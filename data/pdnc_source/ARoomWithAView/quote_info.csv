I can't explain her any other way. Can you? Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer; how she gave you no peace; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable. The sight of us haunted her--or she couldn't have described us as she did to her friend. There are details--it burnt. I read the book afterwards. She is not frozen, Lucy, she is not withered up all through. She tore us apart twice, but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy. We can never make friends with her or thank her. But I do believe that, far down in her heart, far below all speech and behaviour, she is glad.","[373389, 374302]",George Emerson,['Lucy'],Anaphoric,He whispered,"['your cousin', 'we', 'she', 'her', 'we', 'she', 'us', 'she', 'her', 'you', 'she', 'you', 'she', 'you', 'she', 'us', 'her', 'she', 'us', 'she', 'her friend', 'She', 'Lucy', 'she', 'She', 'us', 'she', 'us', 'We', 'her', 'her', 'her', 'she']","[[373450, 373461], [373512, 373514], [373520, 373523], [373543, 373546], [373558, 373560], [373613, 373616], [373624, 373626], [373651, 373654], [373678, 373681], [373701, 373704], [373715, 373718], [373736, 373739], [373760, 373763], [373769, 373772], [373805, 373808], [373860, 373862], [373871, 373874], [373879, 373882], [373907, 373909], [373913, 373916], [373924, 373934], [373993, 373996], [374012, 374016], [374018, 374021], [374054, 374057], [374063, 374065], [374111, 374114], [374149, 374151], [374159, 374161], [374190, 374193], [374203, 374206], [374243, 374246], [374290, 374293]]","[['Miss Bartlett'], ['George Emerson', 'Lucy'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['George Emerson', 'Lucy'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['George Emerson', 'Lucy'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['Lucy'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['Lucy'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['Lucy'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['George Emerson', 'Lucy'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['George Emerson', 'Lucy'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['Miss Lavish'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['Lucy'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['George Emerson', 'Lucy'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['Lucy', 'George Emerson'], ['George Emerson', 'Lucy'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['Miss Bartlett'], ['Miss Bartlett']]",X,1632,minor,ARoomWithAView,2163,2163,20,20,2,373389,374302
