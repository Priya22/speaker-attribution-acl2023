Q74-3,"When first I became one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable disguises. I dressed up as a bishop. I read up all about bishops in our anarchist pamphlets, in _Superstition the Vampire_ and _Priests of Prey_. I certainly understood from them that bishops are strange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind. I was misinformed. When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters in a drawing-room I cried out in a voice of thunder,  Down! down! presumptuous human reason!' they found out in some way that I was not a bishop at all. I was nabbed at once. Then I made up as a millionaire; but I defended Capital with so much intelligence that a fool could see that I was quite poor. Then I tried being a major. Now I am a humanitarian myself, but I have, I hope, enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who, like Nietzsche, admire violence the proud, mad war of Nature and all that, you know. I threw myself into the major. I drew my sword and waved it constantly. I called out  Blood!' abstractedly, like a man calling for wine. I often said,  Let the weak perish; it is the Law.' Well, well, it seems majors don't do this. I was nabbed again.

Q110-0,"our meeting tonight is important, though it need not be long. This branch has always had the honour of electing Thursdays for the Central European Council. We have elected many and splendid Thursdays. We all lament the sad decease of the heroic worker who occupied the post until last week. As you know, his services to the cause were considerable. He organised the great dynamite coup of Brighton which, under happier circumstances, ought to have killed everybody on the pier. As you also know, his death was as self-denying as his life, for he died through his faith in a hygienic mixture of chalk and water as a substitute for milk, which beverage he regarded as barbaric, and as involving cruelty to the cow. Cruelty, or anything approaching to cruelty, revolted him always. But it is not to acclaim his virtues that we are met, but for a harder task. It is difficult properly to praise his qualities, but it is more difficult to replace them. Upon you, comrades, it devolves this evening to choose out of the company present the man who shall be Thursday. If any comrade suggests a name I will put it to the vote. If no comrade suggests a name, I can only tell myself that that dear dynamiter, who is gone from us, has carried into the unknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his innocence.","[42564, 43872]",Comrade Buttons,"['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'A Large Old Man', 'Mr. Lucian Gregory', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'Gabriel Syme']",Anaphoric,he began,"['our', 'We', 'We', 'you', 'you', 'we', 'you', 'comrades', 'us']","[[42564, 42567], [42720, 42722], [42765, 42767], [42858, 42861], [43045, 43048], [43385, 43387], [43517, 43520], [43522, 43530], [43780, 43782]]","[['A Large Old Man', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gabriel Syme', 'Gregory'], ['A Large Old Man', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gabriel Syme', 'Gregory'], ['A Large Old Man', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gabriel Syme', 'Gregory'], ['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gregory', 'Gabriel Syme', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'A Large Old Man'], ['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gregory', 'Gabriel Syme', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'A Large Old Man'], ['A Large Old Man', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gabriel Syme', 'Gregory'], ['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gregory', 'Gabriel Syme', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'A Large Old Man'], ['A Large Old Man', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gabriel Syme', 'Gregory'], ['A Large Old Man', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gabriel Syme', 'Gregory']]",X,110,minor,TheManWhoWasThursday,179,179,3,3,6,42564,43872

Q114-1,"it is not necessary for me to tell you what is my policy, for it is your policy also. Our belief has been slandered, it has been disfigured, it has been utterly confused and concealed, but it has never been altered. Those who talk about anarchism and its dangers go everywhere and anywhere to get their information, except to us, except to the fountain head. They learn about anarchists from sixpenny novels; they learn about anarchists from tradesmen's newspapers; they learn about anarchists from _Ally Sloper's Half-Holiday_ and the _Sporting Times_. They never learn about anarchists from anarchists. We have no chance of denying the mountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from one end of Europe to another. The man who has always heard that we are walking plagues has never heard our reply. I know that he will not hear it tonight, though my passion were to rend the roof. For it is deep, deep under the earth that the persecuted are permitted to assemble, as the Christians assembled in the Catacombs. But if, by some incredible accident, there were here tonight a man who all his life had thus immensely misunderstood us, I would put this question to him:  When those Christians met in those Catacombs, what sort of moral reputation had they in the streets above? What tales were told of their atrocities by one educated Roman to another? Suppose' (I would say to him),  suppose that we are only repeating that still mysterious paradox of history. Suppose we seem as shocking as the Christians because we are really as harmless as the Christians. Suppose we seem as mad as the Christians because we are really as meek.","[45338, 46977]",Mr. Lucian Gregory,"['Comrade Buttons', 'The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'A Large Old Man', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'Gabriel Syme']",Explicit,began Gregory,"['you', 'your', 'Our', 'us', 'We', 'we', 'us', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we', 'we']","[[45373, 45376], [45406, 45410], [45424, 45427], [45664, 45666], [45943, 45945], [46098, 46100], [46477, 46479], [46743, 46745], [46815, 46817], [46861, 46863], [46914, 46916], [46955, 46957]]","[['A Large Old Man', 'Buttons', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard'], ['A Large Old Man', 'Buttons', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard'], ['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gregory', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'Buttons', 'A Large Old Man'], ['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gregory', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'Buttons', 'A Large Old Man'], ['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gregory', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'Buttons', 'A Large Old Man'], ['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gregory', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'Buttons', 'A Large Old Man'], ['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gregory', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'Buttons', 'A Large Old Man'], ['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gregory', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'Buttons', 'A Large Old Man'], ['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gregory', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'Buttons', 'A Large Old Man'], ['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gregory', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'Buttons', 'A Large Old Man'], ['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gregory', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'Buttons', 'A Large Old Man'], ['The Long, Lean Man With The American Beard', 'Gregory', 'Comrade Witherspoon', 'Buttons', 'A Large Old Man']]",X,114,major,TheManWhoWasThursday,186,186,3,3,13,45338,46977

I tell you I am sometimes sick of my trade when I see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate. But this new movement of ours is a very different affair. We deny the snobbish English assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals. We remember the Roman Emperors. We remember the great poisoning princes of the Renaissance. We say that the dangerous criminal is the educated criminal. We say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher. Compared to him, burglars and bigamists are essentially moral men; my heart goes out to them. They accept the essential ideal of man; they merely seek it wrongly. Thieves respect property. They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it. But philosophers dislike property as property; they wish to destroy the very idea of personal possession. Bigamists respect marriage, or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy. But philosophers despise marriage as marriage. Murderers respect human life; they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives.

Q317-1,"I am by profession an actor, and my name is Wilks. When I was on the stage I mixed with all sorts of Bohemian and blackguard company. Sometimes I touched the edge of the turf, sometimes the riff-raff of the arts, and occasionally the political refugee. In some den of exiled dreamers I was introduced to the great German Nihilist philosopher, Professor de Worms. I did not gather much about him beyond his appearance, which was very disgusting, and which I studied carefully. I understood that he had proved that the destructive principle in the universe was God; hence he insisted on the need for a furious and incessant energy, rending all things in pieces. Energy, he said, was the All. He was lame, shortsighted, and partially paralytic. When I met him I was in a frivolous mood, and I disliked him so much that I resolved to imitate him. If I had been a draughtsman I would have drawn a caricature. I was only an actor, I could only act a caricature. I made myself up into what was meant for a wild exaggeration of the old Professor's dirty old self. When I went into the room full of his supporters I expected to be received with a roar of laughter, or (if they were too far gone) with a roar of indignation at the insult. I cannot describe the surprise I felt when my entrance was received with a respectful silence, followed (when I had first opened my lips) with a murmur of admiration. The curse of the perfect artist had fallen upon me. I had been too subtle, I had been too true. They thought I really was the great Nihilist Professor. I was a healthy-minded young man at the time, and I confess that it was a blow. Before I could fully recover, however, two or three of these admirers ran up to me radiating indignation, and told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next room. I inquired its nature. It seemed that an impertinent fellow had dressed himself up as a preposterous parody of myself. I had drunk more champagne than was good for me, and in a flash of folly I decided to see the situation through. Consequently it was to meet the glare of the company and my own lifted eyebrows and freezing eyes that the real Professor came into the room.","[147841, 150020]",Professor De Worms,['Gabriel Syme'],Anaphoric,replied the eminent foreign philosopher,[],[],[],X,317,major,TheManWhoWasThursday,532,532,8,8,16,147841,150020

But there must have been something in me that answered to the nerves in all these anarchic men. For when I first saw Sunday he expressed to me, not your airy vitality, but something both gross and sad in the Nature of Things. I found him smoking in a twilight room, a room with brown blind down, infinitely more depressing than the genial darkness in which our master lives. He sat there on a bench, a huge heap of a man, dark and out of shape. He listened to all my words without speaking or even stirring. I poured out my most passionate appeals, and asked my most eloquent questions. Then, after a long silence, the Thing began to shake, and I thought it was shaken by some secret malady. It shook like a loathsome and living jelly. It reminded me of everything I had ever read about the base bodies that are the origin of life the deep sea lumps and protoplasm. It seemed like the final form of matter, the most shapeless and the most shameful. I could only tell myself, from its shudderings, that it was something at least that such a monster could be miserable. And then it broke upon me that the bestial mountain was shaking with a lonely laughter, and the laughter was at me. Do you ask me to forgive him that? It is no small thing to be laughed at by something at once lower and stronger than oneself.","[285132, 286786]",The Secretary,"['Professor De Worms', 'Inspector Ratcliffe', 'Gogol', 'Dr. Bull', 'Gabriel Syme']",Explicit,the Secretary said,"['You', 'Sunday', 'you', 'us', 'Sunday', 'he', 'your', 'him', 'He', 'He', 'the Thing', 'you', 'him']","[[285132, 285135], [285148, 285154], [285185, 285188], [285333, 285335], [285593, 285599], [285600, 285602], [285624, 285628], [285710, 285713], [285851, 285853], [285921, 285923], [286091, 286100], [286663, 286666], [286685, 286688]]","[['Dr. Bull'], ['The President'], ['Dr. Bull'], ['Inspector Ratcliffe', 'Gogol', 'The Secretary', 'Dr. Bull', 'Gabriel Syme'], ['The President'], ['The President'], ['Dr. Bull'], ['The President'], ['The President'], ['The President'], ['The President'], ['Dr. Bull'], ['The President']]",X,728,minor,TheManWhoWasThursday,1146,1146,14,14,24,285132,286786

He received me in an ordinary office, in a grey check coat, in broad daylight. He talked to me in an ordinary way. But I'll tell you what is a trifle creepy about Sunday. His room is neat, his clothes are neat, everything seems in order; but he's absent-minded. Sometimes his great bright eyes go quite blind. For hours he forgets that you are there. Now absent-mindedness is just a bit too awful in a bad man. We think of a wicked man as vigilant. We can't think of a wicked man who is honestly and sincerely dreamy, because we daren't think of a wicked man alone with himself. An absentminded man means a good-natured man. It means a man who, if he happens to see you, will apologise. But how will you bear an absentminded man who, if he happens to see you, will kill you? That is what tries the nerves, abstraction combined with cruelty. Men have felt it sometimes when they went through wild forests, and felt that the animals there were at once innocent and pitiless.
