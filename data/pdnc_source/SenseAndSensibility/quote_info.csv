Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing. My mother was quite sick of it. Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at my mother s disposal, without any restriction whatever.

Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want for more than that? They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all.

To satisfy me, those characters must be united. I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own.

I always preferred the church, as I still do. But that was not smart enough for my family. They recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart for me. The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family approved. As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it and, at length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing.

Q673-0,"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well in mind as person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me incapable of having ever felt. Hers, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she was lost to me for ever. She was married married against her inclination to my brother. Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered. And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian. My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her. I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at last the misery of her situation, for she experienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though she had promised me that nothing but how blindly I relate! I have never told you how this was brought on. We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin s maid betrayed us. I was banished to the house of a relation far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement, till my father s point was gained. I had depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now to lament it. This however was not the case. My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon s, was but too natural. She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should fall?

I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin. Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person. He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief. At last, however, and after I had been six months in England, I _did_ find her. Regard for a former servant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and there, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my unfortunate sister. So altered so faded worn down by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl, on whom I had once doted.

Q675-1,"by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation. Their fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the other be. But to what does all this lead? I seem to have been distressing you for nothing. Ah! Miss Dashwood a subject such as this untouched for fourteen years it is dangerous to handle it at all! I _will_ be more collected more concise. She left to my care her only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was then about three years old. She loved the child, and had always kept it with her. It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her education myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school. I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the possession of the family property,) she visited me at Delaford. I called her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her. It is now three years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,) that I removed her from school, to place her under the care of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation. But last February, almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared. I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her father there for his health. I knew him to be a very good sort of man, and I thought well of his daughter better than she deserved, for, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she certainly knew all. He, her father, a well-meaning, but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no information; for he had been generally confined to the house, while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself, of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business. In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone; all the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture.

It was forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly, which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body, and which I believe gave offence to some. Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable; but _had_ he known it, what would it have availed?

Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt for all your sakes. When I came to you last week and found you alone, I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when it _was_ known. My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but now you will comprehend it. To suffer you all to be so deceived; to see your sister but what could I do? I had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes I thought your sister s influence might yet reclaim him. But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what were his designs on her. Whatever they may have been, however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless _will_ turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which must attend her through life. Surely this comparison must have its use with her. She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing. They proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace. On the contrary, every friend must be made still more her friend by them. Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen every attachment. Use your own discretion, however, in communicating to her what I have told you. You must know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and from my heart believed it might be of service, might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others.","[360231, 362198]",Colonel Brandon,['Elinor'],Implicit,,"['His', 'you', 'your sister', 'him', 'she', 'him', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you all', 'your sister', 'your sister s', 'him', 'his', 'her', 'they', 'she', 'her', 'she', 'her', 'him', 'her', 'her', 'her', 'She', 'her', 'her', 'her', 'your', 'her', 'you', 'You', 'her', 'you']","[[360231, 360234], [360259, 360262], [360399, 360410], [360422, 360425], [360461, 360464], [360478, 360481], [360519, 360523], [360546, 360549], [360570, 360573], [360709, 360712], [360727, 360730], [360761, 360768], [360795, 360806], [360895, 360908], [360937, 360940], [361005, 361008], [361020, 361023], [361034, 361038], [361063, 361066], [361135, 361138], [361159, 361162], [361290, 361293], [361328, 361331], [361362, 361365], [361433, 361436], [361497, 361500], [361502, 361505], [361516, 361519], [361664, 361667], [361729, 361732], [361791, 361795], [361841, 361844], [361862, 361865], [361867, 361870], [362000, 362003], [362057, 362060]]","[['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Elinor'], ['Marianne'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Marianne'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor', 'Mrs. Dashwood', 'Margaret', 'Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Marianne'], ['Mr. Willoughby', 'Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Elinor'], ['Marianne'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Marianne'], ['Elinor']]",X,679,minor,SenseAndSensibility,1071,1071,31,31,2,360231,362198

Q794-0," So then it all came out; and the long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy! There s for you, my dear! And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter, except Nancy! Could you have believed such a thing possible? There is no great wonder in their liking one another; but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody suspect it! _That_ is strange! I never happened to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so this was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter: till this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out.","[443141, 444131]",Mrs. Jennings,['Elinor'],Implicit,,"['Mr. Edward Ferrars', 'you', 'Mr. Edward Ferrars', 'my cousin Lucy', 'you', 'my dear', 'Nancy', 'you', 'their', 'them', 'them', 'Mrs. Ferrars', 'she', 'your brother', 'sister', 'Nancy', 'you']","[[443247, 443265], [443306, 443309], [443401, 443419], [443474, 443488], [443502, 443505], [443507, 443514], [443576, 443581], [443589, 443592], [443658, 443663], [443738, 443742], [443810, 443814], [443930, 443942], [443956, 443959], [443964, 443976], [443980, 443986], [444048, 444053], [444060, 444063]]","[['Edward Ferrars'], ['Elinor'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Anne Steele'], ['Elinor'], ['Edward Ferrars', 'Lucy Steele'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['John Dashwood'], ['Fanny'], ['Anne Steele'], ['Elinor']]",X,794,major,SenseAndSensibility,1309,1309,37,37,15,443141,444131

Q796-0,"and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come for she had just been saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord s daughter or other, I forget who. So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride. She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as reached your brother s ears, as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on. Poor soul! I pity _her_. And I must say, I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not know what to do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon _his_ knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes. _Then_ she fell into hysterics again, and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar. The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says, she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad. I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her. Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it! To have his love used so scornfully! for they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may. I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest passion! and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same. He and I had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house, for your sister was sure _she_ would be in hysterics too; and so she may, for what I care. I have no pity for either of them. I have no notion of people s making such a to-do about money and greatness. There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours or a little bigger with two maids, and two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly.""

It was told me, it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph.

I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection. Nothing has proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.  I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages. And all this has been going on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness. If you can think me capable of ever feeling, surely you may suppose that I have suffered _now_. The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter, the consolation that I have been willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and painful exertion; they did not spring up of themselves; they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.

Q836-0,"Oh, did not you? But it _was_ said, I know, very well, and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother s Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him. Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that. However this morning he came just as we came home from church; and then it all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by what passed, that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house, he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better of it. And after thinking it all over and over again, he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they to live upon that? He could not bear to think of her doing no better, and so he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the matter directly, and leave him shift for himself. I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be. And it was entirely for _her_ sake, and upon _her_ account, that he said a word about being off, and not upon his own. I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it. But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and love, you know, and all that Oh, la! one can t repeat such kind of things you know) she told him directly, she had not the least mind in the world to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all, you know, or something of the kind. So then he was monstrous happy, and talked on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he should take orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he got a living. And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons.","[470716, 474035]",Anne Steele,['Elinor'],Implicit,,"['you', 'Mr. Ferrars', 'Lucy Steele', 'Mr. Ferrars', 'Edward', 'Lucy', 'we', 'your brother ', 'we', 'him', 'him', 'Lucy', 'him', 'her', 'he', 'we', 'he', 'his mother', 'them', 'he', 'them', 'he', 'Lucy', 'Lucy', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'his mother', 'he', 'his', ' he', 'he', 'him', 'he', 'her', 'her', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'he', 'He', 'her', 'he', 'she', 'him', 'him', 'her', 'her', 'he', 'his', 'he', 'her', 'Lucy', 'she', 'him', 'you', 'you', 'she', 'him', 'she', 'she', 'him', 'he', 'she', 'you', 'he', 'they', 'they', 'he', 'they', 'he', 'her', 'us', 'them', 'Lucy', 'she', 'she', 'Edward']","[[470728, 470731], [470867, 470878], [470964, 470975], [471134, 471145], [471169, 471175], [471278, 471282], [471312, 471314], [471330, 471343], [471360, 471362], [471378, 471381], [471458, 471461], [471468, 471472], [471493, 471496], [471507, 471510], [471559, 471561], [471575, 471577], [471631, 471633], [471702, 471712], [471724, 471728], [471738, 471740], [471761, 471765], [471775, 471777], [471795, 471799], [471816, 471820], [471827, 471829], [471844, 471846], [471899, 471901], [471921, 471931], [471941, 471943], [471957, 471960], [472022, 472025], [472161, 472163], [472183, 472186], [472198, 472200], [472273, 472276], [472322, 472325], [472336, 472338], [472414, 472416], [472443, 472445], [472465, 472467], [472536, 472538], [472566, 472569], [472594, 472596], [472608, 472611], [472687, 472690], [472718, 472721], [472791, 472794], [472812, 472815], [472831, 472833], [472876, 472879], [472905, 472907], [472949, 472952], [473029, 473033], [473081, 473084], [473090, 473093], [473144, 473147], [473212, 473215], [473222, 473225], [473231, 473234], [473245, 473248], [473300, 473303], [473320, 473323], [473362, 473364], [473377, 473380], [473417, 473420], [473461, 473463], [473520, 473524], [473540, 473544], [473552, 473554], [473588, 473592], [473622, 473624], [473751, 473754], [473784, 473786], [473860, 473864], [473873, 473877], [473881, 473884], [473907, 473910], [473933, 473939]]","[['Elinor'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Anne Steele', 'Lucy Steele'], ['John Dashwood'], ['Anne Steele', 'Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Anne Steele', 'Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Fanny', 'John Dashwood', 'Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Fanny', 'John Dashwood', 'Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Elinor'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars', 'Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars', 'Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Edward Ferrars', 'Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Anne Steele', 'Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars', 'Lucy Steele'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Edward Ferrars']]",X,836,minor,SenseAndSensibility,1378,1378,38,38,0,470716,474035

Every year since my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be thought of; and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty, which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much, I was acting in this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a thought of returning it. But one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated, because I did not _then_ know what it was to love. But have I ever known it? Well may it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to avarice? or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers? But I have done it.

Yes, I found myself, by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless. Even _then_, however, when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I allowed myself most improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it, from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed. I will not reason here nor will I stop for _you_ to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound. The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever. At last, however, my resolution was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone, to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display.

Q964-0,"She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be guessed. The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her ignorance of the world every thing was against me. The matter itself I could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She was previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention, the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my present visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure I might have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That could not be and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house. The night following this affair I was to go the next morning was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The struggle was great but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her attachment to me it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased. I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do. A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave Devonshire; I was engaged to dine with you on that very day; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement.

I say awakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in some measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach, overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then,  I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married.  But this note made me know myself better. I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world, and that I was using her infamously. But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me. To retreat was impossible. All that I had to do, was to avoid you both. I sent no answer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street; but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all safely out of the house one morning, and left my name.","[568951, 570371]",Mr. Willoughby,['Elinor'],Implicit,,"['Marianne', 'her', 'we', 'she', 'her', 'her', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'you both', 'Marianne', 'you all']","[[568951, 568959], [569011, 569014], [569072, 569074], [569095, 569098], [569118, 569121], [569394, 569397], [569720, 569723], [569796, 569799], [569884, 569887], [570026, 570034], [570056, 570064], [570309, 570316]]","[['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne', 'Mr. Willoughby'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Elinor'], ['Marianne'], ['Elinor']]",X,974,major,SenseAndSensibility,1623,1623,44,44,12,568951,570371

Lodging as I did in Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us so long. I avoided the Middletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common. Not aware of their being in town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his coming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings s. He asked me to a party, a dance at his house in the evening. Had he _not_ told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should have felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him. The next morning brought another short note from Marianne still affectionate, open, artless, confiding everything that could make _my_ conduct most hateful. I could not answer it. I tried but could not frame a sentence. But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day. If you _can_ pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was _then_. With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman! Those three or four weeks were worse than all.

As bluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &c. I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John. His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted, he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy. What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying, and dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me in her latest moments for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed? _One_ person I was sure would represent me as capable of anything What I felt was dreadful!

Q1026-0,"They have borne more than our conduct. Do not, my dearest Elinor, let your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. My illness has made me think. It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly able to reflect. I considered the past: I saw in my own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of kindness to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave. My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong. Had I died, it would have been self-destruction. I did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery, wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once. Had I died, in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my friend, my sister! You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart! How should I have lived in _your_ remembrance! My mother too! How could you have consoled her! I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing indulged. Every body seemed injured by me. The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful contempt. To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very attention. To John, to Fanny, yes, even to them, little as they deserve, I had given less than their due. But you, you above all, above my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me? not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself. Your example was before me; but to what avail? Was I more considerate of you and your comfort? Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone? No; not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only _that_ heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake.","[604959, 607738]",Marianne,['Elinor'],Implicit,,"['our', 'my dearest Elinor', 'your', 'your', 'him', 'you all', 'you', 'my nurse', 'my friend', 'my sister', 'You', 'your', 'My mother', 'you', 'her', 'Mrs. Jennings', 'the Middletons', 'the Palmers', 'the Steeles', 'their', 'their', 'John', 'Fanny', 'them', 'they', 'their', 'you', 'you', 'my mother', 'your', 'you', 'Your', 'you', 'your', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'you', 'you']","[[604985, 604988], [605006, 605023], [605029, 605033], [605062, 605066], [605355, 605358], [606007, 606014], [606096, 606099], [606101, 606109], [606111, 606120], [606122, 606131], [606133, 606136], [606272, 606276], [606291, 606300], [606316, 606319], [606334, 606337], [606547, 606560], [606604, 606618], [606623, 606634], [606636, 606647], [606746, 606751], [606786, 606791], [606811, 606815], [606820, 606825], [606840, 606844], [606856, 606860], [606892, 606897], [606907, 606910], [606912, 606915], [606933, 606942], [606988, 606992], [607090, 607093], [607105, 607109], [607178, 607181], [607214, 607218], [607242, 607246], [607349, 607352], [607421, 607424], [607465, 607468], [607660, 607663]]","[['Elinor', 'Marianne'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Mrs. Dashwood'], ['Elinor'], ['Mrs. Dashwood'], ['Mrs. Jennings'], ['Lady Middleton', 'John Middleton'], ['Charlotte', 'Mr. Palmer'], ['Anne Steele', 'Lucy Steele'], ['Charlotte', 'Mr. Palmer', 'Anne Steele', 'Lady Middleton', 'Lucy Steele', 'John Middleton'], ['Charlotte', 'Mr. Palmer', 'Anne Steele', 'Lady Middleton', 'Lucy Steele', 'John Middleton'], ['John Dashwood'], ['Fanny'], ['Fanny', 'John Dashwood'], ['Fanny', 'John Dashwood'], ['Fanny', 'John Dashwood'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Mrs. Dashwood'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor'], ['Elinor']]",X,1026,major,SenseAndSensibility,1711,1711,46,46,11,604959,607738

His demands and your inexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought on distresses which would not be the _less_ grievous to you, from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before. _Your_ sense of honour and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage? Beyond _that_, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge _his_ enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart, and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties?","[613612, 615110]",Elinor,"['Marianne', 'Mrs. Dashwood']",Explicit,said Elinor,"['you', 'your', 'you', 'you', 'his', 'you', 'you', 'His', 'his', 'him', 'His', 'you', 'Your', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'your', 'you', 'your', 'you', 'his', 'you', 'your', 'his', 'him', 'him']","[[613694, 613697], [613813, 613817], [613846, 613849], [613905, 613908], [613962, 613965], [613995, 613998], [614008, 614011], [614040, 614043], [614095, 614098], [614170, 614173], [614175, 614178], [614324, 614327], [614389, 614393], [614438, 614441], [614465, 614469], [614529, 614532], [614568, 614572], [614602, 614606], [614620, 614623], [614782, 614786], [614816, 614819], [614865, 614868], [614974, 614977], [614998, 615002], [615020, 615023], [615040, 615043], [615085, 615088]]","[['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne', 'Mr. Willoughby'], ['Marianne'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Marianne'], ['Marianne'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Mr. Willoughby'], ['Mr. Willoughby']]",X,1035,major,SenseAndSensibility,1727,1727,47,47,4,613612,615110

Q1069-1,"the consequence of ignorance of the world, and want of employment. Had my mother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think, nay, I am sure, it would never have happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I must have done. But instead of having any thing to do, instead of having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen. I had therefore nothing in the world to do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging. She was pretty too at least I thought so _then;_ and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no comparisons, and see no defects. Considering everything, therefore, I hope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly.","[633823, 635588]",Edward Ferrars,['Elinor'],Anaphoric,said he,"['my mother', 'Lucy', 'She']","[[634839, 634848], [635195, 635199], [635251, 635254]]","[['Mrs. Ferrars'], ['Lucy Steele'], ['Lucy Steele']]",X,1069,minor,SenseAndSensibility,1797,1797,49,49,3,633823,635588
