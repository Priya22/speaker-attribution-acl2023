Q16-0,"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds of objection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man.  I have observed it all my life.  A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to, and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other line.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men, striking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top.  'In the name of heaven, who is that old fellow?' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near, (Sir Basil Morley).  'Old fellow!' cried Sir Basil, 'it is Admiral Baldwin.  What do you take his age to be?' 'Sixty,' said I, 'or perhaps sixty-two.' 'Forty,' replied Sir Basil, 'forty, and no more.'  Picture to yourselves my amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin.  I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it is the same with them all:  they are all knocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen.  It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin's age.","[31404, 33227]",Sir Walter Elliot,"['Mr Shepherd', 'Mrs Clay', 'Anne Elliot']",Implicit,,"['Admiral', 'you', 'his', 'Admiral', 'you', 'his', 'Admiral']","[[32275, 32282], [32330, 32333], [32347, 32350], [32667, 32674], [32693, 32696], [32702, 32705], [32872, 32879]]","[['Admiral Baldwin'], ['Mr Shepherd'], ['Admiral Baldwin'], ['Admiral Baldwin'], ['Mr Shepherd'], ['Admiral Baldwin'], ['Admiral Baldwin']]",X,16,minor,Persuasion,63,63,3,3,26,31404,33227

Q164-0,"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions, the sea-air always does good.  There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness, last spring twelve-month.  He declares himself, that coming to Lyme for a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took; and, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.  Now, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea.  I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely, and fix at Lyme.  Do not you, Anne? Do not you agree with me, that it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and Mrs Shirley?  She has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would make it cheerful for her, and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand, in case of his having another seizure.  Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who have been doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out from all the world.  I wish his friends would propose it to him.  I really think they ought.  And, as to procuring a dispensation, there could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.  My only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish. He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous I must say.  Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?  Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience, when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties, which may be just as well performed by another person?

There were many things to be taken into the account.  One hates to be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.

You might, some time or other, be differently affected towards him.  Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character.  He has no feeling for others.  Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin, he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.

Q393-0,"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family, long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas, Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things, and the reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand, that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man.  Having long had as much money as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to.  I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.  He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.  You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady if he found it material.  This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could.  He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.  Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.  He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.

Q483-0,"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now.  To me, she was in the place of a parent.  Do not mistake me, however.  I am not saying that she did not err in her advice.  It was, perhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice.  But I mean, that I was right in submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my conscience.  I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman's portion.","[455293, 456313]",Anne Elliot,['Captain Wentworth'],Anaphoric,she said,"['the friend', 'you', 'she', 'she', 'her', 'her']","[[455526, 455536], [455568, 455571], [455588, 455591], [455673, 455676], [455692, 455695], [455951, 455954]]","[['Lady Russell'], ['Anne Elliot'], ['Lady Russell'], ['Lady Russell'], ['Lady Russell'], ['Lady Russell']]",X,483,major,Persuasion,1017,1017,23,23,1,455293,456313

Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared. It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.
