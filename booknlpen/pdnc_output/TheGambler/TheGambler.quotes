Both at Paris and on the Rhine , and even in Switzerland there are so many Poles , with their sympathisers , the French , at these tables d h te that one can not get a word in edgeways if one happens only to be a Russian .

1806	2158	1780	1780	his	150	" You must know that , on one occasion , when , for two days , I had felt certain that at any moment I might have to depart for Rome on business , I repaired to the Embassy of the Holy See in Paris , to have my passport visaed . There I encountered a sacristan of about fifty , and a man dry and cold of mien . After listening politely , but with great reserve , to my account of myself , this sacristan asked me to wait a little . I was in a great hurry to depart , but of course I sat down , pulled out a copy of _ L Opinion Nationale _ , and fell to reading an extraordinary piece of invective against Russia which it happened to contain . As I was thus engaged I heard some one enter an adjoining room and ask for Monsignor ; after which I saw the sacristan make a low bow to the visitor , and then another bow as the visitor took his leave . I ventured to remind the good man of my own business also ; whereupon , with an expression of , if anything , increased dryness , he again asked me to wait . Soon a third visitor arrived who , like myself , had come on business ( he was an Austrian of some sort ) ; and as soon as ever he had stated his errand he was conducted upstairs ! This made me very angry . I rose , approached the sacristan , and told him that , since Monsignor was receiving callers , his lordship might just as well finish off my affair as well . Upon this the sacristan shrunk back in astonishment . It simply passed his understanding that any insignificant Russian should dare to compare himself with other visitors of Monsignor s ! In a tone of the utmost effrontery , as though he were delighted to have a chance of insulting me , he looked me up and down , and then said : "
2176	2184	2186	2186	me	0	" But I only cried the louder : "

2296	2380	2293	2293	I	0	" and that these archbishops and cardinals and monsignors , and the rest of them , meant nothing at all to me . In a word , I showed him that I was not going to give way . He looked at me with an air of infinite resentment . Then he snatched up my passport , and departed with it upstairs . A minute later the passport had been visaed ! Here it is now , if you care to see it , "
2394	2396	2397	2398	the General	150	" But "
2401	2419	2421	2422	the Frenchman	180	" What really saved you was the fact that you proclaimed yourself a heretic and a barbarian , "

2437	2591	2397	2398	the General	150	" But is _ that _ how Russian subjects ought to be treated ? Why , when they settle here they dare not utter even a word they are ready even to deny the fact that they are Russians ! At all events , at my hotel in Paris I received far more attention from the company after I had told them about the fracas with the sacristan . A fat Polish nobleman , who had been the most offensive of all who were present at the table d h te , at once went upstairs , while some of the Frenchmen were simply disgusted when I told them that two years ago I had encountered a man at whom , in 1812 , a French hero fired for the mere fun of discharging his musket . That man was then a boy of ten and his family are still residing in Moscow . "

2944	3007	2936	2936	her	47	" Nothing ; except that two pieces of news have reached us from St. Petersburg . In the first place , my grandmother is very ill , and unlikely to last another couple of days . We had this from Timothy Petrovitch himself , and he is a reliable person . Every moment we are expecting to receive news of the end . "

3023	3054	2936	2936	her	47	" Of course all of us , and every minute of the day . For a year - and - a - half now we have been looking for this . "
3055	3060	2936	2936	her	47	" Looking for it ? "
3061	3102	2936	2936	her	47	" Yes , looking for it . I am not her blood relation , you know I am merely the General s step - daughter . Yet I am certain that the old lady has remembered me in her will . "

3127	3145	3193	3193	she	243	" Yes , for she is fond of me . But how come you to think so ? "
3154	3160	3161	3161	I	0	" That Marquis of yours , "
3164	3176	3161	3161	I	0	" is _ he _ also familiar with your family secrets ? "
3177	3188	3190	3190	her	243	" And why are you yourself so interested in them ? "
3200	3221	3193	3193	she	243	" Never mind . If I am not mistaken , the General has succeeded in borrowing money of the Marquis . "
3222	3228	3193	3193	she	243	" It may be so . "
3229	3290	3193	3193	she	243	" Is it likely that the Marquis would have lent the money if he had not known something or other about your grandmother ? Did you notice , too , that three times during luncheon , when speaking of her , he called her La Baboulenka ? [ 1 ] . What loving , friendly behaviour , to be sure ! "
3298	3336	3412	3412	my	0	" Yes , that is true . As soon as ever he learnt that I was likely to inherit something from her he began to pay me his addresses . I thought you ought to know that . "
3337	3360	3412	3412	my	0	" Then he has only just begun his courting ? Why , I thought he had been doing so a long while ! "

3375	3387	3388	3388	She	47	" But where on earth did you pick up this Englishman ? "

3420	3426	3427	3427	I	0	" He is very shy , "

3460	3494	3410	3410	her	47	" And he is ten times richer than the Frenchman . In fact , what does the Frenchman possess ? To me it seems at least doubtful that he possesses anything at all . "
3495	3533	3412	3412	my	0	" Oh , no , there is no doubt about it . He does possess some ch teau or other . Last night the General told me that for certain . _ Now _ are you satisfied ? "
3534	3546	3410	3410	her	47	" Nevertheless , in your place I should marry the Englishman . "
3547	3551	3553	3553	Polina	47	" And why ? "
3555	3594	3647	3647	she	47	" Because , though the Frenchman is the handsomer of the two , he is also the baser ; whereas the Englishman is not only a man of honour , but ten times the wealthier of the pair . "
3595	3613	3615	3615	Polina	47	" Yes ? But then the Frenchman is a marquis , and the cleverer of the two , "
3618	3623	3624	3624	I	0	" Is that so ? "
3627	3632	3647	3647	she	47	" Yes ; absolutely . "
3670	3680	3681	3681	she	47	" It amuses me to see you grow angry , "
3684	3710	3681	3681	she	47	" However , inasmuch as I allow you to indulge in these questions and conjectures , you ought to pay me something for the privilege . "

3733	3755	3729	3729	my	0	" for the reason that I am ready to pay for them , and also care little what becomes of me . "

Some day I may remind you of that saying , in order to see if you will be as good as your word . Yes , you may depend upon it that I shall do so . I hate you because I have allowed you to go to such lengths , and I also hate you and still more because you are so necessary to me . For the time being I want you , so I must keep you . "

3939	4010	4070	4070	she	245	" You _ know _ who she is just Mlle . Blanche . Nothing further has transpired . Probably she will soon be Madame General that is to say , if the rumours that Grandmamma is nearing her end should prove true . Mlle . Blanche , with her mother and her cousin , the Marquis , know very well that , as things now stand , we are ruined . "
4011	4021	4070	4070	she	245	" And is the General at last in love ? "
4022	4066	4070	4070	she	245	" That has nothing to do with it . Listen to me . Take these 700 florins , and go and play roulette with them . Win as much for me as you can , for I am badly in need of money . "

7367	7371	7372	7372	she	47	" Why not ? "
7376	7387	7388	7388	I	0	" Because I wish to play _ for myself _ , "
7397	7404	7388	7388	I	0	" That is my sole reason . "
7405	7424	7425	7425	she	47	" Then are you so certain that your roulette - playing will get us out of our difficulties ? "
7437	7440	7432	7432	I	0	" Yes , "
7445	7465	7432	7432	I	0	" Possibly my certainty about winning may seem to you ridiculous ; yet , pray leave me in peace . "
7532	7541	7542	7542	I	0	" I am not unwilling so to do , "

None the less we Russians often need money ; wherefore , we are glad of , and greatly devoted to , a method of acquisition like roulette whereby , in a couple of hours , one may grow rich without doing any work . This method , I repeat , has a great attraction for us , but since we play in wanton fashion , and without taking any trouble , we almost invariably lose . "

11617	11623	11625	11626	the General	150	" What an extraordinary idea , "
11628	11637	11639	11640	the Frenchman	180	" And what a _ Russian _ idea ! "
11657	11668	11669	11669	I	0	" I would rather live a wandering life in tents , "
11672	11682	11669	11669	I	0	" than bow the knee to a German idol ! "
11683	11690	11692	11693	the General	150	" To _ what _ idol ? "
11699	12573	11669	11669	I	0	" To the German method of heaping up riches . I have not been here very long , but I can tell you that what I have seen and verified makes my Tartar blood boil . Good Lord ! I wish for no virtues of that kind . Yesterday I went for a walk of about ten versts ; and , everywhere I found that things were even as we read of them in good German picture - books that every house has its Vater , who is horribly beneficent and extraordinarily honourable . So honourable is he that it is dreadful to have anything to do with him ; and I can not bear people of that sort . Each such Vater has his family , and in the evenings they read improving books aloud . Over their roof - trees there murmur elms and chestnuts ; the sun has sunk to his rest ; a stork is roosting on the gable ; and all is beautifully poetic and touching . Do not be angry , General . Let me tell you something that is even more touching than that . I can remember how , of an evening , my own father , now dead , used to sit under the lime trees in his little garden , and to read books aloud to myself and my mother . Yes , I know how things ought to be done . Yet every German family is bound to slavery and to submission to its Vater . They work like oxen , and amass wealth like Jews . Suppose the Vater has put by a certain number of g lden which he hands over to his eldest son , in order that the said son may acquire a trade or a small plot of land . Well , one result is to deprive the daughter of a dowry , and so leave her among the unwedded . For the same reason , the parents will have to sell the younger son into bondage or the ranks of the army , in order that he may earn more towards the family capital . Yes , such things ARE done , for I have been making inquiries on the subject . It is all done out of sheer rectitude out of a rectitude which is magnified to the point of the younger son believing that he has been _ rightly _ sold , and that it is simply idyllic for the victim to rejoice when he is made over into pledge . What more have I to tell ? Well , this that matters bear just as hardly upon the eldest son . Perhaps he has his Gretchen to whom his heart is bound ; but he can not marry her , for the reason that he has not yet amassed sufficient g lden . So , the pair wait on in a mood of sincere and virtuous expectation , and smilingly deposit themselves in pawn the while . Gretchen s cheeks grow sunken , and she begins to wither ; until at last , after some twenty years , their substance has multiplied , and sufficient g lden have been honourably and virtuously accumulated . Then the Vater blesses his forty - year - old heir and the thirty - five - year - old Gretchen with the sunken bosom and the scarlet nose ; after which he bursts , into tears , reads the pair a lesson on morality , and dies . In turn the eldest son becomes a virtuous Vater , and the old story begins again . In fifty or sixty years time the grandson of the original Vater will have amassed a considerable sum ; and that sum he will hand over to , his son , and the latter to _ his _ son , and so on for several generations ; until at length there will issue a Baron Rothschild , or a Hoppe and Company , or the devil knows what ! Is it not a beautiful spectacle the spectacle of a century or two of inherited labour , patience , intellect , rectitude , character , perseverance , and calculation , with a stork sitting on the roof above it all ? What is more ; they think there can never be anything better than this ; wherefore , from _ their _ point of view they begin to judge the rest of the world , and to censure all who are at fault that is to say , who are not exactly like themselves . Yes , there you have it in a nutshell . For my own part , I would rather grow fat after the Russian manner , or squander my whole substance at roulette . I have no wish to be Hoppe and Company at the end of five generations . I want the money for _ myself _ , for in no way do I look upon my personality as necessary to , or meet to be given over to , capital . I may be wrong , but there you have it . Those are _ my _ views . "
12574	12591	12593	12594	the General	150	" How far you may be right in what you have said I do not know , "
12597	12622	12593	12594	the General	150	" but I _ do _ know that you are becoming an insufferable _ far eur _ whenever you are given the least chance . "
12785	12808	12778	12778	I	0	" why our Marquis de Griers had ceased to accompany her for strolls , or to speak to her for days together . "
12809	12816	12817	12817	she	47	" Because he is a brute , "
12855	12876	12877	12877	I	0	" Have you noticed , too , that today he is by no means on good terms with the General ? "
12881	12892	12893	12893	she	47	" Yes and I suppose you want to know why , "
12899	12950	12893	12893	she	47	" You are aware , are you not , that the General is mortgaged to the Marquis , with all his property ? Consequently , if the General s mother does not die , the Frenchman will become the absolute possessor of everything which he now holds only in pledge . "
12951	12981	12877	12877	I	0	" Then it is really the case that everything is mortgaged ? I have heard rumours to that effect , but was unaware how far they might be true . "
12982	12994	12893	12893	she	47	" Yes , they _ are _ true . What then ? "
12995	13010	13011	13011	I	0	" Why , it will be a case of Farewell , Mlle . Blanche , "
13014	13068	13011	13011	I	0	" for in such an event she would never become Madame General . Do you know , I believe the old man is so much in love with her that he will shoot himself if she should throw him over . At his age it is a dangerous thing to fall in love . "
13069	13084	13086	13086	Polina	47	" Yes , something , I believe , _ will _ happen to him , "
13089	13099	13100	13100	I	0	" And what a fine thing it all is ! "
13103	13183	13100	13100	I	0	" Could anything be more abominable than the way in which she has agreed to marry for money alone ? Not one of the decencies has been observed ; the whole affair has taken place without the least ceremony . And as for the grandmother , what could be more comical , yet more dastardly , than the sending of telegram after telegram to know if she is dead ? What do you think of it , Polina Alexandrovna ? "
13184	13192	13193	13193	she	47	" Yes , it is very horrible , "
13199	13237	13193	13193	she	47	" Consequently , I am the more surprised that _ you _ should be so cheerful . What are _ you _ so pleased about ? About the fact that you have gone and lost my money ? "
13238	13316	13100	13100	I	0	" What ? The money that you gave me to lose ? I told you I should never win for other people least of all for you . I obeyed you simply because you ordered me to ; but you must not blame me for the result . I warned you that no good would ever come of it . You seem much depressed at having lost your money . Why do you need it so greatly ? "
13317	13328	13193	13193	she	47	" Why do _ you _ ask me these questions ? "
13329	13381	13100	13100	I	0	" Because you promised to explain matters to me . Listen . I am certain that , as soon as ever I begin to play for myself ( and I still have 120 g lden left ) , I shall win . You can then take of me what you require . "
13388	13397	13398	13398	I	0	" You must not be angry with me , "
13401	13451	13398	13398	I	0	" for making such a proposal . I am so conscious of being only a nonentity in your eyes that you need not mind accepting money from me . A gift from me could not possibly offend you . Moreover , it was I who lost your g lden . "
13474	13483	13484	13484	she	451	" My affairs can not possibly interest you , "
13487	13572	13484	13484	she	451	" Still , if you _ do _ wish to know , I am in debt . I borrowed some money , and must pay it back again . I have a curious , senseless idea that I am bound to win at the gaming - tables . Why I think so I can not tell , but I do think so , and with some assurance . Perhaps it is because of that assurance that I now find myself without any other resource . "
13573	13624	13398	13398	I	0	" Or perhaps it is because it is so _ necessary _ for you to win . It is like a drowning man catching at a straw . You yourself will agree that , unless he were drowning he would not mistake a straw for the trunk of a tree . "
13629	13632	13633	13633	she	451	" What ? "
13636	13715	13633	13633	she	451	" Do not you also hope something from it ? Did you not tell me again and again , two weeks ago , that you were certain of winning at roulette if you played here ? And did you not ask me not to consider you a fool for doing so ? Were you joking ? You can not have been , for I remember that you spoke with a gravity which forbade the idea of your jesting . "
13716	13719	13720	13720	I	0	" True , "
13724	13784	13720	13720	I	0	" I always felt certain that I should win . Indeed , what you say makes me ask myself Why have my absurd , senseless losses of today raised a doubt in my mind ? Yet I am _ still _ positive that , so soon as ever I begin to play for myself , I shall infallibly win . "
13785	13793	13398	13398	I	0	" And why are you so certain ? "
13794	13836	13720	13720	I	0	" To tell the truth , I do not know . I only know that I _ must _ win that it is the one resource I have left . Yes , why do I feel so assured on the point ? "
13837	13854	13398	13398	I	0	" Perhaps because one can not help winning if one is fanatically certain of doing so . "
13855	13874	13720	13720	I	0	" Yet I dare wager that you do not think me capable of serious feeling in the matter ? "
13875	13887	13889	13889	Polina	47	" I do not care whether you are so or not , "
13894	13962	13889	13889	Polina	47	" Well , since you ask me , I _ do _ doubt your ability to take anything seriously . You are capable of worrying , but not deeply . You are too ill - regulated and unsettled a person for that . But why do you want money ? Not a single one of the reasons which you have given can be looked upon as serious . "
13963	13968	13969	13969	I	0	" By the way , "
13972	13996	13969	13969	I	0	" you say you want to pay off a debt . It must be a large one . Is it to the Frenchman ? "
13997	14020	13889	13889	Polina	47	" What do you mean by asking all these questions ? You are very clever today . Surely you are not drunk ? "
14021	14060	13969	13969	I	0	" You know that you and I stand on no ceremony , and that sometimes I put to you very plain questions . I repeat that I am your slave and slaves can not be shamed or offended . "
14061	14093	13889	13889	Polina	47	" You talk like a child . It is always possible to comport oneself with dignity . If one has a quarrel it ought to elevate rather than to degrade one . "
14094	14438	13969	13969	I	0	" A maxim straight from the copybook ! Suppose I _ can not _ comport myself with dignity . By that I mean that , though I am a man of self - respect , I am unable to carry off a situation properly . Do you know the reason ? It is because we Russians are too richly and multifariously gifted to be able at once to find the proper mode of expression . It is all a question of mode . Most of us are so bounteously endowed with intellect as to require also a spice of genius to choose the right form of behaviour . And genius is lacking in us for the reason that so little genius at all exists . It belongs only to the French though a few other Europeans have elaborated their forms so well as to be able to figure with extreme dignity , and yet be wholly undignified persons . That is why , with us , the mode is so all - important . The Frenchman may receive an insult a real , a venomous insult : yet , he will not so much as frown . But a tweaking of the nose he can not bear , for the reason that such an act is an infringement of the accepted , of the time - hallowed order of decorum . That is why our good ladies are so fond of Frenchmen the Frenchman s manners , they say , are perfect ! But in my opinion there is no such thing as a Frenchman s manners . The Frenchman is only a bird the _ coq gaulois _ . At the same time , as I am not a woman , I do not properly understand the question . Cocks may be excellent birds . If I am wrong you must stop me . You ought to stop and correct me more often when I am speaking to you , for I am too apt to say everything that is in my head .
14439	14584	13889	13889	Polina	47	" You see , I have lost my manners . I agree that I have none , nor yet any dignity . I will tell you why . I set no store upon such things . Everything in me has undergone a cheek . You know the reason . I have not a single human thought in my head . For a long while I have been ignorant of what is going on in the world here or in Russia . I have been to Dresden , yet am completely in the dark as to what Dresden is like . You know the cause of my obsession . I have no hope now , and am a mere cipher in your eyes ; wherefore , I tell you outright that wherever I go I see only you all the rest is a matter of indifference .
14585	14652	13969	13969	I	0	" Why or how I have come to love you I do not know . It may be that you are not altogether fair to look upon . Do you know , I am ignorant even as to what your face is like . In all probability , too , your heart is not comely , and it is possible that your mind is wholly ignoble . "
14653	14673	14674	14674	she	452	" And because you do not believe in my nobility of soul you think to purchase me with money ? "
14677	14688	14690	14690	my	0	" _ When _ have I thought to do so ? "
14693	14722	13969	13969	I	0	" You are losing the thread of the argument . If you do not wish to purchase me , at all events you wish to purchase my respect . "
14723	14889	14926	14926	she	453	" Not at all . I have told you that I find it difficult to explain myself . You are hard upon me . Do not be angry at my chattering . You know why you ought not to be angry with me that I am simply an imbecile . However , I do not mind if you _ are _ angry . Sitting in my room , I need but to think of you , to imagine to myself the rustle of your dress , and at once I fall almost to biting my hands . Why should you be angry with me ? Because I call myself your slave ? Revel , I pray you , in my slavery revel in it . Do you know that sometimes I could kill you ? not because I do not love you , or am jealous of you , but , because I feel as though I could simply devour you ... You are laughing ! "
14890	14897	14898	14898	she	453	" No , I am not , "
14901	14913	14898	14898	she	453	" But I order you , nevertheless , to be silent . "
14982	14986	14987	14987	she	453	" What rubbish ! "
14993	14999	15000	15000	I	0	" I do not care , "
15003	15228	15000	15000	I	0	" Also , do you know that it is not safe for us to take walks together ? Often I have a feeling that I should like to strike you , to disfigure you , to strangle you . Are you certain that it will never come to that ? You are driving me to frenzy . Am I afraid of a scandal , or of your anger ? Why should I fear your anger ? I love without hope , and know that hereafter I shall love you a thousand times more . If ever I should kill you I should have to kill myself too . But I shall put off doing so as long as possible , for I wish to continue enjoying the unbearable pain which your coldness gives me . Do you know a very strange thing ? It is that , with every day , my love for you increases though that would seem to be almost an impossibility . Why should I not become a fatalist ? Remember how , on the third day that we ascended the Shlangenberg , I was moved to whisper in your ear : Say but the word , and I will leap into the abyss . Had you said it , I should have leapt . Do you not believe me ? "
15229	15234	15235	15235	she	455	" What stupid rubbish ! "
15238	15249	15250	15250	I	0	" I care not whether it be wise or stupid , "
15255	15293	15250	15250	I	0	" I only know that in your presence I must speak , speak , speak . Therefore , I am speaking . I lose all conceit when I am with you , and everything ceases to matter . "
15294	15307	15308	15308	she	455	" Why should I have wanted you to leap from the Shlangenberg ? "
15321	15334	15308	15308	she	455	" _ That _ would have been of no use to me . "
15335	15338	15339	15339	I	0	" Splendid ! "
15342	15437	15339	15339	I	0	" I know well that you must have used the words of no use in order to crush me . _ I _ can see through you . Of no use , did you say ? Why , to give pleasure is _ always _ of use ; and , as for barbarous , unlimited power even if it be only over a fly why , it is a kind of luxury . Man is a despot by nature , and loves to torture . You , in particular , love to do so . "
15570	15581	15582	15582	she	455	" Oh no ! Why so ? I believe you , "
15645	15653	15655	15655	she	455	" Surely you are not a coward ? "
15659	15665	15666	15666	I	0	" I do not know , "
15669	15690	15666	15666	I	0	" Perhaps I am , but I do not know . I have long given up thinking about such things . "
15691	15707	15655	15655	she	455	" If I said to you , Kill that man , would you kill him ? "
15708	15711	15666	15666	I	0	" Whom ? "
15712	15717	15655	15655	she	455	" Whomsoever I wish ? "
15718	15722	15666	15666	I	0	" The Frenchman ? "
15723	15753	15655	15655	she	455	" Do not ask me questions ; return me answers . I repeat , whomsoever I wish ? I desire to see if you were speaking seriously just now . "
15770	15781	15782	15782	I	0	" Do _ you _ , rather , tell me , "
15785	15897	15782	15782	I	0	" what is going on here ? Why do you seem half - afraid of me ? I can see for myself what is wrong . You are the step - daughter of a ruined and insensate man who is smitten with love for this devil of a Blanche . And there is this Frenchman , too , with his mysterious influence over you . Yet , you actually ask me such a question ! If you do not tell me how things stand , I shall have to put in my oar and do something . Are you ashamed to be frank with me ? Are you shy of me ? "
15898	15925	16056	16056	she	458	" I am not going to talk to you on that subject . I have asked you a question , and am waiting for an answer . "
15926	15937	15938	15938	I	0	" Well , then I will kill whomsoever you wish , "
15941	15956	15938	15938	I	0	" But are you _ really _ going to bid me do such deeds ? "
15957	16022	16056	16056	she	458	" Why should you think that I am going to let you off ? I shall bid you do it , or else renounce me . Could you ever do the latter ? No , you know that you couldn t. You would first kill whom I had bidden you , and then kill _ me _ for having dared to send you away ! "
16094	16114	16085	16085	she	458	" Either you kill whom I bid you , or I will have nothing more to do with you . "
16234	16242	16243	16243	she	458	" Do you see that fat Baroness ? "
16246	16310	16243	16243	she	458	" It is the Baroness Burmergelm . She arrived three days ago . Just look at her husband that tall , wizened Prussian there , with the stick in his hand . Do you remember how he stared at us the other day ? Well , go to the Baroness , take off your hat to her , and say something in French . "
16311	16314	16186	16186	me	0	" Why ? "
16315	16382	16243	16243	she	458	" Because you have sworn that you would leap from the Shlangenberg for my sake , and that you would kill any one whom I might bid you kill . Well , instead of such murders and tragedies , I wish only for a good laugh . Go without answering me , and let me see the Baron give you a sound thrashing with his stick . "
16383	16401	16186	16186	me	0	" Then you throw me out a challenge ? you think that I will not do it ? "
16402	16418	16243	16243	she	458	" Yes , I do challenge you . Go , for such is my will . "
16419	16493	16186	16186	me	0	" Then I _ will _ go , however mad be your fancy . Only , look here : shall you not be doing the General a great disservice , as well as , through him , a great disservice to yourself ? It is not about myself I am worrying it is about you and the General . Why , for a mere fancy , should I go and insult a woman ? "
16494	16508	16509	16509	she	466	" Ah ! Then I can see that you are only a trifler , "
16513	16603	16509	16509	she	466	" Your eyes are swimming with blood but only because you have drunk a little too much at luncheon . Do I not know that what I have asked you to do is foolish and wrong , and that the General will be angry about it ? But I want to have a good laugh , all the same . I want that , and nothing else . Why should you insult a woman , indeed ? Well , you will be given a sound thrashing for so doing . "
17323	17328	17330	17330	I	0	" Madame la Baronne , "
17342	17352	17330	17330	I	0	" j ai l honneur d tre votre esclave . "
17422	17425	17432	17433	the Baron	1935	" Hein ! "
17532	17535	17536	17537	the Baron	1935	" Hein ! "
17555	17559	17560	17560	I	0	" Ja wohl ! "
17570	17575	17576	17576	he	1935	" Sind Sie rasend ? "
17622	17630	17632	17632	I	0	" Ja wo - o - ohl ! "
17644	17646	17632	17632	I	0	" ohl "
17660	17664	17632	17632	I	0	" Ja wohl ! "
17675	17677	17632	17632	I	0	" ohl "
17790	17800	17801	17801	I	0	" I have perpetrated the the piece of idiocy , "
17810	17821	17822	17822	she	47	" Have you ? Then you can take the consequences , "
17990	17995	17996	17997	the General	150	" My good sir , "
18000	18015	17996	17997	the General	150	" may I ask you what this is that you have gone and done ? "
18016	18022	18023	18023	I	0	" I should be glad , "
18026	18049	18023	18023	I	0	" if we could come straight to the point . Probably you are referring to my encounter of today with a German ? "
18050	18083	17996	17997	the General	150	" With a German ? Why , the German was the Baron Burmergelm a most important personage ! I hear that you have been rude both to him and to the Baroness ? "
18084	18091	18023	18023	I	0	" No , I have not . "
18092	18106	18108	18109	the General	150	" But I understand that you simply terrified them , my good sir ? "
18111	18117	18118	18118	I	0	" Not in the least , "
18121	18334	18118	18118	I	0	" You must know that when I was in Berlin I frequently used to hear the Berliners repeat , and repellently prolong , a certain phrase namely , Ja wohl ! ; and , happening to meet this couple in the carriage - drive , I found , for some reason or another , that this phrase suddenly recurred to my memory , and exercised a rousing effect upon my spirits . Moreover , on the three previous occasions that I have met the Baroness she has walked towards me as though I were a worm which could easily be crushed with the foot . Not unnaturally , I too possess a measure of self - respect ; wherefore , on _ this _ occasion I took off my hat , and said politely ( yes , I assure you it was said politely ): Madame , j ai l honneur d tre votre esclave . Then the Baron turned round , and said Hein ! ; whereupon I felt moved to ejaculate in answer Ja wohl ! Twice I shouted it at him the first time in an ordinary tone , and the second time with the greatest prolonging of the words of which I was capable . That is all . "
18381	18390	18392	18393	the General	150	" You are only making fun of me ! "
18424	18432	18433	18433	I	0	" Do not think _ that _ , "
18437	18883	18433	18433	I	0	" It was not so at all . I grant you that my behaviour was bad I fully confess that it was so , and make no secret of the fact . I would even go so far as to grant you that my behaviour might well be called stupid and indecent tomfoolery ; but , _ more _ than that it was not . Also , let me tell you that I am very sorry for my conduct . Yet there is one circumstance which , in my eyes , almost absolves me from regret in the matter . Of late that is to say , for the last two or three weeks I have been feeling not at all well . That is to say , I have been in a sick , nervous , irritable , fanciful condition , so that I have periodically lost control over myself . For instance , on more than one occasion I have tried to pick a quarrel even with Monsieur le Marquise here ; and , under the circumstances , he had no choice but to answer me . In short , I have recently been showing signs of ill - health . Whether the Baroness Burmergelm will take this circumstance into consideration when I come to beg her pardon ( for I _ do _ intend to make her amends ) I do not know ; but I doubt if she will , and the less so since , so far as I know , the circumstance is one which , of late , has begun to be abused in the legal world , in that advocates in criminal cases have taken to justifying their clients on the ground that , at the moment of the crime , they ( the clients ) were unconscious of what they were doing that , in short , they were out of health . My client committed the murder that is true ; but he has no recollection of having committed it . And doctors actually support these advocates by affirming that there really is such a malady that there really _ can _ arise temporary delusions which make a man remember nothing of a given deed , or only a half or a quarter of it ! But the Baron and Baroness are members of an older generation , as well as Prussian Junkers and landowners . To them such a process in the medico - judicial world will be unknown , and therefore , they are the more unlikely to accept any such explanation . What is _ your _ opinion about it , General ? "
18884	18889	18890	18890	he	522	" Enough , sir ! "
18897	19053	18890	18890	he	522	" Enough , I say ! Once and for all I must endeavour to rid myself of you and your impertinence . To justify yourself in the eyes of the Baron and Baroness will be impossible . Any intercourse with you , even though it be confined to a begging of their pardons , they would look upon as a degradation . I may tell you that , on learning that you formed part of my household , the Baron approached me in the Casino , and demanded of me additional satisfaction . Do you understand , then , what it is that you have entailed upon me upon _ me _ , my good sir ? You have entailed upon me the fact of my being forced to sue humbly to the Baron , and to give him my word of honour that this very day you shall cease to belong to my establishment ! "
19054	19060	19061	19061	I	0	" Excuse me , General , "
19064	19089	19061	19061	I	0	" but did he make an express point of it that I should cease to belong to your establishment , as you call it ? "
19090	19224	18890	18890	he	522	" No ; I , of my own initiative , thought that I ought to afford him that satisfaction ; and , with it he was satisfied . So we must part , good sir . It is my duty to hand over to you forty g lden , three florins , as per the accompanying statement . Here is the money , and here the account , which you are at liberty to verify . Farewell . From henceforth we are strangers . From you I have never had anything but trouble and unpleasantness . I am about to call the landlord , and explain to him that from tomorrow onwards I shall no longer be responsible for your hotel expenses . Also I have the honour to remain your obedient servant . "
19254	19427	19431	19431	he	524	" The matter can not end here . I regret very much that you should have been put to unpleasantness at the Baron s hands ; but , the fault ( pardon me ) is your own . How came you to answer for me to the Baron ? And what did you mean by saying that I formed part of your household ? I am merely your family tutor not a son of yours , nor yet your ward , nor a person of any kind for whose acts you need be responsible . I am a judicially competent person , a man of twenty - five years of age , a university graduate , a gentleman , and , until I met yourself , a complete stranger to you . Only my boundless respect for your merits restrains me from demanding satisfaction at your hands , as well as a further explanation as to the reasons which have led you to take it upon yourself to answer for my conduct . "
19470	19481	19482	19482	I	0	" Nor do I intend to let the Baron off , "
19497	19613	19482	19482	I	0	" And since you , General , have today been so good as to listen to the Baron s complaints , and to enter into his concerns since you have made yourself a participator in the affair I have the honour to inform you that , tomorrow morning at the latest , I shall , in my own name , demand of the said Baron a formal explanation as to the reasons which have led him to disregard the fact that the matter lies between him and myself alone , and to put a slight upon me by referring it to another person , as though I were unworthy to answer for my own conduct . "
19637	19640	19641	19641	he	150	" What ? "
19644	19746	19641	19641	he	150	" Do you intend to go on with this damned nonsense ? Do you not realise the harm that it is doing me ? I beg of you not to laugh at me , sir not to laugh at me , for we have police authorities here who , out of respect for my rank , and for that of the Baron ... In short , sir , I swear to you that I will have you arrested , and marched out of the place , to prevent any further brawling on your part . Do you understand what I say ? "
19762	19765	19766	19766	I	0	" General , "
19777	19874	19772	19772	he	529	" one can not arrest a man for brawling until he has brawled . I have not so much as begun my explanations to the Baron , and you are altogether ignorant as to the form and time which my intended procedure is likely to assume . I wish but to disabuse the Baron of what is , to me , a shameful supposition namely , that I am under the guardianship of a person who is qualified to exercise control over my free will . It is vain for you to disturb and alarm yourself . "
19875	19895	19896	19896	he	529	" For God s sake , Alexis Ivanovitch , do put an end to this senseless scheme of yours ! "
19920	20010	20013	20013	he	529	" Do you know what is likely to come of it ? Merely further unpleasantness . You will agree with me , I am sure , that at present I ought to move with especial care yes , with very especial care . You can not be fully aware of how I am situated . When we leave this place I shall be ready to receive you back into my household ; but , for the time being I Well , I can not tell you all my reasons . "
20021	20029	20013	20013	he	529	" O Alexis Ivanovitch , Alexis Ivanovitch ! "
20185	20192	20162	20163	the General	150	" move with especial care at present "
21113	21123	21124	21125	De Griers	73	" I have come to see you on business , "
21139	21201	21124	21125	De Griers	73	" nor will I seek to conceal from you the fact that I have come in the capacity of an emissary , of an intermediary , from the General . Having small knowledge of the Russian tongue , I lost most of what was said last night ; but , the General has now explained matters , and I must confess that "
21202	21210	21211	21211	I	0	" See here , Monsieur de Griers , "
21214	21313	21211	21211	I	0	" I understand that you have undertaken to act in this affair as an intermediary . Of course I am only un utchitel , a tutor , and have never claimed to be an intimate of this household , nor to stand on at all familiar terms with it . Consequently , I do not know the whole of its circumstances . Yet pray explain to me this : have you yourself become one of its members , seeing that you are beginning to take such a part in everything , and are now present as an intermediary ? "
21346	21354	21355	21355	he	61	" I am connected with the General , "
21359	21526	21355	21355	he	61	" partly through business affairs , and partly through special circumstances . My principal has sent me merely to ask you to forego your intentions of last evening . What you contemplate is , I have no doubt , very clever ; yet he has charged me to represent to you that you have not the slightest chance of succeeding in your end , since not only will the Baron refuse to receive you , but also he ( the Baron ) has at his disposal every possible means for obviating further unpleasantness from you . Surely you can see that yourself ? What , then , would be the good of going on with it all ? On the other hand , the General promises that at the first favourable opportunity he will receive you back into his household , and , in the meantime , will credit you with your salary with vos appointements . Surely that will suit you , will it not ? "
21604	21608	21610	21611	de Griers	73	" Good heavens ! "
21613	21640	21610	21611	de Griers	73	" Seeing that the General takes such an interest in the matter , is there anything very unnatural in his desiring also to know your plans ? "
22087	22091	22092	22092	I	0	" In short , "
22097	22117	22092	22092	I	0	" my one desire is that the Baron may make it possible for me to adopt the latter course . "
22118	22127	22129	22130	De Griers	73	" Oh fie ! What refinements and subtleties ! "
22132	22189	22129	22130	De Griers	73	" Besides , what have you to express regret for ? Confess , Monsieur , Monsieur pardon me , but I have forgotten your name confess , I say , that all this is merely a plan to annoy the General ? Or perhaps , you have some other and special end in view ? Eh ? "
22190	22217	22092	22092	I	0	" In return you must pardon _ me _ , mon cher Marquis , and tell me what _ you _ have to do with it . "
22218	22221	22129	22130	De Griers	73	" The General "
22222	22267	22092	22092	I	0	" But what of the General ? Last night he said that , for some reason or another , it behoved him to move with especial care at present ; wherefore , he was feeling nervous . But I did not understand the reference . "
22268	22283	22285	22286	De Griers	73	" Yes , there _ do _ exist special reasons for his doing so , "
22297	22311	22285	22286	De Griers	73	" You are acquainted with Mlle . de Cominges , are you not ? "
22312	22320	22092	22092	I	0	" Mlle . Blanche , you mean ? "
22321	22372	22285	22286	De Griers	73	" Yes , Mlle . Blanche de Cominges . Doubtless you know also that the General is in love with this young lady , and may even be about to marry her before he leaves here ? Imagine , therefore , what any scene or scandal would entail upon him ! "
22373	22391	22092	22092	I	0	" I can not see that the marriage scheme need , be affected by scenes or scandals . "
22392	22415	22285	22286	De Griers	73	" Mais le Baron est si irascible un caract re prussien , vous savez ! Enfin il fera une querelle d Allemand . "
22416	22422	22423	22423	I	0	" I do not care , "
22426	22436	22423	22423	I	0	" seeing that I no longer belong to his household "
22452	22492	22441	22441	I	0	" But is it quite settled that Mlle . is to marry the General ? What are they waiting for ? Why should they conceal such a matter at all events from ourselves , the General s own party ? "
22493	22525	22285	22286	De Griers	73	" I can not tell you . The marriage is not yet a settled affair , for they are awaiting news from Russia . The General has business transactions to arrange . "
22526	22538	22441	22441	I	0	" Ah ! Connected , doubtless , with madame his mother ? "
22549	22555	22556	22556	he	73	" To cut things short , "
22559	22619	22556	22556	he	73	" I have complete confidence in your native politeness , as well as in your tact and good sense . I feel sure that you will do what I suggest , even if it is only for the sake of this family which has received you as a kinsman into its bosom and has always loved and respected you . "
22620	22628	22629	22629	I	0	" Be so good as to observe , "
22632	22706	22629	22629	I	0	" that the same family has just _ expelled _ me from its bosom . All that you are saying you are saying but for show ; but , when people have just said to you , Of course we do not wish to turn you out , yet , for the sake of appearance s , you must _ permit _ yourself to be turned out , nothing can matter very much . "
22707	22713	22714	22714	he	589	" Very well , then , "
22725	22863	22714	22714	he	589	" Seeing that my solicitations have had no effect upon you , it is my duty to mention that other measures will be taken . There exist here police , you must remember , and this very day they shall send you packing . Que diable ! To think of a blanc bec like yourself challenging a person like the Baron to a duel ! Do you suppose that you will be _ allowed _ to do such things ? Just try doing them , and see if any one will be afraid of you ! The reason why I have asked you to desist is that I can see that your conduct is causing the General annoyance . Do you believe that the Baron could not tell his lacquey simply to put you out of doors ? "
22864	22874	22875	22875	I	0	" Nevertheless I should not GO out of doors , "
22881	23114	22875	22875	I	0	" You are labouring under a delusion , Monsieur de Griers . The thing will be done in far better trim than you imagine . I was just about to start for Mr. Astley s , to ask him to be my intermediary in other words , my second . He has a strong liking for me , and I do not think that he will refuse . He will go and see the Baron on MY behalf , and the Baron will certainly not decline to receive him . Although I am only a tutor a kind of subaltern , Mr. Astley is known to all men as the nephew of a real English lord , the Lord Piebroch , as well as a lord in his own right . Yes , you may be pretty sure that the Baron will be civil to Mr. Astley , and listen to him . Or , should he decline to do so , Mr. Astley will take the refusal as a personal affront to himself ( for you know how persistent the English are ? ) and thereupon introduce to the Baron a friend of his own ( and he has many friends in a good position ) . That being so , picture to yourself the issue of the affair an affair which will not quite end as you think it will . "
23127	23137	23138	23138	he	180	" Really things may be as this fellow says , "
23142	23155	23138	23138	he	180	" Really he _ might _ be able to engineer another scene . "
23156	23169	23170	23170	he	180	" Once more I beg of you to let the matter drop , "
23181	23244	23246	23246	he	180	" One would think that it actually _ pleased _ you to have scenes ! Indeed , it is a brawl rather than genuine satisfaction that you are seeking . I have said that the affair may prove to be diverting , and even clever , and that possibly you may attain something by it ; yet none the less I tell you "
23261	23293	23246	23246	he	180	" that I have come hither also to hand you these few words from a certain person . Read them , please , for I must take her back an answer . "
23325	23428	23322	23322	I	0	" I hear that you are thinking of going on with this affair . You have lost your temper now , and are beginning to play the fool ! Certain circumstances , however , I may explain to you later . Pray cease from your folly , and put a check upon yourself . For folly it all is . I have need of you , and , moreover , you have promised to obey me . Remember the Shlangenberg . I ask you to be obedient . If necessary , I shall even _ bid _ you be obedient . Your own "
23431	23456	23485	23487	the cursed Frenchman	592	" _ P.S. _ If so be that you still bear a grudge against me for what happened last night , pray forgive me . "
23516	23520	23521	23521	I	0	" Very well , "
23524	23537	23538	23538	I	0	" you can tell Mlle . not to disturb herself . But , "
23542	23586	23538	23538	I	0	" I would also ask you why you have been so long in handing me this note ? Instead of chattering about trifles , you ought to have delivered me the missive at once if you have really come commissioned as you say . "
23587	23643	23521	23521	I	0	" Well , pardon some natural haste on my part , for the situation is so strange . I wished first to gain some personal knowledge of your intentions ; and , moreover , I did not know the contents of the note , and thought that it could be given you at any time . "
23644	23648	23649	23649	I	0	" I understand , "
23652	23689	23649	23649	I	0	" So you were ordered to hand me the note only in the last resort , and if you could not otherwise appease me ? Is it not so ? Speak out , Monsieur de Griers . "
23690	23693	23695	23695	he	593	" Perhaps , "
23748	23762	23763	23763	I	0	" You and I are to have a reckoning later , Master Frenchman , "
23771	23781	23763	23763	I	0	" Yes , we will measure our strength together . "
24069	24078	24079	24079	he	1930	" I was just coming to see you , "
24082	24102	24079	24079	he	1930	" and you appear to be out on a similar errand . So you have parted with your employers ? "
24103	24110	24111	24111	I	0	" How do you know that ? "
24116	24127	24111	24111	I	0	" Is _ every one _ aware of the fact ? "
24128	24158	24079	24079	he	1930	" By no means . Not every one would consider such a fact to be of moment . Indeed , I have never heard any one speak of it . "
24159	24168	24111	24111	I	0	" Then how come you to know it ? "
24169	24198	24079	24079	he	1930	" Because I have had occasion to do so . Whither are you bound ? I like you , and was therefore coming to pay you a visit . "
24199	24210	24211	24211	I	0	" What a splendid fellow you are , Mr. Astley ! "
24225	24267	24211	24211	I	0	" And since I have not yet had my coffee , and you have , in all probability , scarcely tasted yours , let us adjourn to the Casino Caf , where we can sit and smoke and have a talk . "
24317	24326	24328	24328	my	0	" I do not intend to go away , "
24332	24344	24328	24328	my	0	" I intend , on the contrary , to remain here . "
24345	24351	24352	24352	he	54	" That I never doubted , "
24668	24675	24676	24676	I	0	" No , I fear not , "
24679	24694	24657	24665	a strange man in his mode of propounding questions	611	" And concerning this Marquis and Mlle . Polina you know nothing beyond surmise ? "
24712	24724	24726	24726	my	0	" No , I know nothing _ for certain _ about them "
24729	24733	24726	24726	my	0	" No nothing . "
24734	24756	24788	24788	him	54	" Then you have done very wrong to speak of them to me , or even to imagine things about them . "
24757	24764	24765	24765	I	0	" Quite so , quite so , "
24771	24783	24765	24765	I	0	" I admit that . Yet that is not the question . "
24850	24858	24859	24859	I	0	" What do you make of it ? "
24862	24900	24859	24859	I	0	" When I met you I was just coming to ask you your opinion . For myself , I could have killed this Frenchman , and am not sure that I shall not do so even yet . "
24901	24909	24911	24912	Mr. Astley	54	" I feel the same about it , "
24914	25097	24911	24912	Mr. Astley	54	" As for Mlle . Polina well , you yourself know that , if necessity drives , one enters into relation with people whom one simply detests . Even between this couple there may be something which , though unknown to you , depends upon extraneous circumstances . For , my own part , I think that you may reassure yourself or at all events partially . And as for Mlle . Polina s proceedings of two days ago , they were , of course , strange ; not because she can have meant to get rid of you , or to earn for you a thrashing from the Baron s cudgel ( which for some curious reason , he did not use , although he had it ready in his hands ) , but because such proceedings on the part of such well , of such a refined lady as Mlle . Polina are , to say the least of it , unbecoming . But she can not have guessed that you would carry out her absurd wish to the letter ? "
25098	25104	25106	25106	I	0	" Do you know what ? "
25117	25138	25106	25106	I	0	" I believe that you have already heard the story from some one very possibly from Mlle . Polina herself ? "
25148	25155	25156	25156	he	54	" Your eyes look very fiery , "
25166	25208	25156	25156	he	54	" and in them I can read suspicion . Now , you have no right whatever to be suspicious . It is not a right which I can for a moment recognise , and I absolutely refuse to answer your questions . "
25209	25218	25219	25219	I	0	" Enough ! You need say no more , "
25370	25377	25378	25378	I	0	" Very well , very well , "
25389	25432	25378	25378	I	0	" Then I stand confounded , and have no further opinions to offer . But you are a good fellow , and I am glad to know what you think about it all , even though I do not need your advice . "
25442	25726	25439	25439	I	0	" For instance , what reason should you assign for the General taking fright in this way ? Why should my stupid clowning have led the world to elevate it into a serious incident ? Even De Griers has found it necessary to put in his oar ( and he only interferes on the most important occasions ) , and to visit me , and to address to me the most earnest supplications . Yes , _ he _ , De Griers , has actually been playing the suppliant to _ me ! _ And , mark you , although he came to me as early as nine o clock , he had ready - prepared in his hand Mlle . Polina s note . When , I would ask , was that note written ? Mlle . Polina must have been aroused from sleep for the express purpose of writing it . At all events the circumstance shows that she is an absolute slave to the Frenchman , since she actually begs my pardon in the note actually begs my pardon ! Yet what is her personal concern in the matter ? Why is she interested in it at all ? Why , too , is the whole party so afraid of this precious Baron ? And what sort of a business do you call it for the General to be going to marry Mlle . Blanche de Cominges ? He told me last night that , because of the circumstance , he must move with especial care at present . What is your opinion of it all ? Your look convinces me that you know more about it than I do . "
25733	25750	25751	25751	he	54	" Yes , I think I _ do _ know more about it than you do , "
25754	25770	25751	25751	he	54	" The affair centres around this Mlle . Blanche . Of that I feel certain . "
25771	25779	25780	25780	I	0	" And what of Mlle . Blanche ? "
25805	25856	25439	25439	I	0	" Well , my belief is that at the present moment Mlle . Blanche has , in very truth , a special reason for wishing to avoid any trouble with the Baron and the Baroness . It might lead not only to some unpleasantness , but even to a scandal . "
25857	25862	25727	25728	Mr. Astley	54	" Oh , oh ! "
25863	26038	25439	25439	I	0	" Also I may tell you that Mlle . Blanche has been in Roulettenberg before , for she was staying here three seasons ago . I myself was in the place at the time , and in those days Mlle . Blanche was not known as Mlle . de Cominges , nor was her mother , the Widow de Cominges , even in existence . In any case no one ever mentioned the latter . De Griers , too , had not materialised , and I am convinced that not only do the parties stand in no relation to one another , but also they have not long enjoyed one another s acquaintance . Likewise , the _ Marquisate _ de Griers is of recent creation . Of that I have reason to be sure , owing to a certain circumstance . Even the name De Griers itself may be taken to be a new invention , seeing that I have a friend who once met the said Marquis under a different name altogether . "
26039	26049	25727	25728	Mr. Astley	54	" Yet he possesses a good circle of friends ? "
26050	26094	25439	25439	I	0	" Possibly . Mlle . Blanche also may possess that . Yet it is not three years since she received from the local police , at the instance of the Baroness , an invitation to leave the town . And she left it . "
26095	26099	25727	25728	Mr. Astley	54	" But why ? "
26100	26435	25439	25439	I	0	" Well , I must tell you that she first appeared here in company with an Italian a prince of some sort , a man who bore an historic name ( Barberini or something of the kind ) . The fellow was simply a mass of rings and diamonds real diamonds , too and the couple used to drive out in a marvellous carriage . At first Mlle . Blanche played trente et quarante with fair success , but , later , her luck took a marked change for the worse . I distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost an enormous sum . But worse was to ensue , for one fine morning her prince disappeared horses , carriage , and all . Also , the hotel bill which he left unpaid was enormous . Upon this Mlle . Zelma ( the name which she assumed after figuring as Madame Barberini ) was in despair . She shrieked and howled all over the hotel , and even tore her clothes in her frenzy . In the hotel there was staying also a Polish count ( you must know that ALL travelling Poles are counts ! ) , and the spectacle of Mlle . Zelma tearing her clothes and , catlike , scratching her face with her beautiful , scented nails produced upon him a strong impression . So the pair had a talk together , and , by luncheon time , she was consoled . Indeed , that evening the couple entered the Casino arm - in - arm Mlle . Zelma laughing loudly , according to her custom , and showing even more expansiveness in her manners than she had before shown . For instance , she thrust her way into the file of women roulette - players in the exact fashion of those ladies who , to clear a space for themselves at the tables , push their fellow - players roughly aside . Doubtless you have noticed them ? "
26436	26441	25727	25728	Mr. Astley	54	" Yes , certainly . "
26442	26962	25439	25439	I	0	" Well , they are not worth noticing . To the annoyance of the decent public they are allowed to remain here at all events such of them as daily change 4000 franc notes at the tables ( though , as soon as ever these women cease to do so , they receive an invitation to depart ) . However , Mlle . Zelma continued to change notes of this kind , but her play grew more and more unsuccessful , despite the fact that such ladies luck is frequently good , for they have a surprising amount of cash at their disposal . Suddenly , the Count too disappeared , even as the Prince had done , and that same evening Mlle . Zelma was forced to appear in the Casino alone . On this occasion no one offered her a greeting . Two days later she had come to the end of her resources ; whereupon , after staking and losing her last louis d or she chanced to look around her , and saw standing by her side the Baron Burmergelm , who had been eyeing her with fixed disapproval . To his distaste , however , Mlle . paid no attention , but , turning to him with her well - known smile , requested him to stake , on her behalf , ten louis on the red . Later that evening a complaint from the Baroness led the authorities to request Mlle . not to re - enter the Casino . If you feel in any way surprised that I should know these petty and unedifying details , the reason is that I had them from a relative of mine who , later that evening , drove Mlle . Zelma in his carriage from Roulettenberg to Spa . Now , mark you , Mlle . wants to become Madame General , in order that , in future , she may be spared the receipt of such invitations from Casino authorities as she received three years ago . At present she is not playing ; but that is only because , according to the signs , she is lending money to other players . Yes , that is a much more paying game . I even suspect that the unfortunate General is himself in her debt , as well as , perhaps , also De Griers . Or , it may be that the latter has entered into a partnership with her . Consequently you yourself will see that , until the marriage shall have been consummated , Mlle . would scarcely like to have the attention of the Baron and the Baroness drawn to herself . In short , to any one in her position , a scandal would be most detrimental . You form a member of the m nage of these people ; wherefore , any act of yours might cause such a scandal and the more so since daily she appears in public arm in arm with the General or with Mlle . Polina . _ Now _ do you understand ? "
26963	26970	26971	26971	I	0	" No , I do not ! "
26996	27044	26988	26990	a frightened waiter	618	" Tell me , Mr. Astley , why , if you knew this history all along , and , consequently , always knew who this Mlle . Blanche is , you never warned either myself or the General , nor , most of all , Mlle . Polina "
27063	27070	26988	26990	a frightened waiter	618	" How could you do it ? "
27071	27082	27083	27083	he	618	" It would have done no good to warn you , "
27087	27238	27239	27239	he	620	" for the reason that you could have effected nothing . Against what was I to warn you ? As likely as not , the General knows more about Mlle . Blanche even than I do ; yet the unhappy man still walks about with her and Mlle . Polina . Only yesterday I saw this Frenchwoman riding , splendidly mounted , with De Griers , while the General was careering in their wake on a roan horse . He had said , that morning , that his legs were hurting him , yet his riding - seat was easy enough . As he passed I looked at him , and the thought occurred to me that he was a man lost for ever . However , it is no affair of mine , for I have only recently had the happiness to make Mlle . Polina s acquaintance . Also "
27245	27272	26988	26990	a frightened waiter	618	" I have already told you that I do not recognise your right to ask me certain questions , however sincere be my liking for you . "
27273	27276	27277	27277	I	0	" Enough , "
27282	27407	27277	27277	I	0	" To me it is as clear as day that Mlle . Polina knows all about this Mlle . Blanche , but can not bring herself to part with her Frenchman ; wherefore , she consents also to be seen in public with Mlle . Blanche . You may be sure that nothing else would ever have induced her either to walk about with this Frenchwoman or to send me a note not to touch the Baron . Yes , it is _ there _ that the influence lies before which everything in the world must bow ! Yet she herself it was who launched me at the Baron ! The devil take it , but I was left no choice in the matter . "
27408	27477	26988	26990	a frightened waiter	618	" You forget , in the first place , that this Mlle . de Cominges is the General s inamorata , and , in the second place , that Mlle . Polina , the General s step - daughter , has a younger brother and sister who , though they are the General s own children , are completely neglected by this madman , and robbed as well . "
27478	27561	27277	27277	I	0	" Yes , yes ; that is so . For me to go and desert the children now would mean their total abandonment ; whereas , if I remain , I should be able to defend their interests , and , perhaps , to save a moiety of their property . Yes , yes ; that is quite true . And yet , and yet Oh , I can well understand why they are all so interested in the General s mother ! "
27562	27566	27568	27569	Mr. Astley	54	" In whom ? "
27571	27600	27277	27277	I	0	" In the old woman of Moscow who declines to die , yet concerning whom they are for ever expecting telegrams to notify the fact of her death . "
27601	27643	27277	27277	I	0	" Ah , then of course their interests centre around her . It is a question of succession . Let that but be settled , and the General will marry , Mlle . Polina will be set free , and De Griers "
27644	27651	27277	27277	I	0	" Yes , and De Griers ? "
27652	27668	27277	27277	I	0	" Will be repaid his money , which is what he is now waiting for . "
27669	27683	27277	27277	I	0	" What ? You think that he is waiting for _ that ? _ "
27684	27691	27693	27694	Mr. Astley	54	" I know of nothing else , "
27697	27706	27707	27707	I	0	" But , I do , I do ! "
27713	27840	27841	27841	I	0	" He is waiting also for the old woman s will , for the reason that it awards Mlle . Polina a dowry . As soon as ever the money is received , she will throw herself upon the Frenchman s neck . All women are like that . Even the proudest of them become abject slaves where marriage is concerned . What Polina is good for is to fall head over ears in love . That is _ my _ opinion . Look at her especially when she is sitting alone , and plunged in thought . All this was pre - ordained and foretold , and is accursed . Polina could perpetrate any mad act . She she But who called me by name ? "
27845	27872	27841	27841	I	0	" Who is shouting for me ? I heard some one calling in Russian , Alexis Ivanovitch ! It was a woman s voice . Listen ! "
27900	27986	27841	27841	I	0	" Yes , I _ did _ hear a woman s voice calling , but whose I do not know . The someone was calling you in Russian . Ah ! NOW I can see whence the cries come . They come from that lady there the one who is sitting on the settee , the one who has just been escorted to the verandah by a crowd of lacqueys . Behind her see that pile of luggage ! She must have arrived by train . "
27987	28011	27880	27880	my	0	" But why should she be calling _ me ? _ Hear her calling again ! See ! She is beckoning to us ! "
28012	28019	28021	28022	Mr. Astley	54	" Yes , so she is , "
28024	28039	28088	28089	IX For	101	" Alexis Ivanovitch , Alexis Ivanovitch ! Good heavens , what a stupid fellow ! "
28218	28221	28191	28191	she	396	" La Baboulenka "
28394	28414	28415	28415	I	0	" And this is the woman whom they had thought to see in her grave after making her will ! "
28420	28465	28415	28415	I	0	" Yet she will outlive us , and every one else in the hotel . Good Lord ! what is going to become of us now ? What on earth is to happen to the General ? She will turn the place upside down ! "
28466	28471	28472	28474	the old woman	2191	" My good sir , "
28481	28534	28535	28535	she	2191	" what are you standing _ there _ for , with your eyes almost falling out of your head ? Can not you come and say how - do - you - do ? Are you too proud to shake hands ? Or do you not recognise me ? Here , Potapitch ! "
28572	28633	28535	28535	she	2191	" Just think ! Alexis Ivanovitch does not recognise me ! They have buried me for good and all ! Yes , and after sending hosts of telegrams to know if I were dead or not ! Yes , yes , I have heard the whole story . I am very much alive , though , as you may see . "
28634	28641	28642	28642	I	0	" Pardon me , Antonida Vassilievna , "
28654	28685	28642	28642	I	0	" _ I _ have no reason to wish you ill . I am merely rather astonished to see you . Why should I not be so , seeing how unexpected "
28686	28730	28535	28535	she	2191	" _ Why _ should you be astonished ? I just got into my chair , and came . Things are quiet enough in the train , for there is no one there to chatter . Have you been out for a walk ? "
28731	28742	28642	28642	I	0	" Yes . I have just been to the Casino . "
28743	28754	28755	28755	she	648	" Oh ? Well , it is quite nice here , "
28764	28798	28759	28759	she	648	" The place seems comfortable , and all the trees are out . I like it very well . Are your people at home ? Is the General , for instance , indoors ? "
28799	28808	28642	28642	I	0	" Yes ; and probably all of them . "
28809	28862	28759	28759	she	648	" Do they observe the convenances , and keep up appearances ? Such things always give one tone . I have heard that they are keeping a carriage , even as Russian gentlefolks ought to do . When abroad , our Russian people always cut a dash . Is Prascovia here too ? "
28863	28871	28642	28642	I	0	" Yes . Polina Alexandrovna is here . "
28872	28905	28759	28759	she	648	" And the Frenchwoman ? However , I will go and look for them myself . Tell me the nearest way to their rooms . Do _ you _ like being here ? "
28906	28916	28642	28642	I	0	" Yes , I thank you , Antonida Vassilievna . "
28917	28989	28990	28990	she	649	" And you , Potapitch , you go and tell that fool of a landlord to reserve me a suitable suite of rooms . They must be handsomely decorated , and not too high up . Have my luggage taken up to them . But what are you tumbling over yourselves for ? Why are you all tearing about ? What scullions these fellows are ! Who is that with you ? "
28995	29000	29001	29001	I	0	" A Mr. Astley , "
29004	29011	29097	29097	Our	650	" And who is Mr. Astley ? "
29012	29033	28993	28993	myself	0	" A fellow - traveller , and my very good friend , as well as an acquaintance of the General s. "
29034	29076	29097	29097	Our	650	" Oh , an Englishman ? Then that is why he stared at me without even opening his lips . However , I like Englishmen . Now , take me upstairs , direct to their rooms . Where are they lodging ? "
29413	29419	29421	29422	Mr. Astley	54	" She interests me tremendously , "
30037	30051	30052	30053	the Grandmother	396	" Well , here I am and instead of a telegram , too ! "
30063	30072	30052	30053	the Grandmother	396	" What ? You were not expecting me ? "
30073	30092	30096	30098	the unhappy General	716	" Antonida Vassilievna ! O my dearest mother ! But how on earth did you , did you ? "
30124	30134	30135	30135	she	396	" How on earth did I _ what ? _ "
30138	30242	30135	30135	she	396	" Why , I just got into the train and came here . What else is the railway meant for ? But you thought that I had turned up my toes and left my property to the lot of you . Oh , I know _ all _ about the telegrams which you have been dispatching . They must have cost you a pretty sum , I should think , for telegrams are not sent from abroad for nothing . Well , I picked up my heels , and came here . Who is this Frenchman ? Monsieur de Griers , I suppose ? "
30243	30248	30250	30251	De Griers	73	" Oui , madame , "
30253	30277	30250	30251	De Griers	73	" Et , croyez , je suis si enchant ! Votre sant c est un miracle vous voir ici . Une surprise charmante ! "
30278	30304	30305	30305	She	718	" Just so . Charmante ! I happen to know you as a mountebank , and therefore trust you no more than _ this _ . "
30311	30319	30320	30320	she	718	" And who is _ that ? _ "
30360	30367	30350	30350	she	2227	" Who is that woman there ? "
30368	30374	30375	30375	I	0	" Mlle . de Cominges , "
30378	30397	30375	30375	I	0	" And this is her mother , Madame de Cominges . They also are staying in the hotel . "
30398	30404	30406	30408	the old lady	1794	" Is the daughter married ? "
30417	30420	30421	30421	I	0	" No , "
30433	30439	30375	30375	I	0	" Is she good company ? "
30447	30480	30375	30375	I	0	" I mean , is she or is she not a bore ? Can she speak Russian ? When this De Griers was in Moscow he soon learnt to make himself understood . "
30496	30501	30503	30503	Madame	106	" Bonjour , then , "
30509	30514	30516	30516	Mlle	50	" Bonjour , madame , "
30559	30576	30578	30579	the Grandmother	396	" How the woman sticks out her eyes at me ! How she mows and minces ! "
30594	30626	30584	30584	she	396	" I have taken up my abode here , so am going to be your next - door neighbour . Are you glad to hear that , or are you not ? "
30627	30643	30645	30646	the General	150	" My dear mother , believe me when I say that I am sincerely delighted , "
30696	30722	30682	30682	he	150	" We have been so dismayed and upset by the news of your indisposition ! We had received such hopeless telegrams about you ! Then suddenly "
30723	30728	30730	30731	the Grandmother	396	" Fibs , fibs ! "
30733	30749	30751	30752	the General	150	" How on earth , too , did you come to decide upon the journey ? "
30769	30812	30813	30813	he	150	" Surely , at your age , and in your present state of health , the thing is so unexpected that our surprise is at least intelligible . However , I am glad to see you ( as indeed , are we all "
30826	30843	30813	30813	he	150	" and will use my best endeavours to render your stay here as pleasant as possible . "
30844	30924	30813	30813	he	150	" Enough ! All this is empty chatter . You are talking the usual nonsense . I shall know quite well how to spend my time . How did I come to undertake the journey , you ask ? Well , is there anything so very surprising about it ? It was done quite simply . What is every one going into ecstasies about ? How do you do , Prascovia ? What are _ you _ doing here ? "
30925	30935	30937	30937	Polina	47	" And how are _ you _ , Grandmother ? "
30946	30954	30937	30937	Polina	47	" Were you long on the journey ? "
30955	31166	31167	31167	she	732	" The most sensible question that I have yet been asked ! Well , you shall hear for yourself how it all happened . I lay and lay , and was doctored and doctored , until at last I drove the physicians from me , and called in an apothecary from Nicolai who had cured an old woman of a malady similar to my own cured her merely with a little hayseed . Well , he did me a great deal of good , for on the third day I broke into a sweat , and was able to leave my bed . Then my German doctors held another consultation , put on their spectacles , and told me that if I would go abroad , and take a course of the waters , the indisposition would finally pass away . Why should it not ? I thought to myself . So I had got things ready , and on the following day , a Friday , set out for here . I occupied a special compartment in the train , and where ever I had to change I found at the station bearers who were ready to carry me for a few coppers . You have nice quarters here , "
31177	31228	31171	31171	she	732	" But where on earth did you get the money for them , my good sir ? I thought that everything of yours had been mortgaged ? This Frenchman alone must be your creditor for a good deal . Oh , I know all about it , all about it . "
31229	31242	31244	31245	the General	150	" I - I am surprised at you , my dearest mother , "
31250	31282	31244	31245	the General	150	" I - I am greatly surprised . But I do not need any extraneous control of my finances . Moreover , my expenses do not exceed my income , and we "
31283	31308	31171	31171	she	732	" They do not exceed it ? Fie ! Why , you are robbing your children of their last kopeck you , their guardian ! "
31309	31313	31315	31316	the General	150	" After this , "
31322	31335	31315	31316	the General	150	" after what you have just said , I do not know whether "
31336	31371	31171	31171	she	732	" You do not know _ what ? _ By heavens , are you _ never _ going to drop that roulette of yours ? Are you going to whistle all your property away ? "
31387	31421	31315	31316	the General	150	" Roulette , indeed ? _ I _ play roulette ? Really , in view of my position Recollect what you are saying , my dearest mother . You must still be unwell . "
31422	31427	31428	31428	she	737	" Rubbish , rubbish ! "
31431	31515	31517	31517	she	737	" The truth is that you _ can not _ be got away from that roulette . You are simply telling lies . This very day I mean to go and see for myself what roulette is like . Prascovia , tell me what there is to be seen here ; and do you , Alexis Ivanovitch , show me everything ; and do you , Potapitch , make me a list of excursions . What _ is _ there to be seen ? "
31522	31533	31606	31607	the nursemaid	738	" There is a ruined castle , and the Shlangenberg . "
31534	31545	31606	31607	the nursemaid	738	" The Shlangenberg ? What is it ? A forest ? "
31546	31573	31606	31607	the nursemaid	738	" No , a mountain on the summit of which there is a place fenced off . From it you can get a most beautiful view . "
31574	31586	31606	31607	the nursemaid	738	" Could a chair be carried up that mountain of yours ? "
31587	31597	31598	31598	I	0	" Doubtless we could find bearers for the purpose , "
31619	31632	31634	31635	the Grandmother	396	" No , I _ don t _ want to see them , "
31637	31658	31634	31635	the Grandmother	396	" I hate kissing children , for their noses are always wet . How are you getting on , Theodosia ? "
31659	31670	31672	31673	the nursemaid	738	" I am very well , thank you , Madame , "
31675	31691	31672	31673	the nursemaid	738	" And how is your ladyship ? We have been feeling so anxious about you ! "
31692	31708	31709	31711	the old lady	1794	" Yes , I know , you simple soul But who are those other guests ? "
31719	31732	31709	31711	the old lady	1794	" For instance , who is that old rascal in the spectacles ? "
31733	31739	31741	31741	Polina	47	" Prince Nilski , Grandmamma , "
31743	31795	31796	31796	she	1794	" Oh , a Russian ? Why , I had no idea that he could understand me ! Surely he did not hear what I said ? As for Mr. Astley , I have seen him already , and I see that he is here again . How do you do ? "
31810	31821	31822	31824	the old lady	1794	" Have you _ nothing _ to say to me ? "
31828	31842	31822	31824	the old lady	1794	" Say something , for goodness sake ! Translate to him , Polina . "
31847	31854	31856	31857	Mr. Astley	54	" I have only to say , "
31865	31879	31856	31857	Mr. Astley	54	" that I am indeed glad to see you in such good health . "
31893	31904	31905	31905	she	396	" How well English people know how to answer one ! "
31908	31924	31925	31925	she	1794	" That is why I like them so much better than French . Come here , "
31931	31965	31966	31966	she	1794	" I will try not to bore you too much . Polina , translate to him that I am staying in rooms on a lower floor . Yes , on a lower floor , "
32001	32011	32013	32013	she	1794	" I could almost have liked you , Prascovia , "
32016	32055	32013	32013	she	1794	" for you are a nice girl the best of the lot . You have some character about you . I too have character . Turn round . Surely that is not false hair that you are wearing ? "
32056	32066	31987	31989	the old lady	1794	" No , Grandmamma . It is my own . "
32067	32139	32140	32140	she	749	" Well , well . I do not like the stupid fashions of today . You are very good looking . I should have fallen in love with you if I had been a man . Why do you not get married ? It is time now that I was going . I want to walk , yet I always have to ride . Are you still in a bad temper ? "
32146	32151	32153	32156	the now mollified General	751	" No , indeed , "
32158	32168	32140	32140	she	749	" I quite understand that at your time of life "
32169	32178	32179	32180	De Griers	73	" Cette vieille est tomb e en enfance , "
32185	32195	32196	32198	the old lady	1794	" But I want to look round a little , "
32214	32246	32196	32198	the old lady	1794	" As much as you like . But I myself yes , and Polina and Monsieur de Griers too we all of us hope to have the pleasure of escorting you . "
32247	32257	32258	32259	De Griers	73	" Mais , madame , cela sera un plaisir , "
32266	32283	32285	32285	she	1794	" Plaisir indeed ! Why , I look upon you as a perfect fool , monsieur . "
32291	32333	32285	32285	she	1794	" I am not going to let you have any of my money . I must be off to my rooms now , to see what they are like . Afterwards we will look round a little . Lift me up . "
32680	32691	32672	32672	they	793	" Madame la g n rale , Princesse de Tarassevitcheva , "
32918	32926	32927	32927	she	396	" Of whom is this a portrait ? "
32942	32949	32950	32952	the old lady	1794	" But how know you that ? "
32955	32986	32950	32952	the old lady	1794	" You live here , yet you can not say for certain ! And why is the picture there at all ? And why do its eyes look so crooked ? "
33004	33008	33010	33012	the Grandmother in	805	" The blockhead ! "
33099	33106	33107	33107	she	396	" What donkeys these people are ! "
33120	33126	33127	33127	she	396	" What a huge counterpane ! "
33130	33137	33138	33139	The lacqueys	192	" Turn it back , please . "
33143	33150	33151	33153	the old lady	1794	" Further yet , further yet , "
33156	33180	33151	33153	the old lady	1794	" Turn it _ right _ back . Also , take off those pillows and bolsters , and lift up the feather bed . "
33189	33196	33197	33197	she	396	" Mercifully it contains no bugs , "
33200	33253	33151	33153	the old lady	1794	" Pull off the whole thing , and then put on my own pillows and sheets . The place is too luxurious for an old woman like myself . It is too large for any one person . Alexis Ivanovitch , come and see me whenever you are not teaching your pupils . "
33254	33268	33269	33269	I	0	" After tomorrow I shall no longer be in the General s service , "
33272	33284	33269	33269	I	0	" but merely living in the hotel on my own account . "
33285	33289	33151	33153	the old lady	1794	" Why so ? "
33290	33336	33269	33269	I	0	" Because , the other day , there arrived from Berlin a German and his wife persons of some importance ; and , it chanced that , when taking a walk , I spoke to them in German without having properly compassed the Berlin accent . "
33337	33340	33151	33153	the old lady	1794	" Indeed ? "
33341	33374	33269	33269	I	0	" Yes : and this action on my part the Baron held to be an insult , and complained about it to the General , who yesterday dismissed me from his employ . "
33375	33409	33151	33153	the old lady	1794	" But I suppose you must have threatened that precious Baron , or something of the kind ? However , even if you did so , it was a matter of no moment . "
33410	33429	33269	33269	I	0	" No , I did not . The Baron was the aggressor by raising his stick at me . "
33440	33477	33543	33545	The old lady	1794	" What ? You permitted yourself to treat your tutor thus , you nincompoop , and to dismiss him from his post ? You are a blockhead an utter blockhead ! I can see that clearly . "
33478	33488	33489	33490	the General	150	" Do not alarm yourself , my dear mother , "
33508	33534	33489	33490	the General	150	" I am quite capable of managing my own affairs . Moreover , Alexis Ivanovitch has not given you a true account of the matter . "
33535	33542	33543	33545	The old lady	1794	" What did you do next ? "
33550	33561	33562	33562	I	0	" I wanted to challenge the Baron to a duel , "
33569	33579	33562	33562	I	0	" but the General protested against my doing so . "
33580	33590	33591	33591	she	1794	" And _ why _ did you so protest ? "
33623	33626	33627	33627	she	1794	" For , "
33630	33652	33627	33627	she	1794	" I can see no difference between you and the Baron ; nor can I bear that German visage of yours . "
33672	33678	33679	33680	the General	150	" Pardon me , Madame , "
33686	33693	33679	33680	the General	150	" but are duels really feasible ? "
33694	33870	33679	33680	the General	150	" Why not ? All men are crowing cocks , and that is why they quarrel . _ You _ , though , I perceive , are a blockhead a man who does not even know how to carry his breeding . Lift me up . Potapitch , see to it that you always have _ two _ bearers ready . Go and arrange for their hire . But we shall not require more than two , for I shall need only to be carried upstairs . On the level or in the street I can be _ wheeled _ along . Go and tell them that , and pay them in advance , so that they may show me some respect . You too , Potapitch , are always to come with me , and _ you _ , Alexis Ivanovitch , are to point out to me this Baron as we go along , in order that I may get a squint at the precious Von . And where is that roulette played ? "
33971	33978	33979	33979	she	820	" Then take me straight there , "
33982	33996	33979	33979	she	820	" and do you walk on in front of me , Alexis Ivanovitch . "
33997	34013	34014	34015	the General	150	" What , mother ? Before you have so much as rested from your journey ? "
34109	34115	34116	34116	she	820	" Why should I rest ? "
34119	34177	34116	34116	she	820	" I am not tired , for I have been sitting still these past five days . Let us see what your medicinal springs and waters are like , and where they are situated . What , too , about that , that what did you call it , Prascovia ? oh , about that mountain top ? "
34178	34190	34107	34107	her	396	" Yes , we are going to see it , Grandmamma . "
34191	34205	34116	34116	she	820	" Very well . Is there anything else for me to see here ? "
34206	34215	34218	34218	herself	47	" Yes ! Quite a number of things , "
34222	34235	34238	34240	the old lady	1794	" Martha , _ you _ must come with me as well , "
34245	34252	34254	34255	the General	150	" No , no , mother ! "
34257	34274	34254	34255	the General	150	" Really she can not come . They would not admit even Potapitch to the Casino . "
34275	34347	34238	34240	the old lady	1794	" Rubbish ! Because she is my servant , is that a reason for turning her out ? Why , she is only a human being like the rest of us ; and as she has been travelling for a week she might like to look about her . With whom else could she go out but myself ? She would never dare to show her nose in the street alone . "
34348	34352	34254	34255	the General	150	" But , mother "
34353	34427	34238	34240	the old lady	1794	" Are you ashamed to be seen with me ? Stop at home , then , and you will be asked no questions . A pretty General _ you _ are , to be sure ! I am a general s widow myself . But , after all , why should I drag the whole party with me ? I will go and see the sights with only Alexis Ivanovitch as my escort . "
34475	34484	34485	34485	he	73	" Mais elle est tomb e en enfance , "
34492	34501	34485	34485	he	73	" Seule , elle fera des b tises . "
34734	34742	34722	34722	Polina	47	" Who was it passed just now ? "
34743	34750	34708	34710	the old lady	1794	" Who is that coming along ? "
34751	34759	34708	34710	the old lady	1794	" Is the town a large one ? "
34760	34767	34708	34710	the old lady	1794	" Are the public gardens extensive ? "
34768	34776	34722	34722	Polina	47	" What sort of trees are those ? "
34777	34786	34708	34710	the old lady	1794	" What is the name of those hills ? "
34787	34795	34708	34710	the old lady	1794	" Do I see eagles flying yonder ? "
34796	34805	34834	34836	the old lady	1794	" What is that absurd - looking building ? "
34960	34973	34952	34953	the Grandmother	396	" I am not going to give you any of my money ; "
36309	36315	36317	36317	she	396	" Go and tell him , "
36326	36361	36317	36317	she	396	" go and tell him to stop , and to take his money with him , and go home . Presently he will be losing yes , losing everything that he has now won . "
36369	36374	36375	36375	she	396	" Where is Potapitch ? "
36378	36402	36404	36404	she	396	" Send Potapitch to speak to him . No , _ you _ must tell him , _ you _ must tell him , "
36408	36424	36425	36425	she	396	" for I have not the least notion where Potapitch is . Sortez , sortez , "
36474	36478	36479	36479	she	396	" How provoking ! "
36482	36522	36524	36526	the old lady	1794	" Then the young man is done for ! I suppose he _ wishes _ to be ruined . Yet I could not bear to see him have to return it all . What a fool the fellow is ! "
36743	36752	36753	36753	she	396	" _ That _ woman is not losing , "
36756	36772	36753	36753	she	396	" To whom does she belong ? Do you know her ? Who is she ? "
36773	36783	36784	36784	I	0	" She is , I believe , a Frenchwoman , "
36787	36833	36753	36753	she	396	" Ah ! A bird of passage , evidently . Besides , I can see that she has her shoes polished . Now , explain to me the meaning of each round in the game , and the way in which one ought to stake . "
36848	36853	36836	36836	I	0	" rouge et noir , "
36855	36860	36836	36836	I	0	" pair et impair , "
36862	36867	36836	36836	I	0	" manque et passe , "
36936	36942	36943	36943	she	396	" But what is zero ? "
36946	36993	36943	36943	she	396	" Just now I heard the flaxen - haired croupier call out zero ! And why does he keep raking in all the money that is on the table ? To think that he should grab the whole pile for himself ! What does zero mean ? "
36994	37043	37321	37322	The Grandmother	396	" Zero is what the bank takes for itself . If the wheel stops at that figure , everything lying on the table becomes the absolute property of the bank . Also , whenever the wheel has begun to turn , the bank ceases to pay out anything . "
37044	37055	36943	36943	she	396	" Then I should receive nothing if I were staking ? "
37056	37088	37321	37322	The Grandmother	396	" No ; unless by any chance you had _ purposely _ staked on zero ; in which case you would receive thirty - five times the value of your stake . "
37089	37118	36943	36943	she	396	" Why thirty - five times , when zero so often turns up ? And if so , why do not more of these fools stake upon it ? "
37119	37133	37321	37322	The Grandmother	396	" Because the number of chances against its occurrence is thirty - six . "
37134	37152	37153	37155	The old lady	1794	" Rubbish ! Potapitch , Potapitch ! Come here , and I will give you some money . "
37179	37190	37153	37155	The old lady	1794	" Go at once , and stake that upon zero . "
37191	37204	37205	37205	I	0	" But , Madame , zero has only this moment turned up , "
37208	37235	37205	37205	I	0	" wherefore , it may not do so again for ever so long . Wait a little , and you may then have a better chance . "
37236	37243	37153	37155	The old lady	1794	" Rubbish ! Stake , please . "
37244	37275	37205	37205	I	0	" Pardon me , but zero might not turn up again until , say , tonight , even though you had staked thousands upon it . It often happens so . "
37276	37301	37153	37155	The old lady	1794	" Rubbish , rubbish ! Who fears the wolf should never enter the forest . What ? We have lost ? Then stake again . "
37395	37400	37390	37391	the croupier	329	" Trente - six , "
37407	37413	37415	37417	the old lady	1794	" To listen to him ! "
37419	37485	37415	37417	the old lady	1794	" When will that accursed zero ever turn up ? I can not breathe until I see it . I believe that that infernal croupier is _ purposely _ keeping it from turning up . Alexis Ivanovitch , stake TWO golden pieces this time . The moment we cease to stake , that cursed zero will come turning up , and we shall get nothing . "
37486	37490	37566	37568	the old lady	1794	" My good Madame "
37491	37504	37415	37417	the old lady	1794	" Stake , stake ! It is not _ your _ money . "
37547	37550	37552	37553	the croupier	329	" Zero ! "
37555	37564	37566	37568	the old lady	1794	" There ! You see , you see ! "
37581	37641	37571	37571	she	1794	" I told you so ! It was the Lord God himself who suggested to me to stake those two coins . Now , how much ought I to receive ? Why do they not pay it out to me ? Potapitch ! Martha ! Where are they ? What has become of our party ? Potapitch , Potapitch ! "
37642	37647	37648	37648	I	0	" Presently , Madame , "
37651	37681	37682	37683	The croupiers	910	" Potapitch is outside , and they would decline to admit him to these rooms . See ! You are being paid out your money . Pray take it . "
37729	37747	37749	37750	the croupier	329	" Faites le jeu , messieurs ! Faites le jeu , messieurs ! Rien ne va plus , "
37768	37786	37787	37788	The Grandmother	396	" We shall be too late ! He is going to spin again ! Stake , stake ! "
37795	37804	37809	37809	herself	396	" Do not hang back ! Be quick ! "
37820	37829	37817	37817	she	396	" Upon what shall I stake , Madame ? "
37830	37876	37817	37817	she	396	" Upon zero , upon zero ! Again upon zero ! Stake as much as ever you can . How much have we got ? Seventy ten - g lden pieces ? We shall not miss them , so stake twenty pieces at a time . "
37877	37908	37817	37817	she	396	" Think a moment , Madame . Sometimes zero does not turn up for two hundred rounds in succession . I assure you that you may lose all your capital . "
37909	37938	37939	37941	The old lady	1794	" You are wrong utterly wrong . Stake , I tell you ! What a chattering tongue you have ! I know perfectly well what I am doing . "
37947	37968	37985	37985	she	1794	" But the rules do not allow of more than 120 g lden being staked upon zero at a time . "
37969	37983	37985	37985	she	1794	" How do not allow ? Surely you are wrong ? Monsieur , monsieur "
38000	38008	37985	37985	she	1794	" combien zero ? Douze ? Douze ? "
38014	38019	38021	38022	the croupier	329	" Oui , Madame , "
38027	38042	38021	38022	the croupier	329	" No single stake must exceed four thousand florins . That is the regulation . "
38043	38059	38067	38068	the croupier	329	" Then there is nothing else for it . We must risk in g lden . "
38060	38066	38067	38068	the croupier	329	" Le jeu est fait ! "
38084	38094	38096	38098	the old lady	1794	" Again , again , again ! Stake again ! "
38144	38159	38161	38161	I	0	" Does she again think that zero is going to be the winning coup ? "
38208	38211	38213	38214	the croupier	329	" Zero ! "
38216	38221	38223	38225	the old lady	1794	" Ah ! ! ! "
38487	38525	38483	38483	she	64	" Alexis Ivanovitch , did not the croupier just say that 4000 florins were the most that could be staked at any one time ? Well , take these 4000 , and stake them upon the red . "
38538	38541	38543	38544	the croupier	329	" Rouge ! "
38553	38558	38560	38561	the Grandmother	396	" Give me them , "
38563	38574	38560	38561	the Grandmother	396	" and stake the other 4000 upon the red again . "
38579	38582	38584	38585	the croupier	329	" Rouge ! "
38587	38591	38593	38595	the old lady	1794	" Twelve thousand ! "
38597	38630	38593	38595	the old lady	1794	" Hand me the whole lot . Put the gold into this purse here , and count the bank notes . Enough ! Let us go home . Wheel my chair away . "
38837	38841	38843	38844	De Griers	73	" Quelle victoire ! "
38846	38856	38858	38860	Mlle . Blanche	50	" Mais , Madame , c tait du feu ! "
38866	38876	38878	38880	the old lady	1794	" Yes , I have won twelve thousand florins , "
38882	38918	38878	38880	the old lady	1794	" And then there is all this gold . With it the total ought to come to nearly thirteen thousand . How much is that in Russian money ? Six thousand roubles , I think ? "
38944	38976	38878	38880	the old lady	1794	" Eight thousand roubles ! What a splendid thing ! And to think of you simpletons sitting there and doing nothing ! Potapitch ! Martha ! See what I have won ! "
38977	38988	38989	38989	Martha	103	" How _ did _ you do it , Madame ? "
38993	38998	38989	38989	Martha	103	" Eight thousand roubles ! "
38999	39016	38878	38880	the old lady	1794	" And I am going to give you fifty g lden apiece . There they are . "
39028	39087	38878	38880	the old lady	1794	" And to each bearer also I will give a ten - g lden piece . Let them have it out of the gold , Alexis Ivanovitch . But why is this footman bowing to me , and that other man as well ? Are they congratulating me ? Well , let them have ten g lden apiece . "
39088	39106	39108	39123	a man who for some time past had been hanging around the old lady s chair	1008	" Madame la princesse Un pauvre expatri Malheur continuel Les princes russes sont si g n reux ! "
39147	39154	39156	39157	the Grandmother	396	" Give him ten g lden , "
39159	39223	39156	39157	the Grandmother	396	" No , give him twenty . Now , enough of that , or I shall never get done with you all . Take a moment s rest , and then carry me away . Prascovia , I mean to buy a new dress for you tomorrow . Yes , and for you too , Mlle . Blanche . Please translate , Prascovia . "
39224	39229	39231	39231	Mlle	50	" Merci , Madame , "
39274	39282	39285	39286	the Grandmother	396	" How surprised Theodosia too will be ! "
39296	39320	39322	39326	a crooked - backed ragamuffin	1018	" She , like yourselves , shall have the price of a new gown . Here , Alexis Ivanovitch ! Give that beggar something "
39335	39349	39350	39350	I	0	" But perhaps he is _ not _ a beggar only a rascal , "
39353	39366	39322	39326	a crooked - backed ragamuffin	1018	" Never mind , never mind . Give him a g lden . "
39406	39417	39322	39326	a crooked - backed ragamuffin	1018	" Have you never tried your luck , Alexis Ivanovitch ? "
39418	39423	39322	39326	a crooked - backed ragamuffin	1018	" No , Madame . "
39424	39439	39322	39326	a crooked - backed ragamuffin	1018	" Yet just now I could see that you were burning to do so ? "
39440	39452	39322	39326	a crooked - backed ragamuffin	1018	" I _ do _ mean to try my luck presently . "
39453	39477	39322	39326	a crooked - backed ragamuffin	1018	" Then stake everything upon zero . You have seen how it ought to be done ? How much capital do you possess ? "
39478	39486	39322	39326	a crooked - backed ragamuffin	1018	" Two hundred g lden , Madame . "
39487	39511	39514	39514	she	1020	" Not very much . See here ; I will lend you five hundred if you wish . Take this purse of mine . "
39521	39533	39514	39514	she	1020	" But _ you _ need not expect to receive any . "
39553	39557	39558	39558	he	73	" Que diable ! "
39564	39571	39558	39558	he	73	" C est une terrible vieille . "
39572	39581	39583	39584	the grandmother	396	" Look ! Another beggar , another beggar ! "
39586	39598	39606	39615	a grey - headed old man with a wooden leg	1025	" Alexis Ivanovitch , go and give him a g lden . "
39658	39664	39665	39665	he	1025	" Was ist der Teufel ! "
39677	39685	39687	39688	the Grandmother	396	" The man is a perfect fool ! "
39694	39716	39691	39691	her	396	" Move on now , for I am simply famished . When we have lunched we will return to that place . "
39717	39720	39722	39722	I.	0	" What ? "
39723	39733	39691	39691	her	396	" You are going to play _ again ? _ "
39734	39741	39742	39742	she	396	" What else do you suppose ? "
39745	39765	39742	39742	she	396	" Are you going only to sit here , and grow sour , and let me look at you ? "
39766	39769	39771	39772	De Griers	73	" Madame , "
39775	39799	39771	39772	De Griers	73	" les chances peuvent tourner . Une seule mauvaise chance , et vous perdrez tout surtout avec votre jeu . C tait terrible ! "
39800	39807	39810	39810	Mlle	50	" Oui ; vous perdrez absolument , "
39814	39826	39828	39830	the old lady	1794	" What has that got to do with _ you ? _ "
39832	39861	39862	39862	she	1794	" It is not _ your _ money that I am going to lose ; it is my own . And where is that Mr. Astley of yours ? "
39867	39875	39896	39900	the landlord on the staircase	1030	" He stayed behind in the Casino . "
39876	39890	39896	39900	the landlord on the staircase	1030	" What a pity ! He is such a nice sort of man ! "
39955	39966	39968	39968	Martha	103	" I was watching you all the time , Madame , "
39970	40120	39968	39968	Martha	103	" and I asked Potapitch what mistress was trying to do . And , my word ! the heaps and _ heaps _ of money that were lying upon the table ! Never in my life have I seen so much money . And there were gentlefolk around it , and other gentlefolk sitting down . So , I asked Potapitch where all these gentry had come from ; for , thought I , maybe the Holy Mother of God will help our mistress among them . Yes , I prayed for you , Madame , and my heart died within me , so that I kept trembling and trembling . The Lord be with her , I thought to myself ; and in answer to my prayer He has now sent you what He has done ! Even yet I tremble I tremble to think of it all . "

But she will only gamble away all that she has gamble it away like thistledown . You yourself have seen her play . Once she has acquired the taste for gambling , she will never leave the roulette - table , but , of sheer perversity and temper , will stake her all , and lose it .

I always thought we should get something like this from him , for I always looked upon him as a futile , frivolous fellow who gave himself unconscionable airs on the fact of his being a general ( though he only became one because he retired as a colonel ) . Yes , I know _ all _ about the sending of the telegrams to inquire whether the old woman is likely to turn up her toes soon . Ah , they were looking for the legacies ! Without money that wretched woman ( what is her name ? Oh , De Cominges ) would never dream of accepting the General and his false teeth no , not even for him to be her lacquey since she herself , they say , possesses a pile of money , and lends it on interest , and makes a good thing out of it . However , it is not _ you _ , Prascovia , that I am blaming ; it was not _ you _ who sent those telegrams . Nor , for that matter , do I wish to recall old scores . True , I know that you are a vixen by nature that you are a wasp which will sting one if one touches it yet , my heart is sore for you , for I loved your mother , Katerina . Now , will you leave everything here , and come away with me ? Otherwise , I do not know what is to become of you , and it is not right that you should continue living with these people . Nay , "
47093	47156	47082	47082	she	1215	" I have not yet finished . I ask of you nothing in return . My house in Moscow is , as you know , large enough for a palace , and you could occupy a whole floor of it if you liked , and keep away from me for weeks together . Will you come with me or will you not ? "
47157	47170	47172	47172	Polina	47	" First of all , let me ask of _ you _ , "
47174	47184	47172	47172	Polina	47	" whether you are intending to depart at once ? "
47185	47275	47082	47082	she	1215	" What ? You suppose me to be jesting ? I have said that I am going , and I _ am _ going . Today I have squandered fifteen thousand roubles at that accursed roulette of yours , and though , five years ago , I promised the people of a certain suburb of Moscow to build them a stone church in place of a wooden one , I have been fooling away my money here ! However , I am going back now to build my church . "
47276	47294	47172	47172	Polina	47	" But what about the waters , Grandmamma ? Surely you came here to take the waters ? "
47295	47330	47082	47082	she	1215	" You and your waters ! Do not anger me , Prascovia . Surely you are trying to ? Say , then : will you , or will you not , come with me ? "
47331	47334	47335	47335	Polina	47	" Grandmamma , "
47341	47438	47335	47335	Polina	47	" I am very , very grateful to you for the shelter which you have so kindly offered me . Also , to a certain extent you have guessed my position aright , and I am beholden to you to such an extent that it may be that I _ will _ come and live with you , and that very soon ; yet there are important reasons why why I can not make up my mind just yet . If you would let me have , say , a couple of weeks to decide in ? "
47439	47450	47656	47658	The Great Poulterer	121	" You mean that you are _ not _ coming ? "
47451	47530	47533	47533	she	1216	" I mean only that I can not come just yet . At all events , I could not well leave my little brother and sister here , since , since if I were to leave them they would be abandoned altogether . But if , Grandmamma , you would take the little ones _ and _ myself , then , of course , I could come with you , and would do all I could to serve you "
47540	47554	47533	47533	she	1216	" Only , without the little ones I _ can not _ come . "
47555	47561	47656	47658	The Great Poulterer	121	" Do not make a fuss "
47579	47650	47656	47658	The Great Poulterer	121	" The Great Foster - Father[3 ] can find for all his chicks a place . You are not coming without the children ? But see here , Prascovia . I wish you well , and nothing but well : yet I have divined the reason why you will not come . Yes , I know all , Prascovia . That Frenchman will never bring you good of any sort . "
47669	47672	47674	47674	I	0	" For , "
47678	47702	47674	47674	I	0	" every one seems to know about that affair . Or perhaps I am the only one who does not know about it ? "

47717	47781	47714	47715	the Grandmother	396	" But I do not intend to slur things over . You will take care that no harm befalls you , will you not ? For you are a girl of sense , and I am sorry for you I regard you in a different light to the rest of them . And now , please , leave me . Good - bye . "
47782	47793	47795	47795	Polina	47	" But let me stay with you a little longer , "
47797	47800	47802	47803	the other	1218	" No , "
47805	47826	47802	47803	the other	1218	" you need not . Do not bother me , for you and all of them have tired me out . "
47873	47915	47845	47845	herself	1794	" And good - bye to you , also , Alexis Ivanovitch . The train starts in an hour s time , and I think that you must be weary of me . Take these five hundred g lden for yourself . "

48274	48305	48251	48251	she	396	" I can not rest until I have retrieved my losses . March on ahead , and ask me no questions . Play continues until midnight , does it not ? "

48341	48349	48338	48338	I	0	" I will not go with you . "
48350	48372	48251	48251	she	396	" And why not ? What do you mean ? Is every one here a stupid good - for - nothing ? "
48373	48419	48338	48338	I	0	" Pardon me , but I have nothing to reproach myself with . I merely will not go . I merely intend neither to witness nor to join in your play . I also beg to return you your five hundred g lden . Farewell . "

48453	48489	48447	48448	the Grandmother	396	" Very well , then . Do not come , and I will find my way alone . Potapitch , you must come with me . Lift up the chair , and carry me along . "

48701	48899	48694	48696	the old chamberlain	1237	" treated her as a gentleman should , but he he robbed her right and left , as I could see with my own eyes . Twice she caught him at it , and rated him soundly . On one occasion she even pulled his hair , so that the bystanders burst out laughing . Yet she lost everything , sir that is to say , she lost all that you had changed for her . Then we brought her home , and , after asking for some water and saying her prayers , she went to bed . So worn out was she that she fell asleep at once . May God send her dreams of angels ! And _ this _ is all that foreign travel has done for us ! Oh , my own Moscow ! For what have we not at home there , in Moscow ? Such a garden and flowers as you could never see here , and fresh air and apple - trees coming into blossom , and a beautiful view to look upon . Ah , but what must she do but go travelling abroad ? Alack , alack ! "

Now I am without money without a single groat . But I must not delay a moment ; I must leave by the 9:30 train . I have sent for that English friend of yours , and am going to beg of him three thousand francs for a week . Please try and persuade him to think nothing of it , nor yet to refuse me , for I am still a rich woman who possesses three villages and a couple of mansions . Yes , the money shall be found , for I have not yet squandered _ everything _ . I tell you this in order that he may have no doubts about Ah , but here he is ! Clearly he is a good fellow . "

Never again shall I blame young people for being frivolous . I should think it wrong even to blame that unhappy General of yours . Nevertheless , I do not mean to let him have any of my money ( which is all that he desires ) , for the reason that I look upon him as a perfect blockhead , and consider myself , simpleton though I be , at least wiser than _ he _ is . How surely does God visit old age , and punish it for its presumption ! Well , good - bye . Martha , come and lift me up . "

54905	55233	55290	55290	her	1434	" certain untoward circumstances compel me to depart in haste . Of course , you have of yourself remarked that hitherto I have always refrained from having any final explanation with you , for the reason that I could not well state the whole circumstances ; and now to my difficulties the advent of the aged Grandmother , coupled with her subsequent proceedings , has put the final touch . Also , the involved state of my affairs forbids me to write with any finality concerning those hopes of ultimate bliss upon which , for a long while past , I have permitted myself to feed . I regret the past , but at the same time hope that in my conduct you have never been able to detect anything that was unworthy of a gentleman and a man of honour . Having lost , however , almost the whole of my money in debts incurred by your stepfather , I find myself driven to the necessity of saving the remainder ; wherefore , I have instructed certain friends of mine in St. Petersburg to arrange for the sale of all the property which has been mortgaged to myself . At the same time , knowing that , in addition , your frivolous stepfather has squandered money which is exclusively yours , I have decided to absolve him from a certain moiety of the mortgages on his property , in order that you may be in a position to recover of him what you have lost , by suing him in legal fashion . I trust , therefore , that , as matters now stand , this action of mine may bring you some advantage . I trust also that this same action leaves me in the position of having fulfilled every obligation which is incumbent upon a man of honour and refinement . Rest assured that your memory will for ever remain graven in my heart . "
55234	55241	55242	55242	I	0	" All this is clear enough , "
55245	55256	55258	55258	I	0	" Surely you did not expect aught else from him ? "
55263	55272	55273	55273	she	1434	" I expected nothing at all from him , "
55293	55336	55290	55290	her	1434	" Long ago I made up my mind on the subject , for I could read his thoughts , and knew what he was thinking . He thought that possibly I should sue him that one day I might become a nuisance . "
55350	55458	55337	55338	Here Polina	47	" So of set purpose I redoubled my contemptuous treatment of him , and waited to see what he would do . If a telegram to say that we had become legatees had arrived from , St. Petersburg , I should have flung at him a quittance for my foolish stepfather s debts , and then dismissed him . For a long time I have hated him . Even in earlier days he was not a man ; and now ! Oh , how gladly I could throw those fifty thousand roubles in his face , and spit in it , and then rub the spittle in ! "
55459	55491	55543	55543	me	0	" But the document returning the fifty - thousand rouble mortgage has the General got it ? If so , possess yourself of it , and send it to De Griers . "

55505	55521	55543	55543	me	0	" Just as I expected ! Well , what is the General going to do ? "

55696	55736	55693	55693	she	47	" he would merely tell you to be so good as first to return him the fifty thousand francs . What , then , would be the use of having a quarrel with him ? You talk sheer nonsense . "

59502	59516	59546	59546	she	47	" Because I am not in the habit of receiving money for nothing . "

60295	60373	60375	60375	she	47	" How would it be if we were to try and overtake Grandmamma ? I think we should do so at Berlin . And what think you she would have to say to us when we caught her up , and her eyes first lit upon us ? What , too , about Mr. Astley ? _ He _ would not leap from the Shlangenberg for my sake ! No ! Of that I am very sure ! "
60378	60479	60375	60375	she	47	" Do you know where he is going next year ? He says he intends to go to the North Pole for scientific investigations , and has invited me to go with him ! Ha , ha , ha ! He also says that we Russians know nothing , can do nothing , without European help . But he is a good fellow all the same . For instance , he does not blame the General in the matter , but declares that Mlle . Blanche that love But no ; I do not know , I do not know . "
60497	60561	60563	60563	she	47	" What poor creatures these people are . How sorry I am for them , and for Grandmamma ! But when are you going to kill De Griers ? Surely you do not intend actually to murder him ? You fool ! Do you suppose that I should _ allow _ you to fight De Griers ? Nor shall you kill the Baron . "

60999	61009	61011	61011	she	47	" Then _ take _ your fifty thousand francs ! "

61872	61882	61847	61847	his	54	" Then you are minded to keep her there ? "
61883	61894	61847	61847	his	54	" Yes , I am minded to keep her there . "
61895	61928	61847	61847	his	54	" But , Mr. Astley , that will raise a scandal . It ought not to be allowed . Besides , she is very ill . Perhaps you had not remarked that ? "
61929	61962	61847	61847	his	54	" Yes , I have . It was I who told you about it . Had she not been ill , she would not have gone and spent the night with you . "
61963	61971	61847	61847	his	54	" Then you know all about it ? "
61972	62010	61847	61847	his	54	" Yes ; for last night she was to have accompanied me to the house of a relative of mine . Unfortunately , being ill , she made a mistake , and went to your rooms instead . "
62011	62065	61847	61847	his	54	" Indeed ? Then I wish you joy , Mr. Astley . Apropos , you have reminded me of something . Were you beneath my window last night ? Every moment Mlle . Polina kept telling me to open the window and see if you were there ; after which she always smiled . "
62066	62090	61847	61847	his	54	" Indeed ? No , I was not there ; but I was waiting in the corridor , and walking about the hotel . "
62091	62105	61847	61847	his	54	" She ought to see a doctor , you know , Mr. Astley . "
62106	62130	61847	61847	his	54	" Yes , she ought . I have sent for one , and , if she dies , I shall hold you responsible . "

62143	62150	62140	62140	I	0	" but what do you mean ? "
62151	62173	62133	62133	me	0	" Never mind . Tell me if it is true that , last night , you won two hundred thousand thalers ? "
62174	62184	62140	62140	I	0	" No ; I won a hundred thousand florins . "
62185	62201	62133	62133	me	0	" Good heavens ! Then I suppose you will be off to Paris this morning ? "
62202	62205	62140	62140	I	0	" Why ? "
62206	62218	62220	62220	Astley	54	" Because all Russians who have grown rich go to Paris , "
62233	62259	62224	62224	he	54	" But what could I do in Paris in summer time ? I _ love _ her , Mr. Astley ! Surely you know that ? "
62260	62322	62224	62224	he	54	" Indeed ? I am sure that you do _ not _ . Moreover , if you were to stay here , you would lose everything that you possess , and have nothing left with which to pay your expenses in Paris . Well , good - bye now . I feel sure that today will see you gone from here . "
62323	62369	62224	62224	he	54	" Good - bye . But I am _ not _ going to Paris . Likewise pardon me what is to become of this family ? I mean that the affair of the General and Mlle . Polina will soon be all over the town . "
62370	62422	62224	62224	he	54	" I daresay ; yet , I hardly suppose that that will break the General s heart . Moreover , Mlle . Polina has a perfect right to live where she chooses . In short , we may say that , as a family , this family has ceased to exist . "
62445	62471	62520	62520	her	47	" I suppose he means to shoot me in a duel , should Polina die . Yes , that is what he intends to do . "
62711	62745	62706	62706	Blanche	50	" Ah , c est lui ! Viens , donc , b te ! Is it true that you have won a mountain of gold and silver ? J aimerais mieux l or . "

63094	63169	63403	63403	she	1551	" Eh bien , que feras - tu si je te prends avec moi ? First of all I must have fifty thousand francs , and you shall give them to me at Frankfurt . Then we will go on to Paris , where we will live together , et je te ferai voir des toiles en plein jour . Yes , you shall see such women as your eyes have never lit upon . "
63170	63194	63368	63368	her	1551	" Stop a moment . If I were to give you those fifty thousand francs , what should I have left for myself ? "
63195	63267	63403	63403	she	1551	" Another hundred thousand francs , please to remember . Besides , I could live with you in your rooms for a month , or even for two ; or even for longer . But it would not take us more than two months to get through fifty thousand francs ; for , look you , je suis bonne enfante , et tu verras des toiles , you may be sure . "
63268	63285	63368	63368	her	1551	" What ? You mean to say that we should spend the whole in two months ? "
63286	63352	63403	63403	she	1551	" Certainly . Does that surprise you very much ? Ah , vil esclave ! Why , one month of that life would be better than all your previous existence . One month et apr s , le d luge ! Mais tu ne peux comprendre . Va ! Away , away ! You are not worth it . Ah , que fais - tu ? "
63395	63402	63403	63403	she	1551	" Eh bien , mon utchitel , "
63408	63428	63403	63403	she	1551	" je t attends , si tu veux . I start in a quarter of an hour s time . "

63808	63924	63792	63792	she	50	" Come , come ! We are going to spend your two hundred thousand francs for you , et tu seras heureux comme un petit roi . I myself will tie your tie for you , and introduce you to Hortense . And when we have spent your money you shall return here , and break the bank again . What did those two Jews tell you ? that the thing most needed is daring , and that you possess it ? Consequently , this is not the first time that you will be hurrying to Paris with money in your pocket . Quant moi , je veux cinquante mille francs de rente , et alors "
63925	63932	63933	63933	I	0	" But what about the General ? "
63936	64036	63792	63792	she	50	" The General ? You know well enough that at about this hour every day he goes to buy me a bouquet . On this occasion , I took care to tell him that he must hunt for the choicest of flowers ; and when he returns home , the poor fellow will find the bird flown . Possibly he may take wing in pursuit ha , ha , ha ! And if so , I shall not be sorry , for he could be useful to me in Paris , and Mr. Astley will pay his debts here . "
64169	64179	64180	64180	she	50	" Et les cent mille francs qui nous restent , "

65153	65185	65149	65149	she	50	" I decided to spend so much upon these horses only because I can easily sell them again . They would go at any time for _ twenty _ thousand francs . "
65186	65220	65137	65137	she	50	" Yes , yes . They are splendid horses , and you have got a splendid turn - out . I am quite content . Let me hear no more of the matter . "
65221	65228	65149	65149	she	50	" Then you are not angry ? "
65229	65304	65137	65137	she	50	" No . Why should I be ? You are wise to provide yourself with what you need , for it will all come in handy in the future . Yes , I quite see the necessity of your establishing yourself on a good basis , for without it you will never earn your million . My hundred thousand francs I look upon merely as a beginning as a mere drop in the bucket . "

Since you are what you are , I mean to love you all the time , and never to be unfaithful to you . You see , I have not loved you before parce que je croyais que tu n es qu un utchitel ( quelque chose comme un lacquais , n est - ce pas ? ) Yet all the time I have been true to you , parce que je suis bonne fille .

Mr. Astley has just sent a telegram to say so , and you will agree with me that the General is likely to be her heir .

68596	68603	68604	68604	she	1656	" I must behave altogether differently , "
68613	68687	68604	68604	she	1656	" Yet , mark you , there is a tiresome circumstance of which I had never before thought which is , how best to pronounce my new family name . Zagorianski , Zagozianski , Madame la G n rale de Sago , Madame la G n rale de Fourteen Consonants oh these infernal Russian names ! The _ last _ of them would be the best to use , don t you think ? "
68717	68722	68723	68723	she	1656	" Tu tais bon enfant "
68729	68747	68723	68723	she	1656	" Je te croyais b te et tu en avais l air , but it suited you . "

68802	68883	68799	68799	she	1656	" for , though you are a very learned tutor , you are a very stupid man . More than two thousand francs , however , I am not going to give you , for the reason that , if I did so , you would gamble them all away . Now good - bye . Nous serons toujours bons amis , and if you win again , do not fail to come to me , et tu seras heureux . "

70753	70759	70760	70760	he	54	" _ You _ here ? "
70763	70808	70760	70760	he	54	" Well , I had an idea that I should meet you . Do not trouble to tell me anything , for I know all yes , all . In fact , your whole life during the past twenty months lies within my knowledge . "
70809	70821	70822	70822	I	0	" How closely you watch the doings of your old friends ! "
70825	70874	70822	70822	I	0	" That does you infinite credit . But stop a moment . You have reminded me of something . Was it you who bailed me out of Roulettenberg prison when I was lying there for a debt of two hundred g lden ? _ someone _ did so . "
70875	70892	70760	70760	he	54	" Oh dear no ! though I knew all the time that you were lying there . "
70893	70907	70822	70822	I	0	" Perhaps you could tell me who _ did _ bail me out ? "
70908	70918	70760	70760	he	54	" No ; I am afraid I could not . "
70919	70986	70822	70822	I	0	" What a strange thing ! For I know no Russians at all here , so it can not have been a Russian who befriended me . In Russia we Orthodox folk _ do _ go bail for one another , but in this case I thought it must have been done by some English stranger who was not conversant with the ways of the country . "
71016	71019	71020	71020	he	54	" Well , "
71026	71050	71020	71020	he	54	" I am none the less glad to find that you retain your old independence of spirit , as well as your buoyancy . "
71051	71071	71072	71072	I	0	" Which means that you are vexed at not having found me more abased and humiliated than I am ? "
71093	71103	71104	71104	he	54	" Your remarks please me as they always did , "
71107	71215	71104	71104	he	54	" In those words I see the clever , triumphant , and , above all things , cynical friend of former days . Only Russians have the faculty of combining within themselves so many opposite qualities . Yes , most men love to see their best friend in abasement ; for generally it is on such abasement that friendship is founded . All thinking persons know that ancient truth . Yet , on the present occasion , I assure you , I am sincerely glad to see that you are _ not _ cast down . Tell me , are you never going to give up gambling ? "
71216	71235	71292	71292	me	0	" Damn the gambling ! Yes , I should certainly have given it up , were it not that "
71236	71282	71104	71104	he	54	" That you are losing ? I thought so . You need not tell me any more . I know how things stand , for you have said that last in despair , and therefore , truthfully . Have you no other employment than gambling ? "
71283	71289	71292	71292	me	0	" No ; none whatever . "
71319	71325	71326	71326	he	54	" You are growing blas , "
71329	71445	71326	71326	he	54	" You have not only renounced life , with its interests and social ties , but the duties of a citizen and a man ; you have not only renounced the friends whom I know you to have had , and every aim in life but that of winning money ; but you have also renounced your memory . Though I can remember you in the strong , ardent period of your life , I feel persuaded that you have now forgotten every better feeling of that period that your present dreams and aspirations of subsistence do not rise above pair , impair rouge , noir , the twelve middle numbers , and so forth . "
71446	71452	71453	71453	I	0	" Enough , Mr. Astley ! "
71462	71524	71453	71453	I	0	" Kindly do not recall to me any more recollections , for I can remember things for myself . Only for a time have I put them out of my head . Only until I shall have rehabilitated myself , am I keeping my memory dulled . When that hour shall come , you will see me arise from the dead . "
71525	71537	71538	71538	he	1709	" Then you will have to be here another ten years , "
71541	71580	71538	71538	he	1709	" Should I then be alive , I will remind you here , on this very bench of what I have just said . In fact , I will bet you a wager that I shall do so . "
71581	71586	71587	71587	I	0	" Say no more , "
71591	71642	71587	71587	I	0	" And to show you that I have not wholly forgotten the past , may I enquire where Mlle . Polina is ? If it was not you who bailed me out of prison , it must have been she . Yet never have I heard a word concerning her . "
71643	71680	71681	71681	Astley	54	" No , I do not think it was she . At the present moment she is in Switzerland , and you will do me a favour by ceasing to ask me these questions about her . "
71695	71707	71708	71708	I	0	" Which means that she has dealt you a serious wound ? "
71716	71721	71722	71722	he	54	" Mlle . Polina , "
71725	71772	71722	71722	he	54	" Is the best of all possible living beings ; but , I repeat , that I shall thank you to cease questioning me about her . You never really knew her , and her name on your lips is an offence to my moral feeling . "
71773	71855	71587	71587	I	0	" Indeed ? On what subject , then , have I a better right to speak to you than on this ? With it are bound up all your recollections and mine . However , do not be alarmed : I have no wish to probe too far into your private , your secret affairs . My interest in Mlle . Polina does not extend beyond her outward circumstances and surroundings . About them you could tell me in two words . "
71856	72038	71722	71722	he	54	" Well , on condition that the matter shall end there , I will tell you that for a long time Mlle . Polina was ill , and still is so . My mother and sister entertained her for a while at their home in the north of England , and thereafter Mlle . Polina s grandmother ( you remember the mad old woman ? ) died , and left Mlle . Polina a personal legacy of seven thousand pounds sterling . That was about six months ago , and now Mlle . is travelling with my sister s family my sister having since married . Mlle . s little brother and sister also benefited by the Grandmother s will , and are now being educated in London . As for the General , he died in Paris last month , of a stroke . Mlle . Blanche did well by him , for she succeeded in having transferred to herself all that he received from the Grandmother . That , I think , concludes all that I have to tell . "
72039	72051	71587	71587	I	0	" And De Griers ? Is he too travelling in Switzerland ? "
72052	72090	71722	71722	he	54	" No ; nor do I know where he is . Also I warn you once more that you had better avoid such hints and ignoble suppositions ; otherwise you will assuredly have to reckon with me . "
72091	72101	71587	71587	I	0	" What ? In spite of our old friendship ? "
72102	72112	71722	71722	he	54	" Yes , in spite of our old friendship . "
72113	72176	71587	71587	I	0	" Then I beg your pardon a thousand times , Mr. Astley . I meant nothing offensive to Mlle . Polina , for I have nothing of which to accuse her . Moreover , the question of there being anything between this Frenchman and this Russian lady is not one which you and I need discuss , nor even attempt to understand . "
72177	72180	72182	72182	Astley	54	" If , "
72184	72234	72182	72182	Astley	54	" you do not care to hear their names coupled together , may I ask you what you mean by the expressions this Frenchman , this Russian lady , and there being anything between them ? Why do you call them so particularly a Frenchman and a Russian lady ? "
72235	72939	71587	71587	I	0	" Ah , I see you are interested , Mr. Astley . But it is a long , long story , and calls for a lengthy preface . At the same time , the question is an important one , however ridiculous it may seem at the first glance . A Frenchman , Mr. Astley , is merely a fine figure of a man . With this you , as a Britisher , may not agree . With it I also , as a Russian , may not agree out of envy . Yet possibly our good ladies are of another opinion . For instance , one may look upon Racine as a broken - down , hobbledehoy , perfumed individual one may even be unable to read him ; and I too may think him the same , as well as , in some respects , a subject for ridicule . Yet about him , Mr. Astley , there is a certain charm , and , above all things , he is a great poet though one might like to deny it . Yes , the Frenchman , the Parisian , as a national figure , was in process of developing into a figure of elegance before we Russians had even ceased to be bears . The Revolution bequeathed to the French nobility its heritage , and now every whipper - snapper of a Parisian may possess manners , methods of expression , and even thoughts that are above reproach in form , while all the time he himself may share in that form neither in initiative nor in intellect nor in soul his manners , and the rest , having come to him through inheritance . Yes , taken by himself , the Frenchman is frequently a fool of fools and a villain of villains . Per contra , there is no one in the world more worthy of confidence and respect than this young Russian lady . De Griers might so mask his face and play a part as easily to overcome her heart , for he has an imposing figure , Mr. Astley , and this young lady might easily take that figure for his real self for the natural form of his heart and soul instead of the mere cloak with which heredity has dowered him . And even though it may offend you , I feel bound to say that the majority also of English people are uncouth and unrefined , whereas we Russian folk can recognise beauty wherever we see it , and are always eager to cultivate the same . But to distinguish beauty of soul and personal originality there is needed far more independence and freedom than is possessed by our women , especially by our younger ladies . At all events , they need more _ experience _ . For instance , this Mlle . Polina pardon me , but the name has passed my lips , and I can not well recall it is taking a very long time to make up her mind to prefer you to Monsieur de Griers . She may respect you , she may become your friend , she may open out her heart to you ; yet over that heart there will be reigning that loathsome villain , that mean and petty usurer , De Griers . This will be due to obstinacy and self - love to the fact that De Griers once appeared to her in the transfigured guise of a marquis , of a disenchanted and ruined liberal who was doing his best to help her family and the frivolous old General ; and , although these transactions of his have since been exposed , you will find that the exposure has made no impression upon her mind . Only give her the De Griers of former days , and she will ask of you no more . The more she may detest the present De Griers , the more will she lament the De Griers of the past even though the latter never existed but in her own imagination . You are a sugar refiner , Mr. Astley , are you not ? "
72940	72955	73144	73144	his	1710	" Yes , I belong to the well - known firm of Lovell and Co. "
72956	73046	71587	71587	I	0	" Then see here . On the one hand , you are a sugar refiner , while , on the other hand , you are an Apollo Belvedere . But the two characters do not mix with one another . I , again , am not even a sugar refiner ; I am a mere roulette gambler who has also served as a lacquey . Of this fact Mlle . Polina is probably well aware , since she appears to have an excellent force of police at her disposal . "
73047	73058	73060	73060	Astley	54	" You are saying this because you are feeling bitter , "
73065	73077	73060	73060	Astley	54	" Yet there is not the least originality in your words . "
73078	73121	71587	71587	I	0	" I agree . But therein lies the horror of it all that , how trepidation , playing ever mean and farcical my accusations may be , they are none the less _ true _ . But I am only wasting words . "
73122	73135	73060	73060	Astley	54	" Yes , you are , for you are only talking nonsense ! "
73149	73154	73155	73155	he	1710	" Are you aware , "
73158	73222	73155	73155	he	1710	" that wretched , ignoble , petty , unfortunate man though you are , it was at _ her _ request I came to Homburg , in order to see you , and to have a long , serious talk with you , and to report to her your feelings and thoughts and hopes yes , and your recollections of her , too ? "
73223	73231	73232	73232	I	0	" Indeed ? Is that really so ? "
73249	73255	73257	73257	Astley	54	" Yes , poor unfortunate , "
73259	73530	73257	73257	Astley	54	" She _ did _ love you ; and I may tell you this now for the reason that now you are utterly lost . Even if I were also to tell you that she still loves you , you would none the less have to remain where you are . Yes , you have ruined yourself beyond redemption . Once upon a time you had a certain amount of talent , and you were of a lively disposition , and your good looks were not to be despised . You might even have been useful to your country , which needs men like you . Yet you remained here , and your life is now over . I am not blaming you for this in my view all Russians resemble you , or are inclined to do so . If it is not roulette , then it is something else . The exceptions are very rare . Nor are you the first to learn what a taskmaster is yours . For roulette is not exclusively a Russian game . Hitherto , you have honourably preferred to serve as a lacquey rather than to act as a thief ; but what the future may have in store for you I tremble to think . Now good - bye . You are in want of money , I suppose ? Then take these ten louis d or . More I shall not give you , for you would only gamble it away . Take care of these coins , and farewell . Once more , _ take care _ of them . "
73531	73544	73720	73720	he	1713	" No , Mr. Astley . After all that has been said I "
73545	73553	73555	73556	my friend	617	" _ Take care _ of them ! "
73558	73684	73555	73556	my friend	617	" I am certain you are still a gentleman , and therefore I give you the money as one gentleman may give money to another . Also , if I could be certain that you would leave both Homburg and the gaming - tables , and return to your own country , I would give you a thousand pounds down to start life afresh ; but , I give you ten louis d or instead of a thousand pounds for the reason that at the present time a thousand pounds and ten louis d or will be all the same to you you will lose the one as readily as you will the other . Take the money , therefore , and good - bye . "
73685	73704	73720	73720	he	1713	" Yes , I _ will _ take it if at the same time you will embrace me . "
73705	73709	73555	73556	my friend	617	" With pleasure . "
74040	74050	74051	74051	I	0	" Perhaps I shall need it for a meal , "
