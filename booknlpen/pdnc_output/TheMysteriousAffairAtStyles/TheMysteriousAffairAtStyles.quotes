255	270	271	271	he	32	" The mater will be delighted to see you again after all those years , "
274	280	281	281	I	0	" Your mother keeps well ? "
284	299	271	271	he	32	" Oh , yes . I suppose you know that she has married again ? "
684	690	691	691	he	32	" Rotten little bounder too ! "
695	719	691	691	he	32	" I can tell you , Hastings , it 's making life jolly difficult for us . As for Evie you remember Evie ? "
720	723	654	654	she	33	" No . "
724	769	691	691	he	32	" Oh , I suppose she was after your time . She 's the mater 's factotum , companion , Jack of all trades ! A great sport old Evie ! Not precisely young and beautiful , but as game as they make them . "
770	777	654	654	she	33	" You were going to say ? "
778	870	691	691	he	32	" Oh , this fellow ! He turned up from nowhere , on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of Evie 's , though she did n't seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship . The fellow is an absolute outsider , anyone can see that . He 's got a great black beard , and wears patent leather boots in all weathers ! But the mater cottoned to him at once , took him on as secretary you know how she 's always running a hundred societies ? "
874	963	871	871	I	0	" Well , of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands . No doubt the fellow was very useful to her . But you could have knocked us all down with a feather when , three months ago , she suddenly announced that she and Alfred were engaged ! The fellow must be at least twenty years younger than she is ! It 's simply bare - faced fortune hunting ; but there you are she is her own mistress , and she 's married him . "
964	975	1028	1029	John Cavendish	32	" It must be a difficult situation for you all . "
976	983	871	871	I	0	" Difficult ! It 's damnable ! "
1044	1057	1058	1058	he	32	" Got a drop or two of petrol still , you see , "
1061	1070	1058	1058	he	32	" Mainly owing to the mater 's activities . "
1175	1190	1172	1172	John	32	" I 'm afraid you 'll find it very quiet down here , Hastings . "
1191	1203	1172	1172	John	32	" My dear fellow , that 's just what I want . "
1204	1284	1172	1172	John	32	" Oh , it 's pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life . I drill with the volunteers twice a week , and lend a hand at the farms . My wife works regularly on the land ' . She is up at five every morning to milk , and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime . It 's a jolly good life taking it all round if it were n't for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp ! "
1297	1321	1285	1285	He	32	" I wonder if we 've time to pick up Cynthia . No , she 'll have started from the hospital by now . "
1322	1331	1427	1441	A lady in a stout tweed skirt , who was bending over a flower bed	186	" Cynthia ! That 's not your wife ? "
1332	1408	1285	1285	He	32	" No , Cynthia is a prot g e of my mother 's , the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers , who married a rascally solicitor . He came a cropper , and the girl was left an orphan and penniless . My mother came to the rescue , and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now . She works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster , seven miles away . "
1449	1465	1444	1444	herself	186	" Hullo , Evie , here 's our wounded hero ! Mr. Hastings Miss Howard . "
1549	1572	1693	1693	her	186	" Weeds grow like house afire . Ca n't keep even with 'em . Shall press you in . Better be careful . "
1573	1588	1589	1589	I	0	" I 'm sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful , "
1592	1607	1693	1693	her	186	" Do n't say it . Never does . Wish you had n't later . "
1608	1616	1618	1618	John	32	" You 're a cynic , Evie , "
1622	1633	1618	1618	John	32	" Where 's tea to - day inside or out ? "
1634	1649	1693	1693	her	186	" Out . Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house . "
1650	1682	1618	1618	John	32	" Come on then , you 've done enough gardening for to - day . The labourer is worthy of his hire ' , you know . Come and be refreshed . "
1683	1686	1688	1689	Miss Howard	40	" Well , "
1697	1706	1688	1689	Miss Howard	40	" I 'm inclined to agree with you . "
1746	1752	1754	1754	John	32	" My wife , Hastings , "
1983	2052	2058	2059	a man	196	" Then you 'll write to the Princess after tea , Alfred ? I 'll write to Lady Tadminster for the second day , myself . Or shall we wait until we hear from the Princess ? In case of a refusal , Lady Tadminster might open it the first day , and Mrs. Crosbie the second . Then there 's the Duchess about the school f te . "
2072	2092	2065	2066	Mrs. Inglethorp	44	" Yes , certainly . After tea will do quite well . You are so thoughtful , Alfred dear . "
2148	2179	2141	2142	Mrs. Inglethorp	44	" Why , if it is n't too delightful to see you again , Mr. Hastings , after all these years . Alfred , darling , Mr. Hastings my husband . "
2186	2189	2180	2180	I	0	" Alfred darling "
2280	2289	2270	2270	He	32	" This is a pleasure , Mr. Hastings . "
2297	2310	2270	2270	He	32	" Emily dearest , I think that cushion is a little damp . "
2504	2514	2500	2500	his	203	" Is soldiering your regular profession , Mr. Hastings ? "
2515	2527	2495	2496	her husband	203	" No , before the war I was in Lloyd 's . "
2528	2539	2500	2500	his	203	" And you will return there after it is over ? "
2540	2551	2495	2496	her husband	203	" Perhaps . Either that or a fresh start altogether . "
2557	2575	2495	2496	her husband	203	" What would you really choose as a profession , if you could just consult your inclination ? "
2576	2582	2500	2500	his	203	" Well , that depends . "
2583	2588	2589	2589	she	41	" No secret hobby ? "
2592	2607	2589	2589	she	41	" Tell me you 're drawn to something ? Everyone is usually something absurd . "
2608	2615	2500	2500	his	203	" You 'll laugh at me . "
2619	2622	2500	2500	his	203	" Perhaps . "
2623	2638	2500	2500	his	203	" Well , I 've always had a secret hankering to be a detective ! "
2639	2650	2500	2500	his	203	" The real thing Scotland Yard ? Or Sherlock Holmes ? "
2651	2745	2500	2500	his	203	" Oh , Sherlock Holmes by all means . But really , seriously , I am awfully drawn to it . I came across a man in Belgium once , a very famous detective , and he quite inflamed me . He was a marvellous little fellow . He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method . My system is based on his though of course I have progressed rather further . He was a funny little man , a great dandy , but wonderfully clever . "
2746	2754	2756	2757	Miss Howard	40	" Like a good detective story myself , "
2759	2784	2756	2757	Miss Howard	40	" Lots of nonsense written , though . Criminal discovered in last chapter . Everyone dumbfounded . Real crime you 'd know at once . "
2785	2796	2797	2797	I	0	" There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes , "
2800	2830	2756	2757	Miss Howard	40	" Do n't mean the police , but the people that are right in it . The family . You could n't really hoodwink them . They 'd know . "
2831	2834	2835	2835	I	0	" Then , "
2841	2869	2835	2835	I	0	" you think that if you were mixed up in a crime , say a murder , you 'd be able to spot the murderer right off ? "
2870	2910	2756	2757	Miss Howard	40	" Of course I should . Might n't be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers . But I 'm certain I 'd know . I 'd feel it in my fingertips if he came near me . "
2911	2919	2920	2920	I	0	" It might be a she ' , "
2923	2940	2756	2757	Miss Howard	40	" Might . But murder 's a violent crime . Associate it more with a man . "
2941	2949	2950	2951	Mrs. Cavendish	33	" Not in a case of poisoning . "
2958	2991	2950	2951	Mrs. Cavendish	33	" Dr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that , owing to the general ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession , there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected . "
2992	3002	3004	3005	Mrs. Inglethorp	44	" Why , Mary , what a gruesome conversation ! "
3007	3028	3004	3005	Mrs. Inglethorp	44	" It makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave . Oh , there 's Cynthia ! "
3041	3060	3105	3105	she	48	" Why , Cynthia , you are late to - day . This is Mr. Hastings Miss Murdoch . "
3150	3167	3144	3144	she	48	" Sit down here on the grass , do . It 's ever so much nicer . "
3173	3186	3144	3144	she	48	" You work at Tadminster , do n't you , Miss Murdoch ? "
3190	3195	3144	3144	she	48	" For my sins . "
3196	3204	3205	3205	I	0	" Do they bully you , then ? "
3210	3218	3220	3220	Cynthia	38	" I should like to see them ! "
3224	3234	3235	3235	I	0	" I have got a cousin who is nursing , "
3238	3247	3235	3235	I	0	" And she is terrified of Sisters ' . "
3248	3294	3309	3309	Cynthia	38	" I do n't wonder . Sisters _ are _ , you know , Mr. Hastings . They simp - ly _ are _ ! You 've no idea ! But I 'm not a nurse , thank heaven , I work in the dispensary . "
3295	3303	3304	3304	I	0	" How many people do you poison ? "
3313	3318	3319	3319	she	38	" Oh , hundreds ! "
3322	3325	3327	3328	Mrs. Inglethorp	44	" Cynthia , "
3330	3343	3327	3328	Mrs. Inglethorp	44	" do you think you could write a few notes for me ? "
3344	3350	3359	3359	her	38	" Certainly , Aunt Emily . "
3399	3485	3393	3394	My hostess	194	" John will show you your room . Supper is at half - past seven . We have given up late dinner for some time now . Lady Tadminster , our Member 's wife she was the late Lord Abbotsbury 's daughter does the same . She agrees with me that one must set an example of economy . We are quite a war household ; nothing is wasted here every scrap of waste paper , even , is saved and sent away in sacks . "
3566	3568	3563	3564	Mrs. Inglethorp	44	" Cynthia "
3825	3853	3818	3818	he	32	" Look here , Mary , there 's the deuce of a mess . Evie 's had a row with Alfred Inglethorp , and she 's off . "
3854	3859	3818	3818	he	32	" Evie ? Off ? "
3864	3883	3818	3818	he	32	" Yes ; you see she went to the mater , and Oh , here 's Evie herself . "
3916	3921	3922	3922	she	225	" At any rate , "
3926	3933	3922	3922	she	225	" I 've spoken my mind ! "
3934	3939	3941	3942	Mrs. Cavendish	33	" My dear Evelyn , "
3944	3951	3941	3942	Mrs. Cavendish	33	" this ca n't be true ! "
3957	4153	3952	3953	Miss Howard	40	" True enough ! Afraid I said some things to Emily she wo n't forget or forgive in a hurry . Do n't mind if they 've only sunk in a bit . Probably water off a duck 's back , though . I said right out : You 're an old woman , Emily , and there 's no fool like an old fool . The man 's twenty years younger than you , and do n't you fool yourself as to what he married you for . Money ! Well , do n't let him have too much of it . Farmer Raikes has got a very pretty young wife . Just ask your Alfred how much time he spends over there . ' She was very angry . Natural ! I went on , I 'm going to warn you , whether you like it or not . That man would as soon murder you in your bed as look at you . He 's a bad lot . You can say what you like to me , but remember what I 've told you . He 's a bad lot ! ' "
4154	4160	4247	4248	His wife	149	" What did she say ? "
4169	4206	4247	4248	His wife	149	" Darling Alfred ' dearest Alfred ' wicked calumnies ' wicked lies ' wicked woman ' to accuse her dear husband ! ' The sooner I left her house the better . So I 'm off . "
4207	4212	4250	4250	him	32	" But not now ? "
4213	4217	4247	4248	His wife	149	" This minute ! "
4282	4295	4265	4265	she	149	" Mr. Hastings , you 're honest . I can trust you ? "
4318	4394	4312	4312	her	149	" Look after her , Mr. Hastings . My poor Emily . They 're a lot of sharks all of them . Oh , I know what I 'm talking about . There is n't one of them that 's not hard up and trying to get money out of her . I 've protected her as much as I could . Now I 'm out of the way , they 'll impose upon her . "
4395	4402	4403	4403	I	0	" Of course , Miss Howard , "
4406	4424	4403	4403	I	0	" I 'll do everything I can , but I 'm sure you 're excited and overwrought . "
4434	4471	4431	4431	her	231	" Young man , trust me . I 've lived in the world rather longer than you have . All I ask you is to keep your eyes open . You 'll see what I mean . "
4519	4532	4506	4506	she	231	" Above all , Mr. Hastings , watch that devil her husband ! "
4615	4620	4621	4621	I	0	" Who is that ? "
4632	4638	4640	4640	John	32	" That 's Dr. Bauerstein , "
4643	4650	4607	4607	she	231	" And who is Dr. Bauerstein ? "
4651	4691	4629	4630	the man	1112	" He 's staying in the village doing a rest cure , after a bad nervous breakdown . He 's a London specialist ; a very clever man one of the greatest living experts on poisons , I believe . "
4692	4703	4706	4706	Cynthia	48	" And he 's a great friend of Mary 's , "
4719	4754	4711	4712	John Cavendish	32	" Come for a stroll , Hastings . This has been a most rotten business . She always had a rough tongue , but there is no stauncher friend in England than Evelyn Howard . "
4811	4818	4819	4819	I	0	" That 's a pretty girl , "
4828	4834	4819	4819	I	0	" That is Mrs. Raikes . "
4835	4841	4795	4806	a pretty young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction	245	" The one that Miss Howard "
4842	4845	4847	4847	John	32	" Exactly , "
4896	4905	4906	4906	I	0	" Styles is really a glorious old place , "
4916	4963	4906	4906	I	0	" Yes , it 's a fine property . It 'll be mine some day should be mine now by rights , if my father had only made a decent will . And then I should n't be so damned hard up as I am now . "
4964	4971	4906	4906	I	0	" Hard up , are you ? "
4972	4994	4906	4906	I	0	" My dear Hastings , I do n't mind telling you that I 'm at my wits ' end for money . "
4995	5003	4906	4906	I	0	" Could n't your brother help you ? "
5004	5059	5060	5060	he	248	" Lawrence ? He 's gone through every penny he ever had , publishing rotten verses in fancy bindings . No , we 're an impecunious lot . My mother 's always been awfully good to us , I must say . That is , up to now . Since her marriage , of course "
5626	5656	5606	5606	she	44	" Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston . Lady Tadminster 's sister , you know . The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror one of our oldest families . "
5805	5808	5801	5801	Cynthia	48	" Nibs . "
5809	5816	5817	5817	I	0	" What a lot of bottles ! "
5829	5840	5817	5817	I	0	" Do you really know what 's in them all ? "
5841	5846	5848	5848	Cynthia	48	" Say something original , "
5850	5908	5848	5848	Cynthia	48	" Every single person who comes up here says that . We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on the first individual who does _ not _ say : What a lot of bottles ! ' And I know the next thing you 're going to say is : How many people have you poisoned ? ' "
5916	5976	5817	5817	I	0	" If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by mistake , you would n't joke about it . Come on , let 's have tea . We 've got all sorts of secret stores in that cupboard . No , Lawrence that 's the poison cupboard . The big cupboard that 's right . "
6026	6030	6032	6032	Cynthia	48	" Come in , "
6068	6078	6052	6052	she	269	" _ I_'m not really here to - day . "
6093	6103	6052	6052	she	269	" This should have been sent up this morning . "
6104	6113	6052	6052	she	269	" Sister is very sorry . She forgot . "
6114	6124	6052	6052	she	269	" Sister should read the rules outside the door . "
6152	6154	6052	6052	she	269	" Sister "
6156	6169	6171	6171	Cynthia	48	" So now it ca n't be done until to - morrow , "
6173	6189	6052	6052	she	269	" Do n't you think you could possibly let us have it to - night ? "
6190	6193	6195	6195	Cynthia	48	" Well , "
6198	6214	6195	6195	Cynthia	48	" we are very busy , but if we have time it shall be done . "
6247	6253	6281	6281	they	274	" Discipline must be maintained ? "
6254	6273	6281	6281	they	274	" Exactly . Come out on our little balcony . You can see all the outside wards there . "
6319	6327	6313	6313	she	48	" Nothing more to do , Nibs ? "
6328	6331	6313	6313	she	48	" No . "
6332	6344	6313	6313	she	48	" All right . Then we can lock up and go . "
6532	6539	6540	6540	he	285	" _ Mon ami _ Hastings ! "
6543	6553	6540	6540	he	285	" It is indeed _ mon ami _ Hastings ! "
6554	6557	6558	6558	I	0	" Poirot ! "
6569	6599	6540	6540	he	285	" This is a very pleasant meeting for me , Miss Cynthia . This is my old friend , Monsieur Poirot , whom I have not seen for years . "
6600	6608	6610	6610	Cynthia	62	" Oh , we know Monsieur Poirot , "
6613	6626	6610	6610	Cynthia	62	" But I had no idea he was a friend of yours . "
6627	6632	6634	6634	Poirot	31	" Yes , indeed , "
6637	6658	6540	6540	he	285	" I know Mademoiselle Cynthia . It is by the charity of that good Mrs. Inglethorp that I am here . "
6668	6704	6540	6540	he	285	" Yes , my friend , she had kindly extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who , alas , are refugees from their native land . We Belgians will always remember her with gratitude . "
6894	6902	6904	6904	Cynthia	38	" He 's a dear little man , "
6906	6915	6904	6904	Cynthia	38	" I 'd no idea you knew him . "
6916	6925	6926	6926	I	0	" You 've been entertaining a celebrity unawares , "
6981	6988	6989	6989	she	44	" Oh , it 's you , "
6992	7002	7004	7004	Cynthia	38	" Is there anything the matter , Aunt Emily ? "
7006	7010	7012	7013	Mrs. Inglethorp	44	" Certainly not , "
7016	7022	7039	7039	she	38	" What should there be ? "
7051	7056	7057	7059	The old servant	302	" Yes , m'm . "
7066	7087	7057	7059	The old servant	302	" Do n't you think , m'm , you 'd better get to bed ? You 're looking very tired . "
7088	7125	7057	7059	The old servant	302	" Perhaps you 're right , Dorcas yes no not now . I 've some letters I must finish by post - time . Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told you ? "
7126	7131	7057	7059	The old servant	302	" Yes , m'm . "
7132	7143	7057	7059	The old servant	302	" Then I 'll go to bed directly after supper . "
7157	7167	7168	7168	she	38	" Goodness gracious ! I wonder what 's up ? "
7246	7255	7256	7256	I	0	" Had a good walk with Dr. Bauerstein ? "
7268	7274	7275	7275	she	33	" I did n't go , "
7279	7285	7275	7275	she	33	" Where is Mrs. Inglethorp ? "
7286	7291	7301	7301	she	33	" In the boudoir . "
7382	7392	7368	7369	Mary Cavendish	41	" Then you wo n't show it to me ? "
7399	7413	7368	7369	Mary Cavendish	41	" My dear Mary , it has nothing to do with that matter . "
7414	7421	7368	7369	Mary Cavendish	41	" Then show it to me . "
7422	7442	7368	7369	Mary Cavendish	41	" I tell you it is not what you imagine . It does not concern you in the least . "
7454	7467	7445	7446	Mary Cavendish	41	" Of course , I might have known you would shield him . "
7480	7501	7445	7446	Mary Cavendish	41	" I say ! There 's been the most awful row ! I 've got it all out of Dorcas . "
7502	7509	7368	7369	Mary Cavendish	41	" What kind of a row ? "
7510	7530	7445	7446	Mary Cavendish	41	" Between Aunt Emily and _ him _ . I do hope she 's found him out at last ! "
7531	7538	7368	7369	Mary Cavendish	41	" Was Dorcas there , then ? "
7539	7573	7445	7446	Mary Cavendish	41	" Of course not . She happened to be near the door ' . It was a real old bust - up . I do wish I knew what it was all about . "
7608	7624	7598	7598	Cynthia	38	" Aunt Emily will send him away , and will never speak to him again . "
7790	7799	7800	7800	she	44	" Send my coffee in here , Mary , "
7803	7814	7800	7800	she	44	" I 've just five minutes to catch the post . "
7843	7858	7859	7859	she	41	" Do you young people want lights , or do you enjoy the twilight ? "
7862	7879	7859	7859	she	41	" Will you take Mrs. Inglethorp her coffee , Cynthia ? I will pour it out . "
7880	7887	7889	7889	Inglethorp	44	" Do not trouble , Mary , "
7891	7899	7900	7900	He	316	" I will take it to Emily . "
7956	7963	7964	7964	she	41	" It 's almost too hot , "
7967	7974	7964	7964	she	41	" We shall have a thunderstorm . "
8007	8011	8013	8013	Cynthia	38	" Dr. Bauerstein ! "
8015	8023	8013	8013	Cynthia	38	" What a funny time to come . "
8094	8103	8105	8106	Mrs. Cavendish	33	" What have you been doing , doctor ? "
8108	8115	8117	8118	the doctor	319	" I must make my apologies , "
8120	8135	8117	8118	the doctor	319	" I did not really mean to come in , but Mr. Inglethorp insisted . "
8136	8147	8149	8149	John	32	" Well , Bauerstein , you are in a plight , "
8157	8172	8149	8149	John	32	" Have some coffee , and tell us what you have been up to . "
8173	8180	8117	8118	the doctor	319	" Thank you , I will . "
8224	8232	8233	8233	he	32	" The sun soon dried me off , "
8236	8247	8233	8233	he	32	" but I 'm afraid my appearance is very disreputable . "
8267	8287	8262	8263	the girl	1055	" Just carry up my despatch - case , will you , dear ? I 'm going to bed . "
8374	8385	8387	8388	Mr. Inglethorp	37	" I 'll walk down to the village with you , "
8390	8401	8402	8402	He	37	" I must see our agent over those estate accounts . "
8407	8422	8402	8402	He	37	" No one need sit up . I will take the latch - key . "
8523	8529	8530	8530	I	0	" What 's the matter ? "
8546	8573	8530	8530	I	0	" We are afraid my mother is very ill . She seems to be having some kind of fit . Unfortunately she has locked herself in . "
8574	8581	8530	8530	I	0	" I 'll come at once . "
8643	8653	8637	8637	Lawrence	52	" What do you think we had better do ? "
8721	8732	8734	8734	Dorcas	64	" Try going through Mr. Inglethorp 's room , sir , "
8736	8743	8734	8734	Dorcas	64	" Oh , the poor mistress ! "
8841	8848	8850	8850	Dorcas	64	" Oh , dear , sir , "
8856	8863	8853	8853	her	64	" what ever shall we do ? "
8864	8938	8977	8978	Mary Cavendish	41	" We must try and break the door in , I suppose . It 'll be a tough job , though . Here , let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him to go for Dr. Wilkins at once . Now then , we 'll have a try at the door . Half a moment , though , is n't there a door into Miss Cynthia 's rooms ? "
8939	8956	8853	8853	her	64	" Yes , sir , but that 's always bolted . It 's never been undone . "
8957	8965	8977	8978	Mary Cavendish	41	" Well , we might just see . "
9008	9040	9004	9004	he	347	" No good . That 's bolted too . We must break in the door . I think this one is a shade less solid than the one in the passage . "
9366	9379	9357	9357	She	44	" Better now very sudden stupid of me to lock myself in . "
9432	9439	9441	9442	Mrs. Cavendish	33	" Poor Cynthia is quite frightened , "
9655	9658	9660	9660	she	44	" Alfred Alfred "
9867	9876	9878	9879	Dr. Wilkins	66	" Ve ry sad . Ve ry sad , "
9881	9943	9878	9879	Dr. Wilkins	66	" Poor dear lady . Always did far too much far too much against my advice . I warned her . Her heart was far from strong . Take it easy , ' I said to her , Take it easy ' . But no her zeal for good works was too great . Nature rebelled . Na ture re belled . "
9969	10001	9960	9960	his	46	" The convulsions were of a peculiar violence , Dr. Wilkins . I am sorry you were not here in time to witness them . They were quite tetanic in character . "
10002	10005	10007	10008	Dr. Wilkins	66	" Ah ! "
10011	10022	10024	10025	Dr. Bauerstein	46	" I should like to speak to you in private , "
10032	10038	10027	10027	He	46	" You do not object ? "
10039	10043	10053	10055	the two doctors	381	" Certainly not . "
10115	10128	10106	10107	Mary Cavendish	41	" What is it ? Why did Dr. Bauerstein seem so peculiar ? "
10134	10142	10106	10107	Mary Cavendish	41	" Do you know what I think ? "
10143	10146	10132	10132	her	41	" What ? "
10147	10150	10151	10151	I	0	" Listen ! "
10170	10186	10162	10162	I	0	" I believe she has been poisoned ! I 'm certain Dr. Bauerstein suspects it . "
10187	10192	10193	10193	She	41	" _ What ? _ "
10221	10230	10217	10217	she	41	" No , no not that not that ! "
10270	10300	10264	10264	She	41	" No , no leave me . I 'd rather be alone . Let me just be quiet for a minute or two . Go down to the others . "
10344	10350	10336	10336	I	0	" Where is Mr. Inglethorp ? "
10356	10364	10353	10353	his	32	" He 's not in the house . "
10470	10485	10464	10464	He	66	" Mr. Cavendish , I should like your consent to a post - mortem . "
10486	10491	10493	10493	John	32	" Is that necessary ? "
10504	10507	10509	10510	Dr. Bauerstein	46	" Absolutely , "
10512	10518	10464	10464	He	66	" You mean by that ? "
10519	10535	10464	10464	He	66	" That neither Dr. Wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate under the circumstances . "
10541	10554	10464	10464	He	66	" In that case , I have no alternative but to agree . "
10555	10559	10561	10562	Dr. Wilkins	66	" Thank you , "
10565	10583	10585	10585	he	66	" We propose that it should take place to - morrow night or rather to - night . "
10591	10620	10585	10585	he	66	" Under the circumstances , I am afraid an inquest can hardly be avoided these formalities are necessary , but I beg that you wo n't distress yourselves . "
10643	10673	10674	10675	The doctors	388	" These are the keys of the two rooms . I have locked them and , in my opinion , they would be better kept locked for the present . "
10799	10802	10803	10803	I	0	" John , "
10806	10815	10803	10803	I	0	" I am going to ask you something . "
10816	10819	10780	10781	an ally	393	" Well ? "
10820	10844	10803	10803	I	0	" You remember my speaking of my friend Poirot ? The Belgian who is here ? He has been a most famous detective . "
10845	10848	10780	10781	an ally	393	" Yes . "
10849	10864	10803	10803	I	0	" I want you to let me call him in to investigate this matter . "
10865	10875	10780	10781	an ally	393	" What now ? Before the post - mortem ? "
10876	10891	10803	10803	I	0	" Yes , time is an advantage if if there has been foul play . "
10892	10895	10897	10897	Lawrence	52	" Rubbish ! "
10900	10962	10897	10897	Lawrence	52	" In my opinion the whole thing is a mare 's nest of Bauerstein 's ! Wilkins had n't an idea of such a thing , until Bauerstein put it into his head . But , like all specialists , Bauerstein 's got a bee in his bonnet . Poisons are his hobby , so of course he sees them everywhere . "
10985	10996	10997	10997	he	32	" I ca n't feel as you do , Lawrence , "
11002	11030	10997	10997	he	32	" I 'm inclined to give Hastings a free hand , though I should prefer to wait a bit . We do n't want any unnecessary scandal . "
11031	11036	11037	11037	I	0	" No , no , "
11041	11055	11037	11037	I	0	" you need have no fear of that . Poirot is discretion itself . "
11056	11100	11104	11104	my	0	" Very well , then , have it your own way . I leave it in your hands . Though , if it is as we suspect , it seems a clear enough case . God forgive me if I am wronging him ! "
11252	11270	11223	11226	a man approaching me	402	" My God ! This is terrible ! My poor wife ! I have only just heard . "
11271	11277	11278	11278	I	0	" Where have you been ? "
11281	11328	11223	11226	a man approaching me	402	" Denby kept me late last night . It was one o'clock before we 'd finished . Then I found that I 'd forgotten the latch - key after all . I did n't want to arouse the household , so Denby gave me a bed . "
11329	11337	11338	11338	I	0	" How did you hear the news ? "
11341	11372	11385	11386	the man	1112	" Wilkins knocked Denby up to tell him . My poor Emily ! She was so self - sacrificing such a noble character . She over - taxed her strength . "
11389	11395	11396	11396	I	0	" I must hurry on , "
11480	11504	11518	11518	him	1112	" Wait , my friend , I will let you in , and you shall recount to me the affair whilst I dress . "
11661	11736	11737	11737	he	63	" The mind is confused ? Is it not so ? Take time , _ mon ami _ . You are agitated ; you are excited it is but natural . Presently , when we are calmer , we will arrange the facts , neatly , each in his proper place . We will examine and reject . Those of importance we will put on one side ; those of no importance , pouf ! "
11750	11755	11737	11737	he	63	" blow them away ! "
11756	11763	11764	11764	I	0	" That 's all very well , "
11767	11792	11764	11764	I	0	" but how are you going to decide what is important , and what is n't ? That always seems the difficulty to me . "
11809	11898	11899	11899	He	63	" Not so . _ Voyons ! _ One fact leads to another so we continue . Does the next fit in with that ? _ A merveille ! _ Good ! We can proceed . This next little fact no ! Ah , that is curious ! There is something missing a link in the chain that is not there . We examine . We search . And that little curious fact , that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally , we put it here ! "
11908	11917	11899	11899	He	63	" It is significant ! It is tremendous ! "
11918	11921	11928	11928	his	63	" Y es "
11922	11925	11926	11926	Poirot	63	" Ah ! "
11940	11978	11935	11935	I	0	" Beware ! Peril to the detective who says : It is so small it does not matter . It will not agree . I will forget it . ' That way lies confusion ! Everything matters . "
11979	12011	11928	11928	his	63	" I know . You always told me that . That 's why I have gone into all the details of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not . "
12012	12077	11935	11935	I	0	" And I am pleased with you . You have a good memory , and you have given me the facts faithfully . Of the order in which you present them , I say nothing truly , it is deplorable ! But I make allowances you are upset . To that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of paramount importance . "
12078	12083	12084	12084	I	0	" What is that ? "
12087	12101	12105	12105	him	410	" You have not told me if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night . "
12139	12145	12146	12146	I	0	" I do n't remember , "
12149	12158	12146	12146	I	0	" And , anyway , I do n't see "
12159	12173	12105	12105	him	410	" You do not see ? But it is of the first importance . "
12174	12181	12182	12182	I	0	" I ca n't see why , "
12188	12220	12182	12182	I	0	" As far as I can remember , she did n't eat much . She was obviously upset , and it had taken her appetite away . That was only natural . "
12221	12224	12226	12226	Poirot	63	" Yes , "
12229	12235	12226	12226	Poirot	63	" it was only natural . "
12255	12300	12306	12306	he	63	" Now I am ready . We will proceed to the ch teau , and study matters on the spot . Excuse me , _ mon ami _ , you dressed in haste , and your tie is on one side . Permit me . "
12310	12323	12389	12389	he	63	" _ a y est ! _ Now , shall we start ? "
12360	12382	12389	12389	he	63	" So beautiful , so beautiful , and yet , the poor family , plunged in sorrow , prostrated with grief . "
12475	12482	12483	12483	he	63	" No , you are right , "
12486	12524	12483	12483	he	63	" it is not as though there was a blood tie . She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes , but she was not their own mother . Blood tells always remember that blood tells . "
12525	12528	12529	12529	I	0	" Poirot , "
12532	12577	12529	12529	I	0	" I wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if Mrs. Inglethorp ate well last night ? I have been turning it over in my mind , but I ca n't see how it has anything to do with the matter ? "
12596	12640	12593	12593	he	63	" I do not mind telling you though , as you know , it is not my habit to explain until the end is reached . The present contention is that Mrs. Inglethorp died of strychnine poisoning , presumably administered in her coffee . "
12641	12644	12593	12593	he	63	" Yes ? "
12645	12655	12593	12593	he	63	" Well , what time was the coffee served ? "
12656	12661	12593	12593	he	63	" About eight o'clock . "
12662	12817	12593	12593	he	63	" Therefore she drank it between then and half - past eight certainly not much later . Well , strychnine is a fairly rapid poison . Its effects would be felt very soon , probably in about an hour . Yet , in Mrs. Inglethorp 's case , the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five o'clock the next morning : nine hours ! But a heavy meal , taken at about the same time as the poison , might retard its effects , though hardly to that extent . Still , it is a possibility to be taken into account . But , according to you , she ate very little for supper , and yet the symptoms do not develop until early the next morning ! Now that is a curious circumstance , my friend . Something may arise at the autopsy to explain it . In the meantime , remember it . "
12838	12849	12850	12850	he	32	" This is a very dreadful business , Monsieur Poirot , "
12853	12867	12850	12850	he	32	" Hastings has explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity ? "
12868	12873	12831	12831	His	32	" I comprehend perfectly . "
12874	12892	12850	12850	he	32	" You see , it is only suspicion so far . We have nothing to go upon . "
12893	12904	12831	12831	His	32	" Precisely . It is a matter of precaution only . "
12926	12935	12850	12850	he	32	" You know that fellow Inglethorp is back ? "
12936	12943	12922	12922	he	32	" Yes . I met him . "
12974	12986	12922	12922	he	32	" It 's jolly difficult to know how to treat him . "
12987	12995	12997	12997	Poirot	31	" That difficulty will not exist long , "
13028	13038	13057	13057	Poirot	31	" Show Monsieur Poirot everything he wants to see . "
13039	13045	13047	13047	Poirot	31	" The rooms are locked ? "
13049	13056	13057	13057	Poirot	31	" Dr. Bauerstein considered it advisable . "
13061	13076	13057	13057	Poirot	31	" Then he is very sure . Well , that simplifies matters for us . "
13168	13176	13177	13177	he	31	" What have you , my friend , "
13180	13200	13177	13177	he	31	" that you remain there like how do you say it ? ah , yes , the stuck pig ? "
13214	13268	13323	13323	Poirot	31	" Foot - marks ? But what an idea ! There has already been practically an army in the room ! What foot - marks are we likely to find ? No , come here and aid me in my search . I will put down my little case until I need it . "
13313	13321	13323	13323	Poirot	31	" _ Eh voil une table ! _ "
13325	13344	13323	13323	Poirot	31	" Ah , my friend , one may live in a big house and yet have no comfort . "
13641	13650	13636	13636	He	31	" Cocoa with I think rum in it . "
13699	13706	13708	13708	Poirot	31	" Ah , this is curious , "
13710	13723	13814	13814	he	31	" I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it . "
13724	13760	13708	13708	Poirot	31	" You do not ? Observe the lamp the chimney is broken in two places ; they lie there as they fell . But see , the coffee - cup is absolutely smashed to powder . "
13761	13764	13765	13765	I	0	" Well , "
13769	13779	13765	13765	I	0	" I suppose someone must have stepped on it . "
13780	13783	13785	13785	Poirot	31	" Exactly , "
13792	13798	13785	13785	Poirot	31	" Someone stepped on it . "
13833	13839	13840	13840	he	31	" _ Mon ami _ , "
13847	13884	13840	13840	he	31	" somebody stepped on that cup , grinding it to powder , and the reason they did so was either because it contained strychnine or which is far more serious because it did not contain strychnine ! "
14009	14028	13967	13967	he	31	" I have no authority to go through these papers . But it should be done at once ! "
14123	14131	14132	14132	he	31	" We have found in this room , "
14138	14153	14132	14132	he	31	" six points of interest . Shall I enumerate them , or will you ? "
14154	14159	14160	14160	I	0	" Oh , you , "
14164	14204	14132	14132	he	31	" Very well , then . One , a coffee - cup that has been ground into powder ; two , a despatch - case with a key in the lock ; three , a stain on the floor . "
14205	14215	14216	14216	I	0	" That may have been done some time ago , "
14219	14251	14132	14132	he	31	" No , for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee . Four , a fragment of some dark green fabric only a thread or two , but recognizable . "
14252	14255	14256	14256	I	0	" Ah ! "
14259	14270	14256	14256	I	0	" That was what you sealed up in the envelope . "
14271	14305	14311	14311	he	31	" Yes . It may turn out to be a piece of one of Mrs. Inglethorp 's own dresses , and quite unimportant . We shall see . Five , _ this _ ! "
14329	14371	14311	14311	he	31	" It must have been done since yesterday , otherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with blotting - paper and a hot iron . One of my best hats once but that is not to the point . "
14372	14395	14132	14132	he	31	" It was very likely done last night . We were very agitated . Or perhaps Mrs. Inglethorp herself dropped her candle . "
14396	14406	14311	14311	he	31	" You brought only one candle into the room ? "
14407	14429	14430	14430	I	0	" Yes . Lawrence Cavendish was carrying it . But he was very upset . He seemed to see something over here "
14434	14440	14311	14311	he	31	" that absolutely paralysed him . "
14441	14446	14448	14448	Poirot	31	" That is interesting , "
14451	14457	14458	14458	his	31	" Yes , it is suggestive "
14467	14527	14458	14458	his	31	" but it was not his candle that made this great patch , for you perceive that this is white grease ; whereas Monsieur Lawrence 's candle , which is still on the dressing - table , is pink . On the other hand , Mrs. Inglethorp had no candlestick in the room , only a reading - lamp . "
14528	14531	14532	14532	I	0	" Then , "
14535	14541	14532	14532	I	0	" what do you deduce ? "
14562	14568	14569	14569	I	0	" And the sixth point ? "
14572	14582	14569	14569	I	0	" I suppose it is the sample of cocoa . "
14583	14586	14588	14588	Poirot	31	" No , "
14591	14620	14588	14588	Poirot	31	" I might have included that in the six , but I did not . No , the sixth point I will keep to myself for the present . "
14628	14642	14643	14643	he	31	" There is nothing more to be done here , I think , unless "
14656	14674	14643	14643	he	31	" The fire burns and it destroys . But by chance there might be let us see ! "
14710	14716	14643	14643	he	31	" The forceps , Hastings ! "
14737	14745	14746	14746	he	31	" There , _ mon ami ! _ "
14749	14757	14746	14746	he	31	" What do you think of that ? "
14794	14797	14798	14798	I	0	" Poirot ! "
14801	14810	14798	14798	I	0	" This is a fragment of a will ! "
14811	14814	14792	14792	me	0	" Exactly . "
14822	14828	14798	14798	I	0	" You are not surprised ? "
14829	14832	14833	14833	he	31	" No , "
14837	14842	14833	14833	he	31	" I expected it . "
14922	14928	14930	14930	Poirot	31	" Now , my friend , "
14933	14959	14930	14930	Poirot	31	" we will go . I should like to ask a few questions of the parlourmaid Dorcas , her name is , is it not ? "
15041	15044	15045	15045	I	0	" Poirot , "
15048	15053	15045	15045	I	0	" where are you ? "
15054	15062	15032	15032	her	64	" I am here , my friend . "
15087	15090	15091	15091	he	31	" Admirable ! "
15094	15135	15091	15091	he	31	" Admirable ! What symmetry ! Observe that crescent ; and those diamonds their neatness rejoices the eye . The spacing of the plants , also , is perfect . It has been recently done ; is it not so ? "
15136	15155	15045	15045	I	0	" Yes , I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon . But come in Dorcas is here . "
15156	15177	15091	15091	he	31	" _ Eh bien , eh bien ! _ Do not grudge me a moment 's satisfaction of the eye . "
15178	15188	15045	15045	I	0	" Yes , but this affair is more important . "
15189	15205	15091	15091	he	31	" And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal importance ? "
15226	15250	15219	15219	he	31	" You do not agree ? But such things have been . Well , we will come in and interview the brave Dorcas . "
15321	15328	15315	15315	He	31	" Pray be seated , mademoiselle . "
15329	15335	15300	15300	she	64	" Thank you , sir . "
15336	15351	15315	15315	He	31	" You have been with your mistress many years , is it not so ? "
15352	15358	15300	15300	she	64	" Ten years , sir . "
15359	15382	15315	15315	He	31	" That is a long time , and very faithful service . You were much attached to her , were you not ? "
15383	15395	15300	15300	she	64	" She was a very good mistress to me , sir . "
15396	15420	15315	15315	He	31	" Then you will not object to answering a few questions . I put them to you with Mr. Cavendish 's full approval . "
15421	15428	15300	15300	she	64	" Oh , certainly , sir . "
15429	15450	15315	15315	He	31	" Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday afternoon . Your mistress had a quarrel ? "
15451	15464	15465	15465	Dorcas	64	" Yes , sir . But I do n't know that I ought "
15474	15556	15609	15609	her	64	" My good Dorcas , it is necessary that I should know every detail of that quarrel as fully as possible . Do not think that you are betraying your mistress 's secrets . Your mistress lies dead , and it is necessary that we should know all if we are to avenge her . Nothing can bring her back to life , but we do hope , if there has been foul play , to bring the murderer to justice . "
15557	15562	15564	15564	Dorcas	64	" Amen to that , "
15567	15605	15564	15564	Dorcas	64	" And , naming no names , there 's _ one _ in this house that none of us could ever abide ! And an ill day it was when first _ he _ darkened the threshold . "
15627	15644	15609	15609	her	64	" Now , as to this quarrel ? What is the first you heard of it ? "
15645	15660	15609	15609	her	64	" Well , sir , I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday "
15661	15667	15609	15609	her	64	" What time was that ? "
15668	15914	15609	15609	her	64	" I could n't say exactly , sir , but it was n't tea - time by a long way . Perhaps four o'clock or it may have been a bit later . Well , sir , as I said , I happened to be passing along , when I heard voices very loud and angry in here . I did n't exactly mean to listen , but well , there it is . I stopped . The door was shut , but the mistress was speaking very sharp and clear , and I heard what she said quite plainly . You have lied to me , and deceived me , ' she said . I did n't hear what Mr. Inglethorp replied . He spoke a good bit lower than she did but she answered : How dare you ? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you ! You owe everything to me ! And this is how you repay me ! By bringing disgrace upon our name ! ' Again I did n't hear what he said , but she went on : Nothing that you can say will make any difference . I see my duty clearly . My mind is made up . You need not think that any fear of publicity , or scandal between husband and wife will deter me . ' Then I thought I heard them coming out , so I went off quickly . "
15915	15928	15609	15609	her	64	" You are sure it was Mr. Inglethorp 's voice you heard ? "
15929	15943	15609	15609	her	64	" Oh , yes , sir , whose else 's could it be ? "
15944	15951	15609	15609	her	64	" Well , what happened next ? "
15952	16219	15609	15609	her	64	" Later , I came back to the hall ; but it was all quiet . At five o'clock , Mrs. Inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of tea nothing to eat to the boudoir . She was looking dreadful so white and upset . Dorcas , ' she says , I 've had a great shock . ' I 'm sorry for that , m'm , ' I says . You 'll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea , m'm . ' She had something in her hand . I do n't know if it was a letter , or just a piece of paper , but it had writing on it , and she kept staring at it , almost as if she could n't believe what was written there . She whispered to herself , as though she had forgotten I was there : These few words and everything 's changed . ' And then she says to me : Never trust a man , Dorcas , they 're not worth it ! ' I hurried off , and got her a good strong cup of tea , and she thanked me , and said she 'd feel better when she 'd drunk it . I do n't know what to do , ' she says . Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing , Dorcas . I 'd rather hush it up if I could . ' Mrs. Cavendish came in just then , so she did n't say any more . "
16220	16236	15609	15609	her	64	" She still had the letter , or whatever it was , in her hand ? "
16237	16242	15609	15609	her	64	" Yes , sir . "
16243	16255	15609	15609	her	64	" What would she be likely to do with it afterwards ? "
16256	16280	15609	15609	her	64	" Well , I do n't know , sir , I expect she would lock it up in that purple case of hers . "
16281	16291	15609	15609	her	64	" Is that where she usually kept important papers ? "
16292	16313	15609	15609	her	64	" Yes , sir . She brought it down with her every morning , and took it up every night . "
16314	16324	15609	15609	her	64	" When did she lose the key of it ? "
16325	16355	15609	15609	her	64	" She missed it yesterday at lunch - time , sir , and told me to look carefully for it . She was very much put out about it . "
16356	16364	15609	15609	her	64	" But she had a duplicate key ? "
16365	16372	15609	15609	her	64	" Oh , yes , sir . "
16402	16424	16425	16425	He	437	" Never mind , Dorcas , it is my business to know things . Is this the key that was lost ? "
16460	16483	16446	16446	Dorcas	64	" That 's it , sir , right enough . But where did you find it ? I looked everywhere for it . "
16484	16524	16425	16425	He	437	" Ah , but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was to - day . Now , to pass to another subject , had your mistress a dark green dress in her wardrobe ? "
16534	16539	16446	16446	Dorcas	64	" No , sir . "
16540	16546	16446	16446	Dorcas	64	" Are you quite sure ? "
16547	16554	16446	16446	Dorcas	64	" Oh , yes , sir . "
16555	16567	16446	16446	Dorcas	64	" Has anyone else in the house got a green dress ? "
16571	16580	16425	16425	He	437	" Miss Cynthia has a green evening dress . "
16581	16587	16425	16425	He	437	" Light or dark green ? "
16588	16604	16425	16425	He	437	" A light green , sir ; a sort of chiffon , they call it . "
16605	16622	16425	16425	He	437	" Ah , that is not what I want . And nobody else has anything green ? "
16623	16633	16425	16425	He	437	" No , sir not that I know of . "
16654	16684	16650	16650	He	31	" Good , we will leave that and pass on . Have you any reason to believe that your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night ? "
16685	16700	16425	16425	He	437	" Not _ last _ night , sir , I know she did n't . "
16701	16709	16650	16650	He	31	" Why do you know so positively ? "
16710	16736	16425	16425	He	437	" Because the box was empty . She took the last one two days ago , and she did n't have any more made up . "
16737	16745	16650	16650	He	31	" You are quite sure of that ? "
16746	16751	16425	16425	He	437	" Positive , sir . "
16752	16775	16650	16650	He	31	" Then that is cleared up ! By the way , your mistress did n't ask you to sign any paper yesterday ? "
16776	16786	16425	16425	He	437	" To sign a paper ? No , sir . "
16787	16822	16650	16650	He	31	" When Mr. Hastings and Mr. Lawrence came in yesterday evening , they found your mistress busy writing letters . I suppose you can give me no idea to whom these letters were addressed ? "
16823	16877	16425	16425	He	437	" I 'm afraid I could n't , sir . I was out in the evening . Perhaps Annie could tell you , though she 's a careless girl . Never cleared the coffee - cups away last night . That 's what happens when I 'm not here to look after things . "
16883	16909	16425	16425	He	437	" Since they have been left , Dorcas , leave them a little longer , I pray you . I should like to examine them . "
16910	16916	16880	16880	his	31	" Very well , sir . "
16917	16927	16425	16425	He	437	" What time did you go out last evening ? "
16928	16935	16880	16880	his	31	" About six o'clock , sir . "
16936	16951	16425	16425	He	437	" Thank you , Dorcas , that is all I have to ask you . "
16960	16980	16952	16952	He	31	" I have been admiring these flower beds . How many gardeners are employed here , by the way ? "
16981	17059	16880	16880	his	31	" Only three now , sir . Five , we had , before the war , when it was kept as a gentleman 's place should be . I wish you could have seen it then , sir . A fair sight it was . But now there 's only old Manning , and young William , and a new - fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such - like . Ah , these are dreadful times ! "
17060	17087	16952	16952	He	31	" The good times will come again , Dorcas . At least , we hope so . Now , will you send Annie to me here ? "
17088	17098	16880	16880	his	31	" Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . "
17099	17111	16952	16952	He	31	" How did you know that Mrs. Inglethorp took sleeping powders ? "
17125	17135	17112	17112	I	0	" And about the lost key and the duplicate ? "
17136	17154	17155	17155	He	441	" One thing at a time . As to the sleeping powders , I knew by this . "
17170	17177	17165	17165	chemists	442	" Where did you find it ? "
17178	17199	17165	17165	chemists	442	" In the wash - stand drawer in Mrs. Inglethorp 's bedroom . It was Number Six of my catalogue . "
17200	17222	17165	17165	chemists	442	" But I suppose , as the last powder was taken two days ago , it is not of much importance ? "
17223	17241	17165	17165	chemists	442	" Probably not , but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar about this box ? "
17247	17258	17165	17165	chemists	442	" No , I ca n't say that I do . "
17259	17265	17165	17165	chemists	442	" Look at the label . "
17272	17295	17165	17165	chemists	442	" One powder to be taken at bedtime , if required . Mrs. Inglethorp . ' No , I see nothing unusual . "
17296	17308	17165	17165	chemists	442	" Not the fact that there is no chemist 's name ? "
17309	17312	17313	17313	I	0	" Ah ! "
17316	17325	17313	17313	I	0	" To be sure , that is odd ! "
17326	17346	17165	17165	chemists	442	" Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that , without his printed name ? "
17347	17358	17313	17313	I	0	" No , I ca n't say that I have . "
17373	17390	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" Yet the explanation is quite simple . So do not intrigue yourself , my friend . "
17449	17494	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" I sent for you , Annie , because I thought you might be able to tell me something about the letters Mrs. Inglethorp wrote last night . How many were there ? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses ? "
17498	17558	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" There were four letters , sir . One was to Miss Howard , and one was to Mr. Wells , the lawyer , and the other two I do n't think I remember , sir oh , yes , one was to Ross 's , the caterers in Tadminster . The other one , I do n't remember . "
17559	17562	17564	17564	Poirot	31	" Think , "
17573	17596	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" I 'm sorry , sir , but it 's clean gone . I do n't think I can have noticed it . "
17597	17603	17605	17605	Poirot	31	" It does not matter , "
17614	17647	17605	17605	Poirot	31	" Now I want to ask you about something else . There is a saucepan in Mrs. Inglethorp 's room with some cocoa in it . Did she have that every night ? "
17648	17675	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" Yes , sir , it was put in her room every evening , and she warmed it up in the night whenever she fancied it . "
17676	17684	17605	17605	Poirot	31	" What was it ? Plain cocoa ? "
17685	17708	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" Yes , sir , made with milk , with a teaspoonful of sugar , and two teaspoonfuls of rum in it . "
17709	17717	17605	17605	Poirot	31	" Who took it to her room ? "
17718	17724	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" I did , sir . "
17725	17728	17605	17605	Poirot	31	" Always ? "
17729	17734	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" Yes , sir . "
17735	17740	17605	17605	Poirot	31	" At what time ? "
17741	17756	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" When I went to draw the curtains , as a rule , sir . "
17757	17769	17605	17605	Poirot	31	" Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then ? "
17770	17830	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" No , sir , you see there 's not much room on the gas stove , so cook used to make it early , before putting the vegetables on for supper . Then I used to bring it up , and put it on the table by the swing door , and take it into her room later . "
17831	17845	17605	17605	Poirot	31	" The swing door is in the left wing , is it not ? "
17846	17851	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" Yes , sir . "
17852	17874	17605	17605	Poirot	31	" And the table , is it on this side of the door , or on the farther servants ' side ? "
17875	17883	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" It 's this side , sir . "
17884	17895	17605	17605	Poirot	31	" What time did you bring it up last night ? "
17896	17909	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" About quarter - past seven , I should say , sir . "
17910	17923	17605	17605	Poirot	31	" And when did you take it into Mrs. Inglethorp 's room ? "
17924	17949	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" When I went to shut up , sir . About eight o'clock . Mrs. Inglethorp came up to bed before I 'd finished . "
17950	17973	17605	17605	Poirot	31	" Then , between seven - fifteen and eight o'clock , the cocoa was standing on the table in the left wing ? "
17974	17979	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" Yes , sir . "
17998	18024	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" And if there _ was _ salt in it , sir , it was n't me . I never took the salt near it . "
18025	18036	18038	18038	Poirot	31	" What makes you think there was salt in it ? "
18040	18049	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" Seeing it on the tray , sir . "
18050	18059	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" You saw some salt on the tray ? "
18060	18166	17434	17434	Poirot	31	" Yes . Coarse kitchen salt , it looked . I never noticed it when I took the tray up , but when I came to take it into the mistress 's room I saw it at once , and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again , and asked cook to make some fresh . But I was in a hurry , because Dorcas was out , and I thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right , and the salt had only gone on the tray . So I dusted it off with my apron , and took it in . "
18203	18207	18193	18193	she	444	" coarse kitchen salt "
18248	18269	18193	18193	she	444	" When you went into Mrs. Inglethorp 's room , was the door leading into Miss Cynthia 's room bolted ? "
18270	18287	18193	18193	she	444	" Oh ! Yes , sir ; it always was . It had never been opened . "
18288	18307	18193	18193	she	444	" And the door into Mr. Inglethorp 's room ? Did you notice if that was bolted too ? "
18311	18335	18193	18193	she	444	" I could n't rightly say , sir ; it was shut but I could n't say whether it was bolted or not . "
18336	18353	18193	18193	she	444	" When you finally left the room , did Mrs. Inglethorp bolt the door after you ? "
18354	18386	18193	18193	she	444	" No , sir , not then , but I expect she did later . She usually did lock it at night . The door into the passage , that is . "
18387	18404	18193	18193	she	444	" Did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room yesterday ? "
18405	18429	18193	18193	she	444	" Candle grease ? Oh , no , sir . Mrs. Inglethorp did n't have a candle , only a reading - lamp . "
18430	18459	18193	18193	she	444	" Then , if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor , you think you would have been sure to have seen it ? "
18460	18484	18193	18193	she	444	" Yes , sir , and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting - paper and a hot iron . "
18496	18506	18193	18193	she	444	" Did your mistress ever have a green dress ? "
18507	18512	18193	18193	she	444	" No , sir . "
18513	18534	18193	18193	she	444	" Nor a mantle , nor a cape , nor a how do you call it ? a sports coat ? "
18535	18541	18193	18193	she	444	" Not green , sir . "
18542	18550	18193	18193	she	444	" Nor anyone else in the house ? "
18554	18559	18193	18193	she	444	" No , sir . "
18560	18567	18551	18551	Annie	67	" You are sure of that ? "
18568	18572	18193	18193	she	444	" Quite sure . "
18573	18591	18551	18551	Annie	67	" _ Bien ! _ That is all I want to know . Thank you very much . "
18614	18617	18618	18618	I	0	" Poirot , "
18621	18632	18618	18618	I	0	" I congratulate you ! This is a great discovery . "
18633	18640	18599	18599	herself	67	" What is a great discovery ? "
18641	18686	18618	18618	I	0	" Why , that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned . That explains everything ! Of course it did not take effect until the early morning , since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night . "
18687	18709	18599	18599	herself	67	" So you think that the cocoa mark well what I say , Hastings , the _ cocoa _ contained strychnine ? "
18710	18727	18618	18618	I	0	" Of course ! That salt on the tray , what else could it have been ? "
18728	18735	18737	18737	Poirot	31	" It might have been salt , "
18813	18826	18804	18804	Poirot	31	" You are not pleased with me , _ mon ami ? _ "
18827	18832	18833	18833	I	0	" My dear Poirot , "
18837	18864	18833	18833	I	0	" it is not for me to dictate to you . You have a right to your own opinion , just as I have to mine . "
18865	18871	18873	18873	Poirot	31	" A most admirable sentiment , "
18881	18903	18873	18873	Poirot	31	" Now I have finished with this room . By the way , whose is the smaller desk in the corner ? "
18904	18909	18833	18833	I	0	" Mr. Inglethorp 's . "
18910	18913	18914	18914	He	31	" Ah ! "
18921	18936	18937	18937	He	31	" Locked . But perhaps one of Mrs. Inglethorp 's keys would open it . "
18958	18978	18979	18979	He	31	" _ Voil ! _ It is not the key , but it will open it at a pinch . "
19016	19030	19001	19001	he	31	" Decidedly , he is a man of method , this Mr. Inglethorp ! "
19032	19036	19031	19036	A " man of method "	1369	" man of method "
19072	19100	19101	19101	his	31	" There were no stamps in his desk , but there might have been , eh , _ mon ami ? _ There might have been ? Yes "
19107	19126	19067	19067	he	31	" this boudoir has nothing more to tell us . It did not yield much . Only this . "
19183	19191	19240	19240	his	31	" IT ISN'T STRYCHNINE , IS IT ? "
19192	19199	19200	19200	I	0	" Where did you find this ? "
19208	19221	19240	19240	his	31	" In the waste - paper basket . You recognise the handwriting ? "
19222	19237	19200	19200	I	0	" Yes , it is Mrs. Inglethorp 's . But what does it mean ? "
19243	19253	19240	19240	his	31	" I can not say but it is suggestive . "
19319	19322	19323	19323	he	31	" Come , "
19326	19335	19323	19323	he	31	" now to examine the coffee - cups ! "
19336	19358	19383	19383	his	31	" My dear Poirot ! What on earth is the good of that , now that we know about the cocoa ? "
19359	19371	19373	19373	Poirot	31	" Oh , _ l l ! _ That miserable cocoa ! "
19403	19408	19409	19409	I	0	" And , anyway , "
19416	19455	19409	19409	I	0	" as Mrs. Inglethorp took her coffee upstairs with her , I do not see what you expect to find , unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of strychnine on the coffee tray ! "
19462	19470	19471	19471	he	31	" Come , come , my friend , "
19480	19514	19471	19471	he	31	" _ Ne vous f chez pas ! _ Allow me to interest myself in my coffee - cups , and I will respect your cocoa . There ! Is it a bargain ? "
19576	19637	19703	19703	he	31	" So Mrs. Cavendish stood by the tray and poured out . Yes . Then she came across to the window where you sat with Mademoiselle Cynthia . Yes . Here are the three cups . And the cup on the mantelpiece , half drunk , that would be Mr. Lawrence Cavendish 's . And the one on the tray ? "
19638	19651	19703	19703	he	31	" John Cavendish 's . I saw him put it down there . "
19652	19676	19703	19703	he	31	" Good . One , two , three , four , five but where , then , is the cup of Mr. Inglethorp ? "
19677	19684	19703	19703	he	31	" He does not take coffee . "
19685	19698	19703	19703	he	31	" Then all are accounted for . One moment , my friend . "
19757	19762	19763	19763	he	31	" _ Bien ! _ "
19768	19799	19763	19763	he	31	" It is evident ! I had an idea but clearly I was mistaken . Yes , altogether I was mistaken . Yet it is strange . But no matter ! "
19869	19874	19876	19877	John Cavendish	32	" Breakfast is ready , "
19885	19895	19876	19877	John Cavendish	32	" You will breakfast with us , Monsieur Poirot ? "
20008	20017	20018	20018	he	32	" May I ask how things are proceeding ? "
20021	20044	20018	20018	he	32	" Do your investigations point to my mother having died a natural death or or must we prepare ourselves for the worst ? "
20045	20052	20054	20054	Poirot	31	" I think , Mr. Cavendish , "
20057	20087	20054	20054	Poirot	31	" that you would do well not to buoy yourself up with any false hopes . Can you tell me the views of the other members of the family ? "
20088	20118	20018	20018	he	32	" My brother Lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over nothing . He says that everything points to its being a simple case of heart failure . "
20119	20133	20135	20135	Poirot	31	" He does , does he ? That is very interesting very interesting , "
20138	20143	20135	20135	Poirot	31	" And Mrs. Cavendish ? "
20153	20170	20212	20212	his	31	" I have not the least idea what my wife 's views on the subject are . "
20194	20209	20181	20181	John	32	" I told you , did n't I , that Mr. Inglethorp has returned ? "
20215	20256	20181	20181	John	32	" It 's an awkward position for all of us . Of course one has to treat him as usual but , hang it all , one 's gorge does rise at sitting down to eat with a possible murderer ! "
20261	20315	20257	20257	Poirot	31	" I quite understand . It is a very difficult situation for you , Mr. Cavendish . I would like to ask you one question . Mr. Inglethorp 's reason for not returning last night was , I believe , that he had forgotten the latch - key . Is not that so ? "
20316	20319	20212	20212	his	31	" Yes . "
20320	20345	20257	20257	Poirot	31	" I suppose you are quite sure that the latch - key _ was _ forgotten that he did not take it after all ? "
20346	20378	20212	20212	his	31	" I have no idea . I never thought of looking . We always keep it in the hall drawer . I 'll go and see if it 's there now . "
20389	20430	20212	20212	his	31	" No , no , Mr. Cavendish , it is too late now . I am certain that you would find it . If Mr. Inglethorp did take it , he has had ample time to replace it by now . "
20431	20436	20382	20382	his	31	" But do you think "
20437	20474	20212	20212	his	31	" I think nothing . If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his return , and seen it there , it would have been a valuable point in his favour . That is all . "
20479	20484	20486	20486	Poirot	31	" Do not worry , "
20489	20516	20486	20486	Poirot	31	" I assure you that you need not let it trouble you . Since you are so kind , let us go and have some breakfast . "
20859	20870	20855	20855	she	38	" Yes , I 've got the most beastly headache . "
20871	20880	20882	20882	Poirot	31	" Have another cup of coffee , mademoiselle ? "
20885	20903	20904	20904	He	31	" It will revive you . It is unparalleled for the _ mal de t te _ . "
20912	20916	20918	20918	Cynthia	38	" No sugar , "
20932	20947	20904	20904	He	31	" No sugar ? You abandon it in the war - time , eh ? "
20948	20958	20981	20981	him	31	" No , I never take it in coffee . "
20959	20964	20966	20966	Poirot	31	" _ Sacr ! _ "
21066	21075	21076	21076	she	64	" Mr. Wells to see you , sir , "
21105	21112	21114	21114	he	32	" Show him into my study . "
21119	21125	21126	21126	he	32	" My mother 's lawyer , "
21135	21152	21126	21126	he	32	" He is also Coroner you understand . Perhaps you would like to come with me ? "
21177	21185	21168	21168	I	0	" There will be an inquest then ? "
21205	21219	21126	21126	he	32	" What is it ? You are not attending to what I say . "
21220	21233	21168	21168	I	0	" It is true , my friend . I am much worried . "
21234	21237	21126	21126	he	32	" Why ? "
21238	21250	21168	21168	I	0	" Because Mademoiselle Cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee . "
21251	21260	21126	21126	he	32	" What ? You can not be serious ? "
21261	21285	21168	21168	I	0	" But I am most serious . Ah , there is something there that I do not understand . My instinct was right . "
21286	21290	21126	21126	he	32	" What instinct ? "
21291	21314	21168	21168	I	0	" The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee - cups . _ Chut ! _ no more now ! "
21365	21372	21373	21373	he	32	" You will understand , Wells , "
21376	21403	21373	21373	he	32	" that this is all strictly private . We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for investigation of any kind . "
21404	21411	21413	21414	Mr. Wells	75	" Quite so , quite so , "
21417	21449	21413	21414	Mr. Wells	75	" I wish we could have spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest , but of course it 's quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor 's certificate . "
21450	21457	21373	21373	he	32	" Yes , I suppose so . "
21458	21472	21413	21414	Mr. Wells	75	" Clever man , Bauerstein . Great authority on toxicology , I believe . "
21473	21476	21478	21478	John	32	" Indeed , "
21493	21508	21488	21488	he	32	" Shall we have to appear as witnesses all of us , I mean ? "
21509	21521	21413	21414	Mr. Wells	75	" You , of course and ah er Mr. er Inglethorp . "
21536	21551	21532	21532	his	1319	" Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory , a mere matter of form . "
21552	21556	21488	21488	he	32	" I see . "
21580	21590	21592	21593	Mr. Wells	75	" If you know of nothing to the contrary , "
21595	21630	21592	21593	Mr. Wells	75	" I had thought of Friday . That will give us plenty of time for the doctor 's report . The post - mortem is to take place to - night , I believe ? "
21631	21634	21532	21532	his	1319	" Yes . "
21635	21643	21592	21593	Mr. Wells	75	" Then that arrangement will suit you ? "
21644	21647	21532	21532	his	1319	" Perfectly . "
21648	21669	21592	21593	Mr. Wells	75	" I need not tell you , my dear Cavendish , how distressed I am at this most tragic affair . "
21670	21683	21685	21685	Poirot	31	" Can you give us no help in solving it , monsieur ? "
21699	21702	21592	21593	Mr. Wells	75	" I ? "
21703	21726	21592	21593	Mr. Wells	75	" Yes , we heard that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote to you last night . You should have received the letter this morning . "
21727	21763	21592	21593	Mr. Wells	75	" I did , but it contains no information . It is merely a note asking me to call upon her this morning , as she wanted my advice on a matter of great importance . "
21764	21778	21592	21593	Mr. Wells	75	" She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be ? "
21779	21784	21592	21593	Mr. Wells	75	" Unfortunately , no . "
21785	21791	21793	21793	John	32	" That is a pity , "
21795	21800	21802	21802	Poirot	31	" A great pity , "
21827	21867	21868	21869	The lawyer	1319	" Mr. Wells , there is one thing I should like to ask you that is , if it is not against professional etiquette . In the event of Mrs. Inglethorp 's death , who would inherit her money ? "
21878	21895	21868	21869	The lawyer	1319	" The knowledge will be public property very soon , so if Mr. Cavendish does not object "
21896	21901	21903	21903	John	32	" Not at all , "
21905	21954	21868	21869	The lawyer	1319	" I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question . By her last will , dated August of last year , after various unimportant legacies to servants , etc . , she gave her entire fortune to her stepson , Mr. John Cavendish . "
21955	21976	21868	21869	The lawyer	1319	" Was not that pardon the question , Mr. Cavendish rather unfair to her other stepson , Mr. Lawrence Cavendish ? "
21977	22055	21868	21869	The lawyer	1319	" No , I do not think so . You see , under the terms of their father 's will , while John inherited the property , Lawrence , at his stepmother 's death , would come into a considerable sum of money . Mrs. Inglethorp left her money to her elder stepson , knowing that he would have to keep up Styles . It was , to my mind , a very fair and equitable distribution . "
22060	22090	22094	22094	his	75	" I see . But I am right in saying , am I not , that by your English law that will was automatically revoked when Mrs. Inglethorp remarried ? "
22097	22116	21868	21869	The lawyer	1319	" As I was about to proceed , Monsieur Poirot , that document is now null and void . "
22117	22122	22124	22124	Poirot	31	" _ Hein ! _ "
22136	22146	22126	22126	He	31	" Was Mrs. Inglethorp herself aware of that fact ? "
22147	22158	21868	21869	The lawyer	1319	" I do not know . She may have been . "
22159	22163	22165	22165	John	32	" She was , "
22168	22183	22165	22165	John	32	" We were discussing the matter of wills being revoked by marriage only yesterday . "
22184	22212	21868	21869	The lawyer	1319	" Ah ! One more question , Mr. Wells . You say her last will . ' Had Mrs. Inglethorp , then , made several former wills ? "
22213	22229	22231	22232	Mr. Wells	75	" On an average , she made a new will at least once a year , "
22235	22260	22231	22232	Mr. Wells	75	" She was given to changing her mind as to her testamentary dispositions , now benefiting one , now another member of her family . "
22261	22264	22266	22266	Poirot	31	" Suppose , "
22268	22314	22266	22266	Poirot	31	" that , unknown to you , she had made a new will in favour of someone who was not , in any sense of the word , a member of the family we will say Miss Howard , for instance would you be surprised ? "
22315	22321	22338	22338	him	31	" Not in the least . "
22322	22325	22266	22266	Poirot	31	" Ah ! "
22357	22374	22375	22375	I	0	" Do you think Mrs. Inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to Miss Howard ? "
22389	22392	22375	22375	I	0	" No . "
22393	22400	22375	22375	I	0	" Then why did you ask ? "
22401	22404	22375	22375	I	0	" Hush ! "
22412	22446	22375	22375	I	0	" Will you come with us , Monsieur Poirot ? We are going through my mother 's papers . Mr. Inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely to Mr. Wells and myself . "
22447	22454	22456	22457	the lawyer	1319	" Which simplifies matters very much , "
22459	22469	22470	22470	He	31	" As technically , of course , he was entitled "
22477	22489	22491	22491	John	32	" We will look through the desk in the boudoir first , "
22493	22522	22491	22491	John	32	" and go up to her bedroom afterwards . She kept her most important papers in a purple despatch - case , which we must look through carefully . "
22523	22526	22528	22529	the lawyer	1319	" Yes , "
22531	22550	22528	22529	the lawyer	1319	" it is quite possible that there may be a later will than the one in my possession . "
22551	22560	22563	22563	Poirot	31	" There _ is _ a later will . "
22567	22570	22571	22571	John	32	" What ? "
22580	22585	22587	22588	my friend	129	" Or , rather , "
22591	22598	22587	22588	my friend	129	" there _ was _ one . "
22599	22613	22573	22574	the lawyer	1319	" What do you mean there was one ? Where is it now ? "
22614	22617	22587	22588	my friend	129	" Burnt ! "
22618	22621	22573	22574	the lawyer	1319	" Burnt ? "
22622	22628	22587	22588	my friend	129	" Yes . See here . "
22666	22675	22587	22588	my friend	129	" But possibly this is an old will ? "
22676	22699	22587	22588	my friend	129	" I do not think so . In fact I am almost certain that it was made no earlier than yesterday afternoon . "
22700	22703	22587	22588	my friend	129	" What ? "
22704	22707	22711	22712	both men	490	" Impossible ! "
22719	22738	22587	22588	my friend	129	" If you will allow me to send for your gardener , I will prove it to you . "
22739	22749	22587	22588	my friend	129	" Oh , of course but I do n't see "
22755	22772	22587	22588	my friend	129	" Do as I ask you . Afterwards you shall question as much as you please . "
22773	22777	22778	22778	He	31	" Very well . "
22790	22806	22778	22778	He	31	" Dorcas , will you tell Manning to come round and speak to me here . "
22807	22812	22778	22778	He	31	" Yes , sir . "
22865	22871	22873	22873	John	32	" Come inside , Manning , "
22875	22883	22873	22873	John	32	" I want to speak to you . "
22953	22956	22958	22958	John	32	" Manning , "
22960	22976	22958	22958	John	32	" this gentleman will put some questions to you which I want you to answer . "
22977	22980	22982	22982	Manning	73	" Yessir , "
23000	23025	22937	22937	his	73	" You were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the house yesterday afternoon , were you not , Manning ? "
23026	23035	22958	22958	John	32	" Yes , sir , me and Willum . "
23036	23052	22937	22937	his	73	" And Mrs. Inglethorp came to the window and called you , did she not ? "
23053	23061	22958	22958	John	32	" Yes , sir , she did . "
23062	23075	22937	22937	his	73	" Tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that . "
23076	23123	22958	22958	John	32	" Well , sir , nothing much . She just told Willum to go on his bicycle down to the village , and bring back a form of will , or such - like I do n't know what exactly she wrote it down for him . "
23124	23127	22937	22937	his	73	" Well ? "
23128	23136	22958	22958	John	32	" Well , he did , sir . "
23137	23143	22937	22937	his	73	" And what happened next ? "
23144	23154	22958	22958	John	32	" We went on with the begonias , sir . "
23155	23164	22937	22937	his	73	" Did not Mrs. Inglethorp call you again ? "
23165	23178	22958	22958	John	32	" Yes , sir , both me and Willum , she called . "
23179	23183	22937	22937	his	73	" And then ? "
23184	23209	22958	22958	John	32	" She made us come right in , and sign our names at the bottom of a long paper under where she 'd signed . "
23210	23223	23225	23225	Poirot	31	" Did you see anything of what was written above her signature ? "
23228	23244	22958	22958	John	32	" No , sir , there was a bit of blotting paper over that part . "
23245	23254	22958	22958	John	32	" And you signed where she told you ? "
23255	23266	22958	22958	John	32	" Yes , sir , first me and then Willum . "
23267	23276	22958	22958	John	32	" What did she do with it afterwards ? "
23277	23306	22958	22958	John	32	" Well , sir , she slipped it into a long envelope , and put it inside a sort of purple box that was standing on the desk . "
23307	23318	22958	22958	John	32	" What time was it when she first called you ? "
23319	23329	22958	22958	John	32	" About four , I should say , sir . "
23330	23345	22958	22958	John	32	" Not earlier ? Could n't it have been about half - past three ? "
23346	23372	22958	22958	John	32	" No , I should n't say so , sir . It would be more likely to be a bit after four not before it . "
23373	23383	23385	23385	Poirot	31	" Thank you , Manning , that will do , "
23426	23430	23432	23432	John	32	" Good heavens ! "
23434	23440	23432	23432	John	32	" What an extraordinary coincidence . "
23441	23446	23423	23424	each other	496	" How a coincidence ? "
23447	23464	23432	23432	John	32	" That my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death ! "
23474	23486	23465	23466	Mr. Wells	75	" Are you so sure it is a coincidence , Cavendish ? "
23487	23493	23423	23424	each other	496	" What do you mean ? "
23494	23510	23465	23466	Mr. Wells	75	" Your mother , you tell me , had a violent quarrel with someone yesterday afternoon "
23511	23517	23519	23519	John	32	" What do you mean ? "
23537	23636	23465	23466	Mr. Wells	75	" In consequence of that quarrel , your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will . The contents of that will we shall never know . She told no one of its provisions . This morning , no doubt , she would have consulted me on the subject but she had no chance . The will disappears , and she takes its secret with her to her grave . Cavendish , I much fear there is no coincidence there . Monsieur Poirot , I am sure you agree with me that the facts are very suggestive . "
23637	23643	23645	23645	John	32	" Suggestive , or not , "
23647	23693	23645	23645	John	32	" we are most grateful to Monsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter . But for him , we should never have known of this will . I suppose , I may not ask you , monsieur , what first led you to suspect the fact ? "
23699	23714	23694	23694	Poirot	31	" A scribbled over old envelope , and a freshly planted bed of begonias . "
23752	23755	23757	23757	John	32	" Evie ! "
23759	23765	23766	23766	He	32	" Excuse me , Wells . "
23780	23784	23785	23785	I	0	" Miss Howard , "
23788	23821	23774	23774	Poirot	31	" Ah , I am glad she has come . There is a woman with a head and a heart too , Hastings . Though the good God gave her no beauty ! "
24020	24044	23994	23994	she	500	" Started the moment I got the wire . Just come off night duty . Hired car . Quickest way to get here . "
24045	24057	24059	24059	John	32	" Have you had anything to eat this morning , Evie ? "
24061	24064	23994	23994	she	500	" No . "
24065	24089	24090	24090	He	1112	" I thought not . Come along , breakfast 's not cleared away yet , and they 'll make you some fresh tea . "
24095	24128	24090	24090	He	1112	" Look after her , Hastings , will you ? Wells is waiting for me . Oh , here 's Monsieur Poirot . He 's helping us , you know , Evie . "
24145	24153	24090	24090	He	1112	" What do you mean helping us ? "
24154	24160	24090	24090	He	1112	" Helping us to investigate . "
24161	24174	24090	24090	He	1112	" Nothing to investigate . Have they taken him to prison yet ? "
24175	24181	24090	24090	He	1112	" Taken who to prison ? "
24182	24191	24090	24090	He	1112	" Who ? Alfred Inglethorp , of course ! "
24192	24214	24090	24090	He	1112	" My dear Evie , do be careful . Lawrence is of the opinion that my mother died from heart seizure . "
24215	24221	24223	24224	Miss Howard	40	" More fool , Lawrence ! "
24226	24242	24223	24224	Miss Howard	40	" Of course Alfred Inglethorp murdered poor Emily as I always told you he would . "
24243	24280	24289	24290	Miss Howard	40	" My dear Evie , do n't shout so . Whatever we may think or suspect , it is better to say as little as possible for the present . The inquest is n't until Friday . "
24281	24286	24223	24224	Miss Howard	40	" Not until fiddlesticks ! "
24296	24333	24289	24290	Miss Howard	40	" You 're all off your heads . The man will be out of the country by then . If he 's any sense , he wo n't stay here tamely and wait to be hanged . "
24341	24348	24349	24349	she	503	" I know what it is , "
24353	24483	24349	24349	she	503	" you 've been listening to the doctors . Never should . What do they know ? Nothing at all or just enough to make them dangerous . I ought to know my own father was a doctor . That little Wilkins is about the greatest fool that even I have ever seen . Heart seizure ! Sort of thing he would say . Anyone with any sense could see at once that her husband had poisoned her . I always said he 'd murder her in her bed , poor soul . Now he 's done it . And all you can do is to murmur silly things about heart seizure ' and inquest on Friday . ' You ought to be ashamed of yourself , John Cavendish . "
24484	24493	24495	24495	John	32	" What do you want me to do ? "
24504	24529	24495	24495	John	32	" Dash it all , Evie , I ca n't haul him down to the local police station by the scruff of his neck . "
24530	24566	24594	24594	them	504	" Well , you might do something . Find out how he did it . He 's a crafty beggar . Dare say he soaked fly papers . Ask cook if she 's missed any . "
24677	24680	24681	24681	he	31	" Mademoiselle , "
24685	24693	24681	24681	he	31	" I want to ask you something . "
24694	24698	24700	24701	the lady	507	" Ask away , "
24709	24721	24681	24681	he	31	" I want to be able to count upon your help . "
24722	24733	24734	24734	she	507	" I 'll help you to hang Alfred with pleasure , "
24738	24759	24734	24734	she	507	" Hanging 's too good for him . Ought to be drawn and quartered , like in good old times . "
24760	24767	24769	24769	Poirot	31	" We are at one then , "
24771	24783	24769	24769	Poirot	31	" for I , too , want to hang the criminal . "
24784	24788	24734	24734	she	507	" Alfred Inglethorp ? "
24789	24795	24769	24769	Poirot	31	" Him , or another . "
24796	24856	24734	24734	she	507	" No question of another . Poor Emily was never murdered until _ he _ came along . I do n't say she was n't surrounded by sharks she was . But it was only her purse they were after . Her life was safe enough . But along comes Mr. Alfred Inglethorp and within two months hey presto ! "
24857	24864	24866	24866	Poirot	31	" Believe me , Miss Howard , "
24870	24897	24866	24866	Poirot	31	" if Mr. Inglethorp is the man , he shall not escape me . On my honour , I will hang him as high as Haman ! "
24898	24903	24905	24906	Miss Howard	40	" That 's better , "
24910	24954	24968	24968	her	508	" But I must ask you to trust me . Now your help may be very valuable to me . I will tell you why . Because , in all this house of mourning , yours are the only eyes that have wept . "
24971	25194	24968	24968	her	508	" If you mean that I was fond of her yes , I was . You know , Emily was a selfish old woman in her way . She was very generous , but she always wanted a return . She never let people forget what she had done for them and , that way she missed love . Do n't think she ever realized it , though , or felt the lack of it . Hope not , anyway . I was on a different footing . I took my stand from the first . So many pounds a year I 'm worth to you . Well and good . But not a penny piece besides not a pair of gloves , nor a theatre ticket . ' She did n't understand was very offended sometimes . Said I was foolishly proud . It was n't that but I could n't explain . Anyway , I kept my self - respect . And so , out of the whole bunch , I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of her . I watched over her . I guarded her from the lot of them , and then a glib - tongued scoundrel comes along , and pooh ! all my years of devotion go for nothing . "
25199	25237	24968	24968	her	508	" I understand , mademoiselle , I understand all you feel . It is most natural . You think that we are lukewarm that we lack fire and energy but trust me , it is not so . "
25298	25312	25294	25294	his	32	" Look here , what 's going to happen when these two meet ? "
25319	25332	25294	25294	his	32	" I 've told Mary to keep them apart if she can . "
25333	25342	25294	25294	his	32	" Will she be able to do so ? "
25343	25365	25294	25294	his	32	" The Lord only knows . There 's one thing , Inglethorp himself wo n't be too keen on meeting her . "
25366	25380	25381	25381	I	0	" You 've got the keys still , have n't you , Poirot ? "
25423	25441	25442	25442	he	1319	" My mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch - case , I believe , "
25454	25469	25445	25445	Poirot	31	" Permit me . I locked it , out of precaution , this morning . "
25470	25478	25445	25445	Poirot	31	" But it 's not locked now . "
25479	25482	25445	25445	Poirot	31	" Impossible ! "
25483	25486	25445	25445	Poirot	31	" See . "
25496	25502	25504	25504	Poirot	31	" _ Milles tonnerres ! _ "
25508	25520	25523	25523	himself	31	" And I who have both the keys in my pocket ! "
25532	25546	25529	25529	he	31	" _ Eh voil une affaire ! _ This lock has been forced . "
25547	25550	25551	25551	Poirot	31	" What ? "
25558	25576	25551	25551	Poirot	31	" But who forced it ? Why should they ? When ? But the door was locked ? "
25591	25645	25551	25551	Poirot	31	" Who ? That is the question . Why ? Ah , if I only knew . When ? Since I was here an hour ago . As to the door being locked , it is a very ordinary lock . Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it . "
25692	25701	25702	25702	he	31	" See here , it was like this , "
25707	25806	25702	25702	he	31	" There was something in that case some piece of evidence , slight in itself perhaps , but still enough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime . It was vital to him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its significance appreciated . Therefore , he took the risk , the great risk , of coming in here . Finding the case locked , he was obliged to force it , thus betraying his presence . For him to take that risk , it must have been something of great importance . "
25807	25813	25945	25945	him	31	" But what was it ? "
25814	25817	25819	25819	Poirot	31	" Ah ! "
25827	25859	25860	25860	his	31	" That , I do not know ! A document of some kind , without doubt , possibly the scrap of paper Dorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon . And I "
25865	25932	25860	25860	his	31	" miserable animal that I am ! I guessed nothing ! I have behaved like an imbecile ! I should never have left that case here . I should have carried it away with me . Ah , triple pig ! And now it is gone . It is destroyed but is it destroyed ? Is there not yet a chance we must leave no stone unturned "
25999	26023	25976	25977	Mary Cavendish	41	" What has happened to your extraordinary little friend , Mr. Hastings ? He has just rushed past me like a mad bull . "
26024	26032	26033	26033	I	0	" He 's rather upset about something , "
26076	26086	26065	26065	I	0	" They have n't met yet , have they ? "
26087	26090	26099	26099	She	41	" Who ? "
26091	26098	26065	26065	I	0	" Mr. Inglethorp and Miss Howard . "
26109	26124	26065	26065	I	0	" Do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet ? "
26125	26132	26133	26133	I	0	" Well , do n't you ? "
26140	26143	26144	26144	She	41	" No . "
26152	26183	26144	26144	She	41	" I should like to see a good flare up . It would clear the air . At present we are all thinking so much , and saying so little . "
26184	26191	26192	26192	I	0	" John does n't think so , "
26195	26204	26192	26192	I	0	" He 's anxious to keep them apart . "
26205	26210	26144	26144	She	41	" Oh , John ! "
26223	26232	26219	26219	I	0	" Old John 's an awfully good sort . "
26252	26266	26213	26213	her	41	" You are loyal to your friend . I like you for that . "
26267	26275	26233	26233	She	41	" Are n't you my friend too ? "
26276	26284	26213	26213	her	41	" I am a very bad friend . "
26285	26292	26233	26233	She	41	" Why do you say that ? "
26293	26316	26213	26213	her	41	" Because it is true . I am charming to my friends one day , and forget all about them the next . "
26342	26354	26331	26331	I	0	" Yet you seem to be invariably charming to Dr. Bauerstein ! "
26510	26515	26516	26516	I	0	" My dear fellow , "
26519	26548	26516	26516	I	0	" is this wise ? Surely you do n't want the whole house to know of this occurrence ? You are actually playing into the criminal 's hands . "
26549	26556	26507	26507	him	31	" You think so , Hastings ? "
26557	26564	26516	26516	I	0	" I am sure of it . "
26565	26580	26507	26507	him	31	" Well , well , my friend , I will be guided by you . "
26581	26596	26516	26516	I	0	" Good . Although , unfortunately , it is a little too late now . "
26597	26600	26507	26507	him	31	" Sure . "
26625	26628	26629	26629	he	31	" Well , "
26634	26644	26629	26629	he	31	" let us go , _ mon ami _ . "
26645	26651	26617	26617	my	0	" You have finished here ? "
26652	26669	26629	26629	he	31	" For the moment , yes . You will walk back with me to the village ? "
26670	26673	26617	26617	my	0	" Willingly . "
26713	26722	26748	26748	her	48	" Excuse me , mademoiselle , one minute . "
26723	26726	26727	26727	she	48	" Yes ? "
26731	26742	26748	26748	her	48	" Did you ever make up Mrs. Inglethorp 's medicines ? "
26757	26760	26752	26752	she	48	" No . "
26761	26766	26748	26748	her	48	" Only her powders ? "
26774	26790	26771	26771	Cynthia	48	" Oh , yes , I did make up some sleeping powders for her once . "
26791	26794	26748	26748	her	48	" These ? "
26808	26821	26748	26748	her	48	" Can you tell me what they were ? Sulphonal ? Veronal ? "
26822	26830	26805	26805	She	48	" No , they were bromide powders . "
26831	26842	26748	26748	her	48	" Ah ! Thank you , mademoiselle ; good morning . "
26888	26892	26893	26893	he	31	" My friend , "
26899	26922	26893	26893	he	31	" I have a little idea , a very strange , and probably utterly impossible idea . And yet it fits in . "
26958	26972	26973	26973	I	0	" So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box , "
26976	26996	26973	26973	I	0	" Very simple , as you said . I really wonder that I did not think of it myself . "
27007	27020	27021	27021	he	31	" They have made one more discovery , _ l -bas _ , "
27036	27047	27025	27025	his	31	" Mr. Wells told me as we were going upstairs . "
27048	27053	27025	27025	his	31	" What was it ? "
27054	27133	27025	27025	his	31	" Locked up in the desk in the boudoir , they found a will of Mrs. Inglethorp 's , dated before her marriage , leaving her fortune to Alfred Inglethorp . It must have been made just at the time they were engaged . It came quite as a surprise to Wells and to John Cavendish also . It was written on one of those printed will forms , and witnessed by two of the servants not Dorcas . "
27134	27142	27025	27025	his	31	" Did Mr. Inglethorp know of it ? "
27143	27148	27025	27025	his	31	" He says not . "
27149	27160	27161	27161	I	0	" One might take that with a grain of salt , "
27165	27196	27161	27161	I	0	" All these wills are very confusing . Tell me , how did those scribbled words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday afternoon ? "
27200	27232	27197	27197	Poirot	31	" _ Mon ami _ , have you ever , when writing a letter , been arrested by the fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word ? "
27233	27243	27025	27025	his	31	" Yes , often . I suppose everyone has . "
27244	27454	27197	27197	Poirot	31	" Exactly . And have you not , in such a case , tried the word once or twice on the edge of the blotting - paper , or a spare scrap of paper , to see if it looked right ? Well , that is what Mrs. Inglethorp did . You will notice that the word possessed ' is spelt first with one s ' and subsequently with two correctly . To make sure , she had further tried it in a sentence , thus : I am possessed . ' Now , what did that tell me ? It told me that Mrs. Inglethorp had been writing the word possessed ' that afternoon , and , having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh in my mind , the possibility of a will ( a document almost certain to contain that word ) occurred to me at once . This possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance . In the general confusion , the boudoir had not been swept that morning , and near the desk were several traces of brown mould and earth . The weather had been perfectly fine for some days , and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit .
27455	27605	27025	27025	his	31	" I strolled to the window , and saw at once that the begonia beds had been newly planted . The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that on the floor of the boudoir , and also I learnt from you that they _ had _ been planted yesterday afternoon . I was now sure that one , or possibly both of the gardeners for there were two sets of footprints in the bed had entered the boudoir , for if Mrs. Inglethorp had merely wished to speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window , and they would not have come into the room at all . I was now quite convinced that she had made a fresh will , and had called the two gardeners in to witness her signature . Events proved that I was right in my supposition . "
27606	27612	27613	27613	I	0	" That was very ingenious , "
27619	27637	27613	27613	I	0	" I must confess that the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite erroneous . "
27641	27671	27638	27638	He	532	" You gave too much rein to your imagination . Imagination is a good servant , and a bad master . The simplest explanation is always the most likely . "
27672	27691	27638	27638	He	532	" Another point how did you know that the key of the despatch - case had been lost ? "
27692	27806	27638	27638	He	532	" I did not know it . It was a guess that turned out to be correct . You observed that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle . That suggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy key - ring . Now , if it had been lost and recovered , Mrs. Inglethorp would at once have replaced it on her bunch ; but on her bunch I found what was obviously the duplicate key , very new and bright , which led me to the hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the lock of the despatch - case . "
27807	27810	27811	27811	I	0	" Yes , "
27814	27821	27811	27811	I	0	" Alfred Inglethorp , without doubt . "
27828	27837	27825	27825	me	0	" You are very sure of his guilt ? "
27838	27853	27825	27825	me	0	" Well , naturally . Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more clearly . "
27854	27859	27861	27861	Poirot	31	" On the contrary , "
27864	27873	27861	27861	Poirot	31	" there are several points in his favour . "
27874	27880	27825	27825	me	0	" Oh , come now ! "
27881	27884	27861	27861	Poirot	31	" Yes . "
27885	27891	27825	27825	me	0	" I see only one . "
27892	27896	27861	27861	Poirot	31	" And that ? "
27897	27908	27825	27825	me	0	" That he was not in the house last night . "
27909	27933	27861	27861	Poirot	31	" Bad shot ! ' as you English say ! You have chosen the one point that to my mind tells against him . "
27934	27939	27825	27825	me	0	" How is that ? "
27940	28002	27861	27861	Poirot	31	" Because if Mr. Inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last night , he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house . His excuse was an obviously trumped up one . That leaves us two possibilities : either he knew what was going to happen or he had a reason of his own for his absence . "
28003	28008	28009	28009	I	0	" And that reason ? "
28018	28053	28015	28015	his	31	" How should I know ? Discreditable , without doubt . This Mr. Inglethorp , I should say , is somewhat of a scoundrel but that does not of necessity make him a murderer . "
28061	28069	28071	28071	Poirot	31	" We do not agree , eh ? "
28073	28121	28071	28071	Poirot	31	" Well , let us leave it . Time will show which of us is right . Now let us turn to other aspects of the case . What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom were bolted on the inside ? "
28122	28124	28125	28125	I	0	" Well "
28128	28136	28125	28125	I	0	" One must look at it logically . "
28137	28140	28015	28015	his	31	" True . "
28141	28195	28125	28125	I	0	" I should put it this way . The doors _ were _ bolted our own eyes have told us that yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor , and the destruction of the will , prove that during the night someone entered the room . You agree so far ? "
28196	28206	28015	28015	his	31	" Perfectly . Put with admirable clearness . Proceed . "
28207	28210	28211	28211	I	0	" Well , "
28216	28275	28211	28211	I	0	" as the person who entered did not do so by the window , nor by miraculous means , it follows that the door must have been opened from inside by Mrs. Inglethorp herself . That strengthens the conviction that the person in question was her husband . She would naturally open the door to her own husband . "
28281	28326	28278	28278	his	31	" Why should she ? She had bolted the door leading into his room a most unusual proceeding on her part she had had a most violent quarrel with him that very afternoon . No , he was the last person she would admit . "
28327	28345	28278	28278	his	31	" But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by Mrs. Inglethorp herself ? "
28346	28383	28278	28278	his	31	" There is another possibility . She may have forgotten to bolt the door into the passage when she went to bed , and have got up later , towards morning , and bolted it then . "
28384	28393	28278	28278	his	31	" Poirot , is that seriously your opinion ? "
28394	28440	28278	28278	his	31	" No , I do not say it is so , but it might be . Now , to turn to another feature , what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard between Mrs. Cavendish and her mother - in - law ? "
28441	28447	28448	28448	I	0	" I had forgotten that , "
28452	28490	28448	28448	I	0	" That is as enigmatical as ever . It seems incredible that a woman like Mrs. Cavendish , proud and reticent to the last degree , should interfere so violently in what was certainly not her affair . "
28491	28508	28278	28278	his	31	" Precisely . It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to do . "
28509	28515	28516	28516	I	0	" It is certainly curious , "
28519	28534	28516	28516	I	0	" Still , it is unimportant , and need not be taken into account . "
28541	28569	28278	28278	his	31	" What have I always told you ? Everything must be taken into account . If the fact will not fit the theory let the theory go . "
28570	28577	28578	28578	I	0	" Well , we shall see , "
28583	28590	28278	28278	his	31	" Yes , we shall see . "
28723	28728	28729	28729	I	0	" Look , Poirot ! "
28736	28741	28742	28742	he	537	" _ Tiens ! _ "
28745	28762	28742	28742	he	537	" It is Mr. Mace , from the chemist 's shop . He is coming here . "
28787	28792	28794	28794	Poirot	31	" A little minute , "
28799	28803	28794	28794	Poirot	31	" I come . "
28828	28854	28811	28811	he	31	" Oh , Mr. Poirot , I 'm sorry for the inconvenience , but I heard that you 'd just come back from the Hall ? "
28855	28861	28811	28811	he	31	" Yes , we have . "
28876	28894	28895	28895	he	539	" It 's all over the village about old Mrs. Inglethorp dying so suddenly . They do say "
28900	28906	28897	28897	his	539	" that it 's poison ? "
28914	28926	28895	28895	he	539	" Only the doctors can tell us that , Mr. Mace . "
28927	28933	28934	28936	The young man	539	" Yes , exactly of course "
28964	28984	28958	28958	his	539	" Just tell me this , Mr. Poirot , it is n't it is n't strychnine , is it ? "
29018	29021	29022	29022	he	31	" Yes , "
29028	29039	29022	29022	he	31	" He will have evidence to give at the inquest . "
29063	29092	29053	29053	Poirot	31	" Not now , not now , _ mon ami _ . I have need of reflection . My mind is in some disorder which is not well . "
29133	29193	29127	29127	he	31	" It is well . The bad moment has passed . Now all is arranged and classified . One must never permit confusion . The case is not clear yet no . For it is of the most complicated ! It puzzles _ me _ . _ Me _ , Hercule Poirot ! There are two facts of significance . "
29194	29200	29127	29127	he	31	" And what are they ? "
29201	29217	29127	29127	he	31	" The first is the state of the weather yesterday . That is very important . "
29218	29226	29227	29227	I	0	" But it was a glorious day ! "
29230	29239	29227	29227	I	0	" Poirot , you 're pulling my leg ! "
29240	29271	29127	29127	he	31	" Not at all . The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade . Do not forget that , my friend . It is the key to the whole riddle ! "
29272	29278	29279	29279	I	0	" And the second point ? "
29282	29303	29127	29127	he	31	" The important fact that Monsieur Inglethorp wears very peculiar clothes , has a black beard , and uses glasses . "
29304	29315	29127	29127	he	31	" Poirot , I can not believe you are serious . "
29316	29325	29127	29127	he	31	" I am absolutely serious , my friend . "
29326	29332	29127	29127	he	31	" But this is childish ! "
29333	29341	29127	29127	he	31	" No , it is very momentous . "
29342	29367	29127	29127	he	31	" And supposing the Coroner 's jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder against Alfred Inglethorp . What becomes of your theories , then ? "
29368	29421	29422	29422	he	545	" They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to make a mistake ! But that will not occur . For one thing , a country jury is not anxious to take responsibility upon itself , and Mr. Inglethorp stands practically in the position of local squire . Also , "
29426	29435	29422	29422	he	545	" _ I _ should not allow it ! "
29436	29445	29453	29456	the extraordinary little man	546	" _ You _ would not allow it ? "
29446	29449	29422	29422	he	545	" No . "
29483	29500	29501	29501	He	546	" Oh , yes , _ mon ami _ , I would do what I say . "
29525	29565	29522	29522	his	546	" In all this , you see , I think of that poor Mrs. Inglethorp who is dead . She was not extravagantly loved no . But she was very good to us Belgians I owe her a debt . "
29576	29613	29522	29522	his	546	" Let me tell you this , Hastings . She would never forgive me if I let Alfred Inglethorp , her husband , be arrested _ now _ when a word from me could save him ! "
29759	29768	29769	29769	he	63	" You'm from the Hall , bain't you ? "
29772	29792	29728	29728	him	63	" Yes . I 'm looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked this way . "
29793	29814	29728	29728	him	63	" A little chap ? As waves his hands when he talks ? One of them Belgies from the village ? "
29815	29818	29819	29819	I	0	" Yes , "
29823	29831	29819	29819	I	0	" He has been here , then ? "
29832	29868	29870	29870	he	551	" Oh , ay , he 's been here , right enough . More'n once too . Friend of yours , is he ? Ah , you gentlemen from the Hall you'm a pretty lot ! "
29877	29890	29891	29891	I	0	" Why , do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often ? "
29906	29938	29900	29900	He	551	" _ One _ does , mister . Naming no names , mind . And a very liberal gentleman too ! Oh , thank you , sir , I 'm sure . "
30287	30301	30303	30304	the Coroner	1564	" Is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident ? "
30306	30336	30629	30629	me	0	" I should consider it very unlikely . Strychnine is not used for domestic purposes , as some poisons are , and there are restrictions placed on its sale . "
30337	30353	30629	30629	me	0	" Does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison was administered ? "
30354	30357	30629	30629	me	0	" No . "
30358	30370	30629	30629	me	0	" You arrived at Styles before Dr. Wilkins , I believe ? "
30371	30396	30629	30629	me	0	" That is so . The motor met me just outside the lodge gates , and I hurried there as fast as I could . "
30397	30408	30629	30629	me	0	" Will you relate to us exactly what happened next ? "
30409	30440	30629	30629	me	0	" I entered Mrs. Inglethorp 's room . She was at that moment in a typical tetanic convulsion . She turned towards me , and gasped out : Alfred Alfred ' "
30441	30465	30629	30629	me	0	" Could the strychnine have been administered in Mrs. Inglethorp 's after - dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband ? "
30466	30565	30629	30629	me	0	" Possibly , but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action . The symptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed . It is retarded under certain conditions , none of which , however , appear to have been present in this case . I presume Mrs. Inglethorp took the coffee after dinner about eight o'clock , whereas the symptoms did not manifest themselves until the early hours of the morning , which , on the face of it , points to the drug having been taken much later in the evening . "
30566	30595	30629	30629	me	0	" Mrs. Inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the middle of the night . Could the strychnine have been administered in that ? "
30596	30622	30629	30629	me	0	" No , I myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and had it analysed . There was no strychnine present . "
30631	30637	30638	30638	I	0	" How did you know ? "
30641	30644	30629	30629	me	0	" Listen . "
30645	30649	30650	30651	the doctor	319	" I should say "
30654	30667	30650	30651	the doctor	319	" that I would have been considerably surprised at any other result . "
30668	30671	30650	30651	the doctor	319	" Why ? "
30672	30715	30650	30651	the doctor	319	" Simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste . It can be detected in a solution of one in seventy thousand , and can only be disguised by some strongly flavoured substance . Cocoa would be quite powerless to mask it . "
30731	30751	30718	30719	the jury	557	" No . Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover the taste of strychnine . "
30752	30779	30832	30832	he	66	" Then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the coffee , but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed . "
30780	30800	30718	30719	the jury	557	" Yes , but , the cup being completely smashed , there is no possibility of analyzing its contents . "
30911	30923	30903	30903	he	66	" I should like to make a suggestion if I may ? "
30935	30963	30924	30924	He	66	" Certainly , Mr. Cavendish , we are here to arrive at the truth of this matter , and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation . "
30964	30973	30975	30975	Lawrence	52	" It is just an idea of mine , "
30977	31005	30975	30975	Lawrence	52	" Of course I may be quite wrong , but it still seems to me that my mother 's death might be accounted for by natural means . "
31006	31017	30924	30924	He	66	" How do you make that out , Mr. Cavendish ? "
31018	31043	30975	30975	Lawrence	52	" My mother , at the time of her death , and for some time before it , was taking a tonic containing strychnine . "
31044	31047	31049	31050	the Coroner	1564	" Ah ! "
31059	31063	31065	31065	Lawrence	52	" I believe , "
31067	31111	31065	31065	Lawrence	52	" that there have been cases where the cumulative effect of a drug , administered for some time , has ended by causing death . Also , is it not possible that she may have taken an overdose of her medicine by accident ? "
31112	31142	31052	31053	The jury	557	" This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at the time of her death . We are much obliged to you , Mr. Cavendish . "
31152	31224	30975	30975	Lawrence	52	" What Mr. Cavendish suggests is quite impossible . Any doctor would tell you the same . Strychnine is , in a certain sense , a cumulative poison , but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in this way . There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms which would at once have attracted my attention . The whole thing is absurd . "
31225	31241	31379	31380	the doctor	319	" And the second suggestion ? That Mrs. Inglethorp may have inadvertently taken an overdose ? "
31242	31311	30975	30975	Lawrence	52	" Three , or even four doses , would not have resulted in death . Mrs. Inglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a time , as she dealt with Coot 's , the Cash Chemists in Tadminster . She would have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the amount of strychnine found at the post - mortem . "
31312	31334	31379	31380	the doctor	319	" Then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any way instrumental in causing her death ? "
31335	31343	30975	30975	Lawrence	52	" Certainly . The supposition is ridiculous . "
31367	31377	31379	31380	the doctor	319	" That , of course , is always possible , "
31571	31582	31584	31585	the Coroner	1564	" That would have been the table by the bed ? "
31587	31593	31595	31595	Mary	41	" I opened my door , "
31597	31637	31595	31595	Mary	41	" and listened . In a few minutes a bell rang violently . Dorcas came running down and woke my husband , and we all went to my mother - in - law 's room , but it was locked "
31643	31690	31701	31701	her	41	" I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point . We know all that can be known of the subsequent happenings . But I should be obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the day before . "
31691	31694	31701	31701	her	41	" I ? "
31738	31744	31701	31701	her	41	" She is gaining time ! "
31745	31751	31753	31754	the Coroner	1564	" Yes . I understand , "
31757	31783	31753	31754	the Coroner	1564	" that you were sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the boudoir . That is so , is it not ? "
31823	31830	31820	31820	she	41	" Yes , that is so . "
31831	31843	31820	31820	she	41	" And the boudoir window was open , was it not ? "
31855	31858	31852	31852	she	41	" Yes . "
31859	31896	31852	31852	she	41	" Then you can not have failed to hear the voices inside , especially as they were raised in anger . In fact , they would be more audible where you were than in the hall . "
31897	31900	31852	31852	she	41	" Possibly . "
31901	31914	31852	31852	she	41	" Will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel ? "
31915	31924	31852	31852	she	41	" I really do not remember hearing anything . "
31925	31937	31852	31852	she	41	" Do you mean to say you did not hear voices ? "
31938	31957	31965	31965	her	41	" Oh , yes , I heard the voices , but I did not hear what they said . "
31968	31981	31965	31965	her	41	" I am not in the habit of listening to private conversations . "
31986	32020	31982	31983	The Coroner	1564	" And you remember nothing at all ? _ Nothing _ , Mrs. Cavendish ? Not one stray word or phrase to make you realize that it _ was _ a private conversation ? "
32036	32060	32021	32021	She	41	" Yes ; I remember . Mrs. Inglethorp said something I do not remember exactly what about causing scandal between husband and wife . "
32061	32064	32065	32066	the Coroner	1564	" Ah ! "
32071	32107	32065	32066	the Coroner	1564	" That corresponds with what Dorcas heard . But excuse me , Mrs. Cavendish , although you realized it was a private conversation , you did not move away ? You remained where you were ? "
32151	32170	32146	32146	she	41	" No . I was very comfortable where I was . I fixed my mind on my book . "
32171	32181	32146	32146	she	41	" And that is all you can tell us ? "
32182	32187	32146	32146	she	41	" That is all . "
32316	32325	32335	32336	The Coroner	1564	" You did not hear the table fall ? "
32326	32334	32376	32376	her	33	" No . I was fast asleep . "
32339	32348	32349	32349	he	1564	" A good conscience makes a sound sleeper , "
32352	32363	32349	32349	he	1564	" Thank you , Miss Murdoch , that is all . "
32364	32368	32376	32376	her	33	" Miss Howard . "
32475	32485	32487	32488	the Coroner	1564	" I fear it does not help us much , "
32494	32508	32487	32488	the Coroner	1564	" There is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon . "
32509	32517	32519	32520	Miss Howard	40	" Plain as a pikestaff to me , "
32523	32545	32519	32520	Miss Howard	40	" It shows clearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she 'd been made a fool of ! "
32546	32557	32558	32559	the Coroner	1564	" It says nothing of the kind in the letter , "
32563	32619	32641	32643	a public character	601	" No , because Emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong . But _ I _ know her . She wanted me back . But she was n't going to own that I 'd been right . She went round about . Most people do . Do n't believe in it myself . "
32645	32658	32660	32661	the lady	507	" Anyway , all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time , "
32671	32684	32660	32661	the lady	507	" Talk talk talk ! When all the time we know perfectly well "
32695	32706	32685	32686	The Coroner	1564	" Thank you , Miss Howard , that is all . "
32799	32813	32761	32763	a qualified pharmacist	611	" Mr. Mace , have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person ? "
32814	32819	32761	32763	a qualified pharmacist	611	" Yes , sir . "
32820	32825	32761	32763	a qualified pharmacist	611	" When was this ? "
32826	32831	32761	32763	a qualified pharmacist	611	" Last Monday night . "
32832	32838	32761	32763	a qualified pharmacist	611	" Monday ? Not Tuesday ? "
32839	32849	32761	32763	a qualified pharmacist	611	" No , sir , Monday , the 16th . "
32850	32861	32761	32763	a qualified pharmacist	611	" Will you tell us to whom you sold it ? "
32870	32881	32761	32763	a qualified pharmacist	611	" Yes , sir . It was to Mr. Inglethorp . "
32943	32952	32954	32955	the Coroner	1564	" You are sure of what you say ? "
32958	32964	32954	32955	the Coroner	1564	" Quite sure , sir . "
32965	32979	32954	32955	the Coroner	1564	" Are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the counter ? "
32992	33031	32954	32955	the Coroner	1564	" Oh , no , sir of course not . But , seeing it was Mr. Inglethorp of the Hall , I thought there was no harm in it . He said it was to poison a dog . "
33045	33048	32954	32955	the Coroner	1564	" The Hall "
33066	33080	32954	32955	the Coroner	1564	" Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book ? "
33081	33091	32954	32955	the Coroner	1564	" Yes , sir , Mr. Inglethorp did so . "
33092	33100	32954	32955	the Coroner	1564	" Have you got the book here ? "
33101	33106	32954	32955	the Coroner	1564	" Yes , sir . "
33167	33185	33159	33160	The Coroner	1564	" On Monday evening last , did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of poisoning a dog ? "
33192	33217	33186	33186	Inglethorp	44	" No , I did not . There is no dog at Styles , except an outdoor sheepdog , which is in perfect health . "
33218	33232	33159	33160	The Coroner	1564	" You deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert Mace on Monday last ? "
33233	33237	33186	33186	Inglethorp	44	" I do . "
33238	33247	33159	33160	The Coroner	1564	" Do you also deny _ this _ ? "
33261	33281	33186	33186	Inglethorp	44	" Certainly I do . The hand - writing is quite different from mine . I will show you . "
33311	33323	33294	33294	his	37	" Then what is your explanation of Mr. Mace 's statement ? "
33329	33337	33324	33325	Alfred Inglethorp	37	" Mr. Mace must have been mistaken . "
33349	33377	33338	33339	The Coroner	1564	" Mr. Inglethorp , as a mere matter of form , would you mind telling us where you were on the evening of Monday , July 16th ? "
33378	33385	33294	33294	his	37	" Really I can not remember . "
33386	33394	33396	33397	the Coroner	1564	" That is absurd , Mr. Inglethorp , "
33400	33404	33396	33397	the Coroner	1564	" Think again . "
33410	33427	33294	33294	his	37	" I can not tell you . I have an idea that I was out walking . "
33428	33433	33294	33294	his	37	" In what direction ? "
33434	33441	33294	33294	his	37	" I really ca n't remember . "
33449	33457	33407	33407	his	37	" Were you in company with anyone ? "
33458	33461	33407	33407	his	37	" No . "
33462	33471	33407	33407	his	37	" Did you meet anyone on your walk ? "
33472	33475	33407	33407	his	37	" No . "
33476	33482	33484	33485	the Coroner	1564	" That is a pity , "
33488	33520	33484	33485	the Coroner	1564	" I am to take it then that you decline to say where you were at the time that Mr. Mace positively recognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine ? "
33521	33533	33407	33407	his	37	" If you like to take it that way , yes . "
33534	33541	33484	33485	the Coroner	1564	" Be careful , Mr. Inglethorp . "
33547	33552	33553	33553	he	63	" _ Sacr ! _ "
33556	33570	33553	33553	he	63	" Does this imbecile of a man _ want _ to be arrested ? "
33610	33622	33553	33553	he	63	" You had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon ? "
33623	33627	33629	33630	Alfred Inglethorp	37	" Pardon me , "
33632	33664	33629	33630	Alfred Inglethorp	37	" you have been misinformed . I had no quarrel with my dear wife . The whole story is absolutely untrue . I was absent from the house the entire afternoon . "
33665	33675	33553	33553	he	63	" Have you anyone who can testify to that ? "
33676	33682	33684	33684	Inglethorp	44	" You have my word , "
33695	33712	33553	33553	he	63	" There are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your disagreement with Mrs. Inglethorp . "
33713	33719	33724	33725	The man	1112	" Those witnesses were mistaken . "
33767	33771	33773	33774	the Coroner	1564	" Mr. Inglethorp , "
33776	33796	33773	33774	the Coroner	1564	" you have heard your wife 's dying words repeated here . Can you explain them in any way ? "
33797	33802	33748	33748	his	63	" Certainly I can . "
33803	33807	33773	33774	the Coroner	1564	" You can ? "
33808	33860	33748	33748	his	63	" It seems to me very simple . The room was dimly lighted . Dr. Bauerstein is much of my height and build , and , like me , wears a beard . In the dim light , and suffering as she was , my poor wife mistook him for me . "
33861	33864	33866	33866	Poirot	63	" Ah ! "
33870	33879	33866	33866	Poirot	63	" But it is an idea , that ! "
33880	33887	33888	33888	I	0	" You think it is true ? "
33891	33906	33748	33748	his	63	" I do not say that . But it is truly an ingenious supposition . "
33907	33918	33919	33919	Inglethorp	44	" You read my wife 's last words as an accusation "
33922	33935	33919	33919	Inglethorp	44	" they were , on the contrary , an appeal to me . "
33946	33970	33943	33943	he	1564	" I believe , Mr. Inglethorp , that you yourself poured out the coffee , and took it to your wife that evening ? "
33971	34034	33943	33943	he	1564	" I poured it out , yes . But I did not take it to her . I meant to do so , but I was told that a friend was at the hall door , so I laid down the coffee on the hall table . When I came through the hall again a few minutes later , it was gone . "
34128	34138	34120	34120	He	63	" Do you know who that little man is ? "
34144	34174	34122	34122	his	63	" That is Detective Inspector James Japp of Scotland Yard Jimmy Japp . The other man is from Scotland Yard too . Things are moving quickly , my friend . "
34221	34231	34210	34210	I	0	" Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown . "
34297	34309	34294	34295	the two	646	" I fear you do not remember me , Inspector Japp . "
34310	34320	34322	34323	the Inspector	647	" Why , if it is n't Mr. Poirot ! "
34332	34414	34325	34325	He	647	" You 've heard me speak of Mr. Poirot ? It was in 1904 he and I worked together the Abercrombie forgery case you remember , he was run down in Brussels . Ah , those were great days , moosier . Then , do you remember Baron ' Altara ? There was a pretty rogue for you ! He eluded the clutches of half the police in Europe . But we nailed him in Antwerp thanks to Mr. Poirot here . "
34453	34466	34468	34468	Poirot	85	" I need hardly ask what you are doing here , gentlemen , "
34476	34488	34447	34448	his companion	650	" No , indeed . Pretty clear case I should say . "
34494	34501	34490	34490	Poirot	85	" There I differ from you . "
34502	34507	34509	34509	Summerhaye	94	" Oh , come ! "
34519	34547	34509	34509	Summerhaye	94	" Surely the whole thing is clear as daylight . The man 's caught red - handed . How he could be such a fool beats me ! "
34556	34563	34564	34564	he	92	" Hold your fire , Summerhaye , "
34568	34612	34564	34564	he	92	" Me and Moosier here have met before and there 's no man 's judgment I 'd sooner take than his . If I 'm not greatly mistaken , he 's got something up his sleeve . Is n't that so , moosier ? "
34616	34624	34564	34564	he	92	" I have drawn certain conclusions yes . "
34640	34646	34647	34647	he	92	" It 's this way , "
34650	34855	34647	34647	he	92	" so far , we 've only seen the case from the outside . That 's where the Yard 's at a disadvantage in a case of this kind , where the murder 's only out , so to speak , after the inquest . A lot depends on being on the spot first thing , and that 's where Mr. Poirot 's had the start of us . We should n't have been here as soon as this even , if it had n't been for the fact that there was a smart doctor on the spot , who gave us the tip through the Coroner . But you 've been on the spot from the first , and you may have picked up some little hints . From the evidence at the inquest , Mr. Inglethorp murdered his wife as sure as I stand here , and if anyone but you hinted the contrary I 'd laugh in his face . I must say I was surprised the jury did n't bring it in Wilful Murder against him right off . I think they would have , if it had n't been for the Coroner he seemed to be holding them back . "
34856	34873	34875	34875	Poirot	85	" Perhaps , though , you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket now , "
34892	34903	34904	34904	he	92	" Perhaps I have , and perhaps I have n't , "
34914	34929	34908	34908	Poirot	85	" I am very anxious , Messieurs , that he should not be arrested . "
34930	34935	34937	34937	Summerhaye	94	" I dare say , "
34948	34991	34908	34908	Poirot	85	" Ca n't you go a little further , Mr. Poirot ? A wink 's as good as a nod from you . You 've been on the spot and the Yard does n't want to make any mistakes , you know . "
34996	35042	35044	35044	he	92	" That is exactly what I thought . Well , I will tell you this . Use your warrant : Arrest Mr. Inglethorp . But it will bring you no kudos the case against him will be dismissed at once ! _ Comme a ! _ "
35097	35143	35083	35083	Japp	92	" I dare n't do it , Mr. Poirot . _ I_'d take your word , but there 's others over me who 'll be asking what the devil I mean by it . Ca n't you give me a little more to go on ? "
35149	35155	35156	35156	he	85	" It can be done , "
35161	35247	35156	35156	he	85	" I admit I do not wish it . It forces my hand . I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the present , but what you say is very just the word of a Belgian policeman , whose day is past , is not enough ! And Alfred Inglethorp must not be arrested . That I have sworn , as my friend Hastings here knows . See , then , my good Japp , you go at once to Styles ? "
35248	35267	35083	35083	Japp	92	" Well , in about half an hour . We 're seeing the Coroner and the doctor first . "
35268	35331	35156	35156	he	85	" Good . Call for me in passing the last house in the village . I will go with you . At Styles , Mr. Inglethorp will give you , or if he refuses as is probable I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the case against him could not possibly be sustained . Is that a bargain ? "
35332	35338	35340	35340	Japp	92	" That 's a bargain , "
35343	35395	35340	35340	Japp	92	" And , on behalf of the Yard , I 'm much obliged to you , though I 'm bound to confess I ca n't at present see the faintest possible loop - hole in the evidence , but you always were a marvel ! So long , then , moosier . "
35411	35417	35419	35419	Poirot	85	" Well , my friend , "
35429	35483	35419	35419	Poirot	85	" what do you think ? _ Mon Dieu ! _ I had some warm moments in that court ; I did not figure to myself that the man would be so pig - headed as to refuse to say anything at all . Decidedly , it was the policy of an imbecile . "
35484	35496	35497	35497	I	0	" H'm ! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility , "
35500	35520	35497	35497	I	0	" For , if the case against him is true , how could he defend himself except by silence ? "
35521	35530	35532	35532	Poirot	85	" Why , in a thousand ingenious ways , "
35534	35567	35532	35532	Poirot	85	" See ; say that it is I who have committed this murder , I can think of seven most plausible stories ! Far more convincing than Mr. Inglethorp 's stony denials ! "
35574	35621	35497	35497	I	0	" My dear Poirot , I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy ! But , seriously , in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives , you surely can not still believe in the possibility of Alfred Inglethorp 's innocence ? "
35622	35635	35497	35497	I	0	" Why not now as much as before ? Nothing has changed . "
35636	35644	35497	35497	I	0	" But the evidence is so conclusive . "
35645	35651	35497	35497	I	0	" Yes , too conclusive . "
35670	35678	35680	35680	Poirot	85	" Yes , yes , too conclusive , "
35686	35734	35680	35680	Poirot	85	" Real evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory . It has to be examined sifted . But here the whole thing is cut and dried . No , my friend , this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured so cleverly that it has defeated its own ends . "
35735	35743	35652	35652	We	652	" How do you make that out ? "
35744	35788	35680	35680	Poirot	85	" Because , so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible , it was very hard to disprove . But , in his anxiety , the criminal has drawn the net so closely that one cut will set Inglethorp free . "
35803	35999	35800	35800	Poirot	85	" Let us look at the matter like this . Here is a man , let us say , who sets out to poison his wife . He has lived by his wits as the saying goes . Presumably , therefore , he has some wits . He is not altogether a fool . Well , how does he set about it ? He goes boldly to the village chemist 's and purchases strychnine under his own name , with a trumped up story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd . He does not employ the poison that night . No , he waits until he has had a violent quarrel with her , of which the whole household is cognisant , and which naturally directs their suspicions upon him . He prepares no defence no shadow of an alibi , yet he knows the chemist 's assistant must necessarily come forward with the facts . Bah ! Do not ask me to believe that any man could be so idiotic ! Only a lunatic , who wished to commit suicide by causing himself to be hanged , would act so ! "
36000	36006	36007	36007	I	0	" Still I do not see "
36010	36035	35800	35800	Poirot	85	" Neither do I see . I tell you , _ mon ami _ , it puzzles me . _ Me _ Hercule Poirot ! "
36036	36053	35800	35800	Poirot	85	" But if you believe him innocent , how do you explain his buying the strychnine ? "
36054	36066	35800	35800	Poirot	85	" Very simply . He did _ not _ buy it . "
36067	36073	35800	35800	Poirot	85	" But Mace recognized him ! "
36074	36153	35800	35800	Poirot	85	" I beg your pardon , he saw a man with a black beard like Mr. Inglethorp 's , and wearing glasses like Mr. Inglethorp , and dressed in Mr. Inglethorp 's rather noticeable clothes . He could not recognize a man whom he had probably only seen in the distance , since , you remember , he himself had only been in the village a fortnight , and Mrs. Inglethorp dealt principally with Coot 's in Tadminster . "
36154	36158	35800	35800	Poirot	85	" Then you think "
36159	36189	35800	35800	Poirot	85	" _ Mon ami _ , do you remember the two points I laid stress upon ? Leave the first one for the moment , what was the second ? "
36190	36210	36211	36211	I	0	" The important fact that Alfred Inglethorp wears peculiar clothes , has a black beard , and uses glasses , "
36214	36236	35800	35800	Poirot	85	" Exactly . Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as John or Lawrence Cavendish . Would it be easy ? "
36237	36240	36241	36241	I	0	" No , "
36245	36250	36241	36241	I	0	" Of course an actor "
36258	36495	36254	36254	me	0	" And why would it not be easy ? I will tell you , my friend : Because they are both clean - shaven men . To make up successfully as one of these two in broad daylight , it would need an actor of genius , and a certain initial facial resemblance . But in the case of Alfred Inglethorp , all that is changed . His clothes , his beard , the glasses which hide his eyes those are the salient points about his personal appearance . Now , what is the first instinct of the criminal ? To divert suspicion from himself , is it not so ? And how can he best do that ? By throwing it on someone else . In this instance , there was a man ready to his hand . Everybody was predisposed to believe in Mr. Inglethorp 's guilt . It was a foregone conclusion that he would be suspected ; but , to make it a sure thing there must be tangible proof such as the actual buying of the poison , and that , with a man of the peculiar appearance of Mr. Inglethorp , was not difficult . Remember , this young Mace had never actually spoken to Mr. Inglethorp . How should he doubt that the man in his clothes , with his beard and his glasses , was not Alfred Inglethorp ? "
36496	36502	36503	36503	I	0	" It may be so , "
36512	36536	36503	36503	I	0	" But , if that was the case , why does he not say where he was at six o'clock on Monday evening ? "
36537	36543	36545	36545	Poirot	63	" Ah , why indeed ? "
36550	36626	36545	36545	Poirot	63	" If he were arrested , he probably would speak , but I do not want it to come to that . I must make him see the gravity of his position . There is , of course , something discreditable behind his silence . If he did not murder his wife , he is , nevertheless , a scoundrel , and has something of his own to conceal , quite apart from the murder . "
36627	36633	36634	36634	I	0	" What can it be ? "
36662	36668	36670	36670	Poirot	63	" Can you not guess ? "
36674	36680	36545	36545	Poirot	63	" No , can you ? "
36681	36702	36717	36717	his	63	" Oh , yes , I had a little idea sometime ago and it has turned out to be correct . "
36703	36709	36710	36710	I	0	" You never told me , "
36721	36738	36739	36739	He	63	" Pardon me , _ mon ami _ , you were not precisely _ sympathique _ . "
36745	36758	36739	36739	He	63	" Tell me you see now that he must not be arrested ? "
36759	36762	36763	36763	I	0	" Perhaps , "
36804	36810	36811	36811	he	63	" Come , my friend , "
36818	36834	36811	36811	he	63	" apart from Mr. Inglethorp , how did the evidence at the inquest strike you ? "
36835	36844	36885	36885	I	0	" Oh , pretty much what I expected . "
36845	36855	36811	36811	he	63	" Did nothing strike you as peculiar about it ? "
36867	36872	36885	36885	I	0	" In what way ? "
36873	36884	36885	36885	I	0	" Well , Mr. Lawrence Cavendish 's evidence for instance ? "
36889	36909	36811	36811	he	63	" Oh , Lawrence ! No , I do n't think so . He 's always a nervous chap . "
36910	36941	36811	36811	he	63	" His suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally by means of the tonic she was taking , that did not strike you as strange _ hein ? _ "
36942	36972	36811	36811	he	63	" No , I ca n't say it did . The doctors ridiculed it of course . But it was quite a natural suggestion for a layman to make . "
36973	37002	36811	36811	he	63	" But Monsieur Lawrence is not a layman . You told me yourself that he had started by studying medicine , and that he had taken his degree . "
37003	37016	37017	37017	I	0	" Yes , that 's true . I never thought of that . "
37022	37029	37017	37017	I	0	" It _ is _ odd . "
37033	37148	37030	37030	Poirot	63	" From the first , his behaviour has been peculiar . Of all the household , he alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine poisoning , and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold strenuously the theory of death from natural causes . If it had been Monsieur John , I could have understood it . He has no technical knowledge , and is by nature unimaginative . But Monsieur Lawrence no ! And now , to - day , he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have known was ridiculous . There is food for thought in this , _ mon ami ! _ "
37149	37155	37156	37156	I	0	" It 's very confusing , "
37159	37166	37168	37168	Poirot	63	" Then there is Mrs. Cavendish , "
37170	37190	37168	37168	Poirot	63	" That 's another who is not telling all she knows ! What do you make of her attitude ? "
37191	37221	37030	37030	Poirot	63	" I do n't know what to make of it . It seems inconceivable that she should be shielding Alfred Inglethorp . Yet that is what it looks like . "
37226	37256	37222	37222	Poirot	63	" Yes , it is queer . One thing is certain , she overheard a good deal more of that private conversation ' than she was willing to admit . "
37257	37273	37030	37030	Poirot	63	" And yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to eavesdrop ! "
37274	37315	37222	37222	Poirot	63	" Exactly . One thing her evidence _ has _ shown me . I made a mistake . Dorcas was quite right . The quarrel did take place earlier in the afternoon , about four o'clock , as she said . "
37332	37347	37349	37349	Poirot	63	" Yes , a good deal that was peculiar came out to - day , "
37351	37386	37349	37349	Poirot	63	" Dr. Bauerstein , now , what was _ he _ doing up and dressed at that hour in the morning ? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the fact . "
37387	37395	37396	37396	I	0	" He has insomnia , I believe , "
37400	37413	37415	37415	Poirot	63	" Which is a very good , or a very bad explanation , "
37417	37437	37415	37415	Poirot	63	" It covers everything , and explains nothing . I shall keep my eye on our clever Dr. Bauerstein . "
37438	37448	37449	37449	I	0	" Any more faults to find with the evidence ? "
37453	37459	37461	37461	Poirot	63	" _ Mon ami _ , "
37464	37509	37461	37461	Poirot	63	" when you find that people are not telling you the truth look out ! Now , unless I am much mistaken , at the inquest to - day only one at most , two persons were speaking the truth without reservation or subterfuge . "
37510	37543	37598	37598	her	654	" Oh , come now , Poirot ! I wo n't cite Lawrence , or Mrs. Cavendish . But there 's John and Miss Howard , surely they were speaking the truth ? "
37544	37561	37461	37461	Poirot	63	" Both of them , my friend ? One , I grant you , but both ! "
37625	37631	37617	37617	he	63	" foolishly pig - headed . "
37632	37639	37640	37640	I	0	" Do you really think so ? "
37643	37658	37640	37640	I	0	" Miss Howard had always seemed to me so essentially honest almost uncomfortably so . "
37683	37688	37689	37689	I	0	" Miss Murdoch too , "
37692	37702	37689	37689	I	0	" there 's nothing untruthful about _ her _ . "
37703	37739	37779	37779	his	63	" No . But it was strange that she never heard a sound , sleeping next door ; whereas Mrs. Cavendish , in the other wing of the building , distinctly heard the table fall . "
37740	37752	37689	37689	I	0	" Well , she 's young . And she sleeps soundly . "
37753	37770	37779	37779	his	63	" Ah , yes , indeed ! She must be a famous sleeper , that one ! "

38618	38621	38622	38622	he	63	" Speak ! "
38649	38655	38644	38644	he	63	" You will not speak ? "
38656	38678	38644	38644	he	63	" No . I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me of what you say . "
38692	38697	38698	38698	he	63	" _ Soit ! _ "
38701	38709	38698	38698	he	63	" Then I must speak for you . "
38716	38728	38729	38729	he	37	" You ? How can you speak ? You do not know "
38740	38867	38734	38734	Poirot	63	" _ Mesdames _ and _ messieurs _ ! I speak ! Listen ! I , Hercule Poirot , affirm that the man who entered the chemist 's shop , and purchased strychnine at six o'clock on Monday last was not Mr. Inglethorp , for at six o'clock on that day Mr. Inglethorp was escorting Mrs. Raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm . I can produce no less than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together , either at six or just after and , as you may know , the Abbey Farm , Mrs. Raikes 's home , is at least two and a half miles distant from the village . There is absolutely no question as to the alibi ! "

38907	38931	38904	38904	he	92	" you 're the goods ! And no mistake , Mr. Poirot ! These witnesses of yours are all right , I suppose ? "
38932	38964	38889	38891	any of us	683	" _ Voil ! _ I have prepared a list of them names and addresses . You must see them , of course . But you will find it all right . "
38965	38972	38973	38973	Japp	92	" I 'm sure of that . "
38978	38997	38975	38975	his	92	" I 'm much obliged to you . A pretty mare 's nest arresting him would have been . "
39003	39025	38998	38998	He	92	" But , if you 'll excuse me , sir , why could n't you say all this at the inquest ? "
39026	39033	39035	39035	Poirot	85	" I will tell you why , "
39037	39043	39035	39035	Poirot	85	" There was a certain rumour "
39044	39053	39055	39056	Alfred Inglethorp	37	" A most malicious and utterly untrue one , "
39062	39081	39035	39035	Poirot	85	" And Mr. Inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at present . Am I right ? "
39082	39086	39087	39087	Inglethorp	44	" Quite right . "
39090	39114	39087	39087	Inglethorp	44	" With my poor Emily not yet buried , can you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be started . "
39115	39123	39125	39125	Japp	92	" Between you and me , sir , "
39127	39181	39125	39125	Japp	92	" I 'd sooner have any amount of rumours than be arrested for murder . And I venture to think your poor lady would have felt the same . And , if it had n't been for Mr. Poirot here , arrested you would have been , as sure as eggs is eggs ! "
39182	39190	39192	39192	Inglethorp	44	" I was foolish , no doubt , "
39194	39211	39213	39213	he	92	" But you do not know , inspector , how I have been persecuted and maligned . "
39222	39227	39229	39229	Japp	92	" Now , sir , "
39236	39280	39229	39229	Japp	92	" I should like to see the lady 's bedroom , please , and after that I 'll have a little chat with the servants . Do n't you bother about anything . Mr. Poirot , here , will show me the way . "
39315	39341	39347	39347	he	85	" Quick , go to the other wing . Stand there just this side of the baize door . Do not move till I come . "
39468	39474	39443	39443	my	0	" You have not stirred ? "
39475	39490	39466	39466	me	0	" No , I 've stuck here like a rock . Nothing 's happened . "
39491	39494	39496	39496	he	85	" Ah ! "

39511	39514	39466	39466	me	0	" No . "
39515	39533	39466	39466	me	0	" But you have probably heard something ? A big bump eh , _ mon ami ? _ "
39534	39537	39466	39466	me	0	" No . "
39538	39564	39565	39565	I	0	" Is it possible ? Ah , but I am vexed with myself ! I am not usually clumsy . I made but a slight gesture "
39570	39585	39567	39567	Poirot	85	" with the left hand , and over went the table by the bed ! "
39602	39674	39600	39600	him	85	" Never mind , old chap . What does it matter ? Your triumph downstairs excited you . I can tell you , that was a surprise to us all . There must be more in this affair of Inglethorp 's with Mrs. Raikes than we thought , to make him hold his tongue so persistently . What are you going to do now ? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows ? "
39675	39701	39600	39600	him	85	" Gone down to interview the servants . I showed them all our exhibits . I am disappointed in Japp . He has no method ! "
39702	39705	39706	39706	I	0	" Hullo ! "
39715	39738	39706	39706	I	0	" Here 's Dr. Bauerstein . I believe you 're right about that man , Poirot . I do n't like him . "
39739	39744	39746	39746	Poirot	85	" He is clever , "
39749	39782	39784	39784	I	0	" Oh , clever as the devil ! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the plight he was in on Tuesday . You never saw such a spectacle ! "
39791	39806	39784	39784	I	0	" He looked a regular scarecrow ! Plastered with mud from head to foot . "
39807	39814	39786	39787	the doctor	319	" You saw him , then ? "
39815	39838	39784	39784	I	0	" Yes . Of course , he did n't want to come in it was just after dinner but Mr. Inglethorp insisted . "
39839	39842	39786	39787	the doctor	319	" What ? "
39851	39879	39843	39843	Poirot	85	" Was Dr. Bauerstein here on Tuesday evening ? Here ? And you never told me ? Why did you not tell me ? Why ? Why ? "
39889	39894	39895	39895	I	0	" My dear Poirot , "
39898	39917	39895	39895	I	0	" I never thought it would interest you . I did n't know it was of any importance . "
39918	39954	39880	39880	He	85	" Importance ? It is of the first importance ! So Dr. Bauerstein was here on Tuesday night the night of the murder . Hastings , do you not see ? That alters everything everything ! "
39982	39990	39969	39969	he	85	" Yes , that alters everything everything . "
40000	40005	40006	40006	he	85	" _ Allons ! _ "
40009	40021	40006	40006	he	85	" We must act at once . Where is Mr. Cavendish ? "
40036	40058	39992	39992	he	85	" Mr. Cavendish , I have some important business in Tadminster . A new clue . May I take your motor ? "
40059	40071	40034	40034	him	32	" Why , of course . Do you mean at once ? "
40072	40077	39992	39992	he	85	" If you please . "
40108	40113	40114	40114	I	0	" Now , Poirot , "
40118	40130	40114	40114	I	0	" perhaps you will tell me what all this is about ? "
40131	40332	39992	39992	he	85	" Well , _ mon ami _ , a good deal you can guess for yourself . Of course you realize that , now Mr. Inglethorp is out of it , the whole position is greatly changed . We are face to face with an entirely new problem . We know now that there is one person who did not buy the poison . We have cleared away the manufactured clues . Now for the real ones . I have ascertained that anyone in the household , with the exception of Mrs. Cavendish , who was playing tennis with you , could have personated Mr. Inglethorp on Monday evening . In the same way , we have his statement that he put the coffee down in the hall . No one took much notice of that at the inquest but now it has a very different significance . We must find out who did take that coffee to Mrs. Inglethorp eventually , or who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there . From your account , there are only two people whom we can positively say did not go near the coffee Mrs. Cavendish , and Mademoiselle Cynthia . "
40333	40340	40114	40114	I	0	" Yes , that is so . "
40359	40365	40367	40367	Poirot	85	" In clearing Alfred Inglethorp , "
40369	40415	40416	40416	He	85	" I have been obliged to show my hand sooner than I intended . As long as I might be thought to be pursuing him , the criminal would be off his guard . Now , he will be doubly careful . Yes doubly careful . "
40422	40437	40416	40416	He	85	" Tell me , Hastings , you yourself have you no suspicions of anybody ? "
40477	40486	40487	40487	I	0	" You could n't call it a suspicion , "
40490	40497	40487	40487	I	0	" It 's so utterly foolish . "
40498	40502	40504	40504	Poirot	85	" Come now , "
40507	40525	40504	40504	Poirot	85	" Do not fear . Speak your mind . You should always pay attention to your instincts . "
40526	40530	40531	40531	I	0	" Well then , "
40535	40551	40531	40531	I	0	" it 's absurd but I suspect Miss Howard of not telling all she knows ! "
40552	40556	40487	40487	I	0	" Miss Howard ? "
40557	40564	40531	40531	I	0	" Yes you 'll laugh at me "
40565	40574	40487	40487	I	0	" Not at all . Why should I ? "
40575	40582	40583	40583	I	0	" I ca n't help feeling , "
40587	40652	40583	40583	I	0	" that we 've rather left her out of the possible suspects , simply on the strength of her having been away from the place . But , after all , she was only fifteen miles away . A car would do it in half an hour . Can we say positively that she was away from Styles on the night of the murder ? "
40653	40659	40661	40661	Poirot	85	" Yes , my friend , "
40664	40684	40661	40661	Poirot	85	" we can . One of my first actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working . "
40685	40688	40583	40583	I	0	" Well ? "
40689	40733	40661	40661	Poirot	85	" Well , I learnt that Miss Howard had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday , and that a convoy coming in unexpectedly she had kindly offered to remain on night duty , which offer was gratefully accepted . That disposes of that . "
40734	40737	40738	40738	I	0	" Oh ! "
40744	40747	40748	40748	I	0	" Really , "
40751	40820	40748	40748	I	0	" it 's her extraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that started me off suspecting her . I ca n't help feeling she 'd do anything against him . And I had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the will . She might have burnt the new one , mistaking it for the earlier one in his favour . She is so terribly bitter against him . "
40821	40828	40854	40854	his	85	" You consider her vehemence unnatural ? "
40829	40851	40748	40748	I	0	" Y es . She is so very violent . I wondered really whether she is quite sane on that point . "
40858	40902	40854	40854	his	85	" No , no , you are on a wrong tack there . There is nothing weak - minded or degenerate about Miss Howard . She is an excellent specimen of well - balanced English beef and brawn . She is sanity itself . "
40903	40973	40748	40748	I	0	" Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seems almost a mania . My idea was a very ridiculous one , no doubt that she had intended to poison him and that , in some way , Mrs. Inglethorp got hold of it by mistake . But I do n't at all see how it could have been done . The whole thing is absurd and ridiculous to the last degree . "
40974	41023	40854	40854	his	85	" Still you are right in one thing . It is always wise to suspect everybody until you can prove logically , and to your own satisfaction , that they are innocent . Now , what reasons are there against Miss Howard 's having deliberately poisoned Mrs. Inglethorp ? "
41024	41033	41034	41034	I	0	" Why , she was devoted to her ! "
41037	41042	41044	41044	Poirot	85	" Tcha ! Tcha ! "
41047	41139	41140	41140	He	85	" You argue like a child . If Miss Howard were capable of poisoning the old lady , she would be quite equally capable of simulating devotion . No , we must look elsewhere . You are perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against Alfred Inglethorp is too violent to be natural ; but you are quite wrong in the deduction you draw from it . I have drawn my own deductions , which I believe to be correct , but I will not speak of them at present . "
41149	41171	41140	41140	He	85	" Now , to my way of thinking , there is one insuperable objection to Miss Howard 's being the murderess . "
41172	41177	41222	41222	his	85	" And that is ? "
41178	41202	41140	41140	He	85	" That in no possible way could Mrs. Inglethorp 's death benefit Miss Howard . Now there is no murder without a motive . "
41206	41219	41140	41140	He	85	" Could not Mrs. Inglethorp have made a will in her favour ? "
41225	41236	41222	41222	his	85	" But you yourself suggested that possibility to Mr. Wells ? "
41240	41281	41237	41237	Poirot	85	" That was for a reason . I did not want to mention the name of the person who was actually in my mind . Miss Howard occupied very much the same position , so I used her name instead . "
41282	41305	41357	41357	his	85	" Still , Mrs. Inglethorp might have done so . Why , that will , made on the afternoon of her death may "
41320	41354	41307	41307	Poirot	85	" No , my friend . I have certain little ideas of my own about that will . But I can tell you this much it was not in Miss Howard 's favour . "
41376	41379	41380	41380	I	0	" Well , "
41387	41425	41380	41380	I	0	" we will acquit Miss Howard , then . It is partly your fault that I ever came to suspect her . It was what you said about her evidence at the inquest that set me off . "
41430	41442	41357	41357	his	85	" What did I say about her evidence at the inquest ? "
41443	41461	41357	41357	his	85	" Do n't you remember ? When I cited her and John Cavendish as being above suspicion ? "
41462	41467	41468	41468	He	85	" Oh ah yes . "
41478	41496	41468	41468	He	85	" By the way , Hastings , there is something I want you to do for me . "
41497	41504	41357	41357	his	85	" Certainly . What is it ? "
41505	41539	41468	41468	He	85	" Next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish , I want you to say this to him . I have a message for you , from Poirot . He says : "
41554	41562	41357	41357	his	85	" ' Nothing more . Nothing less . "
41563	41583	41584	41584	I	0	" Find the extra coffee - cup , and you can rest in peace . ' Is that right ? "
41590	41593	41357	41357	his	85	" Excellent . "
41594	41601	41357	41357	his	85	" But what does it mean ? "
41602	41633	41357	41357	his	85	" Ah , that I will leave you to find out . You have access to the facts . Just say that to him , and see what he says . "
41634	41644	41357	41357	his	85	" Very well but it 's all extremely mysterious . "
41659	41663	41357	41357	his	85	" Analytical Chemist . "
41682	41685	41686	41686	he	85	" There , "
41689	41696	41686	41686	he	85	" That is all my business . "
41697	41704	41705	41705	I	0	" What were you doing there ? "
41712	41720	41357	41357	his	85	" I left something to be analysed . "
41721	41727	41357	41357	his	85	" Yes , but what ? "
41728	41742	41357	41357	his	85	" The sample of cocoa I took from the saucepan in the bedroom . "
41743	41751	41752	41752	I	0	" But that has already been tested ! "
41757	41778	41752	41752	I	0	" Dr. Bauerstein had it tested , and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there being strychnine in it . "
41779	41788	41790	41790	Poirot	85	" I know Dr. Bauerstein had it tested , "
41793	41798	41829	41829	him	85	" Well , then ? "
41799	41816	41829	41829	him	85	" Well , I have a fancy for having it analysed again , that is all . "
41946	41962	41964	41966	my honest friend	705	" And really it 's a great relief to think he 's going , Hastings , "
41968	42146	41964	41966	my honest friend	705	" It was bad enough before , when we thought he 'd done it , but I 'm hanged if it is n't worse now , when we all feel guilty for having been so down on the fellow . The fact is , we 've treated him abominably . Of course , things did look black against him . I do n't see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we did . Still , there it is , we were in the wrong , and now there 's a beastly feeling that one ought to make amends ; which is difficult , when one does n't like the fellow a bit better than one did before . The whole thing 's damned awkward ! And I 'm thankful he 's had the tact to take himself off . It 's a good thing Styles was n't the mater 's to leave to him . Could n't bear to think of the fellow lording it here . He 's welcome to her money . "
42147	42160	42161	42161	I	0	" You 'll be able to keep up the place all right ? "
42164	42244	41964	41966	my honest friend	705	" Oh , yes . There are the death duties , of course , but half my father 's money goes with the place , and Lawrence will stay with us for the present , so there is his share as well . We shall be pinched at first , of course , because , as I once told you , I am in a bit of a hole financially myself . Still , the Johnnies will wait now . "

42541	42563	42564	42564	I	0	" Well , it 's just this , sir . You 'll be seeing the Belgian gentleman to - day perhaps ? "
42567	42593	42564	42564	I	0	" Well , sir , you know how he asked me so particular if the mistress , or anyone else , had a green dress ? "

42610	42628	42629	42629	John	32	" No , not that , sir . But since then I 've remembered what the young gentlemen "

42641	42702	42629	42629	John	32	" call the dressing - up box . ' It 's up in the front attic , sir . A great chest , full of old clothes and fancy dresses , and what not . And it came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst them . So , if you 'd tell the Belgian gentleman "
42703	42711	42712	42712	I	0	" I will tell him , Dorcas , "
42715	42795	42834	42834	I	0	" Thank you very much , sir . A very nice gentleman he is , sir . And quite a different class from them two detectives from London , what goes prying about , and asking questions . I do n't hold with foreigners as a rule , but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave Belges is n't the ordinary run of foreigners , and certainly he 's a most polite spoken gentleman . "
42876	42902	42856	42856	him	85	" Ah , the brave Dorcas ! We will look at the chest , although but no matter we will examine it all the same . "
43015	43020	43010	43010	he	85	" What is it ? "
43021	43024	43010	43010	he	85	" Look ! "
43046	43051	43053	43053	Poirot	85	" _ Oh ! _ "
43055	43060	43053	43053	Poirot	85	" _ Oh ! _ "
43073	43076	43077	43077	he	85	" New , "
43080	43086	43077	43077	he	85	" Yes , quite new . "
43148	43188	43135	43135	Poirot	85	" We have been looking through that chest , Dorcas . I am much obliged to you for mentioning it . There is , indeed , a fine collection there . Are they often used , may I ask ? "
43189	43378	43114	43114	his	85	" Well , sir , not very often nowadays , though from time to time we do have what the young gentlemen call a dress - up night . ' And very funny it is sometimes , sir . Mr. Lawrence , he 's wonderful . Most comic ! I shall never forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia , I think he called it a sort of Eastern King it was . He had the big paper knife in his hand , and Mind , Dorcas , ' he says , you 'll have to be very respectful . This is my specially sharpened scimitar , and it 's off with your head if I 'm at all displeased with you ! ' Miss Cynthia , she was what they call an Apache , or some such name a Frenchified sort of cut - throat , I take it to be . A real sight she looked . You 'd never have believed a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into such a ruffian . Nobody would have known her . "
43379	43388	43390	43390	Poirot	85	" These evenings must have been great fun , "
43393	43415	43390	43390	Poirot	85	" I suppose Mr. Lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs , when he was Shah of Persia ? "
43416	43425	43427	43427	Dorcas	64	" He did have a beard , sir , "
43431	43536	43427	43427	Dorcas	64	" And well I know it , for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with ! And I 'm sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance . I did n't know as there was a beard up there at all . It must have been got quite lately , I think . There was a red wig , I know , but nothing else in the way of hair . Burnt corks they use mostly though tis messy getting it off again . Miss Cynthia was a nigger once , and , oh , the trouble she had . "
43537	43547	43549	43549	Poirot	85	" So Dorcas knows nothing about that black beard , "
43561	43572	43573	43573	I	0	" Do you think it is _ the _ one ? "
43580	43591	43427	43427	Dorcas	64	" I do . You notice it had been trimmed ? "
43592	43595	43427	43427	Dorcas	64	" No . "
43596	43627	43427	43427	Dorcas	64	" Yes . It was cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp 's , and I found one or two snipped hairs . Hastings , this affair is very deep . "
43628	43639	43427	43427	Dorcas	64	" Who put it in the chest , I wonder ? "
43640	43649	43651	43651	Poirot	85	" Someone with a good deal of intelligence , "
43654	43707	43651	43651	Poirot	85	" You realize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its presence would not be remarked ? Yes , he is intelligent . But we must be more intelligent . We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us of being intelligent at all . "
43711	43728	43762	43762	me	0	" There , _ mon ami _ , you will be of great assistance to me . "
43753	43756	43757	43757	he	85	" Yes , "
43765	43771	43757	43757	he	85	" you will be invaluable . "
43787	43797	43798	43798	he	85	" I must have an ally in the house , "
43802	43807	43808	43808	I	0	" You have me , "
43811	43820	43757	43757	he	85	" True , but you are not sufficient . "
43835	43866	43757	43757	he	85	" You do not quite take my meaning . You are known to be working with me . I want somebody who is not associated with us in any way . "
43867	43877	43833	43833	himself	85	" Oh , I see . How about John ? "
43878	43885	43757	43757	he	85	" No , I think not . "
43886	43896	43897	43897	I	0	" The dear fellow is n't perhaps very bright , "
43901	43907	43909	43909	Poirot	85	" Here comes Miss Howard , "
43912	43940	43909	43909	Poirot	85	" She is the very person . But I am in her black books , since I cleared Mr. Inglethorp . Still , we can but try . "
43978	43984	43986	43987	Miss Howard	40	" Well , Monsieur Poirot , "
43990	44003	43986	43987	Miss Howard	40	" what is it ? Out with it . I 'm busy . "
44004	44020	43973	43973	Poirot	85	" Do you remember , mademoiselle , that I once asked you to help me ? "
44021	44027	44028	44029	The lady	507	" Yes , I do . "
44032	44048	44028	44029	The lady	507	" And I told you I 'd help you with pleasure to hang Alfred Inglethorp . "
44049	44052	44053	44053	Poirot	31	" Ah ! "
44058	44079	44053	44053	Poirot	31	" Miss Howard , I will ask you one question . I beg of you to reply to it truthfully . "
44080	44085	44087	44088	Miss Howard	40	" Never tell lies , "
44090	44108	44053	44053	Poirot	31	" It is this . Do you still believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband ? "
44109	44115	44116	44116	she	507	" What do you mean ? "
44120	44171	44116	44116	she	507	" You need n't think your pretty explanations influence me in the slightest . I 'll admit that it was n't he who bought strychnine at the chemist 's shop . What of that ? I dare say he soaked fly paper , as I told you at the beginning . "
44172	44179	44181	44181	Poirot	31	" That is arsenic not strychnine , "
44184	44228	44116	44116	she	507	" What does that matter ? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way just as well as strychnine . If I 'm convinced he did it , it does n't matter a jot to me _ how _ he did it . "
44229	44242	44244	44244	Poirot	31	" Exactly . _ If _ you are convinced he did it , "
44247	44275	44244	44244	Poirot	31	" I will put my question in another form . Did you ever in your heart of hearts believe that Mrs. Inglethorp was poisoned by her husband ? "
44276	44280	44282	44283	Miss Howard	40	" Good heavens ! "
44285	44321	44282	44283	Miss Howard	40	" Have n't I always told you the man is a villain ? Have n't I always told you he would murder her in her bed ? Have n't I always hated him like poison ? "
44322	44325	44327	44327	Poirot	31	" Exactly , "
44329	44338	44327	44327	Poirot	31	" That bears out my little idea entirely . "
44339	44344	44116	44116	she	507	" What little idea ? "
44345	44431	44327	44327	Poirot	31	" Miss Howard , do you remember a conversation that took place on the day of my friend 's arrival here ? He repeated it to me , and there is a sentence of yours that has impressed me very much . Do you remember affirming that if a crime had been committed , and anyone you loved had been murdered , you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the criminal was , even if you were quite unable to prove it ? "
44432	44452	44116	44116	she	507	" Yes , I remember saying that . I believe it too . I suppose you think it nonsense ? "
44453	44458	44327	44327	Poirot	31	" Not at all . "
44459	44474	44116	44116	she	507	" And yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred Inglethorp . "
44475	44478	44480	44480	Poirot	31	" No , "
44483	44493	44480	44480	Poirot	31	" Because your instinct is not against Mr. Inglethorp . "
44494	44497	44116	44116	she	507	" What ? "
44498	44538	44480	44480	Poirot	31	" No . You wish to believe he committed the crime . You believe him capable of committing it . But your instinct tells you he did not commit it . It tells you more shall I go on ? "
44557	44605	44543	44543	him	735	" Shall I tell you why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp ? It is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe . It is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct , which tells you another name "
44606	44613	44615	44616	Miss Howard	40	" No , no , no ! "
44624	44665	44615	44616	Miss Howard	40	" Do n't say it ! Oh , do n't say it ! It is n't true ! It ca n't be true . I do n't know what put such a wild such a dreadful idea into my head ! "
44666	44675	44677	44677	Poirot	31	" I am right , am I not ? "
44679	44715	44615	44616	Miss Howard	40	" Yes , yes ; you must be a wizard to have guessed . But it ca n't be so it 's too monstrous , too impossible . It _ must _ be Alfred Inglethorp . "
44722	44730	44732	44733	Miss Howard	40	" Do n't ask me about it , "
44735	44764	44732	44733	Miss Howard	40	" because I sha n't tell you . I wo n't admit it , even to myself . I must be mad to think of such a thing . "
44772	44810	44765	44765	Poirot	31	" I will ask you nothing . It is enough for me that it is as I thought . And I I , too , have an instinct . We are working together towards a common end . "
44811	44833	44834	44834	She	736	" Do n't ask me to help you , because I wo n't . I would n't lift a finger to to "
44837	44879	44765	44765	Poirot	31	" You will help me in spite of yourself . I ask you nothing but you will be my ally . You will not be able to help yourself . You will do the only thing that I want of you . "
44880	44885	44765	44765	Poirot	31	" And that is ? "
44886	44891	44765	44765	Poirot	31	" You will watch ! "
44898	44920	44765	44765	Poirot	31	" Yes , I ca n't help doing that . I am always watching always hoping I shall be proved wrong . "
44921	44931	44933	44933	Poirot	31	" If we are wrong , well and good , "
44935	44968	44933	44933	Poirot	31	" No one will be more pleased than I shall . But , if we are right ? If we are right , Miss Howard , on whose side are you then ? "
44969	44979	44765	44765	Poirot	31	" I do n't know , I do n't know "
44980	44984	44933	44933	Poirot	31	" Come now . "
44985	44992	44765	44765	Poirot	31	" It could be hushed up . "
44993	45001	44933	44933	Poirot	31	" There must be no hushing up . "
45002	45006	45007	45007	She	36	" But Emily herself "
45011	45015	45017	45017	Poirot	31	" Miss Howard , "
45020	45027	45017	45017	Poirot	31	" this is unworthy of you . "
45037	45040	45041	45041	she	36	" Yes , "
45045	45054	45055	45055	She	36	" that was not Evelyn Howard who spoke ! "
45062	45087	45055	45055	She	36	" _ This _ is Evelyn Howard ! And she is on the side of Justice ! Let the cost be what it may . "
45101	45104	45106	45106	Poirot	31	" There , "
45112	45133	45106	45106	Poirot	31	" goes a very valuable ally . That woman , Hastings , has got brains as well as a heart . "
45139	45146	45148	45148	Poirot	31	" Instinct is a marvellous thing , "
45150	45159	45148	45148	Poirot	31	" It can neither be explained nor ignored . "
45160	45174	45175	45175	I	0	" You and Miss Howard seem to know what you are talking about , "
45179	45195	45175	45175	I	0	" Perhaps you do n't realize that _ I _ am still in the dark . "
45196	45208	45238	45238	his	31	" Really ? Is that so , _ mon ami ? _ "
45209	45218	45175	45175	I	0	" Yes . Enlighten me , will you ? "
45242	45248	45238	45238	his	31	" No , my friend . "
45249	45258	45238	45238	his	31	" Oh , look here , why not ? "
45259	45267	45238	45238	his	31	" Two is enough for a secret . "
45268	45284	45238	45238	his	31	" Well , I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me . "
45285	45321	45238	45238	his	31	" I am not keeping back facts . Every fact that I know is in your possession . You can draw your own deductions from them . This time it is a question of ideas . "
45322	45332	45238	45238	his	31	" Still , it would be interesting to know . "
45346	45350	45351	45351	he	31	" You see , "
45355	45363	45351	45351	he	31	" _ you _ have no instincts . "
45364	45374	45375	45375	I	0	" It was intelligence you were requiring just now , "
45379	45386	45388	45388	Poirot	31	" The two often go together , "
45595	45603	45604	45604	I	0	" I 've been looking for you , "
45608	45612	45593	45593	him	31	" Have you ? "
45613	45630	45659	45659	him	31	" Yes . The truth is , I 've got a message for you from Poirot . "
45631	45634	45593	45593	him	31	" Yes ? "
45635	45648	45649	45649	I	0	" He told me to wait until I was alone with you , "
45687	45690	45666	45666	my	0	" Well ? "
45715	45721	45722	45722	I	0	" This is the message . "
45729	45745	45722	45722	I	0	" Find the extra coffee - cup , and you can rest in peace . ' "
45746	45754	45755	45755	Lawrence	52	" What on earth does he mean ? "
45764	45770	45722	45722	I	0	" Do n't you know ? "
45771	45780	45722	45722	I	0	" Not in the least . Do you ? "
45789	45796	45722	45722	I	0	" What extra coffee - cup ? "
45797	45803	45722	45722	I	0	" I do n't know . "
45804	45877	45722	45722	I	0	" He 'd better ask Dorcas , or one of the maids , if he wants to know about coffee - cups . It 's their business , not mine . I do n't know anything about the coffee - cups , except that we 've got some that are never used , which are a perfect dream ! Old Worcester . You 're not a connoisseur , are you , Hastings ? "
45883	45911	45878	45878	I	0	" You miss a lot . A really perfect bit of old china it 's pure delight to handle it , or even to look at it . "
45912	45922	45958	45958	he	744	" Well , what am I to tell Poirot ? "
45923	45943	45878	45878	I	0	" Tell him I do n't know what he 's talking about . It 's double Dutch to me . "
45944	45948	45958	45958	he	744	" All right . "
45964	45984	46020	46020	his	744	" I say , what was the end of that message ? Say it over again , will you ? "
45985	46012	46013	46013	I	0	" Find the extra coffee - cup , and you can rest in peace . ' Are you sure you do n't know what it means ? "
46023	46026	46027	46027	he	744	" No , "
46031	46042	46027	46027	he	744	" I do n't . I I wish I did . "
46127	46144	46145	46145	Poirot	31	" Pardon me , madame , for recalling unpleasant memories , but I have a little idea "
46147	46150	46145	46145	Poirot	31	" little ideas "
46156	46167	46145	46145	Poirot	31	" and would like to ask one or two questions . "
46168	46174	46145	46145	Poirot	31	" Of me ? Certainly . "
46175	46212	46145	46145	Poirot	31	" You are too amiable , madame . What I want to ask is this : the door leading into Mrs. Inglethorp 's room from that of Mademoiselle Cynthia , it was bolted , you say ? "
46213	46219	46221	46222	Mary Cavendish	41	" Certainly it was bolted , "
46227	46235	46221	46222	Mary Cavendish	41	" I said so at the inquest . "
46236	46239	46145	46145	Poirot	31	" Bolted ? "
46240	46243	46244	46244	She	33	" Yes . "
46248	46252	46254	46254	Poirot	31	" I mean , "
46256	46269	46254	46254	Poirot	31	" you are sure it was bolted , and not merely locked ? "
46270	46316	46145	46145	Poirot	31	" Oh , I see what you mean . No , I do n't know . I said bolted , meaning that it was fastened , and I could not open it , but I believe all the doors were found bolted on the inside . "
46317	46336	46254	46254	Poirot	31	" Still , as far as you are concerned , the door might equally well have been locked ? "
46337	46342	46145	46145	Poirot	31	" Oh , yes . "
46343	46370	46254	46254	Poirot	31	" You yourself did not happen to notice , madame , when you entered Mrs. Inglethorp 's room , whether that door was bolted or not ? "
46371	46378	46145	46145	Poirot	31	" I I believe it was . "
46379	46387	46254	46254	Poirot	31	" But you did not see it ? "
46388	46395	46145	46145	Poirot	31	" No . I never looked . "
46396	46403	46405	46405	Lawrence	52	" But _ I _ did , "
46408	46420	46405	46405	Lawrence	52	" I happened to notice that it _ was _ bolted . "
46421	46428	46430	46430	Poirot	31	" Ah , that settles it . "
46447	46450	46446	46446	his	31	" little ideas "
46471	46481	46482	46482	he	31	" You are annoyed , is it not so ? "
46493	46498	46499	46499	I	0	" Not at all , "
46503	46517	46482	46482	he	31	" That is well . That lifts a great load from my mind . "
46560	46567	46568	46568	I	0	" I gave Lawrence your message , "
46571	46583	46546	46546	his	31	" And what did he say ? He was entirely puzzled ? "
46584	46600	46615	46615	he	31	" Yes . I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant . "
46648	46663	46627	46627	he	31	" Mademoiselle Cynthia was not at lunch to - day ? How was that ? "
46664	46679	46627	46627	he	31	" She is at the hospital again . She resumed work to - day . "
46680	46725	46627	46627	he	31	" Ah , she is an industrious little demoiselle . And pretty too . She is like pictures I have seen in Italy . I would rather like to see that dispensary of hers . Do you think she would show it to me ? "
46726	46742	46627	46627	he	31	" I am sure she would be delighted . It 's an interesting little place . "
46743	46751	46627	46627	he	31	" Does she go there every day ? "
46752	46774	46627	46627	he	31	" She has all Wednesdays off , and comes back to lunch on Saturdays . Those are her only times off . "
46775	46804	46627	46627	he	31	" I will remember . Women are doing great work nowadays , and Mademoiselle Cynthia is clever oh , yes , she has brains , that little one . "
46805	46818	46627	46627	he	31	" Yes . I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam . "
46819	46841	46627	46627	he	31	" Without doubt . After all , it is very responsible work . I suppose they have very strong poisons there ? "
46842	46881	46627	46627	he	31	" Yes , she showed them to us . They are kept locked up in a little cupboard . I believe they have to be very careful . They always take out the key before leaving the room . "
46882	46894	46627	46627	he	31	" Indeed . It is near the window , this cupboard ? "
46895	46908	46627	46627	he	31	" No , right the other side of the room . Why ? "
46914	46927	46911	46911	his	31	" I wondered . That is all . Will you come in ? "
46934	46956	46928	46928	We	751	" No . I think I 'll be getting back . I shall go round the long way through the woods . "
47141	47151	47126	47126	John	32	" I tell you I wo n't have it ! "
47229	47242	47243	47243	Mary	41	" I tell you , Mary , I wo n't have it . "
47252	47264	47243	47243	Mary	41	" Have _ you _ any right to criticize my actions ? "
47265	47293	47243	47243	Mary	41	" It will be the talk of the village ! My mother was only buried on Saturday , and here you are gadding about with the fellow . "
47294	47297	47298	47298	she	41	" Oh , "
47303	47314	47300	47300	her	41	" if it is only village gossip that you mind ! "
47315	47339	47376	47376	her	41	" But it is n't . I 've had enough of the fellow hanging about . He 's a Polish Jew , anyway . "
47340	47355	47356	47356	she	41	" A tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing . It leavens the "
47360	47368	47376	47376	her	41	" stolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman . "
47396	47399	47415	47415	his	760	" Mary ! "
47400	47403	47404	47404	Her	41	" Well ? "
47418	47435	47415	47415	his	760	" Am I to understand that you will continue to see Bauerstein against my express wishes ? "
47436	47441	47415	47415	his	760	" If I choose . "
47442	47447	47415	47415	his	760	" You defy me ? "
47448	47473	47415	47415	his	760	" No , but I deny your right to criticize my actions . Have _ you _ no friends of whom I should disapprove ? "
47488	47494	47495	47495	he	760	" What do you mean ? "
47503	47507	47509	47509	Mary	41	" You see ! "
47512	47544	47509	47509	Mary	41	" You _ do _ see , do n't you , that _ you _ have no right to dictate to _ me _ as to the choice of my friends ? "
47558	47571	47572	47572	he	32	" No right ? Have I _ no _ right , Mary ? "
47582	47584	47576	47576	He	32	" Mary "
47610	47613	47634	47634	his	32	" None ! "
47631	47633	47634	47634	his	32	" Mary "
47640	47650	47634	47634	his	32	" are you in love with this fellow Bauerstein ? "
47700	47703	47704	47704	she	41	" Perhaps , "
47769	47799	47754	47754	he	32	" Hullo , Hastings . Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his cottage ? Quaint little chap ! Is he any good , though , really ? "
47800	47813	47754	47754	he	32	" He was considered one of the finest detectives of his day . "
47814	47839	47754	47754	he	32	" Oh , well , I suppose there must be something in it , then . What a rotten world it is , though ! "
47840	47846	47754	47754	he	32	" You find it so ? "
47850	47949	47754	47754	he	32	" Good Lord , yes ! There 's this terrible business to start with . Scotland Yard men in and out of the house like a jack - in - the - box ! Never know where they wo n't turn up next . Screaming headlines in every paper in the country damn all journalists , I say ! Do you know there was a whole crowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning . Sort of Madame Tussaud 's chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing . Pretty thick , is n't it ? "
47950	47956	47957	47957	I	0	" Cheer up , John ! "
47961	47969	47957	47957	I	0	" It ca n't last for ever . "
47970	47995	48052	48052	his	32	" Ca n't it , though ? It can last long enough for us never to be able to hold up our heads again . "
47996	48009	47957	47957	I	0	" No , no , you 're getting morbid on the subject . "
48010	48045	48052	48052	his	32	" Enough to make a man morbid , to be stalked by beastly journalists and stared at by gaping moon - faced idiots , wherever he goes ! But there 's worse than that . "
48046	48049	47957	47957	I	0	" What ? "
48055	48118	48052	48052	his	32	" Have you ever thought , Hastings it 's a nightmare to me who did it ? I ca n't help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident . Because because who could have done it ? Now Inglethorp 's out of the way , there 's no one else ; no one , I mean , except one of us . "
48197	48202	48203	48203	I	0	" No , John , "
48206	48219	48203	48203	I	0	" it is n't one of us . How could it be ? "
48220	48233	48245	48245	I	0	" I know , but , still , who else is there ? "
48234	48240	48203	48203	I	0	" Ca n't you guess ? "
48241	48244	48245	48245	I	0	" No . "
48255	48259	48260	48260	I	0	" Dr. Bauerstein ! "
48263	48266	48245	48245	I	0	" Impossible ! "
48267	48272	48245	48245	I	0	" Not at all . "
48273	48287	48245	48245	I	0	" But what earthly interest could he have in my mother 's death ? "
48288	48295	48296	48296	I	0	" That I do n't see , "
48299	48311	48296	48296	I	0	" but I 'll tell you this : Poirot thinks so . "
48312	48323	48326	48326	him	767	" Poirot ? Does he ? How do you know ? "
48349	48413	48326	48326	him	767	" He said twice : That alters everything . ' And I 've been thinking . You know Inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall ? Well , it was just then that Bauerstein arrived . Is n't it possible that , as Inglethorp brought him through the hall , the doctor dropped something into the coffee in passing ? "
48414	48417	48419	48419	John	32	" H'm , "
48421	48429	48419	48419	John	32	" It would have been very risky . "
48430	48438	48326	48326	him	767	" Yes , but it was possible . "
48439	48465	48419	48419	John	32	" And then , how could he know it was her coffee ? No , old fellow , I do n't think that will wash . "
48473	48489	48491	48491	I	0	" You 're quite right . That was n't how it was done . Listen . "
48515	48528	48419	48419	John	32	" But , look here , Bauerstein had had it analysed already ? "
48529	48618	48619	48619	I	0	" Yes , yes , that 's the point . I did n't see it either until now . Do n't you understand ? Bauerstein had it analysed that 's just it ! If Bauerstein 's the murderer , nothing could be simpler than for him to substitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample , and send that to be tested . And of course they would find no strychnine ! But no one would dream of suspecting Bauerstein , or think of taking another sample except Poirot , "
48626	48641	48419	48419	John	32	" Yes , but what about the bitter taste that cocoa wo n't disguise ? "
48642	48669	48419	48419	John	32	" Well , we 've only his word for that . And there are other possibilities . He 's admittedly one of the world 's greatest toxicologists "
48670	48683	48419	48419	John	32	" One of the world 's greatest what ? Say it again . "
48684	48694	48695	48695	I	0	" He knows more about poisons than almost anybody , "
48698	48745	48695	48695	I	0	" Well , my idea is , that perhaps he 's found some way of making strychnine tasteless . Or it may not have been strychnine at all , but some obscure drug no one has ever heard of , which produces much the same symptoms . "
48746	48755	48757	48757	John	32	" H'm , yes , that might be , "
48759	48778	48757	48757	John	32	" But look here , how could he have got at the cocoa ? That was n't downstairs ? "
48779	48786	48787	48787	I	0	" No , it was n't , "
49007	49012	49003	49004	Miss Howard	40	" hushing it up . "
49022	49025	49014	49014	I	0	" Emily herself "
49057	49063	49065	49065	John	32	" There 's another thing , "
49080	49094	49073	49073	his	32	" Something which makes me doubt if what you say can be true . "
49095	49100	49101	49101	I	0	" What 's that ? "
49125	49160	49073	49073	his	32	" Why , the fact that Bauerstein demanded a post - mortem . He need n't have done so . Little Wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at heart disease . "
49161	49164	49165	49165	I	0	" Yes , "
49169	49243	49165	49165	I	0	" But we do n't know . Perhaps he thought it safer in the long run . Someone might have talked afterwards . Then the Home Office might have ordered exhumation . The whole thing would have come out , then , and he would have been in an awkward position , for no one would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been deceived into calling it heart disease . "
49244	49251	49253	49253	John	32	" Yes , that 's possible , "
49255	49258	49259	49259	he	32	" Still , "
49262	49277	49259	49259	he	32	" I 'm blest if I can see what his motive could have been . "
49281	49285	49286	49286	I	0	" Look here , "
49289	49306	49286	49286	I	0	" I may be altogether wrong . And , remember , all this is in confidence . "
49307	49317	49259	49259	he	32	" Oh , of course that goes without saying . "
49393	49466	49383	49383	her	38	" Of course ! I 'd love him to see it . He 'd better come to tea there one day . I must fix it up with him . He 's such a dear little man ! But he _ is _ funny . He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day , and put it in again , because he said it was n't straight . "
49470	49479	49383	49383	her	38	" It 's quite a mania with him . "
49480	49487	49383	49383	her	38	" Yes , is n't it ? "
49516	49520	49513	49513	Cynthia	38	" Mr. Hastings . "
49521	49524	49510	49510	her	38	" Yes ? "
49525	49536	49513	49513	Cynthia	38	" After tea , I want to talk to you . "
49658	49721	49646	49646	His	32	" Confound those detectives ! I ca n't think what they 're after ! They 've been in every room in the house turning things inside out , and upside down . It really is too bad ! I suppose they took advantage of our all being out . I shall go for that fellow Japp , when I next see him ! "
49722	49728	49730	49731	Miss Howard	40	" Lot of Paul Prys , "
49772	49775	49776	49776	I	0	" Well ? "
49826	49842	49820	49820	her	38	" Mr. Hastings you are always so kind , and you know such a lot . "
49872	49875	49876	49876	I	0	" Well ? "
49884	49897	49820	49820	her	38	" I want to ask your advice . What shall I do ? "
49898	49901	49820	49820	her	38	" Do ? "
49902	49965	49820	49820	her	38	" Yes . You see , Aunt Emily always told me I should be provided for . I suppose she forgot , or did n't think she was likely to die anyway , I am _ not _ provided for ! And I do n't know what to do . Do you think I ought to go away from here at once ? "
49966	49985	49820	49820	her	38	" Good heavens , no ! They do n't want to part with you , I 'm sure . "
50004	50013	50001	50001	she	38	" Mrs. Cavendish does . She hates me . "
50014	50018	50019	50019	I	0	" Hates you ? "
50027	50052	50001	50001	she	38	" Yes . I do n't know why , but she ca n't bear me ; and _ he _ ca n't , either . "
50053	50061	50062	50062	I	0	" There I know you 're wrong , "
50066	50078	50062	50062	I	0	" On the contrary , John is very fond of you . "
50079	50122	50001	50001	she	38	" Oh , yes _ John _ . I meant Lawrence . Not , of course , that I care whether Lawrence hates me or not . Still , it 's rather horrid when no one loves you , is n't it ? "
50123	50131	50132	50132	I	0	" But they do , Cynthia dear , "
50136	50152	50132	50132	I	0	" I 'm sure you are mistaken . Look , there is John and Miss Howard "
50158	50240	50153	50153	Cynthia	38	" Yes , John likes me , I think , and of course Evie , for all her gruff ways , would n't be unkind to a fly . But Lawrence never speaks to me if he can help it , and Mary can hardly bring herself to be civil to me . She wants Evie to stay on , is begging her to , but she does n't want me , and and I do n't know what to do . "
50320	50326	50316	50316	I	0	" Marry me , Cynthia . "
50358	50364	50340	50340	She	788	" Do n't be silly ! "
50371	50392	50406	50409	a " funny dear	1965	" I 'm not being silly . I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming my wife . "
50407	50411	50398	50398	Cynthia	38	" funny dear . "
50412	50420	50421	50421	she	38	" It 's perfectly sweet of you , "
50424	50434	50421	50421	she	38	" but you know you do n't want to ! "
50435	50444	50398	50398	Cynthia	38	" Yes , I do . I 've got "
50445	50465	50421	50421	she	38	" Never mind what you 've got . You do n't really want to and I do n't either . "
50466	50476	50477	50477	I	0	" Well , of course , that settles it , "
50481	50500	50477	50477	I	0	" But I do n't see anything to laugh at . There 's nothing funny about a proposal . "
50501	50506	50508	50508	Cynthia	38	" No , indeed , "
50510	50532	50508	50508	Cynthia	38	" Somebody might accept you next time . Good - bye , you 've cheered me up _ very _ much . "
50634	50636	50655	50657	An old woman	1109	" Apartments "
50663	50667	50668	50668	I	0	" Good afternoon , "
50672	50678	50668	50668	I	0	" Is Dr. Bauerstein in ? "
50684	50690	50655	50657	An old woman	1109	" Have n't you heard ? "
50691	50695	50655	50657	An old woman	1109	" Heard what ? "
50696	50700	50655	50657	An old woman	1109	" About him . "
50701	50706	50655	50657	An old woman	1109	" What about him ? "
50707	50712	50655	50657	An old woman	1109	" He 's took . "
50713	50718	50655	50657	An old woman	1109	" Took ? Dead ? "
50719	50727	50655	50657	An old woman	1109	" No , took by the perlice . "
50728	50733	50734	50734	I	0	" By the police ! "
50737	50746	50734	50734	I	0	" Do you mean they 've arrested him ? "
50747	50755	50787	50793	the old Belgian who answered my knock	796	" Yes , that 's it , and "
51127	51148	51078	51080	the little man	411	" Great Scott ! You _ were _ right , then . I could n't believe it at the time . "
51149	51192	51113	51113	He	32	" No , it is astonishing until you get used to the idea , and see how it makes everything fit in . Now , what are we to do ? Of course , it will be generally known to - morrow . "
51196	51200	51201	51201	he	32	" Never mind , "
51206	51231	51201	51201	he	32	" we wo n't say anything at present . There is no need . As you say , it will be known soon enough . "
51269	51275	51201	51201	he	32	" The Styles Poisoning Case , "
51373	51381	51401	51401	him	31	" _ Bonjour , mon ami ! _ "
51382	51385	51386	51386	I	0	" Poirot , "
51406	51431	51399	51399	I	0	" I was never so glad to see anyone . Listen , I have said nothing to anybody but John . Is that right ? "
51432	51436	51438	51438	Poirot	31	" My friend , "
51440	51451	51438	51438	Poirot	31	" I do not know what you are talking about . "
51452	51461	51462	51462	I	0	" Dr. Bauerstein 's arrest , of course , "
51466	51473	51399	51399	I	0	" Is Bauerstein arrested , then ? "
51474	51481	51399	51399	I	0	" Did you not know it ? "
51482	51490	51399	51399	I	0	" Not the least in the world . "
51500	51521	51497	51497	he	31	" Still , it does not surprise me . After all , we are only four miles from the coast . "
51522	51526	51527	51527	I	0	" The coast ? "
51532	51542	51527	51527	I	0	" What has that got to do with it ? "
51548	51555	51497	51497	he	31	" Surely , it is obvious ! "
51556	51590	51497	51497	he	31	" Not to me . No doubt I am very dense , but I can not see what the proximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp . "
51591	51599	51601	51601	Poirot	31	" Nothing at all , of course , "
51605	51617	51601	51601	Poirot	31	" But we were speaking of the arrest of Dr. Bauerstein . "
51618	51630	51497	51497	he	31	" Well , he is arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp "
51631	51634	51636	51636	Poirot	31	" What ? "
51643	51654	51636	51636	Poirot	31	" Dr. Bauerstein arrested for the murder of Mrs. Inglethorp ? "
51655	51658	51497	51497	he	31	" Yes . "
51659	51678	51636	51636	Poirot	31	" Impossible ! That would be too good a farce ! Who told you that , my friend ? "
51679	51688	51689	51689	I	0	" Well , no one exactly told me , "
51692	51698	51689	51689	I	0	" But he is arrested . "
51699	51716	51636	51636	Poirot	31	" Oh , yes , very likely . But for espionage , _ mon ami _ . "
51717	51720	51721	51721	I	0	" Espionage ? "
51724	51727	51636	51636	Poirot	31	" Precisely . "
51728	51735	51636	51636	Poirot	31	" Not for poisoning Mrs. Inglethorp ? "
51736	51749	51751	51751	Poirot	31	" Not unless our friend Japp has taken leave of his senses , "
51754	51764	51636	51636	Poirot	31	" But but I thought you thought so too ? "
51790	51797	51798	51798	I	0	" Do you mean to say , "
51809	51817	51798	51798	I	0	" that Dr. Bauerstein is a spy ? "
51821	51828	51765	51765	Poirot	31	" Have you never suspected it ? "
51829	51836	51765	51765	Poirot	31	" It never entered my head . "
51837	51879	51765	51765	Poirot	31	" It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should bury himself in a little village like this , and should be in the habit of walking about at all hours of the night , fully dressed ? "
51880	51883	51884	51884	I	0	" No , "
51887	51896	51884	51884	I	0	" I never thought of such a thing . "
51897	51909	51911	51911	Poirot	31	" He is , of course , a German by birth , "
51914	51953	51911	51911	Poirot	31	" though he has practised so long in this country that nobody thinks of him as anything but an Englishman . He was naturalized about fifteen years ago . A very clever man a Jew , of course . "
51954	51958	51959	51959	I	0	" The blackguard ! "
51963	51991	51884	51884	I	0	" Not at all . He is , on the contrary , a patriot . Think what he stands to lose . I admire the man myself . "
52005	52024	52025	52025	I	0	" And this is the man with whom Mrs. Cavendish has been wandering about all over the country ! "
52029	52042	52044	52044	Poirot	31	" Yes . I should fancy he had found her very useful , "
52046	52069	52044	52044	Poirot	31	" So long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together , any other vagaries of the doctor 's passed unobserved . "
52070	52081	52082	52082	I	0	" Then you think he never really cared for her ? "
52095	52118	52204	52204	he	801	" That , of course , I can not say , but shall I tell you my own private opinion , Hastings ? "
52119	52122	52204	52204	he	801	" Yes . "
52123	52148	52204	52204	he	801	" Well , it is this : that Mrs. Cavendish does not care , and never has cared one little jot about Dr. Bauerstein ! "
52149	52156	52204	52204	he	801	" Do you really think so ? "
52164	52179	52204	52204	he	801	" I am quite sure of it . And I will tell you why . "
52180	52183	52204	52204	he	801	" Yes ? "
52184	52197	52204	52204	he	801	" Because she cares for someone else , _ mon ami _ . "
52198	52201	52204	52204	he	801	" Oh ! "
52306	52313	52292	52292	she	804	" On top of the wardrobe . "
52344	52362	52299	52299	she	804	" Come here , Hastings . Now tell me , what is that initial J. or L. ? "
52423	52443	52411	52416	the well - known theatrical costumiers	808	" ( the debatable initial ) Cavendish , Esq . , Styles Court , Styles St. Mary , Essex . "
52444	52456	52457	52457	I	0	" It might be T. , or it might be L. , "
52470	52477	52457	52457	I	0	" It certainly is n't a J. "
52478	52481	52483	52483	Poirot	31	" Good , "
52491	52512	52483	52483	Poirot	31	" I , also , am of your way of thinking . It is an L. , depend upon it ! "
52513	52520	52521	52521	I	0	" Where did it come from ? "
52525	52530	52521	52521	I	0	" Is it important ? "
52531	52567	52457	52457	I	0	" Moderately so . It confirms a surmise of mine . Having deduced its existence , I set Miss Howard to search for it , and , as you see , she has been successful . "
52568	52582	52521	52521	I	0	" What did she mean by On the top of the wardrobe ' ? "
52583	52587	52589	52589	Poirot	31	" She meant , "
52592	52603	52589	52589	Poirot	31	" that she found it on top of a wardrobe . "
52604	52615	52616	52616	I	0	" A funny place for a piece of brown paper , "
52619	52658	52589	52589	Poirot	31	" Not at all . The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown paper and cardboard boxes . I have kept them there myself . Neatly arranged , there is nothing to offend the eye . "
52659	52662	52663	52663	I	0	" Poirot , "
52667	52678	52663	52663	I	0	" have you made up your mind about this crime ? "
52679	52695	52757	52757	Dorcas	64	" Yes that is to say , I believe I know how it was committed . "
52696	52699	52663	52663	I	0	" Ah ! "
52700	52712	52757	52757	Dorcas	64	" Unfortunately , I have no proof beyond my surmise , unless "
52739	52756	52717	52717	he	31	" Mademoiselle Dorcas , Mademoiselle Dorcas , _ un moment , s'il vous pla t ! _ "
52772	52824	52663	52663	I	0	" My good Dorcas , I have an idea a little idea if it should prove justified , what magnificent chance ! Tell me , on Monday , not Tuesday , Dorcas , but Monday , the day before the tragedy , did anything go wrong with Mrs. Inglethorp 's bell ? "
52830	52881	52966	52966	he	812	" Yes , sir , now you mention it , it did ; though I do n't know how you came to hear of it . A mouse , or some such , must have nibbled the wire through . The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning . "
52901	52956	52966	52966	he	812	" See you , one should not ask for outside proof no , reason should be enough . But the flesh is weak , it is consolation to find that one is on the right track . Ah , my friend , I am like a giant refreshed . I run ! I leap ! "
52981	52990	52966	52966	he	812	" What is your remarkable little friend doing ? "
53015	53022	53008	53008	She	41	" What is it all about ? "
53023	53057	52966	52966	he	812	" Really , I ca n't tell you . He asked Dorcas some question about a bell , and appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as you see ! "
53061	53082	52966	52966	he	812	" How ridiculous ! He 's going out of the gate . Is n't he coming back to - day ? "
53083	53102	53008	53008	She	41	" I do n't know . I 've given up trying to guess what he 'll do next . "
53103	53112	52966	52966	he	812	" Is he quite mad , Mr. Hastings ? "
53113	53153	53008	53008	She	41	" I honestly do n't know . Sometimes , I feel sure he is as mad as a hatter ; and then , just as he is at his maddest , I find there is method in his madness . "
53154	53158	52966	52966	he	812	" I see . "
53221	53259	53216	53216	she	41	" You are an excellent advocate , I have no doubt , Mr. Hastings , but in this case your talents are quite thrown away . Cynthia will run no risk of encountering any unkindness from me . "
53299	53303	53304	53304	she	41	" Mr. Hastings , "
53307	53319	53304	53304	she	41	" do you think I and my husband are happy together ? "
53343	53346	53347	53347	she	41	" Well , "
53351	53372	53347	53347	she	41	" whether it is your business or not , I will tell you that we are _ not _ happy . "
53427	53439	53440	53440	she	41	" You do n't know anything about me , do you ? "
53443	53492	53440	53440	she	41	" Where I come from , who I was before I married John anything , in fact ? Well , I will tell you . I will make a father confessor of you . You are kind , I think yes , I am sure you are kind . "
53542	53548	53550	53551	Mrs. Cavendish	33	" My father was English , "
53553	53561	53550	53551	Mrs. Cavendish	33	" but my mother was a Russian . "
53562	53565	53566	53566	I	0	" Ah , "
53569	53573	53566	53566	I	0	" now I understand "
53574	53578	53550	53551	Mrs. Cavendish	33	" Understand what ? "

53595	53703	53550	53551	Mrs. Cavendish	33	" My mother was very beautiful , I believe . I do n't know , because I never saw her . She died when I was quite a little child . I believe there was some tragedy connected with her death she took an overdose of some sleeping draught by mistake . However that may be , my father was broken - hearted . Shortly afterwards , he went into the Consular Service . Everywhere he went , I went with him . When I was twenty - three , I had been nearly all over the world . It was a splendid life I loved it . "
53731	53757	53758	53758	She	816	" Then my father died . He left me very badly off . I had to go and live with some old aunts in Yorkshire . "
53761	53799	53800	53800	She	816	" You will understand me when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had been . The narrowness , the deadly monotony of it , almost drove me mad . "
53812	53820	53800	53800	She	816	" And then I met John Cavendish . "
53821	53824	53800	53800	She	816	" Yes ? "
53825	53880	53800	53800	She	816	" You can imagine that , from my aunts ' point of view , it was a very good match for me . But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed with me . No , he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable monotony of my life . "
53894	53963	53890	53890	she	816	" Do n't misunderstand me . I was quite honest with him . I told him , what was true , that I liked him very much , that I hoped to come to like him more , but that I was not in any way what the world calls in love ' with him . He declared that that satisfied him , and so we were married . "
53991	54043	54044	54044	I	0	" I think I am sure he cared for me at first . But I suppose we were not well matched . Almost at once , we drifted apart . He it is not a pleasing thing for my pride , but it is the truth tired of me very soon . "
54059	54084	54054	54054	she	816	" Oh , yes , he did ! Not that it matters now now that we 've come to the parting of the ways . "
54085	54091	54054	54054	she	816	" What do you mean ? "
54096	54109	54054	54054	she	816	" I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles . "
54110	54121	54054	54054	she	816	" You and John are not going to live here ? "
54122	54133	54054	54054	she	816	" John may live here , but I shall not . "
54134	54142	54054	54054	she	816	" You are going to leave him ? "
54143	54146	54054	54054	she	816	" Yes . "
54147	54151	54054	54054	she	816	" But why ? "
54163	54172	54152	54152	She	816	" Perhaps because I want to be free ! "
54248	54269	54245	54245	her	816	" You do n't know , you do n't know , how this hateful place has been prison to me ! "
54270	54274	54275	54275	I	0	" I understand , "
54278	54287	54275	54275	I	0	" but but do n't do anything rash . "
54288	54293	54294	54294	Her	816	" Oh , rash ! "
54316	54326	54303	54303	I	0	" You know that Dr. Bauerstein has been arrested ? "
54343	54357	54303	54303	I	0	" John was so kind as to break that to me this morning . "
54358	54366	54367	54367	I	0	" Well , what do you think ? "
54371	54375	54303	54303	I	0	" Of what ? "
54376	54381	54303	54303	I	0	" Of the arrest ? "
54382	54402	54303	54303	I	0	" What should I think ? Apparently he is a German spy ; so the gardener had told John . "
54438	54460	54462	54462	she	816	" These are quite dead . I must do them again . Would you mind moving thank you , Mr. Hastings . "
54693	54699	54687	54687	he	31	" Gone to London again ? "
54700	54728	54687	54687	he	31	" Oh , no , monsieur , he has but taken the train to Tadminster . To see a young lady 's dispensary , ' he said . "
54729	54733	54734	54734	I	0	" Silly ass ! "
54737	54767	54734	54734	I	0	" I told him Wednesday was the one day she was n't there ! Well , tell him to look us up to - morrow morning , will you ? "
54768	54773	54687	54687	he	31	" Certainly , monsieur . "
54821	54843	54858	54858	his	52	" No , I do n't think I shall . He can come up here if he wants to see us . "
54844	54847	54848	54848	Lawrence	52	" Oh ! "
54864	54869	54870	54870	I	0	" What is it ? "
54873	54883	54870	54870	I	0	" I could go if there 's anything special . "
54884	54902	54903	54903	he	52	" It 's nothing much , but well , if you are going , will you tell him "
54910	54922	54905	54905	his	52	" I think I 've found the extra coffee - cup ! "
55013	55018	55019	55019	I	0	" What is it ? "
55023	55032	55019	55019	I	0	" You are not ill , I trust ? "
55033	55050	54999	54999	his	31	" No , no , not ill . But I decide an affair of great moment . "
55051	55060	55061	55061	I	0	" Whether to catch the criminal or not ? "
55076	55098	55072	55072	Poirot	31	" To speak or not to speak , ' as your so great Shakespeare says , that is the question . ' "
55108	55116	55072	55072	Poirot	31	" You are not serious , Poirot ? "
55117	55137	55068	55068	my	0	" I am of the most serious . For the most serious of all things hangs in the balance . "
55138	55143	55072	55072	Poirot	31	" And that is ? "
55144	55155	55156	55156	he	31	" A woman 's happiness , _ mon ami _ , "
55169	55175	55177	55177	Poirot	31	" The moment has come , "
55180	55217	55219	55219	he	31	" and I do not know what to do . For , see you , it is a big stake for which I play . No one but I , Hercule Poirot , would attempt it ! "
55249	55252	55253	55253	he	31	" Aha ! "
55256	55288	55253	55253	he	31	" So he has found the extra coffee - cup . That is good . He has more intelligence than would appear , this long - faced Monsieur Lawrence of yours ! "
55327	55366	55393	55393	him	31	" It is true . I have the head of a sieve . However , the other young lady was most kind . She was sorry for my disappointment , and showed me everything in the kindest way . "
55367	55390	55316	55316	my	0	" Oh , well , that 's all right , then , and you must go to tea with Cynthia another day . "
55398	55405	55406	55406	he	31	" I am sorry for that , "
55409	55436	55437	55437	He	31	" I always had hopes of that letter . But no , it was not to be . This affair must all be unravelled from within . "
55442	55460	55465	55465	he	31	" These little grey cells . It is up to them ' as you say over here . "
55468	55481	55465	55465	he	31	" Are you a judge of finger - marks , my friend ? "
55482	55485	55486	55486	I	0	" No , "
55492	55515	55486	55486	I	0	" I know that there are no two finger - marks alike , but that 's as far as my science goes . "
55516	55519	55465	55465	he	31	" Exactly . "
55538	55557	55465	55465	he	31	" I have numbered them , 1 , 2 , 3 . Will you describe them to me ? "
55564	55616	55617	55617	I	0	" All greatly magnified , I see . No . 1 , I should say , are a man 's finger - prints ; thumb and first finger . No . 2 are a lady 's ; they are much smaller , and quite different in every way . No . 3 "
55622	55647	55465	55465	he	31	" there seem to be a lot of confused finger - marks , but here , very distinctly , are No . 1 's . "
55648	55653	55465	55465	he	31	" Overlapping the others ? "
55654	55657	55465	55465	he	31	" Yes . "
55658	55665	55465	55465	he	31	" You recognize them beyond fail ? "
55666	55675	55465	55465	he	31	" Oh , yes ; they are identical . "
55691	55695	55696	55696	I	0	" I suppose , "
55699	55711	55696	55696	I	0	" that as usual , you are not going to explain ? "
55712	55759	55465	55465	he	31	" On the contrary . No . 1 were the finger - prints of Monsieur Lawrence . No . 2 were those of Mademoiselle Cynthia . They are not important . I merely obtained them for comparison . No . 3 is a little more complicated . "
55760	55763	55696	55696	I	0	" Yes ? "
55764	55873	55465	55465	he	31	" It is , as you see , highly magnified . You may have noticed a sort of blur extending all across the picture . I will not describe to you the special apparatus , dusting powder , etc . , which I used . It is a well - known process to the police , and by means of it you can obtain a photograph of the finger - prints of any object in a very short space of time . Well , my friend , you have seen the finger - marks it remains to tell you the particular object on which they had been left . "
55874	55882	55696	55696	I	0	" Go on I am really excited . "
55883	55926	55465	55465	he	31	" _ Eh bien ! _ Photo No . 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a tiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster which sounds like the house that Jack built ! "
55927	55931	55932	55932	I	0	" Good heavens ! "
55935	55962	55932	55932	I	0	" But what were Lawrence Cavendish 's finger - marks doing on it ? He never went near the poison cupboard the day we were there ! "
55963	55971	55465	55465	he	31	" Oh , yes , he did ! "
55972	55983	55932	55932	I	0	" Impossible ! We were all together the whole time . "
55989	56040	55932	55932	I	0	" No , my friend , there was a moment when you were not all together . There was a moment when you could not have been all together , or it would not have been necessary to call to Monsieur Lawrence to come and join you on the balcony . "
56041	56047	56048	56048	I	0	" I 'd forgotten that , "
56051	56060	56048	56048	I	0	" But it was only for a moment . "
56061	56065	55932	55932	I	0	" Long enough . "
56066	56072	56048	56048	I	0	" Long enough for what ? "
56080	56100	56048	56048	I	0	" Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a very natural interest and curiosity . "
56125	56128	56129	56129	I	0	" Poirot , "
56132	56141	56129	56129	I	0	" what was in this particular little bottle ? "
56149	56156	56157	56157	he	31	" Hydro - chloride of strychnine , "
56168	56172	56173	56173	I	0	" Good heavens ! "
56190	56240	56173	56173	I	0	" They use the pure hydro - chloride of strychnine very little only occasionally for pills . It is the official solution , Liq . Strychnine Hydro - clor . that is used in most medicines . That is why the finger - marks have remained undisturbed since then . "
56241	56251	56173	56173	I	0	" How did you manage to take this photograph ? "
56252	56261	56263	56263	Poirot	31	" I dropped my hat from the balcony , "
56266	56299	56263	56263	Poirot	31	" Visitors were not permitted below at that hour , so , in spite of my many apologies , Mademoiselle Cynthia 's colleague had to go down and fetch it for me . "
56300	56311	56173	56173	I	0	" Then you knew what you were going to find ? "
56312	56351	56263	56263	Poirot	31	" No , not at all . I merely realized that it was possible , from your story , for Monsieur Lawrence to go to the poison cupboard . The possibility had to be confirmed , or eliminated . "
56352	56355	56356	56356	I	0	" Poirot , "
56359	56374	56356	56356	I	0	" your gaiety does not deceive me . This is a very important discovery . "
56375	56381	56383	56383	Poirot	31	" I do not know , "
56385	56401	56383	56383	Poirot	31	" But one thing does strike me . No doubt it has struck you too . "
56402	56407	56263	56263	Poirot	31	" What is that ? "
56408	56486	56383	56383	Poirot	31	" Why , that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case . This is the third time we run up against it . There was strychnine in Mrs. Inglethorp 's tonic . There is the strychnine sold across the counter at Styles St. Mary by Mace . Now we have more strychnine , handled by one of the household . It is confusing ; and , as you know , I do not like confusion . "
56506	56518	56502	56502	his	828	" There is a lady below , asking for Mr Hastings . "
56519	56523	56502	56502	his	828	" A lady ? "
56544	56556	56557	56557	she	41	" I have been visiting an old woman in the village , "
56560	56579	56557	56557	she	41	" and as Lawrence told me you were with Monsieur Poirot I thought I would call for you . "
56580	56585	56587	56587	Poirot	31	" Alas , madame , "
56589	56602	56587	56587	Poirot	31	" I thought you had come to honour me with a visit ! "
56603	56614	56615	56615	she	41	" I will some day , if you ask me , "
56621	56635	56636	56636	she	41	" That is well . If you should need a father confessor , madame "
56641	56652	56636	56636	she	41	" remember , Papa Poirot is always at your service . "
56680	56695	56675	56675	she	41	" Come , will you not walk back with us too , Monsieur Poirot ? "
56696	56701	56675	56675	she	41	" Enchanted , madame . "
56830	56847	56817	56828	other servants huddled together in the background , all eyes and ears	832	" Oh , m'am ! Oh , m'am ! I do n't know how to tell you "
56848	56855	56856	56856	I	0	" What is it , Dorcas ? "
56860	56866	56856	56856	I	0	" Tell us at once . "
56867	56884	56817	56828	other servants huddled together in the background , all eyes and ears	832	" It 's those wicked detectives . They 've arrested him they 've arrested Mr. Cavendish ! "
56885	56889	56890	56890	I	0	" Arrested Lawrence ? "
56904	56915	56817	56828	other servants huddled together in the background , all eyes and ears	832	" No , sir . Not Mr. Lawrence Mr. John . "
57032	57066	57028	57028	he	31	" Yes , she is of those women who show at their best in adversity . It brings out all that is sweetest and truest in them . Her pride and her jealousy have "
57067	57070	57071	57071	I	0	" Jealousy ? "
57074	57121	57028	57028	he	31	" Yes . Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman ? As I was saying , her pride and jealousy have been laid aside . She thinks of nothing but her husband , and the terrible fate that is hanging over him . "
57154	57160	57161	57161	I	0	" a woman 's happiness , "
57175	57179	57180	57180	I	0	" Even now , "
57183	57206	57180	57180	I	0	" I can hardly believe it . You see , up to the very last minute , I thought it was Lawrence ! "
57210	57216	57161	57161	I	0	" I know you did . "
57217	57226	57161	57161	I	0	" But John ! My old friend John ! "
57227	57237	57239	57239	Poirot	31	" Every murderer is probably somebody 's old friend , "
57242	57252	57239	57239	Poirot	31	" You can not mix up sentiment and reason . "
57253	57267	57161	57161	I	0	" I must say I think you might have given me a hint . "
57268	57292	57239	57239	Poirot	31	" Perhaps , _ mon ami _ , I did not do so , just because he _ was _ your old friend . "
57404	57408	57409	57409	I	0	" But , Poirot "
57412	57497	57498	57498	He	31	" Oh , my friend , have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs . It is one thing to know that a man is guilty , it is quite another matter to prove him so . And , in this case , there is terribly little evidence . That is the whole trouble . I , Hercule Poirot , know , but I lack the last link in my chain . And unless I can find that missing link "
57504	57513	57514	57514	I	0	" When did you first suspect John Cavendish ? "
57523	57532	57396	57396	he	32	" Did you not suspect him at all ? "
57533	57538	57514	57514	I	0	" No , indeed . "
57539	57569	57396	57396	he	32	" Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between Mrs. Cavendish and her mother - in - law , and her subsequent lack of frankness at the inquest ? "
57570	57573	57514	57514	I	0	" No . "
57574	57654	57396	57396	he	32	" Did you not put two and two together , and reflect that if it was not Alfred Inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife and you remember , he strenuously denied it at the inquest it must be either Lawrence or John . Now , if it was Lawrence , Mary Cavendish 's conduct was just as inexplicable . But if , on the other hand , it was John , the whole thing was explained quite naturally . "
57655	57658	57659	57659	I	0	" So , "
57669	57681	57659	57659	I	0	" it was John who quarrelled with his mother that afternoon ? "
57682	57685	57396	57396	he	32	" Exactly . "
57686	57695	57659	57659	I	0	" And you have known this all along ? "
57696	57710	57396	57396	he	32	" Certainly . Mrs. Cavendish 's behaviour could only be explained that way . "
57711	57721	57659	57659	I	0	" And yet you say he may be acquitted ? "
57727	57799	57659	57659	I	0	" Certainly I do . At the police court proceedings , we shall hear the case for the prosecution , but in all probability his solicitors will advise him to reserve his defence . That will be sprung upon us at the trial . And ah , by the way , I have a word of caution to give you , my friend . I must not appear in the case . "
57800	57803	57659	57659	I	0	" What ? "
57804	57850	57659	57659	I	0	" No . Officially , I have nothing to do with it . Until I have found that last link in my chain , I must remain behind the scenes . Mrs. Cavendish must think I am working for her husband , not against him . "
57851	57864	57865	57865	I	0	" I say , that 's playing it a bit low down , "
57868	57942	57943	57943	he	837	" Not at all . We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man , and we must use any means in our power otherwise he will slip through our fingers . That is why I have been careful to remain in the background . All the discoveries have been made by Japp , and Japp will take all the credit . If I am called upon to give evidence at all "
57946	57958	58026	58028	a true prophet	838	" it will probably be as a witness for the defence . "
57966	57976	57978	57978	Poirot	31	" It is quite _ en r gle _ , "
57980	57997	57978	57978	Poirot	31	" Strangely enough , I can give evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution . "
57998	58002	58026	58028	a true prophet	838	" Which one ? "
58003	58023	57978	57978	Poirot	31	" The one that relates to the destruction of the will . John Cavendish did not destroy that will . "
58129	58132	58133	58133	he	31	" last link "

58857	58875	58832	58834	Sir Ernest Heavywether	116	" I take it , Dr. Bauerstein , that strychnine , as a drug , acts quickly ? "
58876	58879	58832	58834	Sir Ernest Heavywether	116	" Yes . "
58880	58895	58832	58834	Sir Ernest Heavywether	116	" And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case ? "
58896	58899	58832	58834	Sir Ernest Heavywether	116	" Yes . "
58900	58904	58832	58834	Sir Ernest Heavywether	116	" Thank you . "
58920	58924	58927	58927	he	84	" Mr. Inglethorp . "
59010	59014	59005	59005	Dorcas	64	" young gentlemen , "
59123	59145	59119	59120	Mr. Philips	117	" In the month of June last , do you remember a parcel arriving for Mr. Lawrence Cavendish from Parkson 's ? "
59151	59175	59119	59120	Mr. Philips	117	" I do n't remember , sir . It may have done , but Mr. Lawrence was away from home part of June . "
59176	59198	59119	59120	Mr. Philips	117	" In the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away , what would be done with it ? "
59199	59214	59119	59120	Mr. Philips	117	" It would either be put in his room or sent on after him . "
59215	59219	59119	59120	Mr. Philips	117	" By you ? "
59220	59247	59119	59120	Mr. Philips	117	" No , sir , I should leave it on the hall table . It would be Miss Howard who would attend to anything like that . "
59268	59285	59248	59249	Evelyn Howard	36	" Do n't remember . Lots of parcels come . Ca n't remember one special one . "
59286	59311	59248	59249	Evelyn Howard	36	" You do not know if it was sent after Mr. Lawrence Cavendish to Wales , or whether it was put in his room ? "
59312	59330	59248	59249	Evelyn Howard	36	" Do n't think it was sent after him . Should have remembered it if it was . "
59331	59353	59248	59249	Evelyn Howard	36	" Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to Mr. Lawrence Cavendish , and afterwards it disappeared , should you remark its absence ? "
59354	59372	59248	59249	Evelyn Howard	36	" No , do n't think so . I should think someone had taken charge of it . "
59373	59392	59393	59393	He	895	" I believe , Miss Howard , that it was you who found this sheet of brown paper ? "
59414	59420	59248	59249	Evelyn Howard	36	" Yes , I did . "
59421	59431	59393	59393	He	895	" How did you come to look for it ? "
59432	59449	59248	59249	Evelyn Howard	36	" The Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search for it . "
59450	59458	59393	59393	He	895	" Where did you eventually discover it ? "
59459	59468	59248	59249	Evelyn Howard	36	" On the top of of a wardrobe . "
59469	59478	59393	59393	He	895	" On top of the prisoner 's wardrobe ? "
59479	59485	59248	59249	Evelyn Howard	36	" I I believe so . "
59486	59494	59393	59393	He	895	" Did you not find it yourself ? "
59495	59498	59248	59249	Evelyn Howard	36	" Yes . "
59499	59509	59393	59393	He	895	" Then you must know where you found it ? "
59510	59521	59248	59249	Evelyn Howard	36	" Yes , it was on the prisoner 's wardrobe . "
59522	59527	59393	59393	He	895	" That is better . "
59597	59607	59587	59587	They	898	" L. Cavendish , Esq . , Styles Court . "
59614	59622	59608	59610	Sir Ernest Heavywether	116	" Where was the letter written from ? "
59623	59628	59587	59587	They	898	" From Styles Court . "
59629	59640	59608	59610	Sir Ernest Heavywether	116	" The same address to which you sent the parcel ? "
59641	59644	59587	59587	They	898	" Yes . "
59645	59653	59608	59610	Sir Ernest Heavywether	116	" And the letter came from there ? "
59654	59657	59587	59587	They	898	" Yes . "
59669	59675	59587	59587	They	898	" How do you know ? "
59676	59683	59667	59667	him	116	" I I do n't understand . "
59684	59701	59587	59587	They	898	" How do you know that letter came from Styles ? Did you notice the postmark ? "
59702	59705	59667	59667	him	116	" No but "
59706	59741	59587	59587	They	898	" Ah , you did _ not _ notice the postmark ! And yet you affirm so confidently that it came from Styles . It might , in fact , have been any postmark ? "
59742	59746	59667	59667	him	116	" Y es . "
59747	59773	59587	59587	They	898	" In fact , the letter , though written on stamped notepaper , might have been posted from anywhere ? From Wales , for instance ? "
59956	59988	59952	59954	the prosecuting counsel	908	" That hateful man ! What a net he has drawn around my poor John ! How he twisted every little fact until he made it seem what it was n't ! "
59989	59992	59993	59993	I	0	" Well , "
59997	60009	59993	59993	I	0	" it will be the other way about to - morrow . "
60010	60013	60014	60014	she	41	" Yes , "
60024	60048	60021	60021	her	41	" Mr. Hastings , you do not think surely it could not have been Lawrence Oh , no , that could not be ! "
60076	60079	60081	60081	Poirot	31	" Ah ! "
60084	60095	60081	60081	Poirot	31	" He is a clever man , that Sir Ernest . "
60096	60105	60051	60051	myself	0	" Do you think he believes Lawrence guilty ? "
60106	60180	60081	60081	Poirot	31	" I do not think he believes or cares anything ! No , what he is trying for is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are divided in their opinion as to which brother did it . He is endeavouring to make out that there is quite as much evidence against Lawrence as against John and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed . "
60213	60269	60210	60210	he	92	" Acting on information received , Superintendent Summerhaye and myself searched the prisoner 's room , during his temporary absence from the house . In his chest of drawers , hidden beneath some underclothing , we found : first , a pair of gold - rimmed pince - nez similar to those worn by Mr. Inglethorp "
60273	60279	60210	60210	he	92	" secondly , this phial . "
60312	60320	60210	60210	he	92	" Strychnine Hydro - chloride . POISON . "
60371	60390	60210	60210	he	92	" . . . erything of which I die possessed I leave to my beloved husband Alfred Ing ... "
60454	60467	60818	60822	a woman of her pride	918	" What day was it when you searched the prisoner 's room ? "
60468	60476	60803	60803	his	854	" Tuesday , the 24th of July . "
60477	60485	60818	60822	a woman of her pride	918	" Exactly a week after the tragedy ? "
60486	60489	60803	60803	his	854	" Yes . "
60490	60511	60818	60822	a woman of her pride	918	" You found these two objects , you say , in the chest of drawers . Was the drawer unlocked ? "
60512	60515	60803	60803	his	854	" Yes . "
60516	60547	60818	60822	a woman of her pride	918	" Does it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a crime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone to find ? "
60548	60559	60803	60803	his	854	" He might have stowed them there in a hurry . "
60560	60588	60818	60822	a woman of her pride	918	" But you have just said it was a whole week since the crime . He would have had ample time to remove them and destroy them . "
60589	60592	60803	60803	his	854	" Perhaps . "
60593	60619	60818	60822	a woman of her pride	918	" There is no perhaps about it . Would he , or would he not have had plenty of time to remove and destroy them ? "
60620	60623	60803	60803	his	854	" Yes . "
60624	60640	60818	60822	a woman of her pride	918	" Was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy or light ? "
60641	60644	60803	60803	his	854	" Heavyish . "
60645	60669	60818	60822	a woman of her pride	918	" In other words , it was winter underclothing . Obviously , the prisoner would not be likely to go to that drawer ? "
60670	60674	60803	60803	his	854	" Perhaps not . "
60675	60710	60818	60822	a woman of her pride	918	" Kindly answer my question . Would the prisoner , in the hottest week of a hot summer , be likely to go to a drawer containing winter underclothing . Yes , or no ? "
60711	60714	60803	60803	his	854	" No . "
60715	60750	60818	60822	a woman of her pride	918	" In that case , is it not possible that the articles in question might have been put there by a third person , and that the prisoner was quite unaware of their presence ? "
60751	60759	60803	60803	his	854	" I should not think it likely . "
60760	60766	60818	60822	a woman of her pride	918	" But it is possible ? "
60767	60770	60803	60803	his	854	" Yes . "
60771	60776	60818	60822	a woman of her pride	918	" That is all . "
60914	60929	60981	60985	the prisoner in the dock	921	" You deny having ordered a black beard from Parkson 's on June 29th ? "
60930	60934	60981	60985	the prisoner in the dock	921	" I do . "
60935	60954	60981	60985	the prisoner in the dock	921	" Ah ! In the event of anything happening to your brother , who will inherit Styles Court ? "
60999	61008	60981	60985	the prisoner in the dock	921	" Answer my question , if you please . "
61009	61013	61015	61015	Lawrence	52	" I suppose , "
61018	61023	61015	61015	Lawrence	52	" that I should . "
61024	61051	60981	60985	the prisoner in the dock	921	" What do you mean by you suppose ' ? Your brother has no children . You _ would _ inherit it , would n't you ? "
61052	61055	61015	61015	Lawrence	52	" Yes . "
61056	61063	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" Ah , that 's better , "
61071	61087	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" And you 'd inherit a good slice of money too , would n't you ? "
61088	61094	61096	61097	the judge	920	" Really , Sir Ernest , "
61099	61106	61096	61097	the judge	920	" these questions are not relevant . "
61118	61148	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" On Tuesday , the 17th July , you went , I believe , with another guest , to visit the dispensary at the Red Cross Hospital in Tadminster ? "
61149	61152	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" Yes . "
61153	61178	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" Did you while you happened to be alone for a few seconds unlock the poison cupboard , and examine some of the bottles ? "
61179	61187	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" I I may have done so . "
61188	61200	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" I put it to you that you did do so ? "
61201	61204	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" Yes . "
61215	61224	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" Did you examine one bottle in particular ? "
61225	61234	61213	61213	him	920	" No , I do not think so . "
61235	61256	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" Be careful , Mr. Cavendish . I am referring to a little bottle of Hydro - chloride of Strychnine . "
61265	61275	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" N o I am sure I did n't . "
61276	61299	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" Then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable impress of your finger - prints on it ? "
61311	61323	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" I I suppose I must have taken up the bottle . "
61324	61341	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" I suppose so too ! Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle ? "
61342	61346	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" Certainly not . "
61347	61356	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" Then why did you take it up ? "
61357	61372	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" I once studied to be a doctor . Such things naturally interest me . "
61373	61401	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" Ah ! So poisons naturally interest ' you , do they ? Still , you waited to be alone before gratifying that interest ' of yours ? "
61402	61423	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" That was pure chance . If the others had been there , I should have done just the same . "
61424	61437	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" Still , as it happens , the others were not there ? "
61438	61442	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" No , but "
61443	61490	61065	61065	Heavywether	116	" In fact , during the whole afternoon , you were only alone for a couple of minutes , and it happened I say , it happened to be during those two minutes that you displayed your natural interest ' in Hydro - chloride of Strychnine ? "
61495	61498	61539	61544	the many fashionably attired women present	926	" I I "
61510	61522	61506	61507	Sir Ernest	116	" I have nothing more to ask you , Mr. Cavendish . "
61594	61597	61579	61583	The hand - writing experts	928	" Alfred Inglethorp "
62349	62393	62343	62343	he	116	" I should like to make one thing clear . I utterly reject and disapprove of Sir Ernest Heavywether 's insinuations against my brother . My brother , I am convinced , had no more to do with the crime than I have . "
62426	62462	62416	62417	the jury	557	" I understand you to say that it never entered your head that the witnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for that of Mr. Inglethorp . Is not that very surprising ? "
62463	62501	62416	62417	the jury	557	" No , I do n't think so . I was told there had been a quarrel between my mother and Mr. Inglethorp , and it never occurred to me that such was not really the case . "
62502	62521	62416	62417	the jury	557	" Not when the servant Dorcas repeated certain fragments of the conversation fragments which you must have recognized ? "
62522	62529	62416	62417	the jury	557	" I did not recognize them . "
62530	62538	62416	62417	the jury	557	" Your memory must be unusually short ! "
62539	62571	62416	62417	the jury	557	" No , but we were both angry , and , I think , said more than we meant . I paid very little attention to my mother 's actual words . "
62594	62618	62572	62573	Mr. Philips	117	" You have produced this note very opportunely . Tell me , is there nothing familiar about the hand - writing of it ? "
62619	62626	62572	62573	Mr. Philips	117	" Not that I know of . "
62627	62647	62572	62573	Mr. Philips	117	" Do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own hand - writing carelessly disguised ? "
62648	62657	62572	62573	Mr. Philips	117	" No , I do not think so . "
62658	62673	62572	62573	Mr. Philips	117	" I put it to you that it is your own hand - writing ! "
62674	62677	62572	62573	Mr. Philips	117	" No . "
62678	62717	62572	62573	Mr. Philips	117	" I put it to you that , anxious to prove an alibi , you conceived the idea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment , and wrote this note yourself in order to bear out your statement ! "
62718	62721	62572	62573	Mr. Philips	117	" No . "
62722	62771	62572	62573	Mr. Philips	117	" Is it not a fact that , at the time you claim to have been waiting about at a solitary and unfrequented spot , you were really in the chemist 's shop in Styles St. Mary , where you purchased strychnine in the name of Alfred Inglethorp ? "
62772	62780	62572	62573	Mr. Philips	117	" No , that is a lie . "
62781	62818	62572	62573	Mr. Philips	117	" I put it to you that , wearing a suit of Mr. Inglethorp 's clothes , with a black beard trimmed to resemble his , you were there and signed the register in his name ! "
62819	62825	62572	62573	Mr. Philips	117	" That is absolutely untrue . "
62826	62856	62858	62859	Mr. Philips	117	" Then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand - writing between the note , the register , and your own , to the consideration of the jury , "
62926	62933	62934	62934	I	0	" What is it , Poirot ? "
62937	62952	62978	62978	we	975	" Ah , _ mon ami _ , things are going badly , badly . "
62994	63010	63013	63013	him	977	" No , I thank you , madame . I will mount to my room . "
63069	63123	63064	63064	he	977	" No , _ mon ami _ , I am not in my second childhood ! I steady my nerves , that is all . This employment requires precision of the fingers . With precision of the fingers goes precision of the brain . And never have I needed that more than now ! "
63124	63130	63131	63131	I	0	" What is the trouble ? "
63150	63174	63064	63064	he	977	" It is this , _ mon ami ! _ That I can build card houses seven stories high , but I can not "
63176	63178	63208	63208	he	977	" find "
63180	63191	63064	63064	he	977	" that last link of which I spoke to you . "
63225	63241	63208	63208	he	977	" It is done so ! By placing one card on another with mathematical precision ! "
63271	63280	63281	63281	I	0	" What a steady hand you 've got , "
63284	63296	63281	63281	I	0	" I believe I 've only seen your hand shake once . "
63297	63309	63311	63311	Poirot	31	" On an occasion when I was enraged , without doubt , "
63317	63381	63281	63281	I	0	" Yes indeed ! You were in a towering rage . Do you remember ? It was when you discovered that the lock of the despatch - case in Mrs. Inglethorp 's bedroom had been forced . You stood by the mantelpiece , twiddling the things on it in your usual fashion , and your hand shook like a leaf ! I must say "
63422	63428	63429	63429	I	0	" Good heavens , Poirot ! "
63432	63443	63429	63429	I	0	" What is the matter ? Are you taken ill ? "
63444	63449	63450	63450	he	31	" No , no , "
63453	63464	63450	63450	he	31	" It is it is that I have an idea ! "
63465	63468	63469	63469	I	0	" Oh ! "
63475	63483	63469	63469	I	0	" One of your little ideas ' ? "
63484	63494	63496	63496	Poirot	31	" Ah , _ ma foi _ , no ! "
63499	63525	63496	63496	Poirot	31	" This time it is an idea gigantic ! Stupendous ! And you _ you _ , my friend , have given it to me ! "
63562	63613	63624	63624	he	31	" What _ is _ the matter with Monsieur Poirot ? He rushed past me crying out : A garage ! For the love of Heaven , direct me to a garage , madame ! ' And , before I could answer , he had dashed out into the street . "
63650	63670	63624	63624	he	31	" He 'll be stopped by a policeman in another minute . There he goes , round the corner ! "
63683	63690	63624	63624	he	31	" What can be the matter ? "
63696	63724	63624	63624	he	31	" I do n't know . He was building card houses , when suddenly he said he had an idea , and rushed off as you saw . "
63725	63728	63730	63730	Mary	41	" Well , "
63732	63742	63730	63730	Mary	41	" I expect he will be back before dinner . "
63832	63861	63823	63823	He	411	" Madame , I have your permission to hold a little _ r union _ in the _ salon _ ? It is necessary for everyone to attend . "
63866	63884	63823	63823	He	411	" You know , Monsieur Poirot , that you have _ carte blanche _ in every way . "
63885	63893	63862	63862	Mary	41	" You are too amiable , madame . "
63915	63957	63862	63862	Mary	41	" Miss Howard here . Mademoiselle Cynthia . Monsieur Lawrence . The good Dorcas . And Annie . _ Bien ! _ We must delay our proceedings a few minutes until Mr. Inglethorp arrives . I have sent him a note . "
63966	63979	63862	63862	Mary	41	" If that man comes into the house , I leave it ! "
63980	63985	63986	63986	Poirot	31	" No , no ! "
64043	64137	64018	64019	The company	202	" _ Messieurs , mesdames _ , as you all know , I was called in by Monsieur John Cavendish to investigate this case . I at once examined the bedroom of the deceased which , by the advice of the doctors , had been kept locked , and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy occurred . I found : first , a fragment of green material ; second , a stain on the carpet near the window , still damp ; thirdly , an empty box of bromide powders .
64138	64206	64018	64019	The company	202	" To take the fragment of green material first , I found it caught in the bolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one occupied by Mademoiselle Cynthia . I handed the fragment over to the police who did not consider it of much importance . Nor did they recognize it for what it was a piece torn from a green land armlet . "
64215	64255	64018	64019	The company	202	" Now there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land Mrs. Cavendish . Therefore it must have been Mrs. Cavendish who entered the deceased 's room through the door communicating with Mademoiselle Cynthia 's room . "
64256	64266	64267	64267	I	0	" But that door was bolted on the inside ! "
64270	64518	64018	64019	The company	202	" When I examined the room , yes . But in the first place we have only her word for it , since it was she who tried that particular door and reported it fastened . In the ensuing confusion she would have had ample opportunity to shoot the bolt across . I took an early opportunity of verifying my conjectures . To begin with , the fragment corresponds exactly with a tear in Mrs. Cavendish 's armlet . Also , at the inquest , Mrs. Cavendish declared that she had heard , from her own room , the fall of the table by the bed . I took an early opportunity of testing that statement by stationing my friend Monsieur Hastings in the left wing of the building , just outside Mrs. Cavendish 's door . I myself , in company with the police , went to the deceased 's room , and whilst there I , apparently accidentally , knocked over the table in question , but found that , as I had expected , Monsieur Hastings had heard no sound at all . This confirmed my belief that Mrs. Cavendish was not speaking the truth when she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of the tragedy . In fact , I was convinced that , far from having been in her own room , Mrs. Cavendish was actually in the deceased 's room when the alarm was given . "
64535	64756	64757	64757	He	992	" I proceeded to reason on that assumption . Mrs. Cavendish is in her mother - in - law 's room . We will say that she is seeking for something and has not yet found it . Suddenly Mrs. Inglethorp awakens and is seized with an alarming paroxysm . She flings out her arm , overturning the bed table , and then pulls desperately at the bell . Mrs. Cavendish , startled , drops her candle , scattering the grease on the carpet . She picks it up , and retreats quickly to Mademoiselle Cynthia 's room , closing the door behind her . She hurries out into the passage , for the servants must not find her where she is . But it is too late ! Already footsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings . What can she do ? Quick as thought , she hurries back to the young girl 's room , and starts shaking her awake . The hastily aroused household come trooping down the passage . They are all busily battering at Mrs. Inglethorp 's door . It occurs to nobody that Mrs. Cavendish has not arrived with the rest , but and this is significant I can find no one who saw her come from the other wing . "
64763	64770	64757	64757	He	992	" Am I right , madame ? "
64776	64826	64773	64773	her	41	" Quite right , monsieur . You understand that , if I had thought I would do my husband any good by revealing these facts , I would have done so . But it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or innocence . "
64827	64860	64773	64773	her	41	" In a sense , that is correct , madame . But it cleared my mind of many misconceptions , and left me free to see other facts in their true significance . "
64861	64865	64867	64867	Lawrence	34	" The will ! "
64869	64882	64867	64867	Lawrence	34	" Then it was you , Mary , who destroyed the will ? "
64894	64897	64898	64898	he	31	" No , "
64902	64919	64898	64898	he	31	" There is only one person who could possibly have destroyed that will Mrs. Inglethorp herself ! "
64920	64923	64924	64924	I	0	" Impossible ! "
64927	64938	64924	64924	I	0	" She had only made it out that very afternoon ! "
64939	64988	64898	64898	he	31	" Nevertheless , _ mon ami _ , it was Mrs. Inglethorp . Because , in no other way can you account for the fact that , on one of the hottest days of the year , Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room . "
65013	65224	65009	65009	Poirot	31	" The temperature on that day , messieurs , was 80 degrees in the shade . Yet Mrs. Inglethorp ordered a fire ! Why ? Because she wished to destroy something , and could think of no other way . You will remember that , in consequence of the War economics practiced at Styles , no waste paper was thrown away . There was therefore no means of destroying a thick document such as a will . The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in Mrs. Inglethorp 's room , I leaped to the conclusion that it was to destroy some important document possibly a will . So the discovery of the charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me . I did not , of course , know at the time that the will in question had only been made this afternoon , and I will admit that , when I learnt that fact , I fell into a grievous error . I came to the conclusion that Mrs. Inglethorp 's determination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the quarrel she had that afternoon , and that therefore the quarrel took place after , and not before the making of the will .
65225	65287	65288	65288	I	0	" Here , as we know , I was wrong , and I was forced to abandon that idea . I faced the problem from a new standpoint . Now , at four o'clock , Dorcas overheard her mistress saying angrily : You need not think that any fear of publicity , or scandal between husband and wife will deter me . "
65389	65425	65374	65374	she	994	" Looking at the matter psychologically , I drew one deduction which I was convinced was correct . The second scandal ' she spoke of was not the same as the first and it concerned herself !
65426	65590	65374	65374	she	994	" Let us reconstruct . At four o'clock , Mrs. Inglethorp quarrels with her son , and threatens to denounce him to his wife who , by the way , overheard the greater part of the conversation . At four - thirty , Mrs. Inglethorp , in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills , makes a will in favour of her husband , which the two gardeners witness . At five o'clock , Dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable agitation , with a slip of paper a letter , ' Dorcas thinks in her hand , and it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted . Presumably , then , between four - thirty and five o'clock , something has occurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling , since she is now as anxious to destroy the will , as she was before to make it . What was that something ?
65591	65623	65374	65374	she	994	" As far as we know , she was quite alone during that half - hour . Nobody entered or left that boudoir . What then occasioned this sudden change of sentiment ?
65624	65911	65374	65374	she	994	" One can only guess , but I believe my guess to be correct . Mrs. Inglethorp had no stamps in her desk . We know this , because later she asked Dorcas to bring her some . Now in the opposite corner of the room stood her husband 's desk locked . She was anxious to find some stamps , and , according to my theory , she tried her own keys in the desk . That one of them fitted I know . She therefore opened the desk , and in searching for the stamps she came across something else that slip of paper which Dorcas saw in her hand , and which assuredly was never meant for Mrs. Inglethorp 's eyes . On the other hand , Mrs. Cavendish believed that the slip of paper to which her mother - in - law clung so tenaciously was a written proof of her own husband 's infidelity . She demanded it from Mrs. Inglethorp who assured her , quite truly , that it had nothing to do with that matter . Mrs. Cavendish did not believe her . She thought that Mrs. Inglethorp was shielding her stepson . Now Mrs. Cavendish is a very resolute woman , and , behind her mask of reserve , she was madly jealous of her husband . She determined to get hold of that paper at all costs , and in this resolution chance came to her aid . She happened to pick up the key of Mrs. Inglethorp 's despatch - case , which had been lost that morning . She knew that her mother - in - law invariably kept all important papers in this particular case .
65912	66026	65374	65374	she	994	" Mrs. Cavendish , therefore , made her plans as only a woman driven desperate through jealousy could have done . Some time in the evening she unbolted the door leading into Mademoiselle Cynthia 's room . Possibly she applied oil to the hinges , for I found that it opened quite noiselessly when I tried it . She put off her project until the early hours of the morning as being safer , since the servants were accustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time . She dressed completely in her land kit , and made her way quietly through Mademoiselle Cynthia 's room into that of Mrs. Inglethorp . "
66036	66051	65374	65374	she	994	" But I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room ? "
66052	66061	65374	65374	she	994	" Not if you were drugged , mademoiselle . "
66062	66065	65374	65374	she	994	" Drugged ? "
66066	66073	65374	65374	she	994	" _ Mais , oui ! _ "
66074	66077	66078	66078	he	998	" You remember "
66083	66121	66078	66078	he	998	" that through all the tumult and noise next door Mademoiselle Cynthia slept . That admitted of two possibilities . Either her sleep was feigned which I did not believe or her unconsciousness was indeed by artificial means .
66122	66209	65374	65374	she	994	" With this latter idea in my mind , I examined all the coffee - cups most carefully , remembering that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had brought Mademoiselle Cynthia her coffee the night before . I took a sample from each cup , and had them analysed with no result . I had counted the cups carefully , in the event of one having been removed . Six persons had taken coffee , and six cups were duly found . I had to confess myself mistaken .
66210	66328	66078	66078	he	998	" Then I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight . Coffee had been brought in for seven persons , not six , for Dr. Bauerstein had been there that evening . This changed the face of the whole affair , for there was now one cup missing . The servants noticed nothing , since Annie , the housemaid , who took in the coffee , brought in seven cups , not knowing that Mr. Inglethorp never drank it , whereas Dorcas , who cleared them away the following morning , found six as usual or strictly speaking she found five , the sixth being the one found broken in Mrs. Inglethorp 's room .
66329	66416	65374	65374	she	994	" I was confident that the missing cup was that of Mademoiselle Cynthia . I had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the cups found contained sugar , which Mademoiselle Cynthia never took in her coffee . My attention was attracted by the story of Annie about some salt ' on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to Mrs. Inglethorp 's room . I accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa , and sent it to be analysed . "
66417	66428	66430	66430	Lawrence	34	" But that had already been done by Dr. Bauerstein , "
66433	66470	66078	66078	he	998	" Not exactly . The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine was , or was not , present . He did not have it tested , as I did , for a narcotic . "
66471	66476	65374	65374	she	994	" For a narcotic ? "
66477	66665	66078	66078	he	998	" Yes . Here is the analyst 's report . Mrs. Cavendish administered a safe , but effectual , narcotic to both Mrs. Inglethorp and Mademoiselle Cynthia . And it is possible that she had a _ mauvais quart d'heure _ in consequence ! Imagine her feelings when her mother - in - law is suddenly taken ill and dies , and immediately after she hears the word Poison ' ! She has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was perfectly harmless , but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment she must have feared that Mrs. Inglethorp 's death lay at her door . She is seized with panic , and under its influence she hurries downstairs , and quickly drops the coffee - cup and saucer used by Mademoiselle Cynthia into a large brass vase , where it is discovered later by Monsieur Lawrence . The remains of the cocoa she dare not touch . Too many eyes are upon her . Guess at her relief when strychnine is mentioned , and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her doing .
66666	66703	65374	65374	she	994	" We are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning being so long in making their appearance . A narcotic taken with strychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours . "
66721	66757	66711	66711	him	31	" All you have said is quite true , Monsieur Poirot . It was the most awful hour of my life . I shall never forget it . But you are wonderful . I understand now "
66758	66784	66718	66718	her	41	" What I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa Poirot , eh ? But you would not trust me . "
66785	66791	66793	66793	Lawrence	34	" I see everything now , "
66795	66814	66793	66793	Lawrence	34	" The drugged cocoa , taken on top of the poisoned coffee , amply accounts for the delay . "
66815	66844	66718	66718	her	41	" Exactly . But was the coffee poisoned , or was it not ? We come to a little difficulty here , since Mrs. Inglethorp never drank it . "
66845	66848	66793	66793	Lawrence	34	" What ? "
66856	66992	66718	66718	her	41	" No . You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in Mrs. Inglethorp 's room ? There were some peculiar points about that stain . It was still damp , it exhaled a strong odour of coffee , and imbedded in the nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china . What had happened was plain to me , for not two minutes before I had placed my little case on the table near the window , and the table , tilting up , had deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot . In exactly the same way , Mrs. Inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee on reaching her room the night before , and the treacherous table had played her the same trick .
66993	67115	67116	67116	Poirot	31	" What happened next is mere guess work on my part , but I should say that Mrs. Inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the table by the bed . Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind , she heated up her cocoa , and drank it off then and there . Now we are faced with a new problem . We know the cocoa contained no strychnine . The coffee was never drunk . Yet the strychnine must have been administered between seven and nine o'clock that evening . What third medium was there a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that it is extraordinary no one has thought of it ? "
67128	67132	67116	67116	Poirot	31	" Her medicine ! "
67133	67147	67148	67148	I	0	" Do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her tonic ? "
67151	67214	67116	67116	Poirot	31	" There was no need to introduce it . It was already there in the mixture . The strychnine that killed Mrs. Inglethorp was the identical strychnine prescribed by Dr. Wilkins . To make that clear to you , I will read you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the Dispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster :
67215	67225	67116	67116	Poirot	31	" The following prescription has become famous in text books :
67323	67424	67293	67293	her	1001	" Now there was , of course , no bromide in Dr. Wilkins ' prescription , but you will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders . One or two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine would effectually precipitate the strychnine , as the book describes , and cause it to be taken in the last dose . You will learn later that the person who usually poured out Mrs. Inglethorp 's medicine was always extremely careful not to shake the bottle , but to leave the sediment at the bottom of it undisturbed .
67425	67588	67293	67293	her	1001	" Throughout the case , there have been evidences that the tragedy was intended to take place on Monday evening . On that day , Mrs. Inglethorp 's bell wire was neatly cut , and on Monday evening Mademoiselle Cynthia was spending the night with friends , so that Mrs. Inglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing , completely shut off from help of any kind , and would have died , in all probability , before medical aid could have been summoned . But in her hurry to be in time for the village entertainment Mrs. Inglethorp forgot to take her medicine , and the next day she lunched away from home , so that the last and fatal dose was actually taken twenty - four hours later than had been anticipated by the murderer ; and it is owing to that delay that the final proof the last link of the chain is now in my hands . "
67602	67660	67293	67293	her	1001	" A letter in the murderer 's own hand - writing , _ mes amis ! _ Had it been a little clearer in its terms , it is possible that Mrs. Inglethorp , warned in time , would have escaped . As it was , she realized her danger , but not the manner of it . "
67764	67800	67718	67720	the old woman	1003	" Here , my friends , the letter breaks off . Doubtless the writer was interrupted ; but there can be no question as to his identity . We all know this hand - writing and "
67812	67822	67718	67720	the old woman	1003	" You devil ! How did you get it ? "
67848	67855	67857	67857	Poirot	31	" _ Messieurs , mesdames _ , "
67863	67876	67857	67857	Poirot	31	" let me introduce you to the murderer , Mr. Alfred Inglethorp ! "
67882	67889	67890	67890	I	0	" Poirot , you old villain , "
67893	67915	67890	67890	I	0	" I 've half a mind to strangle you ! What do you mean by deceiving me as you have done ? "
67986	68008	67983	67983	he	31	" I did not deceive you , _ mon ami _ . At most , I permitted you to deceive yourself . "
68009	68015	67983	67983	he	31	" Yes , but why ? "
68016	68101	67983	67983	he	31	" Well , it is difficult to explain . You see , my friend , you have a nature so honest , and a countenance so transparent , that _ enfin _ , to conceal your feelings is impossible ! If I had told you my ideas , the very first time you saw Mr. Alfred Inglethorp that astute gentleman would have in your so expressive idiom smelt a rat ' ! And then , _ bonjour _ to our chances of catching him ! "
68102	68117	67983	67983	he	31	" I think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for . "
68118	68122	68124	68124	Poirot	31	" My friend , "
68126	68161	68124	68124	Poirot	31	" I implore you , do not enrage yourself ! Your help has been of the most invaluable . It is but the extremely beautiful nature that you have , which made me pause . "
68162	68165	68166	68166	I	0	" Well , "
68173	68185	68166	68166	I	0	" I still think you might have given me a hint . "
68186	68237	68124	68124	Poirot	31	" But I did , my friend . Several hints . You would not take them . Think now , did I ever say to you that I believed John Cavendish guilty ? Did I not , on the contrary , tell you that he would almost certainly be acquitted ? "
68238	68242	68166	68166	I	0	" Yes , but "
68243	68277	68124	68124	Poirot	31	" And did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of bringing the murderer to justice ? Was it not plain to you that I was speaking of two entirely different persons ? "
68278	68281	68282	68282	I	0	" No , "
68285	68293	68282	68282	I	0	" it was not plain to me ! "
68294	68298	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" Then again , "
68302	68335	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" at the beginning , did I not repeat to you several times that I did n't want Mr. Inglethorp arrested _ now _ ? That should have conveyed something to you . "
68336	68351	68124	68124	Poirot	31	" Do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that ? "
68352	68490	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" Yes . To begin with , whoever else might benefit by Mrs. Inglethorp 's death , her husband would benefit the most . There was no getting away from that . When I went up to Styles with you that first day , I had no idea as to how the crime had been committed , but from what I knew of Mr. Inglethorp I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to connect him with it . When I arrived at the ch teau , I realized at once that it was Mrs. Inglethorp who had burnt the will ; and there , by the way , you can not complain , my friend , for I tried my best to force on you the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer . "
68491	68496	68497	68497	I	0	" Yes , yes , "
68501	68505	68497	68497	I	0	" Go on . "
68506	68553	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" Well , my friend , as I say , my views as to Mr. Inglethorp 's guilt were very much shaken . There was , in fact , so much evidence against him that I was inclined to believe that he had not done it . "
68554	68562	68497	68497	I	0	" When did you change your mind ? "
68563	68621	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" When I found that the more efforts I made to clear him , the more efforts he made to get himself arrested . Then , when I discovered that Inglethorp had nothing to do with Mrs. Raikes and that in fact it was John Cavendish who was interested in that quarter , I was quite sure . "
68622	68626	68497	68497	I	0	" But why ? "
68627	68755	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" Simply this . If it had been Inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue with Mrs. Raikes , his silence was perfectly comprehensible . But , when I discovered that it was known all over the village that it was John who was attracted by the farmer 's pretty wife , his silence bore quite a different interpretation . It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid of the scandal , as no possible scandal could attach to him . This attitude of his gave me furiously to think , and I was slowly forced to the conclusion that Alfred Inglethorp wanted to be arrested . _ Eh bien ! _ from that moment , I was equally determined that he should not be arrested . "
68756	68772	68497	68497	I	0	" Wait a minute . I do n't see why he wished to be arrested ? "
68773	68878	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" Because , _ mon ami _ , it is the law of your country that a man once acquitted can never be tried again for the same offence . Aha ! but it was clever his idea ! Assuredly , he is a man of method . See here , he knew that in his position he was bound to be suspected , so he conceived the exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence against himself . He wished to be arrested . He would then produce his irreproachable alibi and , hey presto , he was safe for life ! "
68879	68903	68497	68497	I	0	" But I still do n't see how he managed to prove his alibi , and yet go to the chemist 's shop ? "
68911	68938	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" Is it possible ? My poor friend ! You have not yet realized that it was Miss Howard who went to the chemist 's shop ? "
68939	68943	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" Miss Howard ? "
68944	69010	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" But , certainly . Who else ? It was most easy for her . She is of a good height , her voice is deep and manly ; moreover , remember , she and Inglethorp are cousins , and there is a distinct resemblance between them , especially in their gait and bearing . It was simplicity itself . They are a clever pair ! "
69011	69028	69029	69029	I	0	" I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was done , "
69032	69302	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" _ Bon ! _ I will reconstruct for you as far as possible . I am inclined to think that Miss Howard was the master mind in that affair . You remember her once mentioning that her father was a doctor ? Possibly she dispensed his medicines for him , or she may have taken the idea from one of the many books lying about when Mademoiselle Cynthia was studying for her exam . Anyway , she was familiar with the fact that the addition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause the precipitation of the latter . Probably the idea came to her quite suddenly . Mrs. Inglethorp had a box of bromide powders , which she occasionally took at night . What could be easier than quietly to dissolve one or more of those powders in Mrs. Inglethorp 's large sized bottle of medicine when it came from Coot 's ? The risk is practically nil . The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later . If anyone has seen either of them touching the medicine , they will have forgotten it by that time . Miss Howard will have engineered her quarrel , and departed from the house . The lapse of time , and her absence , will defeat all suspicion . Yes , it was a clever idea ! If they had left it alone , it is possible the crime might never have been brought home to them . But they were not satisfied . They tried to be too clever and that was their undoing . "
69317	69347	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on John Cavendish , by buying strychnine at the village chemist 's , and signing the register in his hand - writing .
69348	69463	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" On Monday Mrs. Inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine . On Monday , therefore , at six o'clock , Alfred Inglethorp arranges to be seen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village . Miss Howard has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and Mrs. Raikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards . At six o'clock , Miss Howard , disguised as Alfred Inglethorp , enters the chemist 's shop , with her story about a dog , obtains the strychnine , and writes the name of Alfred Inglethorp in John 's handwriting , which she had previously studied carefully .
69464	69511	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" But , as it will never do if John , too , can prove an alibi , she writes him an anonymous note still copying his hand - writing which takes him to a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see him .
69512	69571	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" So far , all goes well . Miss Howard goes back to Middlingham . Alfred Inglethorp returns to Styles . There is nothing that can compromise him in any way , since it is Miss Howard who has the strychnine , which , after all , is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on John Cavendish .
69572	69613	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" But now a hitch occurs . Mrs. Inglethorp does not take her medicine that night . The broken bell , Cynthia 's absence arranged by Inglethorp through his wife all these are wasted . And then he makes his slip .
69614	69736	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" Mrs. Inglethorp is out , and he sits down to write to his accomplice , who , he fears , may be in a panic at the non - success of their plan . It is probable that Mrs. Inglethorp returned earlier than he expected . Caught in the act , and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his desk . He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it again , and that Mrs. Inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before he could snatch it up . So he goes out and walks in the woods , little dreaming that Mrs. Inglethorp will open his desk , and discover the incriminating document .
69737	69846	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" But this , as we know , is what happened . Mrs. Inglethorp reads it , and becomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and Evelyn Howard , though , unfortunately , the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to her mind . She knows that she is in danger but is ignorant of where the danger lies . She decides to say nothing to her husband , but sits down and writes to her solicitor , asking him to come on the morrow , and she also determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just made . She keeps the fatal letter . "
69847	69869	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" It was to discover that letter , then , that her husband forced the lock of the despatch - case ? "
69870	69905	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" Yes , and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he realized its importance . That letter excepted , there was absolutely nothing to connect him with the crime . "
69906	69933	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" There 's only one thing I ca n't make out , why did n't he destroy it at once when he got hold of it ? "
69934	69955	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" Because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all that of keeping it on his own person . "
69956	69962	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" I do n't understand . "
69963	70141	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" Look at it from his point of view . I have discovered that there were only five short minutes in which he could have taken it the five minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene , for before that time Annie was brushing the stairs , and would have seen anyone who passed going to the right wing . Figure to yourself the scene ! He enters the room , unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys they were all much alike . He hurries to the despatch - case it is locked , and the keys are nowhere to be seen . That is a terrible blow to him , for it means that his presence in the room can not be concealed as he had hoped . But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake of that damning piece of evidence . Quickly , he forces the lock with a penknife , and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking for .
70142	70277	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" But now a fresh dilemma arises : he dare not keep that piece of paper on him . He may be seen leaving the room he may be searched . If the paper is found on him , it is certain doom . Probably , at this minute , too , he hears the sounds below of Mr. Wells and John leaving the boudoir . He must act quickly . Where can he hide this terrible slip of paper ? The contents of the waste - paper - basket are kept and in any case , are sure to be examined . There are no means of destroying it ; and he dare not keep it . He looks round , and he sees what do you think , _ mon ami ? _ "
70283	70322	68300	68300	Poirot	31	" In a moment , he has torn the letter into long thin strips , and rolling them up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other spills in the vase on the mantle - piece . "
70328	70337	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" No one would think of looking there , "
70341	70365	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" And he will be able , at his leisure , to come back and destroy this solitary piece of evidence against him . "
70366	70390	70391	70391	I	0	" Then , all the time , it was in the spill vase in Mrs. Inglethorp 's bedroom , under our very noses ? "
70397	70423	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" Yes , my friend . That is where I discovered my last link , ' and I owe that very fortunate discovery to you . "
70424	70428	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" To me ? "
70429	70451	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" Yes . Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was straightening the ornaments on the mantelpiece ? "
70452	70460	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" Yes , but I do n't see "
70461	70530	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" No , but I saw . Do you know , my friend , I remembered that earlier in the morning , when we had been there together , I had straightened all the objects on the mantelpiece . And , if they were already straightened , there would be no need to straighten them again , unless , in the meantime , someone else had touched them . "
70531	70535	70536	70536	I	0	" Dear me , "
70539	70562	70536	70536	I	0	" so that is the explanation of your extraordinary behaviour . You rushed down to Styles , and found it still there ? "
70563	70574	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" Yes , and it was a race for time . "
70575	70603	70536	70536	I	0	" But I still ca n't understand why Inglethorp was such a fool as to leave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it . "
70604	70620	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" Ah , but he had no opportunity . _ I _ saw to that . "
70621	70624	70536	70536	I	0	" You ? "
70625	70644	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" Yes . Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my confidence on the subject ? "
70645	70648	70536	70536	I	0	" Yes . "
70649	70779	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" Well , my friend , I saw there was just one chance . I was not sure then if Inglethorp was the criminal or not , but if he was I reasoned that he would not have the paper on him , but would have hidden it somewhere , and by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually prevent his destroying it . He was already under suspicion , and by making the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur detectives , who would be watching him unceasingly , and being himself aware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy the document . He was therefore forced to depart from the house , leaving it in the spill vase . "
70780	70792	70536	70536	I	0	" But surely Miss Howard had ample opportunities of aiding him . "
70793	70931	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" Yes , but Miss Howard did not know of the paper 's existence . In accordance with their prearranged plan , she never spoke to Alfred Inglethorp . They were supposed to be deadly enemies , and until John Cavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a meeting . Of course I had a watch kept on Mr. Inglethorp , hoping that sooner or later he would lead me to the hiding - place . But he was too clever to take any chances . The paper was safe where it was ; since no one had thought of looking there in the first week , it was not likely they would do so afterwards . But for your lucky remark , we might never have been able to bring him to justice . "
70932	70949	70536	70536	I	0	" I understand that now ; but when did you first begin to suspect Miss Howard ? "
70950	70973	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" When I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the letter she had received from Mrs. Inglethorp . "
70974	70984	70536	70536	I	0	" Why , what was there to lie about ? "
70985	70998	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" You saw that letter ? Do you recall its general appearance ? "
70999	71005	70536	70536	I	0	" Yes more or less . "
71006	71065	70338	70338	Poirot	31	" You will recollect , then , that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very distinctive hand , and left large clear spaces between her words . But if you look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that July 17th ' is quite different in this respect . Do you see what I mean ? "
71066	71069	71070	71070	I	0	" No , "
71073	71078	71070	71070	I	0	" I do n't . "
71079	71124	70536	70536	I	0	" You do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th , but on the 7th the day after Miss Howard 's departure ? The 1 ' was written in before the 7 ' to turn it into the 17th ' . "
71125	71129	71070	71070	I	0	" But why ? "
71130	71206	70536	70536	I	0	" That is exactly what I asked myself . Why does Miss Howard suppress the letter written on the 17th , and produce this faked one instead ? Because she did not wish to show the letter of the 17th . Why , again ? And at once a suspicion dawned in my mind . You will remember my saying that it was wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth . "
71207	71211	71212	71212	I	0	" And yet , "
71216	71235	71212	71212	I	0	" after that , you gave me two reasons why Miss Howard could not have committed the crime ! "
71236	71243	71245	71245	Poirot	31	" And very good reasons too , "
71247	71409	71245	71245	Poirot	31	" For a long time they were a stumbling - block to me until I remembered a very significant fact : that she and Alfred Inglethorp were cousins . She could not have committed the crime single - handed , but the reasons against that did not debar her from being an accomplice . And , then , there was that rather over - vehement hatred of hers ! It concealed a very opposite emotion . There was , undoubtedly , a tie of passion between them long before he came to Styles . They had already arranged their infamous plot that he should marry this rich , but rather foolish old lady , induce her to make a will leaving her money to him , and then gain their ends by a very cleverly conceived crime . If all had gone as they planned , they would probably have left England , and lived together on their poor victim 's money .
71410	71509	70536	70536	I	0	" They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair . While suspicion was to be directed against him , she would be making quiet preparations for a very different _ d nouement _ . She arrives from Middlingham with all the compromising items in her possession . No suspicion attaches to her . No notice is paid to her coming and going in the house . She hides the strychnine and glasses in John 's room . She puts the beard in the attic . She will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered . "
71510	71526	71527	71527	I	0	" I do n't quite see why they tried to fix the blame on John , "
71530	71547	71527	71527	I	0	" It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime home to Lawrence . "
71548	71584	71843	71843	I	0	" Yes , but that was mere chance . All the evidence against him arose out of pure accident . It must , in fact , have been distinctly annoying to the pair of schemers . "
71585	71591	71592	71592	I	0	" His manner was unfortunate , "
71596	71613	70536	70536	I	0	" Yes . You realize , of course , what was at the back of that ? "
71614	71617	70536	70536	I	0	" No . "
71618	71633	70536	70536	I	0	" You did not understand that he believed Mademoiselle Cynthia guilty of the crime ? "
71634	71637	71638	71638	I	0	" No , "
71643	71646	71638	71638	I	0	" Impossible ! "
71647	71713	70536	70536	I	0	" Not at all . I myself nearly had the same idea . It was in my mind when I asked Mr. Wells that first question about the will . Then there were the bromide powders which she had made up , and her clever male impersonations , as Dorcas recounted them to us . There was really more evidence against her than anyone else . "
71714	71721	71638	71638	I	0	" You are joking , Poirot ! "
71722	71780	70536	70536	I	0	" No . Shall I tell you what made Monsieur Lawrence turn so pale when he first entered his mother 's room on the fatal night ? It was because , whilst his mother lay there , obviously poisoned , he saw , over your shoulder , that the door into Mademoiselle Cynthia 's room was unbolted . "
71781	71791	71792	71792	I	0	" But he declared that he saw it bolted ! "
71795	71798	71800	71800	Poirot	31	" Exactly , "
71803	71823	71800	71800	Poirot	31	" And that was just what confirmed my suspicion that it was not . He was shielding Mademoiselle Cynthia . "
71824	71832	71638	71638	I	0	" But why should he shield her ? "
71833	71842	71800	71800	Poirot	31	" Because he is in love with her . "
71846	71878	70536	70536	I	0	" There , Poirot , you are quite wrong ! I happen to know for a fact that , far from being in love with her , he positively dislikes her . "
71879	71890	71843	71843	I	0	" Who told you that , _ mon ami ? _ "
71891	71895	70536	70536	I	0	" Cynthia herself . "
71896	71908	71843	71843	I	0	" _ La pauvre petite ! _ And she was concerned ? "
71909	71920	70536	70536	I	0	" She said that she did not mind at all . "
71921	71930	71932	71932	Poirot	31	" Then she certainly did mind very much , "
71934	71944	71932	71932	Poirot	31	" They are like that _ les femmes ! _ "
71945	71958	71959	71959	I	0	" What you say about Lawrence is a great surprise to me , "
71962	72103	71843	71843	I	0	" But why ? It was most obvious . Did not Monsieur Lawrence make the sour face every time Mademoiselle Cynthia spoke and laughed with his brother ? He had taken it into his long head that Mademoiselle Cynthia was in love with Monsieur John . When he entered his mother 's room , and saw her obviously poisoned , he jumped to the conclusion that Mademoiselle Cynthia knew something about the matter . He was nearly driven desperate . First he crushed the coffee - cup to powder under his feet , remembering that _ she _ had gone up with his mother the night before , and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its contents . Thenceforward , he strenuously , and quite uselessly , upheld the theory of Death from natural causes ' . "
72104	72115	71959	71959	I	0	" And what about the extra coffee - cup ' ? "
72116	72185	71843	71843	I	0	" I was fairly certain that it was Mrs. Cavendish who had hidden it , but I had to make sure . Monsieur Lawrence did not know at all what I meant ; but , on reflection , he came to the conclusion that if he could find an extra coffee - cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion . And he was perfectly right . "
72186	72201	71959	71959	I	0	" One thing more . What did Mrs. Inglethorp mean by her dying words ? "
72202	72215	71843	71843	I	0	" They were , of course , an accusation against her husband . "
72216	72222	72223	72223	I	0	" Dear me , Poirot , "
72229	72255	72223	72223	I	0	" I think you have explained everything . I am glad it has all ended so happily . Even John and his wife are reconciled . "
72256	72261	72223	72223	I	0	" Thanks to me . "
72262	72271	72223	72223	I	0	" How do you mean thanks to you ? "
72272	72432	72223	72223	I	0	" My dear friend , do you not realize that it was simply and solely the trial which has brought them together again ? That John Cavendish still loved his wife , I was convinced . Also , that she was equally in love with him . But they had drifted very far apart . It all arose from a misunderstanding . She married him without love . He knew it . He is a sensitive man in his way , he would not force himself upon her if she did not want him . And , as he withdrew , her love awoke . But they are both unusually proud , and their pride held them inexorably apart . He drifted into an entanglement with Mrs. Raikes , and she deliberately cultivated the friendship of Dr. Bauerstein . Do you remember the day of John Cavendish 's arrest , when you found me deliberating over a big decision ? "
72433	72442	72223	72223	I	0	" Yes , I quite understood your distress . "
72443	72520	72223	72223	I	0	" Pardon me , _ mon ami _ , but you did not understand it in the least . I was trying to decide whether or not I would clear John Cavendish at once . I could have cleared him though it might have meant a failure to convict the real criminals . They were entirely in the dark as to my real attitude up to the very last moment which partly accounts for my success . "
72521	72538	72223	72223	I	0	" Do you mean that you could have saved John Cavendish from being brought to trial ? "
72539	72578	72223	72223	I	0	" Yes , my friend . But I eventually decided in favour of a woman 's happiness ' . Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed could have brought these two proud souls together again . "
72615	72626	72628	72628	Poirot	31	" I perceive your thoughts , _ mon ami _ , "
72634	72672	72628	72628	Poirot	31	" No one but Hercule Poirot would have attempted such a thing ! And you are wrong in condemning it . The happiness of one man and one woman is the greatest thing in all the world . "
72729	72734	72735	72735	he	31	" Yes , madame , "
72738	72747	72735	72735	he	31	" I have brought him back to you . "
72779	72787	72788	72788	I	0	" Perhaps you are right , Poirot , "
72792	72804	72788	72788	I	0	" Yes , it is the greatest thing in the world . "
72820	72824	72788	72788	I	0	" I I only "
72825	72829	72830	72830	I	0	" Come in , "
72846	72854	72788	72788	I	0	" I only wanted to tell you something "
72855	72858	72788	72788	I	0	" Yes ? "
72874	72878	72859	72859	Cynthia	38	" You dears ! "
72894	72902	72903	72903	I	0	" What on earth does this mean ? "
72929	72948	72950	72950	Poirot	31	" It means that she has discovered Monsieur Lawrence does not dislike her as much as she thought , "
72953	72955	73000	73003	A man in love	1015	" But "
72956	72961	73000	73003	A man in love	1015	" Here he is . "
72970	72976	72978	72978	Poirot	31	" Eh ! Monsieur Lawrence , "
72980	72991	72978	72978	Poirot	31	" We must congratulate you , is it not so ? "
73018	73028	73080	73081	THE END	1016	" What is it , _ mon ami ? _ "
73029	73032	73033	73033	I	0	" Nothing , "
73037	73044	73033	73033	I	0	" They are two delightful women ! "
73045	73054	73056	73056	Poirot	31	" And neither of them is for you ? "
73058	73079	73056	73056	Poirot	31	" Never mind . Console yourself , my friend . We may hunt together again , who knows ? And then "
