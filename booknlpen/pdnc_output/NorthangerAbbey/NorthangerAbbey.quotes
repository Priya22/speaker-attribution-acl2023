1910	1963	1901	1901	Her	82	" I beg , Catherine , you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat , when you come from the rooms at night ; and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend ; I will give you this little book on purpose . "
3041	3058	3024	3024	she	91	" I wish you could dance , my dear I wish you could get a partner . "
3311	3323	3325	3325	she	91	" It would have been very shocking to have it torn , "
3327	3360	3325	3325	she	91	" would not it ? It is such a delicate muslin . For my part I have not seen anything I like so well in the whole room , I assure you . "
3361	3367	3369	3369	Catherine	77	" How uncomfortable it is , "
3371	3380	3369	3369	Catherine	77	" not to have a single acquaintance here ! "
3381	3387	3389	3390	Mrs. Allen	91	" Yes , my dear , "
3396	3403	3389	3390	Mrs. Allen	91	" it is very uncomfortable indeed . "
3404	3434	3325	3325	she	91	" What shall we do ? The gentlemen and ladies at this table look as if they wondered why we came here we seem forcing ourselves into their party . "
3435	3456	3389	3390	Mrs. Allen	91	" Aye , so we do . That is very disagreeable . I wish we had a large acquaintance here . "
3457	3474	3325	3325	she	91	" I wish we had _ any ; _ it would be somebody to go to . "
3475	3506	3389	3390	Mrs. Allen	91	" Very true , my dear ; and if we knew anybody we would join them directly . The Skinners were here last year I wish they were here now . "
3507	3530	3325	3325	she	91	" Had not we better go away as it is ? Here are no tea - things for us , you see . "
3531	3584	3389	3390	Mrs. Allen	91	" No more there are , indeed . How very provoking ! But I think we had better sit still , for one gets so tumbled in such a crowd ! How is my head , my dear ? Somebody gave me a push that has hurt it , I am afraid . "
3585	3625	3325	3325	she	91	" No , indeed , it looks very nice . But , dear Mrs. Allen , are you sure there is nobody you know in all this multitude of people ? I think you _ must _ know somebody . "
3626	3700	3389	3390	Mrs. Allen	91	" I don t , upon my word I wish I did . I wish I had a large acquaintance here with all my heart , and then I should get you a partner . I should be so glad to have you dance . There goes a strange - looking woman ! What an odd gown she has got on ! How old - fashioned it is ! Look at the back . "
3763	3769	3771	3771	he	89	" Well , Miss Morland , "
3775	3785	3771	3771	he	89	" I hope you have had an agreeable ball . "
3786	3791	3792	3792	she	344	" Very agreeable indeed , "
3803	3813	3815	3816	his wife	345	" I wish she had been able to dance , "
3818	3882	3815	3816	his wife	345	" I wish we could have got a partner for her . I have been saying how glad I should be if the Skinners were here this winter instead of last ; or if the Parrys had come , as they talked of once , she might have danced with George Parry . I am so sorry she has not had a partner ! "
3883	3893	3895	3896	Mr. Allen	89	" We shall do better another evening I hope , "
4423	4513	4418	4418	he	374	" I have hitherto been very remiss , madam , in the proper attentions of a partner here ; I have not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath ; whether you were ever here before ; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms , the theatre , and the concert ; and how you like the place altogether . I have been very negligent but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these particulars ? If you are I will begin directly . "
4514	4525	4552	4552	he	377	" You need not give yourself that trouble , sir . "
4526	4536	4552	4552	he	377	" No trouble , I assure you , madam . "
4560	4570	4552	4552	he	377	" Have you been long in Bath , madam ? "
4571	4578	4580	4580	Catherine	77	" About a week , sir , "
4587	4590	4552	4552	he	377	" Really ! "
4595	4604	4552	4552	he	377	" Why should you be surprised , sir ? "
4605	4610	4612	4612	he	377	" Why , indeed ! "
4619	4661	4612	4612	he	377	" But some emotion must appear to be raised by your reply , and surprise is more easily assumed , and not less reasonable than any other . Now let us go on . Were you never here before , madam ? "
4662	4667	4552	4552	he	377	" Never , sir . "
4668	4679	4612	4612	he	377	" Indeed ! Have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms ? "
4680	4691	4552	4552	he	377	" Yes , sir , I was there last Monday . "
4692	4700	4612	4612	he	377	" Have you been to the theatre ? "
4701	4714	4552	4552	he	377	" Yes , sir , I was at the play on Tuesday . "
4715	4720	4612	4612	he	377	" To the concert ? "
4721	4729	4552	4552	he	377	" Yes , sir , on Wednesday . "
4730	4739	4612	4612	he	377	" And are you altogether pleased with Bath ? "
4740	4748	4552	4552	he	377	" Yes I like it very well . "
4749	4765	4612	4612	he	377	" Now I must give one smirk , and then we may be rational again . "
4781	4790	4792	4792	he	378	" I see what you think of me , "
4794	4807	4552	4552	he	377	" I shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow . "
4808	4812	4552	4552	he	377	" My journal ! "
4813	4876	4552	4552	he	377	" Yes , I know exactly what you will say : Friday , went to the Lower Rooms ; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings plain black shoes appeared to much advantage ; but was strangely harassed by a queer , half - witted man , who would make me dance with him , and distressed me by his nonsense . "
4877	4886	4552	4552	he	377	" Indeed I shall say no such thing . "
4887	4898	4552	4552	he	377	" Shall I tell you what you ought to say ? "
4899	4904	4552	4552	he	377	" If you please . "
4905	4957	4552	4552	he	377	" I danced with a very agreeable young man , introduced by Mr. King ; had a great deal of conversation with him seems a most extraordinary genius hope I may know more of him . _ That _ , madam , is what I _ wish _ you to say . "
4958	4968	4552	4552	he	377	" But , perhaps , I keep no journal . "
4969	5166	4552	4552	he	377	" Perhaps you are not sitting in this room , and I am not sitting by you . These are points in which a doubt is equally possible . Not keep a journal ! How are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your life in Bath without one ? How are the civilities and compliments of every day to be related as they ought to be , unless noted down every evening in a journal ? How are your various dresses to be remembered , and the particular state of your complexion , and curl of your hair to be described in all their diversities , without having constant recourse to a journal ? My dear madam , I am not so ignorant of young ladies ways as you wish to believe me ; it is this delightful habit of journaling which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which ladies are so generally celebrated . Everybody allows that the talent of writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female . Nature may have done something , but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the practice of keeping a journal . "
5167	5173	5175	5175	Catherine	77	" I have sometimes thought , "
5179	5205	5175	5175	Catherine	77	" whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen ! That is I should not think the superiority was always on our side . "
5206	5239	4552	4552	he	377	" As far as I have had opportunity of judging , it appears to me that the usual style of letter - writing among women is faultless , except in three particulars . "
5240	5246	5175	5175	Catherine	77	" And what are they ? "
5247	5268	4552	4552	he	377	" A general deficiency of subject , a total inattention to stops , and a very frequent ignorance of grammar . "
5269	5297	5175	5175	Catherine	77	" Upon my word ! I need not have been afraid of disclaiming the compliment . You do not think too highly of us in that way . "
5298	5350	4552	4552	he	377	" I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better letters than men , than that they sing better duets , or draw better landscapes . In every power , of which taste is the foundation , excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes . "
5358	5363	5365	5365	she	91	" My dear Catherine , "
5367	5412	5365	5365	she	91	" do take this pin out of my sleeve ; I am afraid it has torn a hole already ; I shall be quite sorry if it has , for this is a favourite gown , though it cost but nine shillings a yard . "
5413	5426	5428	5429	Mr. Tilney	98	" That is exactly what I should have guessed it , madam , "
5436	5444	4552	4552	he	377	" Do you understand muslins , sir ? "
5445	5520	5365	5365	she	91	" Particularly well ; I always buy my own cravats , and am allowed to be an excellent judge ; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of a gown . I bought one for her the other day , and it was pronounced to be a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it . I gave but five shillings a yard for it , and a true Indian muslin . "
5530	5541	5543	5543	she	91	" Men commonly take so little notice of those things , "
5545	5573	5543	5543	she	91	" I can never get Mr. Allen to know one of my gowns from another . You must be a great comfort to your sister , sir . "
5574	5582	5365	5365	she	91	" I hope I am , madam . "
5583	5599	5543	5543	she	91	" And pray , sir , what do you think of Miss Morland s gown ? "
5600	5608	5610	5610	he	98	" It is very pretty , madam , "
5616	5634	5610	5610	he	98	" but I do not think it will wash well ; I am afraid it will fray . "
5635	5640	5642	5642	Catherine	77	" How can you , "
5646	5649	5650	5650	She	77	" be so "
5654	5657	5543	5543	she	91	" strange . "
5658	5668	5670	5671	Mrs. Allen	91	" I am quite of your opinion , sir , "
5673	5685	5670	5671	Mrs. Allen	91	" and so I told Miss Morland when she bought it . "
5686	5762	5610	5610	he	98	" But then you know , madam , muslin always turns to some account or other ; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief , or a cap , or a cloak . Muslin can never be said to be wasted . I have heard my sister say so forty times , when she has been extravagant in buying more than she wanted , or careless in cutting it to pieces . "
5763	5865	5876	5876	she	380	" Bath is a charming place , sir ; there are so many good shops here . We are sadly off in the country ; not but what we have very good shops in Salisbury , but it is so far to go eight miles is a long way ; Mr. Allen says it is nine , measured nine ; but I am sure it can not be more than eight ; and it is such a fag I come back tired to death . Now , here one can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes . "
5917	5926	5928	5928	he	98	" What are you thinking of so earnestly ? "
5938	5962	5928	5928	he	98	" not of your partner , I hope , for , by that shake of the head , your meditations are not satisfactory . "
5969	5977	5963	5963	Catherine	77	" I was not thinking of anything . "
5978	6004	5928	5928	he	98	" That is artful and deep , to be sure ; but I had rather be told at once that you will not tell me . "
6005	6013	5963	5963	Catherine	77	" Well then , I will not . "
6014	6050	5928	5928	he	98	" Thank you ; for now we shall soon be acquainted , as I am authorized to tease you on this subject whenever we meet , and nothing in the world advances intimacy so much . "
6405	6413	6415	6416	Mrs. Allen	91	" What a delightful place Bath is , "
6435	6449	6415	6416	Mrs. Allen	91	" and how pleasant it would be if we had any acquaintance here . "
6482	6490	6478	6478	we	402	" despair of nothing we would attain , "
6492	6499	6478	6478	we	402	" unwearied diligence our point would gain "
6568	6601	6611	6612	the stranger	405	" I think , madam , I can not be mistaken ; it is a long time since I had the pleasure of seeing you , but is not your name Allen ? "
6926	6933	6935	6936	Mrs. Thorpe	102	" Here come my dear girls , "
6957	7010	6935	6936	Mrs. Thorpe	102	" My dear Mrs. Allen , I long to introduce them ; they will be so delighted to see you : the tallest is Isabella , my eldest ; is not she a fine young woman ? The others are very much admired too , but I believe Isabella is the handsomest . "
7062	7072	7052	7055	the eldest young lady	423	" How excessively like her brother Miss Morland is ! "
7073	7081	7083	7084	the mother	425	" The very picture of him indeed ! "
7086	7097	7083	7084	the mother	425	" I should have known her anywhere for his sister ! "
8304	8315	8294	8294	She	77	" for she must confess herself very partial to the profession "
8443	8453	8454	8454	They	486	" I wish we had some acquaintance in Bath ! "
8459	8471	8473	8473	she	91	" How glad I am we have met with Mrs. Thorpe ! "
8989	9020	9049	9051	the young lady	508	" I am no novel - reader I seldom look into novels Do not imagine that _ I _ often read novels It is really very well for a novel . "
9028	9037	9049	9051	the young lady	508	" And what are you reading , Miss ? "
9038	9047	9049	9051	the young lady	508	" Oh ! It is only a novel ! "
9067	9078	9054	9054	she	508	" It is only Cecilia , or Camilla , or Belinda "
9344	9368	9338	9338	her	106	" My dearest creature , what can have made you so late ? I have been waiting for you at least this age ! "
9369	9408	9338	9338	her	106	" Have you , indeed ! I am very sorry for it ; but really I thought I was in very good time . It is but just one . I hope you have not been here long ? "
9409	9561	9338	9338	her	106	" Oh ! These ten ages at least . I am sure I have been here this half hour . But now , let us go and sit down at the other end of the room , and enjoy ourselves . I have an hundred things to say to you . In the first place , I was so afraid it would rain this morning , just as I wanted to set off ; it looked very showery , and that would have thrown me into agonies ! Do you know , I saw the prettiest hat you can imagine , in a shop window in Milsom Street just now very like yours , only with coquelicot ribbons instead of green ; I quite longed for it . But , my dearest Catherine , what have you been doing with yourself all this morning ? Have you gone on with Udolpho ? "
9562	9584	9338	9338	her	106	" Yes , I have been reading it ever since I woke ; and I am got to the black veil . "
9585	9618	9338	9338	her	106	" Are you , indeed ? How delightful ! Oh ! I would not tell you what is behind the black veil for the world ! Are not you wild to know ? "
9619	9709	9338	9338	her	106	" Oh ! Yes , quite ; what can it be ? But do not tell me I would not be told upon any account . I know it must be a skeleton , I am sure it is Laurentina s skeleton . Oh ! I am delighted with the book ! I should like to spend my whole life in reading it . I assure you , if it had not been to meet you , I would not have come away from it for all the world . "
9710	9755	9338	9338	her	106	" Dear creature ! How much I am obliged to you ; and when you have finished Udolpho , we will read the Italian together ; and I have made out a list of ten or twelve more of the same kind for you . "
9756	9772	9338	9338	her	106	" Have you , indeed ! How glad I am ! What are they all ? "
9773	9824	9338	9338	her	106	" I will read you their names directly ; here they are , in my pocketbook . Castle of Wolfenbach , Clermont , Mysterious Warnings , Necromancer of the Black Forest , Midnight Bell , Orphan of the Rhine , and Horrid Mysteries . Those will last us some time . "
9825	9845	9338	9338	her	106	" Yes , pretty well ; but are they all horrid , are you sure they are all horrid ? "
9846	9938	9338	9338	her	106	" Yes , quite sure ; for a particular friend of mine , a Miss Andrews , a sweet girl , one of the sweetest creatures in the world , has read every one of them . I wish you knew Miss Andrews , you would be delighted with her . She is netting herself the sweetest cloak you can conceive . I think her as beautiful as an angel , and I am so vexed with the men for not admiring her ! I scold them all amazingly about it . "
9939	9952	9338	9338	her	106	" Scold them ! Do you scold them for not admiring her ? "
9953	10110	9338	9338	her	106	" Yes , that I do . There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends . I have no notion of loving people by halves ; it is not my nature . My attachments are always excessively strong . I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night , I would not dance with him , unless he would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel . The men think us incapable of real friendship , you know , and I am determined to show them the difference . Now , if I were to hear anybody speak slightingly of you , I should fire up in a moment : but that is not at all likely , for _ you _ are just the kind of girl to be a great favourite with the men . "
10111	10116	10118	10118	Catherine	77	" Oh , dear ! "
10122	10129	10118	10118	Catherine	77	" How can you say so ? "
10130	10197	10198	10198	Catherine	77	" I know you very well ; you have so much animation , which is exactly what Miss Andrews wants , for I must confess there is something amazingly insipid about her . Oh ! I must tell you , that just after we parted yesterday , I saw a young man looking at you so earnestly I am sure he is in love with you . "
10208	10251	10205	10205	Isabella	106	" It is very true , upon my honour , but I see how it is ; you are indifferent to everybody s admiration , except that of one gentleman , who shall be nameless . Nay , I can not blame you "
10255	10310	9338	9338	her	106	" your feelings are easily understood . Where the heart is really attached , I know very well how little one can be pleased with the attention of anybody else . Everything is so insipid , so uninteresting , that does not relate to the beloved object ! I can perfectly comprehend your feelings . "
10311	10337	9338	9338	her	106	" But you should not persuade me that I think so very much about Mr. Tilney , for perhaps I may never see him again . "
10338	10366	9338	9338	her	106	" Not see him again ! My dearest creature , do not talk of it . I am sure you would be miserable if you thought so ! "
10367	10433	9338	9338	her	106	" No , indeed , I should not . I do not pretend to say that I was not very much pleased with him ; but while I have Udolpho to read , I feel as if nobody could make me miserable . Oh ! The dreadful black veil ! My dear Isabella , I am sure there must be Laurentina s skeleton behind it . "
10434	10460	9338	9338	her	106	" It is so odd to me , that you should never have read Udolpho before ; but I suppose Mrs. Morland objects to novels . "
10461	10487	9338	9338	her	106	" No , she does not . She very often reads Sir Charles Grandison herself ; but new books do not fall in our way . "
10488	10516	9338	9338	her	106	" Sir Charles Grandison ! That is an amazing horrid book , is it not ? I remember Miss Andrews could not get through the first volume . "
10517	10535	9338	9338	her	106	" It is not like Udolpho at all ; but yet I think it is very entertaining . "
10536	10596	9338	9338	her	106	" Do you indeed ! You surprise me ; I thought it had not been readable . But , my dearest Catherine , have you settled what to wear on your head tonight ? I am determined at all events to be dressed exactly like you . The men take notice of _ that _ sometimes , you know . "
10597	10607	10609	10609	Catherine	77	" But it does not signify if they do , "
10614	10655	9338	9338	her	106	" Signify ! Oh , heavens ! I make it a rule never to mind what they say . They are very often amazingly impertinent if you do not treat them with spirit , and make them keep their distance . "
10656	10677	9338	9338	her	106	" Are they ? Well , I never observed _ that _ . They always behave very well to me . "
10678	10744	9338	9338	her	106	" Oh ! They give themselves such airs . They are the most conceited creatures in the world , and think themselves of so much importance ! By the by , though I have thought of it a hundred times , I have always forgot to ask you what is your favourite complexion in a man . Do you like them best dark or fair ? "
10745	10774	9338	9338	her	106	" I hardly know . I never much thought about it . Something between both , I think . Brown not fair , and and not very dark . "
10775	10856	9338	9338	her	106	" Very well , Catherine . That is exactly he . I have not forgot your description of Mr. Tilney a brown skin , with dark eyes , and rather dark hair . Well , my taste is different . I prefer light eyes , and as to complexion do you know I like a sallow better than any other . You must not betray me , if you should ever meet with one of your acquaintance answering that description . "
10857	10866	9338	9338	her	106	" Betray you ! What do you mean ? "
10867	10889	9338	9338	her	106	" Nay , do not distress me . I believe I have said too much . Let us drop the subject . "
10941	11003	10933	10934	her friend	313	" For heaven s sake ! Let us move away from this end of the room . Do you know , there are two odious young men who have been staring at me this half hour . They really put me quite out of countenance . Let us go and look at the arrivals . They will hardly follow us there . "
11033	11074	11028	11031	these alarming young men	522	" They are not coming this way , are they ? I hope they are not so impertinent as to follow us . Pray let me know if they are coming . I am determined I will not look up . "
11106	11114	11116	11116	Isabella	106	" And which way are they gone ? "
11122	11133	11116	11116	Isabella	106	" One was a very good - looking young man . "
11134	11143	11088	11088	she	77	" They went towards the church - yard . "
11144	11189	11116	11116	Isabella	106	" Well , I am amazingly glad I have got rid of them ! And now , what say you to going to Edgar s Buildings with me , and looking at my new hat ? You said you should like to see it . "
11194	11197	11198	11198	she	77	" Only , "
11201	11211	11198	11198	she	77	" perhaps we may overtake the two young men . "
11212	11241	11116	11116	Isabella	106	" Oh ! Never mind that . If we make haste , we shall pass by them presently , and I am dying to show you my hat . "
11242	11264	11198	11198	she	77	" But if we only wait a few minutes , there will be no danger of our seeing them at all . "
11265	11300	11116	11116	Isabella	106	" I shall not pay them any such compliment , I assure you . I have no notion of treating men with such respect . _ That _ is the way to spoil them . "
11588	11595	11597	11597	Isabella	106	" Oh , these odious gigs ! "
11602	11608	11597	11597	Isabella	106	" How I detest them . "
11629	11638	11623	11623	she	106	" Delightful ! Mr. Morland and my brother ! "
11639	11646	11623	11623	she	106	" Good heaven ! Tis James ! "
11954	11971	11948	11948	He	2221	" How long do you think we have been running it from Tetbury , Miss Morland ? "
11972	11980	11981	11982	Her brother	2221	" I do not know the distance . "
11993	11999	12001	12001	Thorpe	101	" _ Three_-and - twenty ! "
12003	12015	12001	12001	Thorpe	101	" five - and - twenty if it is an inch . "
12047	12059	12061	12061	he	2221	" I know it must be five - and - twenty , "
12063	12126	12061	12061	he	2221	" by the time we have been doing it . It is now half after one ; we drove out of the inn - yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven ; and I defy any man in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in harness ; that makes it exactly twenty - five . "
12127	12134	12136	12136	Morland	90	" You have lost an hour , "
12138	12151	12136	12136	Morland	90	" it was only ten o clock when we came from Tetbury . "
12152	12206	12039	12039	he	2221	" Ten o clock ! It was eleven , upon my soul ! I counted every stroke . This brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses , Miss Morland ; do but look at my horse ; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in your life ? "
12221	12253	12039	12039	he	2221	" Such true blood ! Three hours and and a half indeed coming only three and twenty miles ! Look at that creature , and suppose it possible if you can . "
12254	12267	12039	12039	he	2221	" He _ does _ look very hot , to be sure . "
12268	12511	12039	12039	he	2221	" Hot ! He had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church ; but look at his forehand ; look at his loins ; only see how he moves ; that horse _ can not _ go less than ten miles an hour : tie his legs and he will get on . What do you think of my gig , Miss Morland ? A neat one , is not it ? Well hung ; town - built ; I have not had it a month . It was built for a Christchurch man , a friend of mine , a very good sort of fellow ; he ran it a few weeks , till , I believe , it was convenient to have done with it . I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the kind , though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too ; but I chanced to meet him on Magdalen Bridge , as he was driving into Oxford , last term : Ah ! Thorpe , said he , do you happen to want such a little thing as this ? It is a capital one of the kind , but I am cursed tired of it . Oh ! D , said I ; I am your man ; what do you ask ? And how much do you think he did , Miss Morland ? "
12512	12523	12039	12039	he	2221	" I am sure I can not guess at all . "
12524	12588	12039	12039	he	2221	" Curricle - hung , you see ; seat , trunk , sword - case , splashing - board , lamps , silver moulding , all you see complete ; the iron - work as good as new , or better . He asked fifty guineas ; I closed with him directly , threw down the money , and the carriage was mine . "
12589	12595	12597	12597	Catherine	77	" And I am sure , "
12599	12619	12597	12597	Catherine	77	" I know so little of such things that I can not judge whether it was cheap or dear . "
12620	12650	12705	12707	the young ladies	560	" Neither one nor t other ; I might have got it for less , I dare say ; but I hate haggling , and poor Freeman wanted cash . "
12651	12661	12663	12663	Catherine	77	" That was very good - natured of you , "
12668	12694	12705	12707	the young ladies	560	" Oh ! D it , when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend , I hate to be pitiful . "
12856	12910	12853	12853	his	103	" You will find , however , Miss Morland , it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people , for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day ; Jackson , of Oriel , bid me sixty at once ; Morland was with me at the time . "
12911	12914	12916	12916	Morland	90	" Yes , "
12922	12932	12916	12916	Morland	90	" but you forget that your horse was included . "
12933	12963	12853	12853	his	103	" My horse ! Oh , d it ! I would not sell my horse for a hundred . Are you fond of an open carriage , Miss Morland ? "
12964	12988	12916	12916	Morland	90	" Yes , very ; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one ; but I am particularly fond of it . "
12989	13006	12853	12853	his	103	" I am glad of it ; I will drive you out in mine every day . "
13007	13011	13013	13013	Catherine	77	" Thank you , "
13031	13041	12853	12853	his	103	" I will drive you up Lansdown Hill tomorrow . "
13042	13054	12916	12916	Morland	90	" Thank you ; but will not your horse want rest ? "
13055	13107	12853	12853	his	103	" Rest ! He has only come three and twenty miles today ; all nonsense ; nothing ruins horses so much as rest ; nothing knocks them up so soon . No , no ; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day while I am here . "
13108	13113	13115	13115	Catherine	77	" Shall you indeed ! "
13119	13128	13115	13115	Catherine	77	" That will be forty miles a day . "
13129	13157	12853	12853	his	103	" Forty ! Aye , fifty , for what I care . Well , I will drive you up Lansdown tomorrow ; mind , I am engaged . "
13158	13165	13167	13167	Isabella	106	" How delightful that will be ! "
13172	13198	13167	13167	Isabella	106	" My dearest Catherine , I quite envy you ; but I am afraid , brother , you will not have room for a third . "
13199	13236	13245	13247	the other two	567	" A third indeed ! No , no ; I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about ; that would be a good joke , faith ! Morland must take care of you . "
13368	13378	13340	13340	her	77	" Have you ever read Udolpho , Mr. Thorpe ? "
13379	13401	13340	13340	her	77	" Udolpho ! Oh , Lord ! Not I ; I never read novels ; I have something else to do . "
13423	13474	13417	13417	he	571	" Novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff ; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since Tom Jones , except The Monk ; I read that t other day ; but as for all the others , they are the stupidest things in creation . "
13475	13496	13340	13340	her	77	" I think you must like Udolpho , if you were to read it ; it is so very interesting . "
13497	13537	13417	13417	he	571	" Not I , faith ! No , if I read any , it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe s ; her novels are amusing enough ; they are worth reading ; some fun and nature in _ them _ . "
13538	13546	13548	13548	Catherine	77	" Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe , "
13561	13604	13417	13417	he	571	" No sure ; was it ? Aye , I remember , so it was ; I was thinking of that other stupid book , written by that woman they make such a fuss about , she who married the French emigrant . "
13605	13612	13417	13417	he	571	" I suppose you mean Camilla ? "
13613	13694	13417	13417	he	571	" Yes , that s the book ; such unnatural stuff ! An old man playing at see - saw , I took up the first volume once and looked it over , but I soon found it would not do ; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be before I saw it : as soon as I heard she had married an emigrant , I was sure I should never be able to get through it . "
13695	13702	13417	13417	he	571	" I have never read it . "
13703	13751	13417	13417	he	571	" You had no loss , I assure you ; it is the horridest nonsense you can imagine ; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man s playing at see - saw and learning Latin ; upon my soul there is not . "
13817	13827	13829	13829	he	577	" Ah , Mother ! How do you do ? "
13840	13888	13829	13829	he	577	" Where did you get that quiz of a hat ? It makes you look like an old witch . Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you , so you must look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near . "
14117	14130	14105	14105	James	108	" Well , Catherine , how do you like my friend Thorpe ? "
14154	14163	14164	14164	she	77	" I do not like him at all , "
14168	14180	14164	14164	she	77	" I like him very much ; he seems very agreeable . "
14181	14223	14136	14136	she	77	" He is as good - natured a fellow as ever lived ; a little of a rattle ; but that will recommend him to your sex , I believe : and how do you like the rest of the family ? "
14224	14234	14164	14164	she	77	" Very , very much indeed : Isabella particularly . "
14235	14322	14136	14136	she	77	" I am very glad to hear you say so ; she is just the kind of young woman I could wish to see you attached to ; she has so much good sense , and is so thoroughly unaffected and amiable ; I always wanted you to know her ; and she seems very fond of you . She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be ; and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you , Catherine , "
14329	14335	14136	14136	she	77	" may be proud of . "
14336	14341	14342	14342	she	589	" Indeed I am , "
14345	14378	14342	14342	she	589	" I love her exceedingly , and am delighted to find that you like her too . You hardly mentioned anything of her when you wrote to me after your visit there . "
14379	14450	14136	14136	she	77	" Because I thought I should soon see you myself . I hope you will be a great deal together while you are in Bath . She is a most amiable girl ; such a superior understanding ! How fond all the family are of her ; she is evidently the general favourite ; and how much she must be admired in such a place as this is not she ? "
14451	14471	14342	14342	she	589	" Yes , very much indeed , I fancy ; Mr. Allen thinks her the prettiest girl in Bath . "
14472	14546	14136	14136	she	77	" I dare say he does ; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of beauty than Mr. Allen . I need not ask you whether you are happy here , my dear Catherine ; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe , it would be impossible for you to be otherwise ; and the Allens , I am sure , are very kind to you ? "
14547	14591	14342	14342	she	589	" Yes , very kind ; I never was so happy before ; and now you are come it will be more delightful than ever ; how good it is of you to come so far on purpose to see _ me _ . "
14614	14624	14601	14601	his	108	" Indeed , Catherine , I love you dearly . "
15031	15036	15038	15038	she	449	" I assure you , "
15040	15068	15038	15038	she	449	" I would not stand up without your dear sister for all the world ; for if I did we should certainly be separated the whole evening . "
15111	15164	15106	15107	his sister	2222	" My dear creature , I am afraid I must leave you , your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin ; I know you will not mind my going away , and I dare say John will be back in a moment , and then you may easily find me out . "
15201	15210	15194	15195	her friend	313	" Good - bye , my dear love , "
15742	15764	15765	15765	He	98	" I am very happy to see you again , sir , indeed ; I was afraid you had left Bath . "
15797	15897	15765	15765	He	98	" Well , sir , and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again , for it is just the place for young people and indeed for everybody else too . I tell Mr. Allen , when he talks of being sick of it , that I am sure he should not complain , for it is so very agreeable a place , that it is much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year . I tell him he is quite in luck to be sent here for his health . "
15898	15924	16018	16018	she	102	" And I hope , madam , that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place , from finding it of service to him . "
15925	15961	15765	15765	He	98	" Thank you , sir . I have no doubt that he will . A neighbour of ours , Dr. Skinner , was here for his health last winter , and came away quite stout . "
15962	15970	16018	16018	she	102	" That circumstance must give great encouragement . "
15971	16002	15765	15765	He	98	" Yes , sir and Dr. Skinner and his family were here three months ; so I tell Mr. Allen he must not be in a hurry to get away . "
16341	16350	16352	16352	she	383	" I beg your pardon , Miss Morland , "
16354	16391	16352	16352	she	383	" for this liberty but I can not anyhow get to Miss Thorpe , and Mrs. Thorpe said she was sure you would not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you . "
16716	16764	16684	16684	she	95	" At last I have got you . My dearest creature , I have been looking for you this hour . What could induce you to come into this set , when you knew I was in the other ? I have been quite wretched without you . "
16765	16790	16684	16684	she	95	" My dear Isabella , how was it possible for me to get at you ? I could not even see where you were . "
16791	16878	16684	16684	she	95	" So I told your brother all the time but he would not believe me . Do go and see for her , Mr. Morland , said I but all in vain he would not stir an inch . Was not it so , Mr. Morland ? But you men are all so immoderately lazy ! I have been scolding him to such a degree , my dear Catherine , you would be quite amazed . You know I never stand upon ceremony with such people . "
16879	16893	16895	16895	Catherine	77	" Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head , "
16903	16911	16895	16895	Catherine	77	" It is Mr. Tilney s sister . "
16912	16993	16684	16684	she	95	" Oh ! Heavens ! You don t say so ! Let me look at her this moment . What a delightful girl ! I never saw anything half so beautiful ! But where is her all - conquering brother ? Is he in the room ? Point him out to me this instant , if he is . I die to see him . Mr. Morland , you are not to listen . We are not talking about you . "
16994	17008	16895	16895	Catherine	77	" But what is all this whispering about ? What is going on ? "
17009	17056	16684	16684	she	95	" There now , I knew how it would be . You men have such restless curiosity ! Talk of the curiosity of women , indeed ! Tis nothing . But be satisfied , for you are not to know anything at all of the matter . "
17057	17070	16895	16895	Catherine	77	" And is that likely to satisfy me , do you think ? "
17071	17123	16684	16684	she	95	" Well , I declare I never knew anything like you . What can it signify to you , what we are talking of . Perhaps we are talking about you ; therefore I would advise you not to listen , or you may happen to hear something not very agreeable . "
17200	17208	17209	17209	she	77	" I tell you , Mr. Morland , "
17212	17292	17209	17209	she	77	" I would not do such a thing for all the world . How can you be so teasing ; only conceive , my dear Catherine , what your brother wants me to do . He wants me to dance with him again , though I tell him that it is a most improper thing , and entirely against the rules . It would make us the talk of the place , if we were not to change partners . "
17293	17298	17300	17300	James	108	" Upon my honour , "
17302	17316	17300	17300	James	108	" in these public assemblies , it is as often done as not . "
17317	17379	17209	17209	she	77	" Nonsense , how can you say so ? But when you men have a point to carry , you never stick at anything . My sweet Catherine , do support me ; persuade your brother how impossible it is . Tell him that it would quite shock you to see me do such a thing ; now would not it ? "
17380	17400	17300	17300	James	108	" No , not at all ; but if you think it wrong , you had much better change . "
17401	17404	17406	17406	Isabella	106	" There , "
17408	17464	17406	17406	Isabella	106	" you hear what your sister says , and yet you will not mind her . Well , remember that it is not my fault , if we set all the old ladies in Bath in a bustle . Come along , my dearest Catherine , for heaven s sake , and stand by me . "
17553	17559	17561	17562	Mrs. Thorpe	102	" Well , my dear , "
17571	17581	17561	17562	Mrs. Thorpe	102	" I hope you have had an agreeable partner . "
17582	17588	17545	17545	she	77	" Very agreeable , madam . "
17589	17605	17561	17562	Mrs. Thorpe	102	" I am glad of it . John has charming spirits , has not he ? "
17606	17616	17618	17619	Mrs. Allen	91	" Did you meet Mr. Tilney , my dear ? "
17621	17628	17561	17562	Mrs. Thorpe	102	" No , where is he ? "
17629	17671	17561	17562	Mrs. Thorpe	102	" He was with us just now , and said he was so tired of lounging about , that he was resolved to go and dance ; so I thought perhaps he would ask you , if he met with you . "
17672	17678	17680	17680	Catherine	77	" Where can he be ? "
17704	17722	17724	17725	Mrs. Allen	91	" Ah ! He has got a partner ; I wish he had asked _ you _ , "
17736	17745	17733	17733	she	91	" he is a very agreeable young man . "
17746	17754	17756	17757	Mrs. Thorpe	102	" Indeed he is , Mrs. Allen , "
17762	17789	17756	17757	Mrs. Thorpe	102	" I must say it , though I _ am _ his mother , that there is not a more agreeable young man in the world . "
17829	17842	17820	17820	she	91	" I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son . "
17891	17912	17880	17881	John Thorpe	103	" Well , Miss Morland , I suppose you and I are to stand up and jig it together again . "
17913	17948	17880	17881	John Thorpe	103	" Oh , no ; I am much obliged to you , our two dances are over ; and , besides , I am tired , and do not mean to dance any more . "
17949	17999	18003	18003	herself	77	" Do not you ? Then let us walk about and quiz people . Come along with me , and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room ; my two younger sisters and their partners . I have been laughing at them this half hour . "
18092	18096	18072	18073	the latter	562	" dearest Catherine . "
18519	18627	18510	18511	John Thorpe	103	" Well , Miss Morland , here I am . Have you been waiting long ? We could not come before ; the old devil of a coachmaker was such an eternity finding out a thing fit to be got into , and now it is ten thousand to one but they break down before we are out of the street . How do you do , Mrs. Allen ? A famous ball last night , was not it ? Come , Miss Morland , be quick , for the others are in a confounded hurry to be off . They want to get their tumble over . "
18628	18634	18636	18636	Catherine	77	" What do you mean ? "
18638	18646	18636	18636	Catherine	77	" Where are you all going to ? "
18647	18685	18510	18511	John Thorpe	103	" Going to ? Why , you have not forgot our engagement ! Did not we agree together to take a drive this morning ? What a head you have ! We are going up Claverton Down . "
18686	18696	18698	18698	Catherine	77	" Something was said about it , I remember , "
18708	18717	18698	18698	Catherine	77	" but really I did not expect you . "
18718	18744	18761	18762	Mrs. Allen	91	" Not expect me ! That s a good one ! And what a dust you would have made , if I had not come . "
18849	18876	18828	18829	Mr. Thorpe	122	" Well , ma am , what do you say to it ? Can you spare me for an hour or two ? Shall I go ? "
18877	18887	18889	18890	Mrs. Allen	91	" Do just as you please , my dear , "
18964	18969	18971	18971	Isabella	106	" My dearest creature , "
18990	19041	18971	18971	Isabella	106	" you have been at least three hours getting ready . I was afraid you were ill . What a delightful ball we had last night . I have a thousand things to say to you ; but make haste and get in , for I long to be off . "
19063	19077	19056	19057	her friend	313	" What a sweet girl she is ! I quite dote on her . "
19078	19088	19090	19090	Thorpe	122	" You will not be frightened , Miss Morland , "
19098	19160	19090	19090	Thorpe	122	" if my horse should dance about a little at first setting off . He will , most likely , give a plunge or two , and perhaps take the rest for a minute ; but he will soon know his master . He is full of spirits , playful as can be , but there is no vice in him . "
19243	19249	19228	19236	the servant who stood at the horse s head	685	" to let him go , "
19475	19488	19495	19495	he	122	" Old Allen is as rich as a Jew is not he ? "
19504	19514	19495	19495	he	122	" Old Allen , the man you are with . "
19515	19534	19495	19495	he	122	" Oh ! Mr. Allen , you mean . Yes , I believe , he is very rich . "
19535	19542	19495	19495	he	122	" And no children at all ? "
19543	19548	19495	19495	he	122	" No not any . "
19549	19569	19495	19495	he	122	" A famous thing for his next heirs . He is _ your _ godfather , is not he ? "
19570	19576	19495	19495	he	122	" My godfather ! No . "
19577	19587	19495	19495	he	122	" But you are always very much with them . "
19588	19594	19495	19495	he	122	" Yes , very much . "
19595	19643	19495	19495	he	122	" Aye , that is what I meant . He seems a good kind of old fellow enough , and has lived very well in his time , I dare say ; he is not gouty for nothing . Does he drink his bottle a day now ? "
19644	19679	19495	19495	he	122	" His bottle a day ! No . Why should you think of such a thing ? He is a very temperate man , and you could not fancy him in liquor last night ? "
19680	19754	19495	19495	he	122	" Lord help you ! You women are always thinking of men s being in liquor . Why , you do not suppose a man is overset by a bottle ? I am sure of _ this _ that if everybody was to drink their bottle a day , there would not be half the disorders in the world there are now . It would be a famous good thing for us all . "
19755	19762	19495	19495	he	122	" I can not believe it . "
19763	19801	19495	19495	he	122	" Oh ! Lord , it would be the saving of thousands . There is not the hundredth part of the wine consumed in this kingdom that there ought to be . Our foggy climate wants help . "
19802	19820	19495	19495	he	122	" And yet I have heard that there is a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford . "
19821	19947	19495	19495	he	122	" Oxford ! There is no drinking at Oxford now , I assure you . Nobody drinks there . You would hardly meet with a man who goes beyond his four pints at the utmost . Now , for instance , it was reckoned a remarkable thing , at the last party in my rooms , that upon an average we cleared about five pints a head . It was looked upon as something out of the common way . _ Mine _ is famous good stuff , to be sure . You would not often meet with anything like it in Oxford and that may account for it . But this will just give you a notion of the general rate of drinking there . "
19948	19957	19959	19959	Catherine	77	" Yes , it does give a notion , "
19962	19994	19959	19959	Catherine	77	" and that is , that you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did . However , I am sure James does not drink so much . "
20228	20238	20240	20240	Catherine	77	" You do not really think , Mr. Thorpe , "
20264	20273	20240	20240	Catherine	77	" that James s gig will break down ? "
20274	20376	20240	20240	Catherine	77	" Break down ! Oh ! Lord ! Did you ever see such a little tittuppy thing in your life ? There is not a sound piece of iron about it . The wheels have been fairly worn out these ten years at least and as for the body ! Upon my soul , you might shake it to pieces yourself with a touch . It is the most devilish little rickety business I ever beheld ! Thank God ! we have got a better . I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds . "
20377	20381	20383	20383	Catherine	77	" Good heavens ! "
20388	20433	20383	20383	Catherine	77	" Then pray let us turn back ; they will certainly meet with an accident if we go on . Do let us turn back , Mr. Thorpe ; stop and speak to my brother , and tell him how very unsafe it is . "
20434	20536	20240	20240	Catherine	77	" Unsafe ! Oh , lord ! What is there in that ? They will only get a roll if it does break down ; and there is plenty of dirt ; it will be excellent falling . Oh , curse it ! The carriage is safe enough , if a man knows how to drive it ; a thing of that sort in good hands will last above twenty years after it is fairly worn out . Lord bless you ! I would undertake for five pounds to drive it to York and back again , without losing a nail . "
21136	21142	21130	21131	her friend	313	" Past three o clock ! "
21391	21401	21361	21361	she	77	" Well , my dear , here you are , "
21415	21426	21405	21405	she	77	" and I hope you have had a pleasant airing ? "
21427	21446	21361	21361	she	77	" Yes , ma am , I thank you ; we could not have had a nicer day . "
21447	21462	21405	21405	she	77	" So Mrs. Thorpe said ; she was vastly pleased at your all going . "
21463	21472	21361	21361	she	77	" You have seen Mrs. Thorpe , then ? "
21473	21527	21405	21405	she	77	" Yes , I went to the pump - room as soon as you were gone , and there I met her , and we had a great deal of talk together . She says there was hardly any veal to be got at market this morning , it is so uncommonly scarce . "
21528	21538	21361	21361	she	77	" Did you see anybody else of our acquaintance ? "
21539	21568	21405	21405	she	77	" Yes ; we agreed to take a turn in the Crescent , and there we met Mrs. Hughes , and Mr. and Miss Tilney walking with her . "
21569	21581	21361	21361	she	77	" Did you indeed ? And did they speak to you ? "
21582	21641	21405	21405	she	77	" Yes , we walked along the Crescent together for half an hour . They seem very agreeable people . Miss Tilney was in a very pretty spotted muslin , and I fancy , by what I can learn , that she always dresses very handsomely . Mrs. Hughes talked to me a great deal about the family . "
21642	21652	21361	21361	she	77	" And what did she tell you of them ? "
21653	21668	21405	21405	she	77	" Oh ! A vast deal indeed ; she hardly talked of anything else . "
21669	21682	21361	21361	she	77	" Did she tell you what part of Gloucestershire they come from ? "
21683	21769	21405	21405	she	77	" Yes , she did ; but I can not recollect now . But they are very good kind of people , and very rich . Mrs. Tilney was a Miss Drummond , and she and Mrs. Hughes were schoolfellows ; and Miss Drummond had a very large fortune ; and , when she married , her father gave her twenty thousand pounds , and five hundred to buy wedding - clothes . Mrs. Hughes saw all the clothes after they came from the warehouse . "
21770	21780	21361	21361	she	77	" And are Mr. and Mrs. Tilney in Bath ? "
21781	21870	21405	21405	she	77	" Yes , I fancy they are , but I am not quite certain . Upon recollection , however , I have a notion they are both dead ; at least the mother is ; yes , I am sure Mrs. Tilney is dead , because Mrs. Hughes told me there was a very beautiful set of pearls that Mr. Drummond gave his daughter on her wedding - day and that Miss Tilney has got now , for they were put by for her when her mother died . "
21871	21884	21361	21361	she	77	" And is Mr. Tilney , my partner , the only son ? "
21885	21928	21405	21405	she	77	" I can not be quite positive about that , my dear ; I have some idea he is ; but , however , he is a very fine young man , Mrs. Hughes says , and likely to do very well . "
22100	22116	22118	22118	her	562	" Oh , heavens ! My beloved Catherine , have I got you at last ? "
22131	22137	22139	22139	he	726	" Now , Mr. Morland , "
22149	22349	22139	22139	he	726	" I shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening ; so I charge you not to expect it . My sweetest Catherine , how have you been this long age ? But I need not ask you , for you look delightfully . You really have done your hair in a more heavenly style than ever ; you mischievous creature , do you want to attract everybody ? I assure you , my brother is quite in love with you already ; and as for Mr. Tilney but _ that _ is a settled thing even _ your _ modesty can not doubt his attachment now ; his coming back to Bath makes it too plain . Oh ! What would not I give to see him ! I really am quite wild with impatience . My mother says he is the most delightful young man in the world ; she saw him this morning , you know ; you must introduce him to me . Is he in the house now ? Look about , for heaven s sake ! I assure you , I can hardly exist till I see him . "
22350	22353	22355	22355	Catherine	77	" No , "
22357	22370	22355	22355	Catherine	77	" he is not here ; I can not see him anywhere . "
22371	22529	22139	22139	he	726	" Oh , horrid ! Am I never to be acquainted with him ? How do you like my gown ? I think it does not look amiss ; the sleeves were entirely my own thought . Do you know , I get so immoderately sick of Bath ; your brother and I were agreeing this morning that , though it is vastly well to be here for a few weeks , we would not live here for millions . We soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place ; really , our opinions were so exactly the same , it was quite ridiculous ! There was not a single point in which we differed ; I would not have had you by for the world ; you are such a sly thing , I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it . "
22530	22538	22355	22355	Catherine	77	" No , indeed I should not . "
22539	22606	22139	22139	he	726	" Oh , yes you would indeed ; I know you better than you know yourself . You would have told us that we seemed born for each other , or some nonsense of that kind , which would have distressed me beyond conception ; my cheeks would have been as red as your roses ; I would not have had you by for the world . "
22607	22641	22355	22355	Catherine	77	" Indeed you do me injustice ; I would not have made so improper a remark upon any account ; and besides , I am sure it would never have entered my head . "
23122	23129	23135	23135	Catherine	77	" How well your brother dances ! "
23153	23156	23157	23157	she	77	" Henry ! "
23163	23172	23157	23157	she	77	" Yes , he does dance very well . "
23173	23212	23213	23214	Miss Tilney	95	" He must have thought it very odd to hear me say I was engaged the other evening , when he saw me sitting down . But I really had been engaged the whole day to Mr. Thorpe . "
23219	23225	23227	23227	Catherine	77	" You can not think , "
23234	23255	23227	23227	Catherine	77	" how surprised I was to see him again . I felt so sure of his being quite gone away . "
23256	23287	23157	23157	she	77	" When Henry had the pleasure of seeing you before , he was in Bath but for a couple of days . He came only to engage lodgings for us . "
23288	23327	23227	23227	Catherine	77	" _ That _ never occurred to me ; and of course , not seeing him anywhere , I thought he must be gone . Was not the young lady he danced with on Monday a Miss Smith ? "
23328	23337	23157	23157	she	77	" Yes , an acquaintance of Mrs. Hughes . "
23338	23355	23227	23227	Catherine	77	" I dare say she was very glad to dance . Do you think her pretty ? "
23356	23360	23157	23157	she	77	" Not very . "
23361	23374	23227	23227	Catherine	77	" He never comes to the pump - room , I suppose ? "
23375	23391	23157	23157	she	77	" Yes , sometimes ; but he has rid out this morning with my father . "
23409	23423	23425	23425	Catherine	77	" I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon , "
23427	23437	23425	23425	Catherine	77	" Shall you be at the cotillion ball tomorrow ? "
23438	23449	23396	23396	them	747	" Perhaps we Yes , I think we certainly shall . "
23450	23464	23425	23425	Catherine	77	" I am glad of it , for we shall all be there . "
24047	24057	24059	24059	Isabella	106	" Do not be frightened , my dear Catherine , "
24061	24130	24059	24059	Isabella	106	" but I am really going to dance with your brother again . I declare positively it is quite shocking . I tell him he ought to be ashamed of himself , but you and John must keep us in countenance . Make haste , my dear creature , and come to us . John is just walked off , but he will be back in a moment . "
24353	24359	24361	24361	he	103	" Heyday , Miss Morland ! "
24363	24381	24361	24361	he	103	" What is the meaning of this ? I thought you and I were to dance together . "
24382	24396	24351	24351	her	77	" I wonder you should think so , for you never asked me . "
24397	24531	24361	24361	he	103	" That is a good one , by Jove ! I asked you as soon as I came into the room , and I was just going to ask you again , but when I turned round , you were gone ! This is a cursed shabby trick ! I only came for the sake of dancing with _ you _ , and I firmly believe you were engaged to me ever since Monday . Yes ; I remember , I asked you while you were waiting in the lobby for your cloak . And here have I been telling all my acquaintance that I was going to dance with the prettiest girl in the room ; and when they see you standing up with somebody else , they will quiz me famously . "
24532	24553	24351	24351	her	77	" Oh , no ; they will never think of _ me _ , after such a description as that . "
24554	24580	24581	24581	Catherine	77	" By heavens , if they do not , I will kick them out of the room for blockheads . What chap have you there ? "
24586	24589	24590	24590	he	771	" Tilney , "
24593	24753	24590	24590	he	771	" Hum I do not know him . A good figure of a man ; well put together . Does he want a horse ? Here is a friend of mine , Sam Fletcher , has got one to sell that would suit anybody . A famous clever animal for the road only forty guineas . I had fifty minds to buy it myself , for it is one of my maxims always to buy a good horse when I meet with one ; but it would not answer my purpose , it would not do for the field . I would give any money for a real good hunter . I have three now , the best that ever were backed . I would not take eight hundred guineas for them . Fletcher and I mean to get a house in Leicestershire , against the next season . It is so d uncomfortable , living at an inn . "
24796	24925	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" That gentleman would have put me out of patience , had he stayed with you half a minute longer . He has no business to withdraw the attention of my partner from me . We have entered into a contract of mutual agreeableness for the space of an evening , and all our agreeableness belongs solely to each other for that time . Nobody can fasten themselves on the notice of one , without injuring the rights of the other . I consider a country - dance as an emblem of marriage . Fidelity and complaisance are the principal duties of both ; and those men who do not choose to dance or marry themselves , have no business with the partners or wives of their neighbours . "
24926	24935	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" But they are such very different things ! "
24936	24947	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" That you think they can not be compared together . "
24948	24986	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" To be sure not . People that marry can never part , but must go and keep house together . People that dance only stand opposite each other in a long room for half an hour . "
24987	25147	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" And such is your definition of matrimony and dancing . Taken in that light certainly , their resemblance is not striking ; but I think I could place them in such a view . You will allow , that in both , man has the advantage of choice , woman only the power of refusal ; that in both , it is an engagement between man and woman , formed for the advantage of each ; and that when once entered into , they belong exclusively to each other till the moment of its dissolution ; that it is their duty , each to endeavour to give the other no cause for wishing that he or she had bestowed themselves elsewhere , and their best interest to keep their own imaginations from wandering towards the perfections of their neighbours , or fancying that they should have been better off with anyone else . You will allow all this ? "
25148	25196	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" Yes , to be sure , as you state it , all this sounds very well ; but still they are so very different . I can not look upon them at all in the same light , nor think the same duties belong to them . "
25197	25300	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" In one respect , there certainly is a difference . In marriage , the man is supposed to provide for the support of the woman , the woman to make the home agreeable to the man ; he is to purvey , and she is to smile . But in dancing , their duties are exactly changed ; the agreeableness , the compliance are expected from him , while she furnishes the fan and the lavender water . _ That _ , I suppose , was the difference of duties which struck you , as rendering the conditions incapable of comparison . "
25301	25312	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" No , indeed , I never thought of that . "
25313	25422	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" Then I am quite at a loss . One thing , however , I must observe . This disposition on your side is rather alarming . You totally disallow any similarity in the obligations ; and may I not thence infer that your notions of the duties of the dancing state are not so strict as your partner might wish ? Have I not reason to fear that if the gentleman who spoke to you just now were to return , or if any other gentleman were to address you , there would be nothing to restrain you from conversing with him as long as you chose ? "
25423	25470	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" Mr. Thorpe is such a very particular friend of my brother s , that if he talks to me , I must talk to him again ; but there are hardly three young men in the room besides him that I have any acquaintance with . "
25471	25485	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" And is that to be my only security ? Alas , alas ! "
25486	25532	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" Nay , I am sure you can not have a better ; for if I do not know anybody , it is impossible for me to talk to them ; and , besides , I do not _ want _ to talk to anybody . "
25533	25569	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" Now you have given me a security worth having ; and I shall proceed with courage . Do you find Bath as agreeable as when I had the honour of making the inquiry before ? "
25570	25579	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" Yes , quite more so , indeed . "
25580	25613	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" More so ! Take care , or you will forget to be tired of it at the proper time . You ought to be tired at the end of six weeks . "
25614	25633	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" I do not think I should be tired , if I were to stay here six months . "
25634	25720	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" Bath , compared with London , has little variety , and so everybody finds out every year . For six weeks , I allow Bath is pleasant enough ; but beyond _ that _ , it is the most tiresome place in the world . You would be told so by people of all descriptions , who come regularly every winter , lengthen their six weeks into ten or twelve , and go away at last because they can afford to stay no longer . "
25721	25803	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" Well , other people must judge for themselves , and those who go to London may think nothing of Bath . But I , who live in a small retired village in the country , can never find greater sameness in such a place as this than in my own home ; for here are a variety of amusements , a variety of things to be seen and done all day long , which I can know nothing of there . "
25804	25813	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" You are not fond of the country . "
25814	25859	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" Yes , I am . I have always lived there , and always been very happy . But certainly there is much more sameness in a country life than in a Bath life . One day in the country is exactly like another . "
25860	25875	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" But then you spend your time so much more rationally in the country . "
25876	25880	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" Do I ? "
25881	25886	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" Do you not ? "
25887	25897	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" I do not believe there is much difference . "
25898	25911	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" Here you are in pursuit only of amusement all day long . "
25912	25964	24787	24788	Her partner	393	" And so I am at home only I do not find so much of it . I walk about here , and so I do there ; but here I see a variety of people in every street , and there I can only go and call on Mrs. Allen . "
25972	25981	25982	25982	he	98	" Only go and call on Mrs. Allen ! "
25985	26027	25982	25982	he	98	" What a picture of intellectual poverty ! However , when you sink into this abyss again , you will have more to say . You will be able to talk of Bath , and of all that you did here . "
26028	26148	26252	26255	the lookers - on	777	" Oh ! Yes . I shall never be in want of something to talk of again to Mrs. Allen , or anybody else . I really believe I shall always be talking of Bath , when I am at home again I _ do _ like it so very much . If I could but have Papa and Mamma , and the rest of them here , I suppose I should be too happy ! James s coming ( my eldest brother ) is quite delightful and especially as it turns out that the very family we are just got so intimate with are his intimate friends already . Oh ! Who can ever be tired of Bath ? "
26149	26209	25982	25982	he	98	" Not those who bring such fresh feelings of every sort to it as you do . But papas and mammas , and brothers , and intimate friends are a good deal gone by , to most of the frequenters of Bath and the honest relish of balls and plays , and everyday sights , is past with them . "
26353	26389	26345	26346	her partner	393	" I see that you guess what I have just been asked . That gentleman knows your name , and you have a right to know his . It is General Tilney , my father . "
26395	26398	26390	26390	Catherine	77	" Oh ! "
26403	26406	26438	26438	he	783	" Oh ! "
26445	26453	26438	26438	he	783	" How handsome a family they are ! "
26555	26561	26562	26562	she	77	" I shall like it , "
26565	26585	26562	26562	she	77	" beyond anything in the world ; and do not let us put it off let us go tomorrow . "
26631	26637	26620	26620	they	787	" Remember twelve o clock , "
26840	26870	26832	26833	Mrs. Allen	91	" She had no doubt in the world of its being a very fine day , if the clouds would only go off , and the sun keep out . "
26895	26908	26911	26911	her	77	" Oh ! dear , I do believe it will be wet , "
26918	26926	26928	26929	Mrs. Allen	91	" I thought how it would be , "
26931	26938	26940	26940	Catherine	77	" No walk for me today , "
26942	26959	26940	26940	Catherine	77	" but perhaps it may come to nothing , or it may hold up before twelve . "
26960	26977	26911	26911	her	77	" Perhaps it may , but then , my dear , it will be so dirty . "
26978	26991	26940	26940	Catherine	77	" Oh ! That will not signify ; I never mind dirt . "
26992	26995	26997	26998	her friend	313	" No , "
27002	27010	26997	26998	her friend	313	" I know you never mind dirt . "
27016	27024	27026	27026	Catherine	77	" It comes on faster and faster ! "
27036	27054	26911	26911	her	77	" So it does indeed . If it keeps raining , the streets will be very wet . "
27055	27072	26911	26911	her	77	" There are four umbrellas up already . How I hate the sight of an umbrella ! "
27073	27092	26911	26911	her	77	" They are disagreeable things to carry . I would much rather take a chair at any time . "
27093	27112	26911	26911	her	77	" It was such a nice - looking morning ! I felt so convinced it would be dry ! "
27113	27190	26911	26911	her	77	" Anybody would have thought so indeed . There will be very few people in the pump - room , if it rains all the morning . I hope Mr. Allen will put on his greatcoat when he goes , but I dare say he will not , for he had rather do anything in the world than walk out in a greatcoat ; I wonder he should dislike it , it must be so comfortable . "
27244	27256	27225	27225	she	77	" You will not be able to go , my dear . "
27257	27357	27225	27225	she	77	" I do not quite despair yet . I shall not give it up till a quarter after twelve . This is just the time of day for it to clear up , and I do think it looks a little lighter . There , it is twenty minutes after twelve , and now I _ shall _ give it up entirely . Oh ! That we had such weather here as they had at Udolpho , or at least in Tuscany and the south of France ! the night that poor St. Aubin died ! such beautiful weather ! "
27450	27458	27445	27446	Mrs. Allen	91	" always thought it would clear up . "
27552	27591	27592	27593	Mrs. Allen	91	" Isabella , my brother , and Mr. Thorpe , I declare ! They are coming for me perhaps but I shall not go I can not go indeed , for you know Miss Tilney may still call . "
27629	27636	27618	27618	he	103	" Make haste ! Make haste ! "
27644	27672	27638	27638	he	103	" Put on your hat this moment there is no time to be lost we are going to Bristol . How d ye do , Mrs. Allen ? "
27673	27709	27618	27618	he	103	" To Bristol ! Is not that a great way off ? But , however , I can not go with you today , because I am engaged ; I expect some friends every moment . "
27744	27887	27733	27735	the two others	679	" My sweetest Catherine , is not this delightful ? We shall have a most heavenly drive . You are to thank your brother and me for the scheme ; it darted into our heads at breakfast - time , I verily believe at the same instant ; and we should have been off two hours ago if it had not been for this detestable rain . But it does not signify , the nights are moonlight , and we shall do delightfully . Oh ! I am in such ecstasies at the thoughts of a little country air and quiet ! So much better than going to the Lower Rooms . We shall drive directly to Clifton and dine there ; and , as soon as dinner is over , if there is time for it , go on to Kingsweston . "
27888	27899	27901	27901	Morland	77	" I doubt our being able to do so much , "
27903	27908	27910	27910	Thorpe	122	" You croaking fellow ! "
27912	27951	27910	27910	Thorpe	122	" We shall be able to do ten times more . Kingsweston ! Aye , and Blaize Castle too , and anything else we can hear of ; but here is your sister says she will not go . "
27952	27956	27958	27958	Catherine	77	" Blaize Castle ! "
27960	27965	27958	27958	Catherine	77	" What is that ? "
27966	27982	27733	27735	the two others	679	" The finest place in England worth going fifty miles at any time to see . "
27983	27996	27958	27958	Catherine	77	" What , is it really a castle , an old castle ? "
27997	28004	27733	27735	the two others	679	" The oldest in the kingdom . "
28005	28015	27958	27958	Catherine	77	" But is it like what one reads of ? "
28016	28022	27733	27735	the two others	679	" Exactly the very same . "
28023	28034	27958	27958	Catherine	77	" But now really are there towers and long galleries ? "
28035	28039	27733	27735	the two others	679	" By dozens . "
28040	28058	27958	27958	Catherine	77	" Then I should like to see it ; but I can not I can not go . "
28059	28072	27733	27735	the two others	679	" Not go ! My beloved creature , what do you mean ? "
28073	28080	28084	28084	she	77	" I can not go , because "
28092	28139	28084	28084	she	77	" I expect Miss Tilney and her brother to call on me to take a country walk . They promised to come at twelve , only it rained ; but now , as it is so fine , I dare say they will be here soon . "
28140	28145	28147	28147	Thorpe	106	" Not they indeed , "
28149	28172	28147	28147	Thorpe	106	" for , as we turned into Broad Street , I saw them does he not drive a phaeton with bright chestnuts ? "
28173	28180	28084	28084	she	77	" I do not know indeed . "
28181	28209	28147	28147	Thorpe	106	" Yes , I know he does ; I saw him . You are talking of the man you danced with last night , are not you ? "
28210	28213	28084	28084	she	77	" Yes . "
28214	28236	28147	28147	Thorpe	106	" Well , I saw him at that moment turn up the Lansdown Road , driving a smart - looking girl . "
28237	28242	28084	28084	she	77	" Did you indeed ? "
28243	28266	28147	28147	Thorpe	106	" Did upon my soul ; knew him again directly , and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too . "
28267	28287	28084	28084	she	77	" It is very odd ! But I suppose they thought it would be too dirty for a walk . "
28288	28334	28147	28147	Thorpe	106	" And well they might , for I never saw so much dirt in my life . Walk ! You could no more walk than you could fly ! It has not been so dirty the whole winter ; it is ankle - deep everywhere . "
28339	28367	28335	28335	Isabella	106	" My dearest Catherine , you can not form an idea of the dirt ; come , you must go ; you can not refuse going now . "
28368	28399	28532	28532	she	91	" I should like to see the castle ; but may we go all over it ? May we go up every staircase , and into every suite of rooms ? "
28400	28410	28335	28335	Isabella	106	" Yes , yes , every hole and corner . "
28411	28436	28532	28532	she	91	" But then , if they should only be gone out for an hour till it is dryer , and call by and by ? "
28437	28475	28335	28335	Isabella	106	" Make yourself easy , there is no danger of that , for I heard Tilney hallooing to a man who was just passing by on horseback , that they were going as far as Wick Rocks . "
28476	28488	28532	28532	she	91	" Then I will . Shall I go , Mrs. Allen ? "
28489	28498	28335	28335	Isabella	106	" Just as you please , my dear . "
28499	28510	28532	28532	she	91	" Mrs. Allen , you must persuade her to go , "
28524	28530	28532	28532	she	91	" Well , my dear , "
28534	28539	28532	28532	she	91	" suppose you go . "
28800	28816	28790	28790	she	77	" Who is that girl who looked at you so hard as she went by ? "
28817	28822	28783	28783	they	800	" Who ? Where ? "
28823	28839	28840	28840	Catherine	77	" On the right - hand pavement she must be almost out of sight now . "
28869	28877	28878	28878	she	77	" Stop , stop , Mr. Thorpe , "
28882	28916	28878	28878	she	77	" it is Miss Tilney ; it is indeed . How could you tell me they were gone ? Stop , stop , I will get out this moment and go to them . "
28991	29020	28985	28985	she	77	" Pray , pray stop , Mr. Thorpe . I can not go on . I will not go on . I must go back to Miss Tilney . "
29079	29194	29197	29197	himself	122	" How could you deceive me so , Mr. Thorpe ? How could you say that you saw them driving up the Lansdown Road ? I would not have had it happen so for the world . They must think it so strange , so rude of me ! To go by them , too , without saying a word ! You do not know how vexed I am ; I shall have no pleasure at Clifton , nor in anything else . I had rather , ten thousand times rather , get out now , and walk back to them . How could you say you saw them driving out in a phaeton ? "
29462	29549	29459	29459	Morland	77	" We had better go back , Thorpe ; it is too late to go on today ; your sister thinks so as well as I. We have been exactly an hour coming from Pulteney Street , very little more than seven miles ; and , I suppose , we have at least eight more to go . It will never do . We set out a great deal too late . We had much better put it off till another day , and turn round . "
29550	29558	29560	29560	Thorpe	122	" It is all one to me , "
29579	29593	29595	29595	he	122	" If your brother had not got such a d beast to drive , "
29599	29660	29595	29595	he	122	" we might have done it very well . My horse would have trotted to Clifton within the hour , if left to himself , and I have almost broke my arm with pulling him in to that cursed broken - winded jade s pace . Morland is a fool for not keeping a horse and gig of his own . "
29661	29668	29670	29670	Catherine	77	" No , he is not , "
29673	29684	29670	29670	Catherine	77	" for I am sure he could not afford it . "
29685	29694	29752	29756	people who rolled in money	817	" And why can not he afford it ? "
29695	29703	29670	29670	Catherine	77	" Because he has not money enough . "
29704	29711	29752	29756	people who rolled in money	817	" And whose fault is that ? "
29712	29721	29670	29670	Catherine	77	" Nobody s , that I know of . "
29940	29967	29924	29925	Mr. Allen	89	" I am glad your brother had so much sense ; I am glad you are come back . It was a strange , wild scheme . "
30043	30198	30025	30025	Her	106	" How I pity the poor creatures that are going there ! How glad I am that I am not amongst them ! I wonder whether it will be a full ball or not ! They have not begun dancing yet . I would not be there for all the world . It is so delightful to have an evening now and then to oneself . I dare say it will not be a very good ball . I know the Mitchells will not be there . I am sure I pity everybody that is . But I dare say , Mr. Morland , you long to be at it , do not you ? I am sure you do . Well , pray do not let anybody here be a restraint on you . I dare say we could do very well without you ; but you men think yourselves of such consequence . "
30238	30249	30250	30250	she	77	" Do not be so dull , my dearest creature , "
30253	30377	30250	30250	she	77	" You will quite break my heart . It was amazingly shocking , to be sure ; but the Tilneys were entirely to blame . Why were not they more punctual ? It was dirty , indeed , but what did that signify ? I am sure John and I should not have minded it . I never mind going through anything , where a friend is concerned ; that is my disposition , and John is just the same ; he has amazing strong feelings . Good heavens ! What a delightful hand you have got ! Kings , I vow ! I never was so happy in my life ! I would fifty times rather you should have them than myself . "
30435	30439	30441	30441	Catherine	77	" Mrs. Allen , "
30446	30471	30441	30441	Catherine	77	" will there be any harm in my calling on Miss Tilney today ? I shall not be easy till I have explained everything . "
30472	30495	30417	30417	she	762	" Go , by all means , my dear ; only put on a white gown ; Miss Tilney always wears white . "
31082	31086	31106	31107	no one	366	" quite horrid . "
31488	31578	31482	31482	he	98	" Oh ! Mr. Tilney , I have been quite wild to speak to you , and make my apologies . You must have thought me so rude ; but indeed it was not my own fault , was it , Mrs. Allen ? Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his sister were gone out in a phaeton together ? And then what could I do ? But I had ten thousand times rather have been with you ; now had not I , Mrs. Allen ? "
31579	31588	31590	31591	Mrs. Allen	91	" My dear , you tumble my gown , "
31638	31673	31625	31625	he	869	" We were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk after our passing you in Argyle Street : you were so kind as to look back on purpose . "
31674	31756	31625	31625	he	869	" But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk ; I never thought of such a thing ; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop ; I called out to him as soon as ever I saw you ; now , Mrs. Allen , did not Oh ! You were not there ; but indeed I did ; and , if Mr. Thorpe would only have stopped , I would have jumped out and run after you . "
31808	31820	31822	31822	Catherine	77	" Oh ! Do not say Miss Tilney was not angry , "
31824	31879	31822	31822	Catherine	77	" because I know she was ; for she would not see me this morning when I called ; I saw her walk out of the house the next minute after my leaving it ; I was hurt , but I was not affronted . Perhaps you did not know I had been there . "
31880	31990	31786	31786	he	98	" I was not within at the time ; but I heard of it from Eleanor , and she has been wishing ever since to see you , to explain the reason of such incivility ; but perhaps I can do it as well . It was nothing more than that my father they were just preparing to walk out , and he being hurried for time , and not caring to have it put off made a point of her being denied . That was all , I do assure you . She was very much vexed , and meant to make her apology as soon as possible . "
32027	32076	31786	31786	he	98	" But , Mr. Tilney , why were _ you _ less generous than your sister ? If she felt such confidence in my good intentions , and could suppose it to be only a mistake , why should _ you _ be so ready to take offence ? "
32077	32084	31991	31991	Catherine	77	" Me ! I take offence ! "
32085	32106	31786	31786	he	98	" Nay , I am sure by your look , when you came into the box , you were angry . "
32107	32117	31991	31991	Catherine	77	" I angry ! I could have no right . "
32118	32134	31786	31786	he	98	" Well , nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face . "
32328	32338	32345	32345	she	77	" How came Mr. Thorpe to know your father ? "
32446	32493	32437	32437	she	77	" He is a fine old fellow , upon my soul ! Stout , active looks as young as his son . I have a great regard for him , I assure you : a gentleman - like , good sort of fellow as ever lived . "
32494	32503	32410	32410	he	122	" But how came you to know him ? "
32504	32688	32437	32437	she	77	" Know him ! There are few people much about town that I do not know . I have met him forever at the Bedford ; and I knew his face again today the moment he came into the billiard - room . One of the best players we have , by the by ; and we had a little touch together , though I was almost afraid of him at first : the odds were five to four against me ; and , if I had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever was made in this world I took his ball exactly but I could not make you understand it without a table ; however , I _ did _ beat him . A very fine fellow ; as rich as a Jew . I should like to dine with him ; I dare say he gives famous dinners . But what do you think we have been talking of ? You . Yes , by heavens ! And the general thinks you the finest girl in Bath . "
32689	32700	32712	32712	his	885	" Oh ! Nonsense ! How can you say so ? "
32701	32710	32712	32712	his	885	" And what do you think I said ? "
32714	32730	32712	32712	his	885	" well done , general , said I ; I am quite of your mind . "
33209	33229	33201	33201	Catherine	77	" Do not urge me , Isabella . I am engaged to Miss Tilney . I can not go . "
33258	33291	33245	33245	she	77	" It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that you had just been reminded of a prior engagement , and must only beg to put off the walk till Tuesday . "
33292	33314	33358	33364	a friend who loved her so dearly	891	" No , it would not be easy . I could not do it . There has been no prior engagement . "
33474	33571	33472	33472	herself	106	" I can not help being jealous , Catherine , when I see myself slighted for strangers , I , who love you so excessively ! When once my affections are placed , it is not in the power of anything to change them . But I believe my feelings are stronger than anybody s ; I am sure they are too strong for my own peace ; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers does cut me to the quick , I own . These Tilneys seem to swallow up everything else . "
33655	33695	33642	33642	Morland	77	" Nay , Catherine . I think you can not stand out any longer now . The sacrifice is not much ; and to oblige such a friend I shall think you quite unkind , if you still refuse . "
33760	33767	33717	33717	she	106	" No , no , no ! "
33773	33794	33795	33795	Catherine	77	" that could not be , for Thorpe did not know that he might not go to town on Tuesday . "
33826	33874	33815	33815	Isabella	106	" Very well , then there is an end of the party . If Catherine does not go , I can not . I can not be the only woman . I would not , upon any account in the world , do so improper a thing . "
33875	33882	33884	33884	James	108	" Catherine , you must go , "
33886	33911	33815	33815	Isabella	106	" But why can not Mr. Thorpe drive one of his other sisters ? I dare say either of them would like to go . "
33912	33916	33918	33918	Thorpe	122	" Thank ye , "
33920	33964	33918	33918	Thorpe	122	" but I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters about , and look like a fool . No , if you do not go , d me if I do . I only go for the sake of driving you . "
33965	33976	33978	33978	her	898	" That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure . "
34060	34073	34075	34075	James	108	" I did not think you had been so obstinate , Catherine , "
34077	34102	34075	34075	James	108	" you were not used to be so hard to persuade ; you once were the kindest , best - tempered of my sisters . "
34103	34113	34114	34114	she	77	" I hope I am not less so now , "
34120	34143	34114	34114	she	77	" but indeed I can not go . If I am wrong , I am doing what I believe to be right . "
34144	34148	34150	34150	Isabella	106	" I suspect , "
34157	34164	34150	34150	Isabella	106	" there is no great struggle . "
34209	34242	34195	34195	Thorpe	106	" Well , I have settled the matter , and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe conscience . I have been to Miss Tilney , and made your excuses . "
34243	34248	34250	34250	Catherine	77	" You have not ! "
34252	34333	34195	34195	Thorpe	106	" I have , upon my soul . Left her this moment . Told her you had sent me to say that , having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us tomorrow , you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till Tuesday . She said very well , Tuesday was just as convenient to her ; so there is an end of all our difficulties . A pretty good thought of mine hey ? "
34353	34386	34334	34334	Isabella	106	" A most heavenly thought indeed ! Now , my sweet Catherine , all our distresses are over ; you are honourably acquitted , and we shall have a most delightful party . "
34387	34393	34395	34395	Catherine	77	" This will not do , "
34397	34417	34395	34395	Catherine	77	" I can not submit to this . I must run after Miss Tilney directly and set her right . "
34479	34570	34455	34455	herself	95	" I do not care . Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message . If I had thought it right to put it off , I could have spoken to Miss Tilney myself . This is only doing it in a ruder way ; and how do I know that Mr. Thorpe has He may be mistaken again perhaps ; he led me into one act of rudeness by his mistake on Friday . Let me go , Mr. Thorpe ; Isabella , do not hold me . "
34608	34616	34618	34618	Catherine	77	" Then I will go after them , "
34620	34657	34662	34662	she	95	" wherever they are I will go after them . It does not signify talking . If I could not be persuaded into doing what I thought wrong , I never will be tricked into it . "
34681	34695	34677	34677	Morland	77	" Let her go , let her go , if she will go . "
34696	34702	34662	34662	she	95	" She is as obstinate as "
35070	35128	35045	35045	Her	95	" I am come in a great hurry It was all a mistake I never promised to go I told them from the first I could not go . I ran away in a great hurry to explain it . I did not care what you thought of me . I would not stay for the servant . "
35330	35349	35309	35309	he	783	" What did William mean by it ? He should make a point of inquiring into the matter . "
35512	35537	35538	35539	The general	783	" Oh , no ; Catherine was sure they would not have the least objection , and she should have great pleasure in coming . "
35780	35783	35785	35785	he	89	" Well , "
35787	35796	35785	35785	he	89	" and do you think of going too ? "
35797	35831	35749	35749	she	77	" No ; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they told me of it ; and therefore you know I could not go with them , could I ? "
35832	35943	35785	35785	he	89	" No , certainly not ; and I am glad you do not think of it . These schemes are not at all the thing . Young men and women driving about the country in open carriages ! Now and then it is very well ; but going to inns and public places together ! It is not right ; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe should allow it . I am glad you do not think of going ; I am sure Mrs. Morland would not be pleased . Mrs. Allen , are not you of my way of thinking ? Do not you think these kind of projects objectionable ? "
35944	35998	35749	35749	she	77	" Yes , very much so indeed . Open carriages are nasty things . A clean gown is not five minutes wear in them . You are splashed getting in and getting out ; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every direction . I hate an open carriage myself . "
35999	36043	35785	35785	he	89	" I know you do ; but that is not the question . Do not you think it has an odd appearance , if young ladies are frequently driven about in them by young men , to whom they are not even related ? "
36044	36064	35749	35749	she	77	" Yes , my dear , a very odd appearance indeed . I can not bear to see it . "
36065	36069	36071	36071	Catherine	77	" Dear madam , "
36073	36124	36071	36071	Catherine	77	" then why did not you tell me so before ? I am sure if I had known it to be improper , I would not have gone with Mr. Thorpe at all ; but I always hoped you would tell me , if you thought I was doing wrong . "
36125	36217	35749	35749	she	77	" And so I should , my dear , you may depend on it ; for as I told Mrs. Morland at parting , I would always do the best for you in my power . But one must not be over particular . Young people _ will _ be young people , as your good mother says herself . You know I wanted you , when we first came , not to buy that sprigged muslin , but you would . Young people do not like to be always thwarted . "
36218	36241	36071	36071	Catherine	77	" But this was something of real consequence ; and I do not think you would have found me hard to persuade . "
36242	36257	36259	36260	Mr. Allen	89	" As far as it has gone hitherto , there is no harm done , "
36262	36283	36259	36260	Mr. Allen	89	" and I would only advise you , my dear , not to go out with Mr. Thorpe any more . "
36284	36295	36297	36298	his wife	345	" That is just what I was going to say , "
36388	36457	36375	36376	Mr. Allen	89	" You had better leave her alone , my dear ; she is old enough to know what she is about , and if not , has a mother to advise her . Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt ; but , however , you had better not interfere . She and your brother choose to go , and you will be only getting ill will . "
36716	36723	36725	36725	Catherine	77	" I never look at it , "
36737	36746	36725	36725	Catherine	77	" without thinking of the south of France . "
36747	36754	36756	36756	Henry	98	" You have been abroad then ? "
36762	36809	36725	36725	Catherine	77	" Oh ! No , I only mean what I have read about . It always puts me in mind of the country that Emily and her father travelled through , in The Mysteries of Udolpho . But you never read novels , I dare say ? "
36810	36814	36725	36725	Catherine	77	" Why not ? "
36815	36829	36725	36725	Catherine	77	" Because they are not clever enough for you gentlemen read better books . "
36830	36906	36725	36725	Catherine	77	" The person , be it gentleman or lady , who has not pleasure in a good novel , must be intolerably stupid . I have read all Mrs. Radcliffe s works , and most of them with great pleasure . The Mysteries of Udolpho , when I had once begun it , I could not lay down again ; I remember finishing it in two days my hair standing on end the whole time . "
36907	36910	36912	36913	Miss Tilney	95	" Yes , "
36915	36972	36912	36913	Miss Tilney	95	" and I remember that you undertook to read it aloud to me , and that when I was called away for only five minutes to answer a note , instead of waiting for me , you took the volume into the Hermitage Walk , and I was obliged to stay till you had finished it . "
36973	37081	36725	36725	Catherine	77	" Thank you , Eleanor a most honourable testimony . You see , Miss Morland , the injustice of your suspicions . Here was I , in my eagerness to get on , refusing to wait only five minutes for my sister , breaking the promise I had made of reading it aloud , and keeping her in suspense at a most interesting part , by running away with the volume , which , you are to observe , was her own , particularly her own . I am proud when I reflect on it , and I think it must establish me in your good opinion . "
37082	37116	36912	36913	Miss Tilney	95	" I am very glad to hear it indeed , and now I shall never be ashamed of liking Udolpho myself . But I really thought before , young men despised novels amazingly . "
37117	37268	36725	36725	Catherine	77	" It is _ amazingly ; _ it may well suggest _ amazement _ if they do for they read nearly as many as women . I myself have read hundreds and hundreds . Do not imagine that you can cope with me in a knowledge of Julias and Louisas . If we proceed to particulars , and engage in the never - ceasing inquiry of Have you read this ? and Have you read that ? I shall soon leave you as far behind me as what shall I say ? I want an appropriate simile . as far as your friend Emily herself left poor Valancourt when she went with her aunt into Italy . Consider how many years I have had the start of you . I had entered on my studies at Oxford , while you were a good little girl working your sampler at home ! "
37269	37294	36912	36913	Miss Tilney	95	" Not very good , I am afraid . But now really , do not you think Udolpho the nicest book in the world ? "
37295	37314	36725	36725	Catherine	77	" The nicest by which I suppose you mean the neatest . That must depend upon the binding . "
37315	37318	37320	37321	Miss Tilney	95	" Henry , "
37323	37410	37320	37321	Miss Tilney	95	" you are very impertinent . Miss Morland , he is treating you exactly as he does his sister . He is forever finding fault with me , for some incorrectness of language , and now he is taking the same liberty with you . The word nicest , as you used it , did not suit him ; and you had better change it as soon as you can , or we shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way . "
37411	37416	37418	37418	Catherine	77	" I am sure , "
37420	37448	37418	37418	Catherine	77	" I did not mean to say anything wrong ; but it _ is _ a nice book , and why should not I call it so ? "
37449	37453	37455	37455	Henry	98	" Very true , "
37457	37544	37455	37455	Henry	98	" and this is a very nice day , and we are taking a very nice walk , and you are two very nice young ladies . Oh ! It is a very nice word indeed ! It does for everything . Originally perhaps it was applied only to express neatness , propriety , delicacy , or refinement people were nice in their dress , in their sentiments , or their choice . But now every commendation on every subject is comprised in that one word . "
37545	37551	37553	37554	his sister	2222	" While , in fact , "
37556	37627	37553	37554	his sister	2222	" it ought only to be applied to you , without any commendation at all . You are more nice than wise . Come , Miss Morland , let us leave him to meditate over our faults in the utmost propriety of diction , while we praise Udolpho in whatever terms we like best . It is a most interesting work . You are fond of that kind of reading ? "
37628	37642	37418	37418	Catherine	77	" To say the truth , I do not much like any other . "
37643	37646	37553	37554	his sister	2222	" Indeed ! "
37647	37687	37418	37418	Catherine	77	" That is , I can read poetry and plays , and things of that sort , and do not dislike travels . But history , real solemn history , I can not be interested in . Can you ? "
37688	37697	37553	37554	his sister	2222	" Yes , I am fond of history . "
37698	37820	37418	37418	Catherine	77	" I wish I were too . I read it a little as a duty , but it tells me nothing that does not either vex or weary me . The quarrels of popes and kings , with wars or pestilences , in every page ; the men all so good for nothing , and hardly any women at all it is very tiresome : and yet I often think it odd that it should be so dull , for a great deal of it must be invention . The speeches that are put into the heroes mouths , their thoughts and designs the chief of all this must be invention , and invention is what delights me in other books . "
37821	37827	37829	37830	Miss Tilney	95	" Historians , you think , "
37832	37978	37829	37830	Miss Tilney	95	" are not happy in their flights of fancy . They display imagination without raising interest . I am fond of history and am very well contented to take the false with the true . In the principal facts they have sources of intelligence in former histories and records , which may be as much depended on , I conclude , as anything that does not actually pass under one s own observation ; and as for the little embellishments you speak of , they are embellishments , and I like them as such . If a speech be well drawn up , I read it with pleasure , by whomsoever it may be made and probably with much greater , if the production of Mr. Hume or Mr. Robertson , than if the genuine words of Caractacus , Agricola , or Alfred the Great . "
37979	38126	37418	37418	Catherine	77	" You are fond of history ! And so are Mr. Allen and my father ; and I have two brothers who do not dislike it . So many instances within my small circle of friends is remarkable ! At this rate , I shall not pity the writers of history any longer . If people like to read their books , it is all very well , but to be at so much trouble in filling great volumes , which , as I used to think , nobody would willingly ever look into , to be labouring only for the torment of little boys and girls , always struck me as a hard fate ; and though I know it is all very right and necessary , I have often wondered at the person s courage that could sit down on purpose to do it . "
38127	38137	38139	38139	Henry	98	" That little boys and girls should be tormented , "
38141	38243	38139	38139	Henry	98	" is what no one at all acquainted with human nature in a civilized state can deny ; but in behalf of our most distinguished historians , I must observe that they might well be offended at being supposed to have no higher aim , and that by their method and style , they are perfectly well qualified to torment readers of the most advanced reason and mature time of life . I use the verb to torment , as I observed to be your own method , instead of to instruct , supposing them to be now admitted as synonymous . "
38244	38347	37418	37418	Catherine	77	" You think me foolish to call instruction a torment , but if you had been as much used as myself to hear poor little children first learning their letters and then learning to spell , if you had ever seen how stupid they can be for a whole morning together , and how tired my poor mother is at the end of it , as I am in the habit of seeing almost every day of my life at home , you would allow that to _ torment _ and to _ instruct _ might sometimes be used as synonymous words . "
38348	38450	38139	38139	Henry	98	" Very probably . But historians are not accountable for the difficulty of learning to read ; and even you yourself , who do not altogether seem particularly friendly to very severe , very intense application , may perhaps be brought to acknowledge that it is very well worth - while to be tormented for two or three years of one s life , for the sake of being able to read all the rest of it . Consider if reading had not been taught , Mrs. Radcliffe would have written in vain or perhaps might not have written at all . "
39085	39101	39069	39069	Catherine	77	" I have heard that something very shocking indeed will soon come out in London . "
39119	39127	39102	39103	Miss Tilney	95	" Indeed ! And of what nature ? "
39128	39160	39069	39069	Catherine	77	" That I do not know , nor who is the author . I have only heard that it is to be more horrible than anything we have met with yet . "
39161	39174	39102	39103	Miss Tilney	95	" Good heaven ! Where could you hear of such a thing ? "
39175	39210	39069	39069	Catherine	77	" A particular friend of mine had an account of it in a letter from London yesterday . It is to be uncommonly dreadful . I shall expect murder and everything of the kind . "
39211	39253	39102	39103	Miss Tilney	95	" You speak with astonishing composure ! But I hope your friend s accounts have been exaggerated ; and if such a design is known beforehand , proper measures will undoubtedly be taken by government to prevent its coming to effect . "
39254	39257	39259	39259	Henry	98	" Government , "
39266	39289	39259	39259	Henry	98	" neither desires nor dares to interfere in such matters . There must be murder ; and government cares not how much . "
39300	39405	39294	39294	He	98	" Come , shall I make you understand each other , or leave you to puzzle out an explanation as you can ? No I will be noble . I will prove myself a man , no less by the generosity of my soul than the clearness of my head . I have no patience with such of my sex as disdain to let themselves sometimes down to the comprehension of yours . Perhaps the abilities of women are neither sound nor acute neither vigorous nor keen . Perhaps they may want observation , discernment , judgment , fire , genius , and wit . "
39406	39430	39259	39259	Henry	98	" Miss Morland , do not mind what he says ; but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot . "
39431	39437	39294	39294	He	98	" Riot ! What riot ? "
39438	39674	39259	39259	Henry	98	" My dear Eleanor , the riot is only in your own brain . The confusion there is scandalous . Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out , in three duodecimo volumes , two hundred and seventy - six pages in each , with a frontispiece to the first , of two tombstones and a lantern do you understand ? And you , Miss Morland my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions . You talked of expected horrors in London and instead of instantly conceiving , as any rational creature would have done , that such words could relate only to a circulating library , she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George s Fields , the Bank attacked , the Tower threatened , the streets of London flowing with blood , a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons ( the hopes of the nation ) called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents , and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney , in the moment of charging at the head of his troop , knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window . Forgive her stupidity . The fears of the sister have added to the weakness of the woman ; but she is by no means a simpleton in general . "
39679	39685	39687	39688	Miss Tilney	95	" And now , Henry , "
39690	39745	39687	39688	Miss Tilney	95	" that you have made us understand each other , you may as well make Miss Morland understand yourself unless you mean to have her think you intolerably rude to your sister , and a great brute in your opinion of women in general . Miss Morland is not used to your odd ways . "
39746	39760	39259	39259	Henry	98	" I shall be most happy to make her better acquainted with them . "
39761	39774	39687	39688	Miss Tilney	95	" No doubt ; but that is no explanation of the present . "
39775	39782	39259	39259	Henry	98	" What am I to do ? "
39783	39812	39687	39688	Miss Tilney	95	" You know what you ought to do . Clear your character handsomely before her . Tell her that you think very highly of the understanding of women . "
39813	39847	39259	39259	Henry	98	" Miss Morland , I think very highly of the understanding of all the women in the world especially of those whoever they may be with whom I happen to be in company . "
39848	39858	39687	39688	Miss Tilney	95	" That is not enough . Be more serious . "
39859	39900	39259	39259	Henry	98	" Miss Morland , no one can think more highly of the understanding of women than I do . In my opinion , nature has given them so much that they never find it necessary to use more than half . "
39901	39958	39687	39688	Miss Tilney	95	" We shall get nothing more serious from him now , Miss Morland . He is not in a sober mood . But I do assure you that he must be entirely misunderstood , if he can ever appear to say an unjust thing of any woman at all , or an unkind one of me . "
40263	40272	40274	40275	Miss Anne	157	" They set off at eight this morning , "
40277	40341	40274	40275	Miss Anne	157	" and I am sure I do not envy them their drive . I think you and I are very well off to be out of the scrape . It must be the dullest thing in the world , for there is not a soul at Clifton at this time of year . Belle went with your brother , and John drove Maria . "
40357	40362	40364	40365	the other	413	" Oh ! yes , "
40367	40420	40364	40365	the other	413	" Maria is gone . She was quite wild to go . She thought it would be something very fine . I can not say I admire her taste ; and for my part , I was determined from the first not to go , if they pressed me ever so much . "
40434	40453	40421	40421	Catherine	77	" I wish you could have gone too . It is a pity you could not all go . "
40454	40493	40517	40517	she	77	" Thank you ; but it is quite a matter of indifference to me . Indeed , I would not have gone on any account . I was saying so to Emily and Sophia when you overtook us . "
40901	40982	40889	40889	she	158	" She will never forgive me , I am sure ; but , you know , how could I help it ? John would have me go , for he vowed he would not drive her , because she had such thick ankles . I dare say she will not be in good humour again this month ; but I am determined I will not be cross ; it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper . "
41026	41058	41018	41018	Isabella	106	" Yes , my dear Catherine , it is so indeed ; your penetration has not deceived you . Oh ! That arch eye of yours ! It sees through everything . "
41069	41078	41080	41081	the other	413	" Nay , my beloved , sweetest friend , "
41083	41186	41080	41081	the other	413	" compose yourself . I am amazingly agitated , as you perceive . Let us sit down and talk in comfort . Well , and so you guessed it the moment you had my note ? Sly creature ! Oh ! My dear Catherine , you alone , who know my heart , can judge of my present happiness . Your brother is the most charming of men . I only wish I were more worthy of him . But what will your excellent father and mother say ? Oh ! Heavens ! When I think of them I am so agitated ! "
41221	41245	41217	41217	she	77	" Good heaven ! My dear Isabella , what do you mean ? Can you can you really be in love with James ? "
41444	41484	41436	41436	Isabella	106	" You will be so infinitely dearer to me , my Catherine , than either Anne or Maria : I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland s family than to my own . "
41494	41503	41505	41505	Isabella	106	" You are so like your dear brother , "
41507	41600	41505	41505	Isabella	106	" that I quite doted on you the first moment I saw you . But so it always is with me ; the first moment settles everything . The very first day that Morland came to us last Christmas the very first moment I beheld him my heart was irrecoverably gone . I remember I wore my yellow gown , with my hair done up in braids ; and when I came into the drawing - room , and John introduced him , I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before . "
41636	41779	41505	41505	Isabella	106	" I remember too , Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening , and wore her puce - coloured sarsenet ; and she looked so heavenly that I thought your brother must certainly fall in love with her ; I could not sleep a wink all night for thinking of it . Oh ! Catherine , the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother s account ! I would not have you suffer half what I have done ! I am grown wretchedly thin , I know ; but I will not pain you by describing my anxiety ; you have seen enough of it . I feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually so unguarded in speaking of my partiality for the church ! But my secret I was always sure would be safe with _ you _ . "
41891	41896	41898	41898	she	77	" It is impossible , "
41900	41926	41898	41898	she	77	" for parents to be more kind , or more desirous of their children s happiness ; I have no doubt of their consenting immediately . "
41927	41934	41936	41936	Isabella	106	" Morland says exactly the same , "
41938	41969	41936	41936	Isabella	106	" and yet I dare not expect it ; my fortune will be so small ; they never can consent to it . Your brother , who might marry anybody ! "
41979	41999	42088	42093	all the heroines of her acquaintance	1019	" Indeed , Isabella , you are too humble . The difference of fortune can be nothing to signify . "
42000	42068	42088	42093	all the heroines of her acquaintance	1019	" Oh ! My sweet Catherine , in _ your _ generous heart I know it would signify nothing ; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many . As for myself , I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed . Had I the command of millions , were I mistress of the whole world , your brother would be my only choice . "
42111	42119	42121	42121	her	77	" I am sure they will consent , "
42125	42136	42121	42121	her	77	" I am sure they will be delighted with you . "
42137	42143	42145	42145	Isabella	106	" For my own part , "
42147	42209	42145	42145	Isabella	106	" my wishes are so moderate that the smallest income in nature would be enough for me . Where people are really attached , poverty itself is wealth ; grandeur I detest : I would not settle in London for the universe . A cottage in some retired village would be ecstasy . There are some charming little villas about Richmond . "
42210	42213	42215	42215	Catherine	77	" Richmond ! "
42217	42230	42215	42215	Catherine	77	" You must settle near Fullerton . You must be near us . "
42231	42324	42371	42371	he	1022	" I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not . If I can but be near _ you _ , I shall be satisfied . But this is idle talking ! I will not allow myself to think of such things , till we have your father s answer . Morland says that by sending it tonight to Salisbury , we may have it tomorrow . Tomorrow ? I know I shall never have courage to open the letter . I know it will be the death of me . "
42483	42532	42469	42469	he	108	" Indeed , Morland , I must drive you away . Consider how far you have to ride . I can not bear to see you linger so . For heaven s sake , waste no more time . There , go , go I insist on it . "
42687	42691	42737	42738	her friend	313	" I know what "
42812	42843	42889	42889	herself	106	" I have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind parents , and am promised that everything in their power shall be done to forward my happiness , "
42936	42939	42966	42969	two " dears "	2819	" dear John "
42941	42944	42966	42969	two " dears "	2819	" dear Catherine "
42949	42955	42960	42960	sharers	1035	" dear Anne and dear Maria "
42967	42969	42966	42969	two " dears "	2819	" dears "
43237	43243	43245	43245	he	103	" Well , Miss Morland , "
43255	43266	43267	43267	Catherine	77	" I am come to bid you good - bye . "
43300	43309	43311	43311	Catherine	77	" Shall not you be late at Devizes ? "
43328	43370	43313	43313	He	103	" A famous good thing this marrying scheme , upon my soul ! A clever fancy of Morland s and Belle s. What do you think of it , Miss Morland ? _ I _ say it is no bad notion . "
43371	43383	43278	43278	her	77	" I am sure I think it a very good one . "
43384	43436	43313	43313	He	103	" Do you ? That s honest , by heavens ! I am glad you are no enemy to matrimony , however . Did you ever hear the old song Going to One Wedding Brings on Another ? I say , you will come to Belle s wedding , I hope . "
43437	43453	43278	43278	her	77	" Yes ; I have promised your sister to be with her , if possible . "
43454	43459	43313	43313	He	103	" And then you know "
43468	43487	43313	43313	He	103	" I say , then you know , we may try the truth of this same old song . "
43488	43520	43313	43313	He	103	" May we ? But I never sing . Well , I wish you a good journey . I dine with Miss Tilney today , and must now be going home . "
43521	43567	43313	43313	He	103	" Nay , but there is no such confounded hurry . Who knows when we may be together again ? Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a fortnight , and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me . "
43568	43578	43580	43580	Catherine	77	" Then why do you stay away so long ? "
43589	43672	43313	43313	He	103	" That is kind of you , however kind and good - natured . I shall not forget it in a hurry . But you have more good nature and all that , than anybody living , I believe . A monstrous deal of good nature , and it is not only good nature , but you have so much , so much of everything ; and then you have such upon my soul , I do not know anybody like you . "
43673	43702	43313	43313	He	103	" Oh ! dear , there are a great many people like me , I dare say , only a great deal better . Good morning to you . "
43703	43729	43313	43313	He	103	" But I say , Miss Morland , I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton before it is long , if not disagreeable . "
43730	43746	43313	43313	He	103	" Pray do . My father and mother will be very glad to see you . "
43747	43768	43313	43313	He	103	" And I hope I hope , Miss Morland , _ you _ will not be sorry to see me . "
43769	43794	43313	43313	He	103	" Oh ! dear , not at all . There are very few people I am sorry to see . Company is always cheerful . "
43795	43878	43313	43313	He	103	" That is just my way of thinking . Give me but a little cheerful company , let me only have the company of the people I love , let me only be where I like and with whom I like , and the devil take the rest , say I. And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same . But I have a notion , Miss Morland , you and I think pretty much alike upon most matters . "
43879	43919	43313	43313	He	103	" Perhaps we may ; but it is more than I ever thought of . And as to _ most matters _ , to say the truth , there are not many that I know my own mind about . "
43920	44011	43313	43313	He	103	" By Jove , no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with what does not concern me . My notion of things is simple enough . Let me only have the girl I like , say I , with a comfortable house over my head , and what care I for all the rest ? Fortune is nothing . I am sure of a good income of my own ; and if she had not a penny , why , so much the better . "
44012	44100	43313	43313	He	103	" Very true . I think like you there . If there is a good fortune on one side , there can be no occasion for any on the other . No matter which has it , so that there is enough . I hate the idea of one great fortune looking out for another . And to marry for money I think the wickedest thing in existence . Good day . We shall be very glad to see you at Fullerton , whenever it is convenient . "
44687	44763	44672	44672	Isabella	106	" It was all pride , pride , insufferable haughtiness and pride ! She had long suspected the family to be very high , and this made it certain . Such insolence of behaviour as Miss Tilney s she had never heard of in her life ! Not to do the honours of her house with common good breeding ! To behave to her guest with such superciliousness ! Hardly even to speak to her ! "
44764	44786	45187	45187	Isabella	106	" But it was not so bad as that , Isabella ; there was no superciliousness ; she was very civil . "
44787	44834	44672	44672	Isabella	106	" Oh ! Don t defend her ! And then the brother , he , who had appeared so attached to you ! Good heavens ! Well , some people s feelings are incomprehensible . And so he hardly looked once at you the whole day ? "
44835	44851	45187	45187	Isabella	106	" I do not say so ; but he did not seem in good spirits . "
44852	44889	44672	44672	Isabella	106	" How contemptible ! Of all things in the world inconstancy is my aversion . Let me entreat you never to think of him again , my dear Catherine ; indeed he is unworthy of you . "
44890	44903	45187	45187	Isabella	106	" Unworthy ! I do not suppose he ever thinks of me . "
44904	44942	44672	44672	Isabella	106	" That is exactly what I say ; he never thinks of you . Such fickleness ! Oh ! How different to your brother and to mine ! I really believe John has the most constant heart . "
44943	44983	45187	45187	Isabella	106	" But as for General Tilney , I assure you it would be impossible for anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention ; it seemed to be his only care to entertain and make me happy . "
44984	45024	44672	44672	Isabella	106	" Oh ! I know no harm of him ; I do not suspect him of pride . I believe he is a very gentleman - like man . John thinks very well of him , and John s judgment "
45025	45047	45187	45187	Isabella	106	" Well , I shall see how they behave to me this evening ; we shall meet them at the rooms . "
45048	45054	44672	44672	Isabella	106	" And must I go ? "
45055	45069	45187	45187	Isabella	106	" Do not you intend it ? I thought it was all settled . "
45070	45186	44672	44672	Isabella	106	" Nay , since you make such a point of it , I can refuse you nothing . But do not insist upon my being very agreeable , for my heart , you know , will be some forty miles off . And as for dancing , do not mention it , I beg ; _ that _ is quite out of the question . Charles Hodges will plague me to death , I dare say ; but I shall cut him very short . Ten to one but he guesses the reason , and that is exactly what I want to avoid , so I shall insist on his keeping his conjecture to himself . "
45761	45772	45774	45774	she	77	" Your brother will not mind it , I know , "
45776	45837	45774	45774	she	77	" because I heard him say before that he hated dancing ; but it was very good - natured in him to think of it . I suppose he saw Isabella sitting down , and fancied she might wish for a partner ; but he is quite mistaken , for she would not dance upon any account in the world . "
45844	45863	45838	45838	Henry	98	" How very little trouble it can give you to understand the motive of other people s actions . "
45864	45872	45752	45753	the other	413	" Why ? What do you mean ? "
45873	45939	45838	45838	Henry	98	" With you , it is not , How is such a one likely to be influenced , What is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person s feelings , age , situation , and probable habits of life considered but , How should _ I _ be influenced , What would be _ my _ inducement in acting so and so ? "
45940	45947	45752	45753	the other	413	" I do not understand you . "
45948	45964	45838	45838	Henry	98	" Then we are on very unequal terms , for I understand you perfectly well . "
45965	45980	45752	45753	the other	413	" Me ? Yes ; I can not speak well enough to be unintelligible . "
45981	45991	45838	45838	Henry	98	" Bravo ! An excellent satire on modern language . "
45992	46001	45752	45753	the other	413	" But pray tell me what you mean . "
46002	46041	45838	45838	Henry	98	" Shall I indeed ? Do you really desire it ? But you are not aware of the consequences ; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment , and certainly bring on a disagreement between us . "
46042	46058	45752	45753	the other	413	" No , no ; it shall not do either ; I am not afraid . "
46059	46101	45838	45838	Henry	98	" Well , then , I only meant that your attributing my brother s wish of dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world . "
46235	46253	46223	46223	she	106	" I can not think how it could happen ! Isabella was so determined not to dance . "
46254	46264	46223	46223	she	106	" And did Isabella never change her mind before ? "
46265	46293	46223	46223	she	106	" Oh ! But , because And your brother ! After what you told him from me , how could he think of going to ask her ? "
46294	46373	46223	46223	she	106	" I can not take surprise to myself on that head . You bid me be surprised on your friend s account , and therefore I am ; but as for my brother , his conduct in the business , I must own , has been no more than I believed him perfectly equal to . The fairness of your friend was an open attraction ; her firmness , you know , could only be understood by yourself . "
46374	46392	46223	46223	she	106	" You are laughing ; but , I assure you , Isabella is very firm in general . "
46393	46452	46223	46223	she	106	" It is as much as should be said of anyone . To be always firm must be to be often obstinate . When properly to relax is the trial of judgment ; and , without reference to my brother , I really think Miss Thorpe has by no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour . "
46490	46534	46488	46488	herself	106	" I do not wonder at your surprise ; and I am really fatigued to death . He is such a rattle ! Amusing enough , if my mind had been disengaged ; but I would have given the world to sit still . "
46535	46542	46223	46223	she	106	" Then why did not you ? "
46543	46781	46488	46488	herself	106	" Oh ! My dear ! It would have looked so particular ; and you know how I abhor doing that . I refused him as long as I possibly could , but he would take no denial . You have no idea how he pressed me . I begged him to excuse me , and get some other partner but no , not he ; after aspiring to my hand , there was nobody else in the room he could bear to think of ; and it was not that he wanted merely to dance , he wanted to be with me . Oh ! Such nonsense ! I told him he had taken a very unlikely way to prevail upon me ; for , of all things in the world , I hated fine speeches and compliments ; and so and so then I found there would be no peace if I did not stand up . Besides , I thought Mrs. Hughes , who introduced him , might take it ill if I did not : and your dear brother , I am sure he would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening . I am so glad it is over ! My spirits are quite jaded with listening to his nonsense : and then , being such a smart young fellow , I saw every eye was upon us . "
46782	46789	46223	46223	she	106	" He is very handsome indeed . "
46790	46862	46488	46488	herself	106	" Handsome ! Yes , I suppose he may . I dare say people would admire him in general ; but he is not at all in my style of beauty . I hate a florid complexion and dark eyes in a man . However , he is very well . Amazingly conceited , I am sure . I took him down several times , you know , in my way . "
47061	47068	47070	47070	Isabella	106	" It is very charming indeed , "
47077	47086	47088	47091	the gentle Mrs. Thorpe	102	" Mr. Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed , "
47099	47190	47088	47091	the gentle Mrs. Thorpe	102	" I only wish I could do as much . One could not expect more from him , you know . If he finds he _ can _ do more by and by , I dare say he will , for I am sure he must be an excellent good - hearted man . Four hundred is but a small income to begin on indeed , but your wishes , my dear Isabella , are so moderate , you do not consider how little you ever want , my dear . "
47191	47251	47042	47042	her	77	" It is not on my own account I wish for more ; but I can not bear to be the means of injuring my dear Morland , making him sit down upon an income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life . For myself , it is nothing ; I never think of myself . "
47252	47391	47088	47091	the gentle Mrs. Thorpe	102	" I know you never do , my dear ; and you will always find your reward in the affection it makes everybody feel for you . There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you ; and I dare say when Mr. Morland sees you , my dear child but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things . Mr. Morland has behaved so very handsome , you know . I always heard he was a most excellent man ; and you know , my dear , we are not to suppose but what , if you had had a suitable fortune , he would have come down with something more , for I am sure he must be a most liberal - minded man . "
47392	47432	47042	47042	her	77	" Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do , I am sure . But everybody has their failing , you know , and everybody has a right to do what they like with their own money . "
47440	47446	47448	47448	she	77	" I am very sure , "
47450	47465	47448	47448	she	77	" that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford . "
47470	47589	47468	47468	herself	106	" As to that , my sweet Catherine , there can not be a doubt , and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me . It is not the want of more money that makes me just at present a little out of spirits ; I hate money ; and if our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year , I should not have a wish unsatisfied . Ah ! my Catherine , you have found me out . There s the sting . The long , long , endless two years and half that are to pass before your brother can hold the living . "
47590	47599	47601	47602	Mrs. Thorpe	102	" Yes , yes , my darling Isabella , "
47604	47638	47601	47602	Mrs. Thorpe	102	" we perfectly see into your heart . You have no disguise . We perfectly understand the present vexation ; and everybody must love you the better for such a noble honest affection . "
47855	47858	47844	47844	she	77	" perhaps , "
48022	48030	48014	48014	she	77	" By the end of another week ! "
48031	48083	48014	48014	she	77	" Yes , my father can seldom be prevailed on to give the waters what I think a fair trial . He has been disappointed of some friends arrival whom he expected to meet here , and as he is now pretty well , is in a hurry to get home . "
48084	48092	48094	48094	Catherine	77	" I am very sorry for it , "
48097	48104	48094	48094	Catherine	77	" if I had known this before "
48105	48108	48110	48111	Miss Tilney	95	" Perhaps , "
48117	48130	48110	48111	Miss Tilney	95	" you would be so good it would make me very happy if "
48173	48193	48165	48165	he	188	" Well , Eleanor , may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend ? "
48194	48211	48165	48165	he	188	" I was just beginning to make the request , sir , as you came in . "
48212	48236	48237	48237	he	188	" Well , proceed by all means . I know how much your heart is in it . My daughter , Miss Morland , "
48248	48487	48237	48237	he	188	" has been forming a very bold wish . We leave Bath , as she has perhaps told you , on Saturday se nnight . A letter from my steward tells me that my presence is wanted at home ; and being disappointed in my hope of seeing the Marquis of Longtown and General Courteney here , some of my very old friends , there is nothing to detain me longer in Bath . And could we carry our selfish point with you , we should leave it without a single regret . Can you , in short , be prevailed on to quit this scene of public triumph and oblige your friend Eleanor with your company in Gloucestershire ? I am almost ashamed to make the request , though its presumption would certainly appear greater to every creature in Bath than yourself . Modesty such as yours but not for the world would I pain it by open praise . If you can be induced to honour us with a visit , you will make us happy beyond expression . Tis true , we can offer you nothing like the gaieties of this lively place ; we can tempt you neither by amusement nor splendour , for our mode of living , as you see , is plain and unpretending ; yet no endeavours shall be wanting on our side to make Northanger Abbey not wholly disagreeable . "
48579	48586	48588	48588	she	77	" I will write home directly , "
48590	48605	48588	48588	she	77	" and if they do not object , as I dare say they will not "
48632	48642	48644	48644	he	143	" Since they can consent to part with you , "
48646	48656	48644	48644	he	143	" we may expect philosophy from all the world . "
49451	49458	49460	49460	she	77	" This is my favourite place , "
49483	49492	49460	49460	she	77	" it is so out of the way . "
49544	49558	49519	49519	she	106	" Do not be uneasy , Isabella , James will soon be here . "
49559	49566	49567	49567	she	77	" Psha ! My dear creature , "
49570	49648	49567	49567	she	77	" do not think me such a simpleton as to be always wanting to confine him to my elbow . It would be hideous to be always together ; we should be the jest of the place . And so you are going to Northanger ! I am amazingly glad of it . It is one of the finest old places in England , I understand . I shall depend upon a most particular description of it . "
49649	49674	49519	49519	she	106	" You shall certainly have the best in my power to give . But who are you looking for ? Are your sisters coming ? "
49675	49743	49567	49567	she	77	" I am not looking for anybody . One s eyes must be somewhere , and you know what a foolish trick I have of fixing mine , when my thoughts are an hundred miles off . I am amazingly absent ; I believe I am the most absent creature in the world . Tilney says it is always the case with minds of a certain stamp . "
49744	49760	49519	49519	she	106	" But I thought , Isabella , you had something in particular to tell me ? "
49761	49814	49567	49567	she	77	" Oh ! Yes , and so I have . But here is a proof of what I was saying . My poor head , I had quite forgot it . Well , the thing is this : I have just had a letter from John ; you can guess the contents . "
49815	49824	49519	49519	she	106	" No , indeed , I can not . "
49825	49859	49567	49567	she	77	" My sweet love , do not be so abominably affected . What can he write about , but yourself ? You know he is over head and ears in love with you . "
49860	49869	49519	49519	she	106	" With _ me _ , dear Isabella ! "
49870	50012	49567	49567	she	77	" Nay , my sweetest Catherine , this is being quite absurd ! Modesty , and all that , is very well in its way , but really a little common honesty is sometimes quite as becoming . I have no idea of being so overstrained ! It is fishing for compliments . His attentions were such as a child must have noticed . And it was but half an hour before he left Bath that you gave him the most positive encouragement . He says so in this letter , says that he as good as made you an offer , and that you received his advances in the kindest way ; and now he wants me to urge his suit , and say all manner of pretty things to you . So it is in vain to affect ignorance . "
50059	50186	50023	50023	her	77	" As to any attentions on his side , I do declare , upon my honour , I never was sensible of them for a moment except just his asking me to dance the first day of his coming . And as to making me an offer , or anything like it , there must be some unaccountable mistake . I could not have misunderstood a thing of that kind , you know ! And , as I ever wish to be believed , I solemnly protest that no syllable of such a nature ever passed between us . The last half hour before he went away ! It must be all and completely a mistake for I did not see him once that whole morning . "
50187	50237	50023	50023	her	77	" But _ that _ you certainly did , for you spent the whole morning in Edgar s Buildings it was the day your father s consent came and I am pretty sure that you and John were alone in the parlour some time before you left the house . "
50238	50457	50458	50458	Isabella	106	" Are you ? Well , if you say it , it was so , I dare say but for the life of me , I can not recollect it . I _ do _ remember now being with you , and seeing him as well as the rest but that we were ever alone for five minutes However , it is not worth arguing about , for whatever might pass on his side , you must be convinced , by my having no recollection of it , that I never thought , nor expected , nor wished for anything of the kind from him . I am excessively concerned that he should have any regard for me but indeed it has been quite unintentional on my side ; I never had the smallest idea of it . Pray undeceive him as soon as you can , and tell him I beg his pardon that is I do not know what I ought to say but make him understand what I mean , in the properest way . I would not speak disrespectfully of a brother of yours , Isabella , I am sure ; but you know very well that if I could think of one man more than another _ he _ is not the person . "
50462	50499	50458	50458	Isabella	106	" My dear friend , you must not be angry with me . I can not suppose your brother cares so very much about me . And , you know , we shall still be sisters . "
50500	50504	50023	50023	her	77	" Yes , yes "
50511	50553	50023	50023	her	77	" there are more ways than one of our being sisters . But where am I wandering to ? Well , my dear Catherine , the case seems to be that you are determined against poor John is not it so ? "
50554	50572	50023	50023	her	77	" I certainly can not return his affection , and as certainly never meant to encourage it . "
50573	50708	50023	50023	her	77	" Since that is the case , I am sure I shall not tease you any further . John desired me to speak to you on the subject , and therefore I have . But I confess , as soon as I read his letter , I thought it a very foolish , imprudent business , and not likely to promote the good of either ; for what were you to live upon , supposing you came together ? You have both of you something , to be sure , but it is not a trifle that will support a family nowadays ; and after all that romancers may say , there is no doing without money . I only wonder John could think of it ; he could not have received my last . "
50709	50745	50023	50023	her	77	" You _ do _ acquit me , then , of anything wrong ? You are convinced that I never meant to deceive your brother , never suspected him of liking me till this moment ? "
50746	50753	50755	50755	Isabella	106	" Oh ! As to that , "
50758	50865	50755	50755	Isabella	106	" I do not pretend to determine what your thoughts and designs in time past may have been . All that is best known to yourself . A little harmless flirtation or so will occur , and one is often drawn on to give more encouragement than one wishes to stand by . But you may be assured that I am the last person in the world to judge you severely . All those things should be allowed for in youth and high spirits . What one means one day , you know , one may not mean the next . Circumstances change , opinions alter . "
50866	50890	50023	50023	her	77	" But my opinion of your brother never did alter ; it was always the same . You are describing what never happened . "
50891	50896	50898	50899	the other	413	" My dearest Catherine , "
50907	51117	50898	50899	the other	413	" I would not for all the world be the means of hurrying you into an engagement before you knew what you were about . I do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother , because he is my brother , and who perhaps after all , you know , might be just as happy without you , for people seldom know what they would be at , young men especially , they are so amazingly changeable and inconstant . What I say is , why should a brother s happiness be dearer to me than a friend s ? You know I carry my notions of friendship pretty high . But , above all things , my dear Catherine , do not be in a hurry . Take my word for it , that if you are in too great a hurry , you will certainly live to repent it . Tilney says there is nothing people are so often deceived in as the state of their own affections , and I believe he is very right . Ah ! Here he comes ; never mind , he will not see us , I am sure . "
51175	51189	51171	51171	she	77	" What ! Always to be watched , in person or by proxy ! "
51190	51195	51197	51197	Isabella	106	" Psha , nonsense ! "
51206	51232	51197	51197	Isabella	106	" Why do you put such things into my head ? If I could believe it my spirit , you know , is pretty independent . "
51233	51248	51171	51171	she	77	" I wish your heart were independent . That would be enough for me . "
51249	51273	51197	51197	Isabella	106	" My heart , indeed ! What can you have to do with hearts ? You men have none of you any hearts . "
51274	51292	51171	51171	she	77	" If we have not hearts , we have eyes ; and they give us torment enough . "
51293	51325	51328	51328	her	1151	" Do they ? I am sorry for it ; I am sorry they find anything so disagreeable in me . I will look another way . I hope this pleases you "
51334	51344	51328	51328	her	1151	" I hope your eyes are not tormented now . "
51345	51369	51399	51399	she	106	" Never more so ; for the edge of a blooming cheek is still in view at once too much and too little . "
52369	52376	52378	52378	Henry	98	" My brother does know it , "
52382	52393	52378	52378	Henry	98	" Does he ? Then why does he stay here ? "
52413	52484	52409	52409	she	77	" Why do not you persuade him to go away ? The longer he stays , the worse it will be for him at last . Pray advise him for his own sake , and for everybody s sake , to leave Bath directly . Absence will in time make him comfortable again ; but he can have no hope here , and it is only staying to be miserable . "
52490	52503	52485	52485	Henry	98	" I am sure my brother would not wish to do that . "
52504	52514	52409	52409	she	77	" Then you will persuade him to go away ? "
52515	52561	52485	52485	Henry	98	" Persuasion is not at command ; but pardon me , if I can not even endeavour to persuade him . I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged . He knows what he is about , and must be his own master . "
52562	52574	52576	52576	Catherine	77	" No , he does not know what he is about , "
52578	52609	52576	52576	Catherine	77	" he does not know the pain he is giving my brother . Not that James has ever told me so , but I am sure he is very uncomfortable . "
52610	52622	52485	52485	Henry	98	" And are you sure it is my brother s doing ? "
52623	52629	52576	52576	Catherine	77	" Yes , very sure . "
52630	52654	52485	52485	Henry	98	" Is it my brother s attentions to Miss Thorpe , or Miss Thorpe s admission of them , that gives the pain ? "
52655	52663	52576	52576	Catherine	77	" Is not it the same thing ? "
52664	52701	52485	52485	Henry	98	" I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference . No man is offended by another man s admiration of the woman he loves ; it is the woman only who can make it a torment . "
52711	52776	52702	52702	Catherine	77	" Isabella is wrong . But I am sure she can not mean to torment , for she is very much attached to my brother . She has been in love with him ever since they first met , and while my father s consent was uncertain , she fretted herself almost into a fever . You know she must be attached to him . "
52777	52793	52485	52485	Henry	98	" I understand : she is in love with James , and flirts with Frederick . "
52794	52815	52702	52702	Catherine	77	" Oh ! no , not flirts . A woman in love with one man can not flirt with another . "
52816	52849	52485	52485	Henry	98	" It is probable that she will neither love so well , nor flirt so well , as she might do either singly . The gentlemen must each give up a little . "
52859	52874	52855	52855	Catherine	77	" Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother ? "
52875	52885	52485	52485	Henry	98	" I can have no opinion on that subject . "
52886	52908	52855	52855	Catherine	77	" But what can your brother mean ? If he knows her engagement , what can he mean by his behaviour ? "
52909	52917	52485	52485	Henry	98	" You are a very close questioner . "
52918	52932	52855	52855	Catherine	77	" Am I ? I only ask what I want to be told . "
52933	52947	52485	52485	Henry	98	" But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell ? "
52948	52964	52855	52855	Catherine	77	" Yes , I think so ; for you must know your brother s heart . "
52965	52990	52485	52485	Henry	98	" My brother s heart , as you term it , on the present occasion , I assure you I can only guess at . "
52991	52994	52855	52855	Catherine	77	" Well ? "
52995	53071	52485	52485	Henry	98	" Well ! Nay , if it is to be guesswork , let us all guess for ourselves . To be guided by second - hand conjecture is pitiful . The premises are before you . My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man ; he has had about a week s acquaintance with your friend , and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her . "
53072	53075	53077	53077	Catherine	77	" Well , "
53084	53144	53077	53077	Catherine	77	" _ you _ may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this ; but I am sure I can not . But is not your father uncomfortable about it ? Does not he want Captain Tilney to go away ? Sure , if your father were to speak to him , he would go . "
53145	53151	53153	53153	Henry	98	" My dear Miss Morland , "
53155	53387	53153	53153	Henry	98	" in this amiable solicitude for your brother s comfort , may you not be a little mistaken ? Are you not carried a little too far ? Would he thank you , either on his own account or Miss Thorpe s , for supposing that her affection , or at least her good behaviour , is only to be secured by her seeing nothing of Captain Tilney ? Is he safe only in solitude ? Or is her heart constant to him only when unsolicited by anyone else ? He can not think this and you may be sure that he would not have you think it . I will not say , Do not be uneasy , because I know that you are so , at this moment ; but be as little uneasy as you can . You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of your brother and your friend ; depend upon it , therefore , that real jealousy never can exist between them ; depend upon it that no disagreement between them can be of any duration . Their hearts are open to each other , as neither heart can be to you ; they know exactly what is required and what can be borne ; and you may be certain that one will never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant . "
53400	53480	53397	53397	he	1178	" Though Frederick does not leave Bath with us , he will probably remain but a very short time , perhaps only a few days behind us . His leave of absence will soon expire , and he must return to his regiment . And what will then be their acquaintance ? The mess - room will drink Isabella Thorpe for a fortnight , and she will laugh with your brother over poor Tilney s passion for a month . "
54207	54219	54193	54193	she	1185	" How glad I shall be when you are all off . "
54690	54711	54669	54670	the general	783	" the day was fine , and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible . "
55083	55090	55092	55092	Catherine	77	" But how can that be ? "
55094	55101	55092	55092	Catherine	77	" Are not you with her ? "
55102	55143	55054	55054	he	98	" Northanger is not more than half my home ; I have an establishment at my own house in Woodston , which is nearly twenty miles from my father s , and some of my time is necessarily spent there . "
55144	55153	55092	55092	Catherine	77	" How sorry you must be for that ! "
55154	55163	55054	55054	he	98	" I am always sorry to leave Eleanor . "
55164	55204	55092	55092	Catherine	77	" Yes ; but besides your affection for her , you must be so fond of the abbey ! After being used to such a home as the abbey , an ordinary parsonage - house must be very disagreeable . "
55211	55223	55205	55205	He	1231	" You have formed a very favourable idea of the abbey . "
55224	55247	55092	55092	Catherine	77	" To be sure , I have . Is not it a fine old place , just like what one reads about ? "
55248	55284	55205	55205	He	1231	" And are you prepared to encounter all the horrors that a building such as what one reads about may produce ? Have you a stout heart ? Nerves fit for sliding panels and tapestry ? "
55285	55342	55092	55092	Catherine	77	" Oh ! yes I do not think I should be easily frightened , because there would be so many people in the house and besides , it has never been uninhabited and left deserted for years , and then the family come back to it unawares , without giving any notice , as generally happens . "
55343	55560	55205	55205	He	1231	" No , certainly . We shall not have to explore our way into a hall dimly lighted by the expiring embers of a wood fire nor be obliged to spread our beds on the floor of a room without windows , doors , or furniture . But you must be aware that when a young lady is ( by whatever means ) introduced into a dwelling of this kind , she is always lodged apart from the rest of the family . While they snugly repair to their own end of the house , she is formally conducted by Dorothy , the ancient housekeeper , up a different staircase , and along many gloomy passages , into an apartment never used since some cousin or kin died in it about twenty years before . Can you stand such a ceremony as this ? Will not your mind misgive you when you find yourself in this gloomy chamber too lofty and extensive for you , with only the feeble rays of a single lamp to take in its size its walls hung with tapestry exhibiting figures as large as life , and the bed , of dark green stuff or purple velvet , presenting even a funereal appearance ? Will not your heart sink within you ? "
55561	55576	55092	55092	Catherine	77	" Oh ! But this will not happen to me , I am sure . "
55577	55777	55205	55205	He	1231	" How fearfully will you examine the furniture of your apartment ! And what will you discern ? Not tables , toilettes , wardrobes , or drawers , but on one side perhaps the remains of a broken lute , on the other a ponderous chest which no efforts can open , and over the fireplace the portrait of some handsome warrior , whose features will so incomprehensibly strike you , that you will not be able to withdraw your eyes from it . Dorothy , meanwhile , no less struck by your appearance , gazes on you in great agitation , and drops a few unintelligible hints . To raise your spirits , moreover , she gives you reason to suppose that the part of the abbey you inhabit is undoubtedly haunted , and informs you that you will not have a single domestic within call . With this parting cordial she curtsies off you listen to the sound of her receding footsteps as long as the last echo can reach you and when , with fainting spirits , you attempt to fasten your door , you discover , with increased alarm , that it has no lock . "
55778	55818	55092	55092	Catherine	77	" Oh ! Mr. Tilney , how frightful ! This is just like a book ! But it can not really happen to me . I am sure your housekeeper is not really Dorothy . Well , what then ? "
55819	56052	55205	55205	He	1231	" Nothing further to alarm perhaps may occur the first night . After surmounting your _ unconquerable _ horror of the bed , you will retire to rest , and get a few hours unquiet slumber . But on the second , or at farthest the _ third _ night after your arrival , you will probably have a violent storm . Peals of thunder so loud as to seem to shake the edifice to its foundation will roll round the neighbouring mountains and during the frightful gusts of wind which accompany it , you will probably think you discern ( for your lamp is not extinguished ) one part of the hanging more violently agitated than the rest . Unable of course to repress your curiosity in so favourable a moment for indulging it , you will instantly arise , and throwing your dressing - gown around you , proceed to examine this mystery . After a very short search , you will discover a division in the tapestry so artfully constructed as to defy the minutest inspection , and on opening it , a door will immediately appear which door , being only secured by massy bars and a padlock , you will , after a few efforts , succeed in opening and , with your lamp in your hand , will pass through it into a small vaulted room . "
56053	56070	55092	55092	Catherine	77	" No , indeed ; I should be too much frightened to do any such thing . "
56071	56365	55205	55205	He	1231	" What ! Not when Dorothy has given you to understand that there is a secret subterraneous communication between your apartment and the chapel of St. Anthony , scarcely two miles off ? Could you shrink from so simple an adventure ? No , no , you will proceed into this small vaulted room , and through this into several others , without perceiving anything very remarkable in either . In one perhaps there may be a dagger , in another a few drops of blood , and in a third the remains of some instrument of torture ; but there being nothing in all this out of the common way , and your lamp being nearly exhausted , you will return towards your own apartment . In repassing through the small vaulted room , however , your eyes will be attracted towards a large , old - fashioned cabinet of ebony and gold , which , though narrowly examining the furniture before , you had passed unnoticed . Impelled by an irresistible presentiment , you will eagerly advance to it , unlock its folding doors , and search into every drawer but for some time without discovering anything of importance perhaps nothing but a considerable hoard of diamonds . At last , however , by touching a secret spring , an inner compartment will open a roll of paper appears you seize it it contains many sheets of manuscript you hasten with the precious treasure into your own chamber , but scarcely have you been able to decipher Oh ! Thou whomsoever thou mayst be , into whose hands these memoirs of the wretched Matilda may fall when your lamp suddenly expires in the socket , and leaves you in total darkness . "
56366	56382	55092	55092	Catherine	77	" Oh ! No , no do not say so . Well , go on . "
56469	56497	56452	56452	her	1233	" Miss Tilney , she was sure , would never put her into such a chamber as he had described ! She was not at all afraid . "
57536	57615	57616	57616	She	77	" This is strange indeed ! I did not expect such a sight as this ! An immense heavy chest ! What can it hold ? Why should it be placed here ? Pushed back too , as if meant to be out of sight ! I will look into it cost me what it may , I will look into it and directly too by daylight . If I stay till evening my candle may go out . "
58158	58170	58172	58173	Miss Tilney	95	" That is a curious old chest , is not it ? "
58187	58267	58172	58173	Miss Tilney	95	" It is impossible to say how many generations it has been here . How it came to be first put in this room I know not , but I have not had it moved , because I thought it might sometimes be of use in holding hats and bonnets . The worst of it is that its weight makes it difficult to open . In that corner , however , it is at least out of the way . "
58355	58365	58373	58373	he	143	" Dinner to be on table _ directly ! _ "
58641	58659	58636	58636	he	783	" that she must have been used to much better - sized apartments at Mr. Allen s ? "
58660	58665	58667	58667	Catherine	77	" No , indeed , "
58672	58687	58689	58689	she	77	" Mr. Allen s dining - parlour was not more than half as large , "
59107	59114	59116	59116	she	77	" How much better is this , "
59124	59235	59116	59116	she	77	" how much better to find a fire ready lit , than to have to wait shivering in the cold till all the family are in bed , as so many poor girls have been obliged to do , and then to have a faithful old servant frightening one by coming in with a faggot ! How glad I am that Northanger is what it is ! If it had been like some other places , I do not know that , in such a night as this , I could have answered for my courage : but now , to be sure , there is nothing to alarm one . "
59366	59425	59343	59343	she	77	" She should take her time ; she should not hurry herself ; she did not care if she were the last person up in the house . But she would not make up her fire ; _ that _ would seem cowardly , as if she wished for the protection of light after she were in bed . "
60049	60097	60047	60047	she	77	" never from the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the cabinet , and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus far , it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was about it . "
61107	61112	61057	61064	Two others , penned by the same hand	1324	" To poultice chestnut mare "
61609	61619	61620	61620	she	77	" But we have a charming morning after it , "
61631	61656	61620	61620	she	77	" and storms and sleeplessness are nothing when they are over . What beautiful hyacinths ! I have just learnt to love a hyacinth . "
61657	61669	61945	61956	the general , whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind	1332	" And how might you learn ? By accident or argument ? "
61670	61722	61620	61620	she	77	" Your sister taught me ; I can not tell how . Mrs. Allen used to take pains , year after year , to make me like them ; but I never could , till I saw them the other day in Milsom Street ; I am naturally indifferent about flowers . "
61723	61827	61945	61956	the general , whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind	1332	" But now you love a hyacinth . So much the better . You have gained a new source of enjoyment , and it is well to have as many holds upon happiness as possible . Besides , a taste for flowers is always desirable in your sex , as a means of getting you out of doors , and tempting you to more frequent exercise than you would otherwise take . And though the love of a hyacinth may be rather domestic , who can tell , the sentiment once raised , but you may in time come to love a rose ? "
61828	61877	61620	61620	she	77	" But I do not want any such pursuit to get me out of doors . The pleasure of walking and breathing fresh air is enough for me , and in fine weather I am out more than half my time . Mamma says I am never within . "
61878	61931	61945	61956	the general , whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind	1332	" At any rate , however , I am pleased that you have learnt to love a hyacinth . The mere habit of learning to love is the thing ; and a teachableness of disposition in a young lady is a great blessing . Has my sister a pleasant mode of instruction ? "
62214	62227	62229	62230	the general	783	" This is a somewhat heavy call upon your brother s fortitude , "
62234	62244	62229	62230	the general	783	" Woodston will make but a sombre appearance today . "
62245	62252	62254	62254	Catherine	77	" Is it a pretty place ? "
62256	62525	62229	62230	the general	783	" What say you , Eleanor ? Speak your opinion , for ladies can best tell the taste of ladies in regard to places as well as men . I think it would be acknowledged by the most impartial eye to have many recommendations . The house stands among fine meadows facing the south - east , with an excellent kitchen - garden in the same aspect ; the walls surrounding which I built and stocked myself about ten years ago , for the benefit of my son . It is a family living , Miss Morland ; and the property in the place being chiefly my own , you may believe I take care that it shall not be a bad one . Did Henry s income depend solely on this living , he would not be ill - provided for . Perhaps it may seem odd , that with only two younger children , I should think any profession necessary for him ; and certainly there are moments when we could all wish him disengaged from every tie of business . But though I may not exactly make converts of you young ladies , I am sure your father , Miss Morland , would agree with me in thinking it expedient to give every young man some employment . The money is nothing , it is not an object , but employment is the thing . Even Frederick , my eldest son , you see , who will perhaps inherit as considerable a landed property as any private man in the county , has his profession . "
62657	62682	62683	62683	She	383	" And when they had gone over the house , he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden . "
62688	62816	62683	62683	She	383	" But perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object . The weather was at present favourable , and at this time of year the uncertainty was very great of its continuing so . Which would she prefer ? He was equally at her service . Which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend s wishes ? But he thought he could discern . Yes , he certainly read in Miss Morland s eyes a judicious desire of making use of the present smiling weather . But when did she judge amiss ? The abbey would be always safe and dry . He yielded implicitly , and would fetch his hat and attend them in a moment . "
62875	62913	62861	62861	she	77	" I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine ; and do not be uneasy on my father s account ; he always walks out at this time of day . "
63353	63474	63347	63347	he	783	" without any ambition of that sort himself without any solicitude about it he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom . If he had a hobby - horse , it was _ that _ . He loved a garden . Though careless enough in most matters of eating , he loved good fruit or if he did not , his friends and children did . There were great vexations , however , attending such a garden as his . The utmost care could not always secure the most valuable fruits . The pinery had yielded only one hundred in the last year . Mr. Allen , he supposed , must feel these inconveniences as well as himself . "
63475	63497	63347	63347	he	783	" No , not at all . Mr. Allen did not care about the garden , and never went into it . "
63539	63550	63555	63555	his	783	" How were Mr. Allen s succession - houses worked ? "
63562	63597	63555	63555	his	783	" Mr. Allen had only one small hot - house , which Mrs. Allen had the use of for her plants in winter , and there was a fire in it now and then . "
63598	63605	63607	63608	the general	783	" He is a happy man ! "
63693	63728	63660	63660	his	783	" But where are you going , Eleanor ? Why do you choose that cold , damp path to it ? Miss Morland will get wet . Our best way is across the park . "
63729	63739	63741	63742	Miss Tilney	95	" This is so favourite a walk of mine , "
63744	63763	63741	63742	Miss Tilney	95	" that I always think it the best and nearest way . But perhaps it may be damp . "
63844	63866	63836	63836	himself	783	" The rays of the sun were not too cheerful for him , and he would meet them by another course . "
63922	63931	63933	63934	her companion	687	" I am particularly fond of this spot , "
63940	63949	63933	63934	her companion	687	" It was my mother s favourite walk . "
63991	64002	64004	64004	Eleanor	145	" I used to walk here so often with her ! "
64006	64040	64004	64004	Eleanor	145	" though I never loved it then , as I have loved it since . At that time indeed I used to wonder at her choice . But her memory endears it now . "
64041	64047	64049	64049	Catherine	77	" And ought it not , "
64051	64067	64068	64069	Miss Tilney	95	" to endear it to her husband ? Yet the general would not enter it . "
64078	64088	64073	64073	she	95	" Her death must have been a great affliction ! "
64089	64096	64098	64099	the other	413	" A great and increasing one , "
64106	64148	64149	64149	She	95	" I was only thirteen when it happened ; and though I felt my loss perhaps as strongly as one so young could feel it , I did not , I could not , then know what a loss it was . "
64163	64207	64149	64149	She	95	" I have no sister , you know and though Henry though my brothers are very affectionate , and Henry is a great deal here , which I am most thankful for , it is impossible for me not to be often solitary . "
64208	64219	64296	64298	the first three	1392	" To be sure you must miss him very much . "
64220	64247	64149	64149	She	95	" A mother would have been always present . A mother would have been a constant friend ; her influence would have been beyond all other . "
64248	64288	64296	64298	the first three	1392	" Was she a very charming woman ? Was she handsome ? Was there any picture of her in the abbey ? And why had she been so partial to that grove ? Was it from dejection of spirits ? "
64391	64398	64368	64368	he	783	" Her picture , I suppose , "
64409	64417	64368	64368	he	783	" hangs in your father s room ? "
64418	64482	64368	64368	he	783	" No ; it was intended for the drawing - room ; but my father was dissatisfied with the painting , and for some time it had no place . Soon after her death I obtained it for my own , and hung it in my bed - chamber where I shall be happy to show it you ; it is very like . "
64799	64823	64826	64826	he	783	" This lengthened absence , these solitary rambles , did not speak a mind at ease , or a conscience void of reproach . "
66128	66134	66150	66166	a man so kindly disposed towards herself , and so full of civility to all her family	1485	" our friends from Fullerton . "
66442	66462	66465	66465	her	95	" I was going to take you into what was my mother s room the room in which she died "
66602	66612	66614	66614	she	77	" It remains as it was , I suppose ? "
66622	66627	66585	66585	her	77	" Yes , entirely . "
66628	66641	66585	66585	her	77	" And how long ago may it be that your mother died ? "
66642	66651	66585	66585	her	77	" She has been dead these nine years . "
66686	66699	66585	66585	her	77	" You were with her , I suppose , to the last ? "
66700	66703	66705	66706	Miss Tilney	95	" No , "
66710	66734	66705	66706	Miss Tilney	95	" I was unfortunately from home . Her illness was sudden and short ; and , before I arrived it was all over . "
66889	66893	66894	66894	she	77	" My father , "
66897	66912	66894	66894	she	77	" often walks about the room in this way ; it is nothing unusual . "
66913	66919	66921	66921	Catherine	77	" So much the worse ! "
67023	67031	67033	67033	he	1066	" I have many pamphlets to finish , "
67037	67096	67033	67033	he	1066	" before I can close my eyes , and perhaps may be poring over the affairs of the nation for hours after you are asleep . Can either of us be more meetly employed ? _ My _ eyes will be blinding for the good of others , and _ yours _ preparing by rest for future mischief . "
68465	68467	68474	68474	his	783	" Eleanor "
68728	68739	68740	68740	she	145	" My father only wanted me to answer a note , "
69600	69604	69605	69605	she	77	" Mr. Tilney ! "
69621	69625	69626	69626	she	77	" Good God ! "
69635	69648	69626	69626	she	77	" How came you here ? How came you up that staircase ? "
69649	69657	69658	69658	he	98	" How came I up that staircase ! "
69664	69690	69658	69658	he	98	" Because it is my nearest way from the stable - yard to my own chamber ; and why should I not come up it ? "
69729	69739	69741	69741	he	98	" And may I not , in my turn , "
69751	69789	69741	69741	he	98	" ask how _ you _ came here ? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road from the breakfast - parlour to your apartment , as that staircase can be from the stables to mine . "
69790	69795	69797	69797	Catherine	77	" I have been , "
69802	69810	69797	69797	Catherine	77	" to see your mother s room . "
69811	69826	69741	69741	he	98	" My mother s room ! Is there anything extraordinary to be seen there ? "
69827	69846	69797	69797	Catherine	77	" No , nothing at all . I thought you did not mean to come back till tomorrow . "
69847	69916	69741	69741	he	98	" I did not expect to be able to return sooner , when I went away ; but three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me . You look pale . I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those stairs . Perhaps you did not know you were not aware of their leading from the offices in common use ? "
69917	69935	69797	69797	Catherine	77	" No , I was not . You have had a very fine day for your ride . "
69936	69958	69741	69741	he	98	" Very ; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms in the house by yourself ? "
69959	69983	69797	69797	Catherine	77	" Oh ! No ; she showed me over the greatest part on Saturday and we were coming here to these rooms but only "
69987	69994	69741	69741	he	98	" your father was with us . "
69995	70001	70003	70003	Henry	98	" And that prevented you , "
70009	70021	70003	70003	Henry	98	" Have you looked into all the rooms in that passage ? "
70022	70042	69741	69741	he	98	" No , I only wanted to see Is not it very late ? I must go and dress . "
70043	70051	70053	70053	his	98	" It is only a quarter past four "
70055	70082	70098	70098	her	1617	" and you are not now in Bath . No theatre , no rooms to prepare for . Half an hour at Northanger must be enough . "
70126	70139	70119	70119	They	1618	" Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you ? "
70140	70158	70098	70098	her	1617	" No , and I am very much surprised . Isabella promised so faithfully to write directly . "
70159	70272	70119	70119	They	1618	" Promised so faithfully ! A faithful promise ! That puzzles me . I have heard of a faithful performance . But a faithful promise the fidelity of promising ! It is a power little worth knowing , however , since it can deceive and pain you . My mother s room is very commodious , is it not ? Large and cheerful - looking , and the dressing - closets so well disposed ! It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house , and I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her own . She sent you to look at it , I suppose ? "
70273	70276	70098	70098	her	1617	" No . "
70277	70286	70119	70119	They	1618	" It has been your own doing entirely ? "
70307	70417	70304	70304	he	1620	" As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity , this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character , as described by Eleanor , which does honour to her memory . The world , I believe , never saw a better woman . But it is not often that virtue can boast an interest such as this . The domestic , unpretending merits of a person never known do not often create that kind of fervent , venerating tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours . Eleanor , I suppose , has talked of her a great deal ? "
70418	70445	70515	70515	her	1622	" Yes , a great deal . That is no , not much , but what she did say was very interesting . Her dying so suddenly "
70457	70481	70304	70304	he	1620	" and you none of you being at home and your father , I thought perhaps had not been very fond of her . "
70482	70488	70489	70489	he	1621	" And from these circumstances , "
70500	70510	70304	70304	he	1620	" you infer perhaps the probability of some negligence some "
70518	70529	70530	70530	She	1622	" or it may be of something still less pardonable . "
70545	70551	70552	70552	he	1621	" My mother s illness , "
70555	70742	70552	70552	he	1621	" the seizure which ended in her death , _ was _ sudden . The malady itself , one from which she had often suffered , a bilious fever its cause therefore constitutional . On the third day , in short , as soon as she could be prevailed on , a physician attended her , a very respectable man , and one in whom she had always placed great confidence . Upon his opinion of her danger , two others were called in the next day , and remained in almost constant attendance for four and twenty hours . On the fifth day she died . During the progress of her disorder , Frederick and I ( _ we _ were both at home ) saw her repeatedly ; and from our own observation can bear witness to her having received every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those about her , or which her situation in life could command . Poor Eleanor was absent , and at such a distance as to return only to see her mother in her coffin . "
70743	70748	70750	70750	Catherine	77	" But your father , "
70752	70759	70750	70750	Catherine	77	" was _ he _ afflicted ? "
70760	70864	70552	70552	he	1621	" For a time , greatly so . You have erred in supposing him not attached to her . He loved her , I am persuaded , as well as it was possible for him to we have not all , you know , the same tenderness of disposition and I will not pretend to say that while she lived , she might not often have had much to bear , but though his temper injured her , his judgment never did . His value of her was sincere ; and , if not permanently , he was truly afflicted by her death . "
70865	70873	70875	70875	Catherine	77	" I am very glad of it , "
70877	70885	70875	70875	Catherine	77	" it would have been very shocking ! "
70886	71046	70552	70552	he	1621	" If I understand you rightly , you had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to Dear Miss Morland , consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained . What have you been judging from ? Remember the country and the age in which we live . Remember that we are English , that we are Christians . Consult your own understanding , your own sense of the probable , your own observation of what is passing around you . Does our education prepare us for such atrocities ? Do our laws connive at them ? Could they be perpetrated without being known , in a country like this , where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing , where every man is surrounded by a neighbourhood of voluntary spies , and where roads and newspapers lay everything open ? Dearest Miss Morland , what ideas have you been admitting ? "
72247	72255	72257	72257	she	77	" Tis only from James , however , "
72277	72281	72257	72257	she	77	" Dear Catherine , "
72621	72625	72616	72616	you	77	" Believe me , "
73021	73048	73018	73018	Eleanor	145	" No bad news from Fullerton , I hope ? Mr. and Mrs. Morland your brothers and sisters I hope they are none of them ill ? "
73049	73055	73059	73059	she	145	" No , I thank you "
73063	73079	73059	73059	she	145	" they are all very well . My letter was from my brother at Oxford . "
73099	73113	73096	73096	she	145	" I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter again ! "
73114	73119	73121	73121	Henry	98	" I am sorry , "
73131	73153	73121	73121	Henry	98	" if I had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome , I should have given it with very different feelings . "
73154	73176	73096	73096	she	145	" It contained something worse than anybody could suppose ! Poor James is so unhappy ! You will soon know why . "
73177	73190	73192	73192	Henry	98	" To have so kind - hearted , so affectionate a sister , "
73195	73206	73192	73192	Henry	98	" must be a comfort to him under any distress . "
73207	73215	73217	73217	Catherine	77	" I have one favour to beg , "
73227	73252	73217	73217	Catherine	77	" that , if your brother should be coming here , you will give me notice of it , that I may go away . "
73253	73259	73192	73192	Henry	98	" Our brother ! Frederick ! "
73260	73299	73217	73217	Catherine	77	" Yes ; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon , but something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in the same house with Captain Tilney . "
73336	73342	73344	73344	Catherine	77	" How quick you are ! "
73346	73419	73344	73344	Catherine	77	" you have guessed it , I declare ! And yet , when we talked about it in Bath , you little thought of its ending so . Isabella no wonder _ now _ I have not heard from her Isabella has deserted my brother , and is to marry yours ! Could you have believed there had been such inconstancy and fickleness , and everything that is bad in the world ? "
73420	73505	73333	73333	his	98	" I hope , so far as concerns my brother , you are misinformed . I hope he has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland s disappointment . His marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable . I think you must be deceived so far . I am very sorry for Mr. Morland sorry that anyone you love should be unhappy ; but my surprise would be greater at Frederick s marrying her than at any other part of the story . "
73506	73527	73681	73682	Miss Tilney	95	" It is very true , however ; you shall read James s letter yourself . Stay There is one part "
73536	73553	73333	73333	his	98	" Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern my brother ? "
73554	73561	73563	73563	Catherine	77	" No , read it yourself , "
73571	73581	73563	73563	Catherine	77	" I do not know what I was thinking of "
73592	73602	73563	73563	Catherine	77	" James only means to give me good advice . "
73624	73680	73603	73603	He	1678	" Well , if it is to be so , I can only say that I am sorry for it . Frederick will not be the first man who has chosen a wife with less sense than his family expected . I do not envy his situation , either as a lover or a son . "
73716	73727	73729	73729	Catherine	77	" Her mother is a very good sort of woman , "
73733	73739	73603	73603	He	1678	" What was her father ? "
73740	73752	73603	73603	He	1678	" A lawyer , I believe . They live at Putney . "
73753	73760	73603	73603	He	1678	" Are they a wealthy family ? "
73761	73817	73603	73603	He	1678	" No , not very . I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all : but that will not signify in your family . Your father is so very liberal ! He told me the other day that he only valued money as it allowed him to promote the happiness of his children . "
73827	73830	73832	73832	Eleanor	145	" But , "
73839	73931	73832	73832	Eleanor	145	" would it be to promote his happiness , to enable him to marry such a girl ? She must be an unprincipled one , or she could not have used your brother so . And how strange an infatuation on Frederick s side ! A girl who , before his eyes , is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another man ! Is not it inconceivable , Henry ? Frederick too , who always wore his heart so proudly ! Who found no woman good enough to be loved ! "
73932	74052	73824	73825	each other	338	" That is the most unpromising circumstance , the strongest presumption against him . When I think of his past declarations , I give him up . Moreover , I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe s prudence to suppose that she would part with one gentleman before the other was secured . It is all over with Frederick indeed ! He is a deceased man defunct in understanding . Prepare for your sister - in - law , Eleanor , and such a sister - in - law as you must delight in ! Open , candid , artless , guileless , with affections strong but simple , forming no pretensions , and knowing no disguise . "
74053	74069	74071	74071	Eleanor	145	" Such a sister - in - law , Henry , I should delight in , "
74076	74080	74082	74082	Catherine	77	" But perhaps , "
74084	74117	74082	74082	Catherine	77	" though she has behaved so ill by our family , she may behave better by yours . Now she has really got the man she likes , she may be constant . "
74118	74126	74128	74128	Henry	98	" Indeed I am afraid she will , "
74130	74169	74128	74128	Henry	98	" I am afraid she will be very constant , unless a baronet should come in her way ; that is Frederick s only chance . I will get the Bath paper , and look over the arrivals . "
74170	74239	73824	73825	each other	338	" You think it is all for ambition , then ? And , upon my word , there are some things that seem very like it . I can not forget that , when she first knew what my father would do for them , she seemed quite disappointed that it was not more . I never was so deceived in anyone s character in my life before . "
74240	74253	74128	74128	Henry	98	" Among all the great variety that you have known and studied . "
74254	74282	73824	73825	each other	338	" My own disappointment and loss in her is very great ; but , as for poor James , I suppose he will hardly ever recover it . "
74283	74430	74128	74128	Henry	98	" Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present ; but we must not , in our concern for his sufferings , undervalue yours . You feel , I suppose , that in losing Isabella , you lose half yourself : you feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy . Society is becoming irksome ; and as for the amusements in which you were wo nt to share at Bath , the very idea of them without her is abhorrent . You would not , for instance , now go to a ball for the world . You feel that you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve , on whose regard you can place dependence , or whose counsel , in any difficulty , you could rely on . You feel all this ? "
74431	74434	74436	74436	Catherine	77	" No , "
74444	74503	74436	74436	Catherine	77	" I do not ought I ? To say the truth , though I am hurt and grieved , that I can not still love her , that I am never to hear from her , perhaps never to see her again , I do not feel so very , very much afflicted as one would have thought . "
74504	74536	74556	74556	she	77	" You feel , as you always do , what is most to the credit of human nature . Such feelings ought to be investigated , that they may know themselves . "
74989	74992	74994	74994	he	783	" No , "
74996	75024	74994	74994	he	783	" my father s hands need not be strengthened , and Frederick s confession of folly need not be forestalled . He must tell his own story . "
75025	75035	75061	75061	sister	721	" But he will tell only half of it . "
75036	75043	74994	74994	he	783	" A quarter would be enough . "
75296	75338	75288	75288	Catherine	77	" And when do you think , sir , I may look forward to this pleasure ? I must be at Woodston on Monday to attend the parish meeting , and shall probably be obliged to stay two or three days . "
75339	75638	75667	75667	her	77	" Well , well , we will take our chance some one of those days . There is no need to fix . You are not to put yourself at all out of your way . Whatever you may happen to have in the house will be enough . I think I can answer for the young ladies making allowance for a bachelor s table . Let me see ; Monday will be a busy day with you , we will not come on Monday ; and Tuesday will be a busy one with me . I expect my surveyor from Brockham with his report in the morning ; and afterwards I can not in decency fail attending the club . I really could not face my acquaintance if I stayed away now ; for , as I am known to be in the country , it would be taken exceedingly amiss ; and it is a rule with me , Miss Morland , never to give offence to any of my neighbours , if a small sacrifice of time and attention can prevent it . They are a set of very worthy men . They have half a buck from Northanger twice a year ; and I dine with them whenever I can . Tuesday , therefore , we may say is out of the question . But on Wednesday , I think , Henry , you may expect us ; and we shall be with you early , that we may have time to look about us . Two hours and three quarters will carry us to Woodston , I suppose ; we shall be in the carriage by ten ; so , about a quarter before one on Wednesday , you may look for us . "
75699	75807	75675	75675	Henry	98	" I am come , young ladies , in a very moralizing strain , to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for , and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage , giving ready - monied actual happiness for a draft on the future , that may not be honoured . Witness myself , at this present hour . Because I am to hope for the satisfaction of seeing you at Woodston on Wednesday , which bad weather , or twenty other causes , may prevent , I must go away directly , two days before I intended it . "
75808	75812	75814	75814	Catherine	77	" Go away ! "
75822	75826	75814	75814	Catherine	77	" And why ? "
75827	75869	75675	75675	Henry	98	" Why ! How can you ask the question ? Because no time is to be lost in frightening my old housekeeper out of her wits , because I must go and prepare a dinner for you , to be sure . "
75870	75876	75814	75814	Catherine	77	" Oh ! Not seriously ! "
75877	75890	75675	75675	Henry	98	" Aye , and sadly too for I had much rather stay . "
75891	75928	75814	75814	Catherine	77	" But how can you think of such a thing , after what the general said ? When he so particularly desired you not to give yourself any trouble , because _ anything _ would do . "
75933	76008	75929	75929	Henry	98	" I am sure it is quite unnecessary upon your sister s account and mine . You must know it to be so ; and the general made such a point of your providing nothing extraordinary : besides , if he had not said half so much as he did , he has always such an excellent dinner at home , that sitting down to a middling one for one day could not signify . "
76009	76041	76067	76067	she	77	" I wish I could reason like you , for his sake and my own . Good - bye . As tomorrow is Sunday , Eleanor , I shall not return . "
76699	76709	76711	76711	he	783	" We are not calling it a good house , "
76713	76825	76711	76711	he	783	" We are not comparing it with Fullerton and Northanger we are considering it as a mere parsonage , small and confined , we allow , but decent , perhaps , and habitable ; and altogether not inferior to the generality ; or , in other words , I believe there are few country parsonages in England half so good . It may admit of improvement , however . Far be it from me to say otherwise ; and anything in reason a bow thrown out , perhaps though , between ourselves , if there is one thing more than another my aversion , it is a patched - on bow . "
77028	77071	77010	77010	she	77	" Oh ! Why do not you fit up this room , Mr. Tilney ? What a pity not to have it fitted up ! It is the prettiest room I ever saw ; it is the prettiest room in the world ! "
77072	77076	77078	77079	the general	783	" I trust , "
77087	77105	77078	77079	the general	783	" that it will very speedily be furnished : it waits only for a lady s taste ! "
77106	77145	77010	77010	she	77	" Well , if it was my house , I should never sit anywhere else . Oh ! What a sweet little cottage there is among the trees apple trees , too ! It is the prettiest cottage ! "
77146	77175	77078	77079	the general	783	" You like it you approve it as an object it is enough . Henry , remember that Robinson is spoken to about it . The cottage remains . "
78514	78536	78544	78544	she	77	" Write to James on her behalf ! No , James should never hear Isabella s name mentioned by her again . "
78582	78588	78589	78589	she	77	" So much for Isabella , "
78592	78679	78589	78589	she	77	" and for all our intimacy ! She must think me an idiot , or she could not have written so ; but perhaps this has served to make her character better known to me than mine is to her . I see what she has been about . She is a vain coquette , and her tricks have not answered . I do not believe she had ever any regard either for James or for me , and I wish I had never known her . "
78680	78691	78693	78693	Henry	98	" It will soon be as if you never had , "
78695	78760	78589	78589	she	77	" There is but one thing that I can not understand . I see that she has had designs on Captain Tilney , which have not succeeded ; but I do not understand what Captain Tilney has been about all this time . Why should he pay her such attentions as to make her quarrel with my brother , and then fly off himself ? "
78761	78836	78589	78589	she	77	" I have very little to say for Frederick s motives , such as I believe them to have been . He has his vanities as well as Miss Thorpe , and the chief difference is , that , having a stronger head , they have not yet injured himself . If the _ effect _ of his behaviour does not justify him with you , we had better not seek after the cause . "
78837	78850	78589	78589	she	77	" Then you do not suppose he ever really cared about her ? "
78851	78860	78589	78589	she	77	" I am persuaded that he never did . "
78861	78874	78589	78589	she	77	" And only made believe to do so for mischief s sake ? "
78880	78952	78589	78589	she	77	" Well , then , I must say that I do not like him at all . Though it has turned out so well for us , I do not like him at all . As it happens , there is no great harm done , because I do not think Isabella has any heart to lose . But , suppose he had made her very much in love with him ? "
78953	78991	78589	78589	she	77	" But we must first suppose Isabella to have had a heart to lose consequently to have been a very different creature ; and , in that case , she would have met with very different treatment . "
78992	79005	78589	78589	she	77	" It is very right that you should stand by your brother . "
79006	79061	78589	78589	she	77	" And if you would stand by _ yours _ , you would not be much distressed by the disappointment of Miss Thorpe . But your mind is warped by an innate principle of general integrity , and therefore not accessible to the cool reasonings of family partiality , or a desire of revenge . "
79481	79548	79549	79549	Catherine	77	" hoped for the pleasure of her company for a much longer time had been misled ( perhaps by her wishes ) to suppose that a much longer visit had been promised and could not but think that if Mr. and Mrs. Morland were aware of the pleasure it was to her to have her there , they would be too generous to hasten her return . "
79552	79584	79549	79549	Catherine	77	" Oh ! As to _ that _ , Papa and Mamma were in no hurry at all . As long as she was happy , they would always be satisfied . "
79585	79602	79549	79549	Catherine	77	" Then why , might she ask , in such a hurry herself to leave them ? "
79603	79614	79549	79549	Catherine	77	" Oh ! Because she had been there so long . "
79615	79638	79549	79549	Catherine	77	" Nay , if you can use such a word , I can urge you no farther . If you think it long "
79639	79663	79549	79549	Catherine	77	" Oh ! No , I do not indeed . For my own pleasure , I could stay with you as long again . "
79999	80009	80042	80042	him	427	" Good heaven ! What can be the matter ? "
80449	80461	80463	80463	Eleanor	145	" My dear Catherine , you must not you must not indeed "
80469	80493	80463	80463	Eleanor	145	" I am quite well . This kindness distracts me I can not bear it I come to you on such an errand ! "
80494	80500	80535	80535	she	77	" Errand ! To me ! "
80501	80516	80463	80463	Eleanor	145	" How shall I tell you ! Oh ! How shall I tell you ! "
80538	80545	80535	80535	she	77	" Tis a messenger from Woodston ! "
80546	80553	80555	80555	Eleanor	145	" You are mistaken , indeed , "
80563	80577	80578	80578	Her	77	" it is no one from Woodston . It is my father himself . "
80655	80814	80633	80633	Eleanor	145	" You are too good , I am sure , to think the worse of me for the part I am obliged to perform . I am indeed a most unwilling messenger . After what has so lately passed , so lately been settled between us how joyfully , how thankfully on my side ! as to your continuing here as I hoped for many , many weeks longer , how can I tell you that your kindness is not to be accepted and that the happiness your company has hitherto given us is to be repaid by But I must not trust myself with words . My dear Catherine , we are to part . My father has recollected an engagement that takes our whole family away on Monday . We are going to Lord Longtown s , near Hereford , for a fortnight . Explanation and apology are equally impossible . I can not attempt either . "
80815	80820	80822	80822	Catherine	77	" My dear Eleanor , "
80833	80917	80822	80822	Catherine	77	" do not be so distressed . A second engagement must give way to a first . I am very , very sorry we are to part so soon , and so suddenly too ; but I am not offended , indeed I am not . I can finish my visit here , you know , at any time ; or I hope you will come to me . Can you , when you return from this lord s , come to Fullerton ? "
80918	80929	80633	80633	Eleanor	145	" It will not be in my power , Catherine . "
80930	80938	80822	80822	Catherine	77	" Come when you can , then . "
80961	81070	80955	80955	she	77	" Monday so soon as Monday ; and you _ all _ go . Well , I am certain of I shall be able to take leave , however . I need not go till just before you do , you know . Do not be distressed , Eleanor , I can go on Monday very well . My father and mother s having no notice of it is of very little consequence . The general will send a servant with me , I dare say , half the way and then I shall soon be at Salisbury , and then I am only nine miles from home . "
81071	81153	80822	80822	Catherine	77	" Ah , Catherine ! Were it settled so , it would be somewhat less intolerable , though in such common attentions you would have received but half what you ought . But how can I tell you ? tomorrow morning is fixed for your leaving us , and not even the hour is left to your choice ; the very carriage is ordered , and will be here at seven o clock , and no servant will be offered you . "
81162	81326	81154	81154	Catherine	77	" I could hardly believe my senses , when I heard it ; and no displeasure , no resentment that you can feel at this moment , however justly great , can be more than I myself but I must not talk of what I felt . Oh ! That I could suggest anything in extenuation ! Good God ! What will your father and mother say ! After courting you from the protection of real friends to this almost double distance from your home , to have you driven out of the house , without the considerations even of decent civility ! Dear , dear Catherine , in being the bearer of such a message , I seem guilty myself of all its insult ; yet , I trust you will acquit me , for you must have been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress of it , that my real power is nothing . "
81327	81334	81336	81336	Catherine	77	" Have I offended the general ? "
81342	81445	81154	81154	Catherine	77	" Alas ! For my feelings as a daughter , all that I know , all that I answer for , is that you can have given him no just cause of offence . He certainly is greatly , very greatly discomposed ; I have seldom seen him more so . His temper is not happy , and something has now occurred to ruffle it in an uncommon degree ; some disappointment , some vexation , which just at this moment seems important , but which I can hardly suppose you to have any concern in , for how is it possible ? "
81470	81475	81477	81477	she	77	" I am sure , "
81479	81544	81477	81477	she	77	" I am very sorry if I have offended him . It was the last thing I would willingly have done . But do not be unhappy , Eleanor . An engagement , you know , must be kept . I am only sorry it was not recollected sooner , that I might have written home . But it is of very little consequence . "
81545	81640	81729	81729	Catherine	77	" I hope , I earnestly hope , that to your real safety it will be of none ; but to everything else it is of the greatest consequence : to comfort , appearance , propriety , to your family , to the world . Were your friends , the Allens , still in Bath , you might go to them with comparative ease ; a few hours would take you there ; but a journey of seventy miles , to be taken post by you , at your age , alone , unattended ! "
81641	81690	81477	81477	she	77	" Oh , the journey is nothing . Do not think about that . And if we are to part , a few hours sooner or later , you know , makes no difference . I can be ready by seven . Let me be called in time . "
81719	81728	81716	81716	her	145	" I shall see you in the morning . "
82676	82687	82688	82688	she	145	" You _ must _ write to me , Catherine , "
82691	82805	82688	82688	she	145	" you _ must _ let me hear from you as soon as possible . Till I know you to be safe at home , I shall not have an hour s comfort . For _ one _ letter , at all risks , all hazards , I must entreat . Let me have the satisfaction of knowing that you are safe at Fullerton , and have found your family well , and then , till I can ask for your correspondence as I ought to do , I will not expect more . Direct to me at Lord Longtown s , and , I must ask it , under cover to Alice . "
82806	82843	82905	82905	she	77	" No , Eleanor , if you are not allowed to receive a letter from me , I am sure I had better not write . There can be no doubt of my getting home safe . "
82848	82881	82844	82844	Eleanor	145	" I can not wonder at your feelings . I will not importune you . I will trust to your own kindness of heart when I am at a distance from you . "
82909	82923	82905	82905	she	77	" Oh , Eleanor , I _ will _ write to you indeed . "
83155	83164	83139	83139	she	77	" her kind remembrance for her absent friend . "
84988	85005	85010	85010	their	1925	" it was a strange business , and that he must be a very strange man , "
85033	85047	85049	85050	her mother	194	" My dear , you give yourself a great deal of needless trouble , "
85054	85068	85049	85050	her mother	194	" depend upon it , it is something not at all worth understanding . "
85069	85085	85087	85087	Sarah	80	" I can allow for his wishing Catherine away , when he recollected this engagement , "
85089	85097	85087	85087	Sarah	80	" but why not do it civilly ? "
85098	85107	85109	85110	Mrs. Morland	82	" I am sorry for the young people , "
85112	85150	85151	85151	Catherine	77	" they must have a sad time of it ; but as for anything else , it is no matter now ; Catherine is safe at home , and our comfort does not depend upon General Tilney . "
85154	85157	85159	85161	her philosophic mother	1935	" Well , "
85163	85270	85159	85161	her philosophic mother	1935	" I am glad I did not know of your journey at the time ; but now it is all over , perhaps there is no great harm done . It is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves ; and you know , my dear Catherine , you always were a sad little scatter - brained creature ; but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you , with so much changing of chaises and so forth ; and I hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets . "
85665	85673	85675	85676	Mrs. Morland	82	" This has been a strange acquaintance , "
85684	85750	85675	85676	Mrs. Morland	82	" soon made and soon ended . I am sorry it happens so , for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people ; and you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella . Ah ! Poor James ! Well , we must live and learn ; and the next new friends you make I hope will be better worth keeping . "
85758	85769	85751	85751	Catherine	77	" No friend can be better worth keeping than Eleanor . "
85770	85822	85675	85676	Mrs. Morland	82	" If so , my dear , I dare say you will meet again some time or other ; do not be uneasy . It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in the course of a few years ; and then what a pleasure it will be ! "
85982	85989	85991	85991	she	82	" We are sorry for him , "
85993	86095	85991	85991	she	82	" but otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off ; for it could not be a desirable thing to have him engaged to a girl whom we had not the smallest acquaintance with , and who was so entirely without fortune ; and now , after such behaviour , we can not think at all well of her . Just at present it comes hard to poor James ; but that will not last forever ; and I dare say he will be a discreeter man all his life , for the foolishness of his first choice . "
86301	86311	86313	86313	she	77	" Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening , "
86315	86416	86313	86313	she	77	" She travelled all the way post by herself , and knew nothing of coming till Saturday night ; for General Tilney , from some odd fancy or other , all of a sudden grew tired of having her there , and almost turned her out of the house . Very unfriendly , certainly ; and he must be a very odd man ; but we are so glad to have her amongst us again ! And it is a great comfort to find that she is not a poor helpless creature , but can shift very well for herself . "
86473	86482	86464	86464	hers	91	" I really have not patience with the general "
86492	86502	86464	86464	hers	91	" I really have not patience with the general , "
86548	86646	86544	86544	she	91	" Only think , my dear , of my having got that frightful great rent in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended , before I left Bath , that one can hardly see where it was . I must show it you some day or other . Bath is a nice place , Catherine , after all . I assure you I did not above half like coming away . Mrs. Thorpe s being there was such a comfort to us , was not it ? You know , you and I were quite forlorn at first . "
86647	86659	86661	86661	Catherine	77	" Yes , but _ that _ did not last long , "
86680	86747	86544	86544	she	91	" Very true : we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe , and then we wanted for nothing . My dear , do not you think these silk gloves wear very well ? I put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms , you know , and I have worn them a great deal since . Do you remember that evening ? "
86748	86756	86544	86544	she	91	" Do I ! Oh ! Perfectly . "
86757	86813	86544	86544	she	91	" It was very agreeable , was not it ? Mr. Tilney drank tea with us , and I always thought him a great addition , he is so very agreeable . I have a notion you danced with him , but am not quite sure . I remember I had my favourite gown on . "
86834	86900	86829	86830	Mrs. Allen	91	" I really have not patience with the general ! Such an agreeable , worthy man as he seemed to be ! I do not suppose , Mrs. Morland , you ever saw a better - bred man in your life . His lodgings were taken the very day after he left them , Catherine . But no wonder ; Milsom Street , you know . "
87281	87364	87270	87270	she	82	" My dear Catherine , I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady . I do not know when poor Richard s cravats would be done , if he had no friend but you . Your head runs too much upon Bath ; but there is a time for everything a time for balls and plays , and a time for work . You have had a long run of amusement , and now you must try to be useful . "
87380	87390	87365	87365	Catherine	77	" her head did not run upon Bath much . "
87391	87426	87368	87368	her	77	" Then you are fretting about General Tilney , and that is very simple of you ; for ten to one whether you ever see him again . You should never fret about trifles . "
87431	87514	87365	87365	Catherine	77	" I hope , my Catherine , you are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as Northanger . That would be turning your visit into an evil indeed . Wherever you are you should always be contented , but especially at home , because there you must spend the most of your time . I did not quite like , at breakfast , to hear you talk so much about the French bread at Northanger . "
87515	87538	87365	87365	Catherine	77	" I am sure I do not care about the bread . It is all the same to me what I eat . "
87539	87598	87365	87365	Catherine	77	" There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much such a subject , about young girls that have been spoilt for home by great acquaintance The Mirror , I think . I will look it out for you some day or other , because I am sure it will do you good . "
87837	87842	87823	87823	he	1970	" Mr. Henry Tilney , "
88295	88307	88311	88311	Sarah	80	" You may see the house from this window , sir , "
90483	90497	90499	90500	her mother	194	" Catherine would make a sad , heedless young housekeeper to be sure , "
91040	91050	91036	91036	his	98	" to be a fool if he liked it ! "
91206	91210	91202	91202	he	783	" Your Ladyship ! "
