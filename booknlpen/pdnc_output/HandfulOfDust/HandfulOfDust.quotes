8	13	248	248	his	175	" Was anyone hurt ? "
14	24	26	27	Mrs Beaver	170	" No one , I am thankful to say , "
29	142	26	27	Mrs Beaver	170	" except two housemaids who lost their heads and jumped through a glass roof into the paved court . They were in no danger . The fire never reached the bedrooms , I am afraid . Still , they are bound to need doing up , everything black with smoke and drenched in water and luckily they had that old - fashioned sort of extinguisher that ruins _ everything _ . One really can not complain . The chief rooms were _ completely _ gutted and everything was insured . Sylvia Newport knows the people . I must get on to them this morning before that ghoul Mrs Shutter snaps them up . "
172	212	248	249	his mother	377	" Heavens , how nasty this stuff is . I wish you 'd take to it , John . You 're looking so tired lately . I do n't know how I should get through my day without it . "
213	229	261	262	his father	380	" But , mumsy , I have n't as much to do as you have . "
230	238	248	249	his mother	377	" That 's true , my son . "
686	692	675	675	she	170	" What was your evening ? "
693	731	675	675	she	170	" Audrey rang up at eight and asked me to dinner . Ten of us at the Embassy , rather dreary . Afterwards we all went on to a party given by a woman called de Trommet . "
732	785	675	675	she	170	" I know who you mean . American . She has n't paid for the toile - de - jouy chair covers we made her last April . I had a dull time too ; did n't hold a card all the evening and came away four pounds ten to the bad . "
786	790	675	675	she	170	" Poor mumsy . "
791	816	675	675	she	170	" I 'm lunching at Viola Chasm 's . What are you doing ? I did n't order anything here , I 'm afraid . "
817	831	675	675	she	170	" Nothing so far . I can always go round to Bratt 's . "
832	865	675	675	she	170	" But that 's so expensive . I 'm sure if we ask Chambers she 'll be able to get you something in . I thought you were certain to be out . "
866	880	675	675	she	170	" Well , I still may be . It is n't twelve yet . "
913	950	953	953	he	404	" John , darling , there 's been a muddle and Sonia has arrived without Reggie . Could you be an angel and help me out ? Only be quick , because we 're going in now "
995	1006	978	979	his mother	377	" Where are you going for the week - end ? "
1007	1010	978	979	his mother	377	" Hetton . "
1011	1019	978	979	his mother	377	" Who 's that ? I forget . "
1020	1024	978	979	his mother	377	" Tony Last . "
1025	1049	978	979	his mother	377	" Yes , of course . She 's lovely , he 's rather a stick . I did n't know you knew them . "
1050	1073	978	979	his mother	377	" Well , I do n't really . Tony asked me in Bratt 's the other night . He may have forgotten . "
1074	1116	978	979	his mother	377	" Send a telegram and remind them . It is far better than ringing up . It gives them less chance to make excuses . Send it to - morrow just before you start . They owe me for a table . "
1117	1123	978	979	his mother	377	" What 's their dossier ? "
1124	1251	978	979	his mother	377	" I used to see her quite a lot before she married . She was Brenda Rex , Lord St Cloud 's daughter , very fair , underwater look . People used to be mad about her when she was a girl . Everyone thought she would marry Jock Grant - Menzies at one time . Wasted on Tony Last , he 's a prig . I should say it was time she began to be bored . They 've been married five or six years . Quite well off but everything goes in keeping up the house . I 've never seen it but I 've an idea it 's huge and quite hideous . They 've got one child at least , perhaps more . "
1252	1266	978	979	his mother	377	" Mumsy , you are wonderful . I believe you know about everyone . "
1267	1285	978	979	his mother	377	" It 's a great help . All a matter of paying attention while people are talking . "
1398	1404	1405	1405	she	170	" That 's the way , "
1408	1428	1405	1405	she	170	" you are doing very nicely , Joyce . I 'll soon get you on to something more interesting . "
1429	1436	1395	1396	a man	414	" Thank you , Mrs Beaver . "
1499	1521	1559	1559	her	192	" Mr Beaver ? Will you please hold the line , sir , Mrs Tipping would like to speak to you . "
1565	1624	1561	1561	Someone	419	" Oh , Mr Beaver , I _ am _ so sorry to trouble you . I was wondering , could you _ possibly _ tell me the name of the young man you introduced to me last night at Madame de Trommet 's ? The one with the reddish moustache . I think he was in Parliament . "
1625	1635	1559	1559	her	192	" I expect you mean Jock Grant - Menzies . "
1636	1660	1561	1561	Someone	419	" Yes , that 's the name . You do n't by any chance know where I can find him , do you ? "
1661	1699	1559	1559	her	192	" He 's in the book but I do n't suppose he 'll be at home now . You might be able to get him at Bratt 's at about one . He 's almost always there . "
1700	1740	1561	1561	Someone	419	" Jock Grant - Menzies , Bratt 's Club . Thank you so _ very _ much . It _ is _ kind of you . I hope you will come and see me some day . _ Good_-bye . "
1981	1993	1972	1976	The men at the bar	436	" Hullo , Jock old boy , what are you drinking ? "
1999	2005	1972	1976	The men at the bar	436	" Well , old boy ? "
2059	2065	2066	2066	he	187	" Well , old boy , "
2069	2075	2066	2066	he	187	" What are you drinking ? "
2076	2081	2082	2082	Beaver	170	" Nothing so far . "
2088	2104	2082	2082	Beaver	170	" But I think it 's time I had one . Brandy and ginger ale . "
2114	2130	2105	2105	Jock	187	" Who was the old girl you wished on me at that party last night ? "
2131	2138	2108	2109	the barman	439	" She 's called Mrs Tipping . "
2139	2170	2105	2105	Jock	187	" I thought she might be . That explains it . They gave me a message downstairs that someone with a name like that wanted me to lunch with her . "
2171	2176	2108	2109	the barman	439	" Are you going ? "
2177	2203	2105	2105	Jock	187	" No , I 'm no good at lunch parties . Besides , I decided when I got up that I 'd have oysters here . "
2211	2230	2204	2205	The barman	439	" Mr Beaver , sir , there 's ten shillings against you in my books for last month . "
2231	2247	2204	2205	The barman	439	" Ah , thank you , Macdougal , remind me some time , will you ? "
2248	2254	2204	2205	The barman	439	" Very good , sir . "
2258	2268	2255	2255	Beaver	191	" I 'm going to Hetton to - morrow . "
2269	2281	2204	2205	The barman	439	" Are you now ? Give Tony and Brenda my love . "
2282	2288	2255	2255	Beaver	191	" What 's the form ? "
2289	2295	2204	2205	The barman	439	" Very quiet and enjoyable . "
2296	2301	2255	2255	Beaver	191	" No paper games ? "
2302	2325	2204	2205	The barman	439	" Oh , no , nothing like that . A certain amount of bridge and backgammon and low poker with the neighbours . "
2326	2329	2255	2255	Beaver	191	" Comfortable ? "
2330	2353	2204	2205	The barman	439	" Not bad . Plenty to drink . Rather a shortage of bathrooms . You can stay in bed all the morning . "
2354	2361	2255	2255	Beaver	191	" I 've never met Brenda . "
2362	2416	2204	2205	The barman	439	" You 'll like her , she 's a grand girl . I often think Tony Last 's one of the happiest men I know . He 's got just enough money , loves the place , one son he 's crazy about , devoted wife , not a worry in the world . "
2417	2446	2255	2255	Beaver	191	" Most enviable . You do n't know anyone else who 's going , do you ? I was wondering if I could get a lift down there . "
2447	2463	2204	2205	The barman	439	" I do n't , I 'm afraid . It 's quite easy by train . "
2464	2475	2255	2255	Beaver	191	" Yes , but it 's more pleasant by road . "
2476	2480	2204	2205	The barman	439	" And cheaper . "
2481	2504	2255	2255	Beaver	191	" Yes , and cheaper I suppose ... well , I 'm going down to lunch . You wo n't have another ? "
2510	2518	2533	2533	Macdougal	194	" Yes , I think I will . "
2519	2532	2533	2533	Macdougal	194	" Oh , all right . Macdougal . Two more , please . "
2536	2546	2533	2533	Macdougal	194	" Shall I book them to you , sir ? "
2547	2554	2533	2533	Macdougal	194	" Yes , if you will . "
2564	2573	2561	2561	Jock	187	" I made Beaver pay for a drink . "
2574	2582	2533	2533	Macdougal	194	" He ca n't have liked that . "
2583	2595	2561	2561	Jock	187	" He nearly died of it . Know anything about pigs ? "
2596	2601	2533	2533	Macdougal	194	" No . Why . "
2602	2616	2561	2561	Jock	187	" Only that they keep writing to me about them from my constituency . "
2652	2675	2633	2633	he	191	" Mrs Tipping rang up a few minutes ago and asked whether you could come to luncheon with her to - day . "
2676	2701	2633	2633	he	191	" Will you ring her up and say that I shall be delighted to , but that I may be a few minutes late ? "
2867	3110	2860	2861	Mr Pecksniff	196	" designs for an orphanage . But there was not a glazed brick or encaustic tile that was not dear to Tony 's heart . In some ways , he knew , it was not convenient to run ; but what big house was ? It was not altogether amenable to modern ideas of comfort ; he had many small improvements in mind , which would be put into effect as soon as the death duties were paid off . But the general aspect and atmosphere of the place ; the line of its battlements against the sky ; the central clock tower where quarterly chimes disturbed all but the heaviest sleepers ; the ecclesiastical gloom of the great hall , its ceiling groined and painted in diapers of red and gold , supported on shafts of polished granite with vine - wreathed capitals , half - lit by day through lancet windows of armorial stained glass , at night by a vast gasolier of brass and wrought iron , wired now and fitted with twenty electric bulbs ; the blasts of hot air that rose suddenly at one 's feet , through grills of cast - iron trefoils from the antiquated heating apparatus below ; the cavernous chill of the more remote corridors where , economizing in coke , he had had the pipes shut off ; the dining - hall with its hammer - beam roof and pitch - pine minstrels "

3762	3773	3748	3748	he	184	" About a quarter of an hour ago , sir . "
3774	3784	3748	3748	he	184	" Then I 'll have breakfast in her room . "

3931	3935	3928	3928	she	233	" Anything interesting ? "
3944	3982	3928	3928	she	233	" No . Mama wants nanny to send John 's measurements . She 's knitting him something for Christmas . And the mayor wants me to open something next month . I need n't , need I ? "
3983	4002	3928	3928	she	233	" I think you 'd better , we have n't done anything for him for a long time . "
4003	4040	3928	3928	she	233	" Well , you must write the speech . I 'm getting too old for the girlish one I used to give them all . And Angela says , will we stay for the New Year ? "
4041	4055	3928	3928	she	233	" That 's easy . Not on her life , we wo n't . "
4056	4068	3928	3928	she	233	" I guessed not ... though it sounds an amusing party . "
4069	4083	3928	3928	she	233	" You go if you like . I ca n't possibly get away . "
4084	4095	3928	3928	she	233	" That 's all right . I knew it would be "
4097	4104	3928	3928	she	233	" before I opened the letter . "
4105	4128	3928	3928	she	233	" Well , what sort of pleasure can there be in going all the way to Yorkshire in the middle of winter ? "
4129	4170	3928	3928	she	233	" Darling , do n't be cross . I know we are n't going . I 'm not making a thing about it . I just thought it might be fun to eat someone else 's food for a bit . "
4219	4239	4216	4216	he	481	" As a matter of fact I probably _ can _ manage to get away that week - end . "
4240	4252	4216	4216	he	481	" Darling , are you sure you would n't hate it ? "
4253	4258	4216	4216	he	481	" I daresay not . "
4272	4343	4345	4345	she	233	" Reggie 's been making another speech ... There 's such an extraordinary picture of Babe and Jock ... a woman in America has had twins by two different husbands . Would you have thought that possible ? ... Two more chaps in gas ovens ... a little girl has been strangled in a cemetery with a bootlace ... that play we went to about a farm is coming off . "
4356	4376	4351	4351	He	481	" I do n't believe you 're listening . Why does n't Sylvia want Rupert to get the letter ? "
4377	4393	4345	4345	she	233	" Eh ? Oh well , you see , she does n't really trust Rupert . "
4394	4420	4351	4351	He	481	" I _ knew _ it . There 's no such character as Rupert in the story . I shall never read to you again . "
4421	4434	4345	4345	she	233	" Well , to tell you the truth I was just thinking . "
4435	4438	4351	4351	He	481	" Oh . "
4439	4466	4345	4345	she	233	" I was thinking how delightful it is , that it 's Saturday morning and we have n't got anyone coming for the week - end . "

4481	4513	4351	4351	He	481	" Well , it sometimes seems to me rather pointless keeping up a house this size if we do n't now and then ask some other people to stay in it . "
4514	4599	4601	4601	Tony	184	" _ Pointless ? _ I ca n't think what you mean . I do n't keep up this house to be a hostel for a lot of bores to come and gossip in . We 've always lived here and I hope John will be able to keep it on after me . One has a duty towards one 's employees , and towards the place too . It 's a definite part of English life which would be a serious loss if ... "

5510	5544	5459	5459	Nanny	217	" Short step my grandmother . You just opened your bloody legs and took an arser . Keep hold on to the reins next time . You can lose a hunt that way . "
5580	5600	5459	5459	Nanny	217	" There , how did that feel ? You just skimmed over like a swallow . Try it again ? "
5638	5651	5635	5635	Nanny	217	" Oh dear , look at all the mud on your coat . "

5704	5741	5652	5652	Ben	212	" That 's not for me to say . You must ask nanny . Tell you what though , the grey carthorse has got worms . Would you like to see me give him a pill ? "
5742	5753	5459	5459	Nanny	217	" Oh yes ; please , nanny , may I ? "

6085	6097	5954	5954	his	174	" Oh , I could n't repeat it , my lady . "
6098	6119	6065	6065	Brenda	233	" Nonsense , you must tell me . Otherwise I shall be thinking it something far worse than it was . "
6120	6139	5954	5954	his	174	" It could n't have been worse ... he called me a silly old tart , my lady . "
6148	6155	6140	6140	Brenda	233	" He said _ that _ ? "
6156	6177	5954	5954	his	174	" Repeatedly . He danced in front of me all the way up the drive , _ singing it _ . "
6178	6192	6140	6140	Brenda	233	" I see ... well , you were quite right to tell me . "
6193	6251	5954	5954	his	174	" Thank you , my lady , and since we are talking about it I think I ought to say that it seems to me that Ben Hacket is making the child go ahead far too quickly with his riding . It 's very dangerous . He had what might have been a serious fall this morning . "
6252	6267	6140	6140	Brenda	233	" All right , nanny , I 'll speak to Mr Last about it . "
6282	6285	6286	6286	she	517	" Darling , "
6289	6310	6286	6286	she	517	" _ you _ must speak to him . You 're so much better at being serious than I am . "

6335	6348	6332	6332	John	174	" and anyway it 's a word Ben often uses about people . "
6349	6359	6286	6286	she	517	" Well , he 's got no business to . "
6360	6380	6332	6332	John	174	" I like Ben more than anyone in the world . And I should think he 's cleverer too . "
6381	6396	6286	6286	she	517	" Now , you know you do n't like him more than your mother . "
6397	6407	6332	6332	John	174	" Yes I do . _ Far _ more . "
6430	6471	6408	6408	Tony	219	" Now listen , John . It was very wrong of you to call nanny a silly old tart . First , because it was unkind to her . Think of all the things she does for you every day . "
6472	6478	6332	6332	John	174	" She 's paid to . "
6479	6568	6408	6408	Tony	219	" Be quiet . And secondly , because you were using a word which people of your age and class do not use . Poor people use certain expressions which gentlemen do not . You are a gentleman . When you grow up all this house and lots of other things besides will belong to you . You must learn to speak like someone who is going to have these things and to be considerate to people less fortunate than you , particularly women . Do you understand ? "
6569	6577	6332	6332	John	174	" Is Ben less fortunate than me ? "
6578	6611	6408	6408	Tony	219	" That has nothing to do with it . Now you are to go upstairs and say you are sorry to nanny and promise never to use that word about anyone again . "
6612	6616	6332	6332	John	174	" All right . "
6617	6637	6408	6408	Tony	219	" And because you have been so naughty to - day you are not to ride to - morrow . "
6638	6645	6332	6332	John	174	" To - morrow 's Sunday . "
6646	6653	6408	6408	Tony	219	" Well , next day then . "
6654	6658	6332	6332	John	174	" But you said "
6662	6672	6408	6408	Tony	219	" . It is n't fair to change now . "
6673	6718	6408	6408	Tony	219	" John , do n't argue . If you are not careful I shall send Thunderclap back to Uncle Reggie and say that I find you are not a good enough boy to keep it . You would n't like that , would you ? "
6719	6741	6408	6408	Tony	219	" What would Uncle Reggie do with her ? She could n't carry him . Besides , he 's usually abroad . "
6742	6775	6408	6408	Tony	219	" He 'd give her to some other little boy . Anyway , that 's got nothing to do with it . Now run off and say you 're sorry to nanny . "
6782	6800	6779	6779	John	174	" It 's all right riding on Monday , is n't it ? You did _ say _ "
6804	6806	6408	6408	Tony	219	" . "
6807	6814	6408	6408	Tony	219	" Yes , I suppose so . "
6815	6846	6408	6408	Tony	219	" Hooray . Thunderclap went very well to - day . We jumped a big post and rail . She refused first time but went like a bird after that . "
6847	6854	6408	6408	Tony	219	" Did n't you come off ? "
6855	6878	6408	6408	Tony	219	" Yes , once . It was n't Thunderclap 's fault . I just opened my bloody legs and cut an arser . "
6884	6891	6892	6892	Brenda	233	" How did the lecture go ? "
6895	6901	6408	6408	Tony	219	" Bad . Rotten bad . "
6902	6913	6408	6408	Tony	219	" The trouble is that nanny 's jealous of Ben . "
6914	6926	6408	6408	Tony	219	" I 'm not sure we sha n't both be soon . "
7141	7143	7137	7137	their	519	" joker "
7145	7158	7137	7137	their	519	" I 'm sure it does me a great deal of good . "
7159	7208	7137	7137	their	519	" Yes , darling , and when we get tired of it we might try an alphabetical diet , having things beginning with a different letter every day . J would be hungry , nothing but jam and jellied eels ... What are your plans for the afternoon ? "
7209	7263	7137	7137	their	519	" Nothing much . Carter 's coming up at five to go over a few things . I may go to Pigstanton after luncheon . I think we 've got a tenant for Lowater Farm but it 's been empty some time and I ought to see how much needs doing to it . "
7264	7269	7137	7137	their	519	" I would n't say "
7271	7277	7137	7137	their	519	" to going in to the "
7279	7281	7137	7137	their	519	" . "
7282	7294	7137	7137	their	519	" All right . I can easily leave Lowater till Monday . "
7295	7307	7137	7137	their	519	" And we might go to Woolworth 's afterwards , eh ? "
7372	7375	7367	7367	Tony	219	" Hell . "
7376	7379	7331	7347	a pair who were pre - eminently successful in solving the problem of getting along well together	527	" Badders ? "
7380	7391	7367	7367	Tony	219	" Something too horrible has happened . Look at this . "
7395	7407	7392	7392	Brenda	233	" _ Arriving 3.18 so looking forward visit . Beaver . _ "
7411	7416	7392	7392	Brenda	233	" What 's Beaver ? "
7417	7424	7331	7347	a pair who were pre - eminently successful in solving the problem of getting along well together	527	" It 's a young man . "
7425	7431	7392	7392	Brenda	233	" That sounds all right . "
7432	7445	7331	7347	a pair who were pre - eminently successful in solving the problem of getting along well together	527	" Oh no it 's not . Wait till you see him . "
7446	7461	7392	7392	Brenda	233	" What 's he coming here for ? Did you ask him to stay ? "
7462	7504	7331	7347	a pair who were pre - eminently successful in solving the problem of getting along well together	527	" I suppose I did in a vague kind of way . I went to Bratt 's one evening and he was the only chap there so we had some drinks and he said something about wanting to see the house ... "
7505	7512	7392	7392	Brenda	233	" I suppose you were tight . "
7513	7528	7331	7347	a pair who were pre - eminently successful in solving the problem of getting along well together	527	" Not really , but I never thought he 'd hold it against me . "
7529	7561	7392	7392	Brenda	233	" Well , it jolly well serves you right . That 's what comes of going up to London on business and leaving me alone here ... Who is he anyway ? "
7562	7574	7331	7347	a pair who were pre - eminently successful in solving the problem of getting along well together	527	" Just a young man . His mother keeps that shop . "
7575	7597	7392	7392	Brenda	233	" I used to know her . She 's hell . Come to think of it we owe her some money . "
7598	7614	7331	7347	a pair who were pre - eminently successful in solving the problem of getting along well together	527	" Look here , we must put a call through and say we 're ill . "
7615	7664	7392	7392	Brenda	233	" Too late , he 's in the train now , recklessly mixing starch and protein in the Great Western three and sixpenny lunch ... Anyway , he can go into Galahad . No one who sleeps there ever comes again -- the bed 's agony I believe . "
7665	7686	7331	7347	a pair who were pre - eminently successful in solving the problem of getting along well together	527	" What on earth are we going to do with him ? It 's too late to get anyone else . "
7687	7749	7392	7392	Brenda	233	" You go over to Pigstanton . I 'll look after him . It 's easier alone . We can take him to the movies to - night , and to - morrow he can see over the house . If we 're lucky he may go up by the evening train . Does he have to work on Monday morning ? "
7750	7756	7331	7347	a pair who were pre - eminently successful in solving the problem of getting along well together	527	" I should n't know . "
7874	7957	7871	7871	She	533	" It is nice that you were able to come . I must break it to you at once that we have n't got a party . I 'm afraid you 'll be terribly bored ... Tony had to go out but he 'll be in soon ... was the train crowded ? It often is on Saturdays ... would you like to come outside ? It 'll be dark soon and we might get some of the sun while we can ... "
8096	8104	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" Polly Cockpurse is having one soon . "
8105	8111	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" Yes , I know . "
8112	8120	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" Are you coming up for it ? "
8121	8134	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" I do n't expect so . We never go anywhere nowadays . "
8183	8192	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" What 's happening to Mary and Simon ? "
8193	8206	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" Oh , did n't you know ? That 's broken up . "
8207	8210	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" When ? "
8211	8219	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" It began in Austria this summer ... "
8220	8225	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" And Billy Angmering ? "
8226	8241	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" He 's having a terrific walk out with a girl called Sheila Shrub . "
8242	8249	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" And the Helm - Hubbards ? "
8250	8284	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" That marriage is n't going too well either ... Daisy has started a new restaurant . It 's going very well ... and there 's a new night club called the Warren ... "
8285	8289	8290	8290	Brenda	233	" Dear me , "
8295	8304	8290	8290	Brenda	233	" What fun everyone seems to be having . "
8318	8324	8325	8325	he	174	" How do you do ? "
8328	8354	8325	8325	he	174	" I did n't know you were coming . Daddy said he had a week - end to himself for once . Do you hunt ? "
8355	8362	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" Not for a long time . "
8363	8386	8325	8325	he	174	" Ben says it stands to reason everyone ought to hunt who can afford to , for the good of the country . "
8387	8395	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" Perhaps I ca n't afford to . "
8396	8401	8325	8325	he	174	" Are you poor ? "
8402	8416	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" Please , Mr Beaver , you must n't let him bore you . "
8417	8423	8325	8325	he	174	" Yes , very poor . "
8424	8432	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" Poor enough to call people tarts ? "
8433	8440	8325	8325	he	174	" Yes , quite poor enough . "
8441	8448	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" How did you get poor ? "
8449	8455	8325	8325	he	174	" I always have been . "
8456	8459	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" Oh . "
8467	8478	8460	8460	John	174	" The grey horse at the farm has got worms . "
8479	8485	8075	8079	the agent in his study	548	" How do you know ? "
8486	8503	8460	8460	John	174	" Ben says so . Besides , you 've only got to look at his dung . "
8504	8508	8510	8510	Brenda	233	" Oh dear , "
8512	8525	8510	8510	Brenda	233	" what would nanny say if she heard you talking like that ? "
8526	8532	8325	8325	he	174	" How old are you ? "
8533	8543	8510	8510	Brenda	233	" Twenty - five . How old are you ? "
8544	8550	8325	8325	he	174	" What do you do ? "
8551	8555	8510	8510	Brenda	233	" Nothing much . "
8556	8580	8325	8325	he	174	" Well , if I was you I 'd do something and earn some money . Then you 'd be able to hunt . "
8581	8593	8510	8510	Brenda	233	" But I should n't be able to call people tarts . "
8594	8605	8325	8325	he	174	" I do n't see any point in that anyway . "
8623	8638	8620	8620	John	174	" I think Mr Beaver 's a very silly man , do n't you ? "
8639	8648	8650	8650	nanny	2412	" I 'm sure I do n't know , "
8652	8666	8620	8620	John	174	" I think he 's the silliest man who 's ever been here . "
8667	8672	8620	8620	John	174	" Comparisons are odious . "
8673	8700	8701	8701	John	174	" There just is n't anything nice about him . He 's got a silly voice and a silly face , silly eyes and silly nose , "
8712	8725	8701	8701	John	174	" silly feet and silly toes , silly head and silly clothes ... "
8726	8734	8736	8736	nanny	2412	" Now you eat up your supper , "
8771	8793	8754	8754	she	233	" I feel rather guilty about Beaver -- going off and leaving you like that . You were heavenly to him . "
8797	8811	8794	8794	She	233	" Oh , it was n't bad really . He 's rather pathetic . "
9057	9064	9118	9118	he	191	" I hope you sleep well . "
9065	9072	9118	9118	he	191	" I 'm sure I shall . "
9073	9083	9118	9118	he	191	" D'you like to be called in the morning ? "
9084	9089	9118	9118	he	191	" May I ring ? "
9090	9098	9118	9118	he	191	" Certainly . Got everything you want ? "
9099	9107	9118	9118	he	191	" Yes , thanks . Good night . "
9108	9112	9118	9118	he	191	" Good night . "
9121	9131	9118	9118	he	191	" You know , I feel awful about Beaver . "
9132	9140	9142	9142	Brenda	233	" Oh , Beaver 's all right , "
9638	9646	9617	9617	he	219	" I hope you slept all right ? "
9647	9650	9652	9652	Beaver	191	" Beautifully , "
9664	9702	9617	9617	he	219	" I 'm so glad . I always sleep well here myself . I say , I do n't like the look of that train guide . I hope you were n't thinking of leaving us yet ? "
9703	9720	9617	9617	he	219	" Alas , I 've got to get up to - night , I 'm afraid . "
9721	9766	9617	9617	he	219	" Too bad . I 've hardly seen you . The trains are n't very good on Sundays . The best leaves at five - forty - five and gets up about nine . It stops a lot and there 's no restaurant car . "
9767	9773	9617	9617	he	219	" That 'll do fine . "
9774	9785	9617	9617	he	219	" Sure you ca n't stay until to - morrow ? "
9786	9790	9617	9617	he	219	" Quite sure . "
9800	9820	9617	9617	he	219	" Well , I 'm just off to church . I do n't suppose you 'd care to come . "
9846	9857	9617	9617	he	219	" Oh yes , I should like to very much . "
9858	9908	9617	9617	he	219	" No , really , I should n't if I were you . You would n't enjoy it . I only go because I more or less have to . You stay here . Brenda will be down directly . Ring for a drink when you feel like it . "
9909	9915	9617	9617	he	219	" Oh , all right . "
9916	9922	9617	9617	he	219	" See you later then . "
9937	9949	9950	9950	he	219	" Now I 've behaved inhospitably to that young man again , "
10095	10100	10092	10092	Tony	219	" How very sad . "
10101	10130	10092	10092	Tony	219	" Well , _ I _ thought it was sad too , but it is n't . Ben said it made him laugh fit to bust his pants . "
10210	10222	10200	10201	the organist	607	" Enter not into judgment with Thy servant , O Lord ... "
10513	10530	10531	10531	he	219	" ... And so as we stand here bareheaded at this solemn hour of the week , "
10543	10663	10534	10534	his	219	" let us remember our Gracious Queen Empress in whose service we are here , and pray that she may long be spared to send us at her bidding to do our duty in the uttermost parts of the earth ; and let us think of our dear ones far away and the homes we have left in her name , and remember that though miles of barren continent and leagues of ocean divide us , we are never so near to them as on these Sunday mornings , united with them across dune and mountain in our loyalty to our sovereign and thanksgiving for her welfare ; one with them as proud subjects of her sceptre and crown . "
10665	10669	10670	10670	e	629	" The Reverend Tendril "
10674	10680	10681	10684	a gardener 's wife	631	" igh of the Queen , "
10769	10779	10762	10762	he	219	" Lady Brenda is not ill , I hope ? "
10780	10786	10766	10767	the vicar	576	" No , nothing serious . "
10800	10808	10762	10762	he	219	" A most interesting sermon , Vicar . "
10809	10838	10762	10762	he	219	" My dear boy , I 'm delighted to hear you say so . It is one of my favourites . But have you never heard it before ? "
10839	10846	10762	10762	he	219	" No , I assure you . "
10847	10888	10889	10891	The old clergyman	640	" I have n't used it here lately . When I am asked to supply elsewhere it is the one I invariably choose . Let me see now , I always make a note of the times I use it . "
10914	11016	10889	10891	The old clergyman	640	" Ah yes , here we are . I preached it first in Jellalabad when the Coldstream Guards were there ; then I used it in the Red Sea coming home from my fourth leave ; then at Sidmouth ... Mentone ... Winchester ... to the Girl Guides at their summer rally in 1921 ... the Church Stage Guild at Leicester ... twice at Bournemouth during the winter of 1926 when poor Ada was so ill ... No , I do n't seem to have used it here since 1911 , when you would have been too young to enjoy it ... "
11036	11069	11027	11027	He	174	" ... he 'd have been all right , Ben says , if he had been able to cat the rum up , but mules ca n't cat , neither can horses ... "
11080	11116	11070	11070	Nanny	217	" How many times have I told you not to go repeating whatever Ben Hacket tells you ? Miss Tendril did n't want to hear about Peppermint . And do n't ever use that rude word "
11118	11121	11070	11070	Nanny	217	" again . "
11122	11130	11070	11070	Nanny	217	" It only means to be sick . "
11131	11143	11070	11070	Nanny	217	" Well , Miss Tendril is n't interested in being sick ... "
11316	11326	11619	11619	he	191	" I say , ca n't I carry something ? "
11327	11342	11286	11286	her	233	" No thanks , I 've got everything safe . How did you sleep ? "
11343	11346	11619	11619	he	191	" Beautifully . "
11347	11354	11286	11286	her	233	" I bet you did n't . "
11355	11366	11619	11619	he	191	" Well , I 'm not a very good sleeper . "
11367	11418	11286	11286	her	233	" Next time you come you shall have a different room . But I daresay you wo n't ever come again . People so seldom do . It is very sad because it 's such fun for us having them and we never make any new friends living down here . "
11419	11426	11619	11619	he	191	" Tony 's gone to church . "
11427	11454	11286	11286	her	233	" Yes , he likes that . He 'll be back soon . Let 's go out for a minute or two , it looks lovely . "
11475	11483	11484	11484	he	191	" ... Now cut to me again , "
11488	11575	11484	11484	he	191	" and I 'll see if it 's any clearer ... Oh yes ... there is going to be a sudden death which will cause you great pleasure and profit . In fact you are going to kill someone . I ca n't tell if it 's a man or a woman ... yes , a woman ... then you are going to go on a long journey across the sea , marry six dark men and have eleven children , grow a beard and die . "
11576	11598	11619	11619	he	191	" Beast . And all this time I 've been thinking it was serious . Hullo , Tony . Jolly church ? "
11599	11608	11484	11484	he	191	" Most enjoyable ; how about some sherry ? "
11622	11632	11619	11619	he	191	" Darling , you 're being heroic with Beaver . "
11633	11649	11619	11619	he	191	" Oh , I quite enjoy coping -- in fact I 'm bitching him rather . "
11650	11671	11619	11619	he	191	" So I saw . Well , I 'll look after him this afternoon and he 's going this evening . "
11672	11742	11619	11619	he	191	" Is he ? I 'll be quite sorry . You know that 's a difference between us , that when someone 's awful you just run away and hide , while I actually enjoy it -- making up to them and showing off to myself how well I can do it . Besides , Beaver is n't so bad . He 's quite like us in some ways . "
11743	11750	11752	11752	Tony	219	" He 's not like me , "
11759	11810	11756	11756	Tony	219	" Well , if it would really amuse you , we might go over the house . I know it is n't fashionable to like this sort of architecture now -- my Aunt Frances says it is an authentic Pecksniff -- but I think it 's good of its kind . "
12056	12078	12052	12052	Beaver	191	" The So - and - so 's have got one rather like that at Such - and - such a place "
12085	12100	12081	12081	Tony	219	" Yes , I 've seen it but I think mine is the earlier . "
12132	12135	12136	12136	she	233	" Well , "
12146	12154	12136	12136	she	233	" what did you think of it ? "
12155	12158	12081	12081	Tony	219	" Magnificent . "
12159	12173	12136	12136	she	233	" You do n't have to say that to me , you know . "
12174	12186	12081	12081	Tony	219	" Well , a lot of the things are very fine . "
12187	12201	12136	12136	she	233	" Yes , the _ things _ are all right , I suppose . "
12202	12211	12081	12081	Tony	219	" But do n't you like the house ? "
12212	12461	12136	12136	she	233	" Me ? I _ detest _ it ... at least I do n't mean that really , but I do wish sometimes that it was n't _ all _ , every bit of it , so appallingly ugly . Only I 'd die rather than say that to Tony . We could never live anywhere else , of course . He 's crazy about the place ... It 's funny . None of us minded very much when my brother Reggie sold _ our _ house -- and that was built by Vanbrugh , you know ... I suppose we 're lucky to be able to afford to keep it up at all . Do you know how much it costs just to live here ? We should be quite rich if it was n't for that . As it is we support fifteen servants indoors , besides gardeners and carpenters and a night - watchman and all the people at the farm and odd little men constantly popping in to wind the clocks and cook the accounts and clean the moat , while Tony and I have to fuss about whether it 's cheaper to take a car up to London for the night or buy an excursion ticket ... I should n't feel so badly about it if it were a really lovely house -- like my home for instance ... but of course Tony 's been brought up here and sees it all differently ... "
12468	12495	12462	12462	Tony	219	" I do n't want to seem inhospitable , but if you 're going to catch that train , you ought really to be getting ready . "
12496	12514	12553	12553	he	174	" That 's all right . I 've persuaded him to stay on till to - morrow . "
12515	12524	12462	12462	Tony	219	" If you 're sure you do n't ... "
12525	12548	12553	12553	he	174	" Splendid . I _ am _ glad . It 's beastly going up at this time , particularly by that train . "
12556	12564	12553	12553	he	174	" I thought Mr Beaver was going . "
12565	12572	12553	12553	he	174	" Not till to - morrow . "
12573	12576	12553	12553	he	174	" Oh . "
12607	12613	12604	12604	Beaver	191	" I 've thought of something "
12653	12655	12651	12651	they	670	" Analogies "
12679	12690	12707	12707	footman	674	" Do let me know when you come to London . "
12691	12699	12707	12707	footman	674	" I may be up this week . "
12743	12776	12707	12707	footman	674	" Well , that 's the last of _ him _ . You were superb , darling . I 'm sure he 's gone back thinking that you 're mad about him . "
12777	12786	12737	12737	he	219	" Oh , he was n't too awful . "
12787	12806	12707	12707	footman	674	" No . I must say he took a very intelligent interest when we went round the house . "
12823	12828	12812	12813	Mrs Beaver	170	" Who was there ? "
12829	12833	12737	12737	he	219	" No one . "
12834	12842	12812	12813	Mrs Beaver	170	" No one ? My poor boy . "
12843	12875	12737	12737	he	219	" They were n't expecting me . It was awful at first but got better . They were just as you said . She 's very charming . He scarcely spoke . "
12876	12884	12812	12813	Mrs Beaver	170	" I wish I saw her sometimes . "
12885	12895	12737	12737	he	219	" She talked of taking a flat in London . "
12896	12902	12812	12813	Mrs Beaver	170	" _ Did _ she ? "
12919	12925	12737	12737	he	219	" What does she want ? "
12926	12953	13017	13017	She	233	" Something quite simple . Two rooms and a bath . But it 's all quite vague . She has n't said anything to Tony yet . "
12954	12967	12737	12737	he	219	" I am sure I shall be able to find her something . "
13104	13109	13102	13102	them	685	" the lovely Rex sisters "
13318	13347	13268	13268	she	233	" Darling , what _ does _ the country do to you ? You look like a thousand pounds . Where _ did _ you get that suit ? "
13348	13357	13268	13268	she	233	" I do n't know . Some shop . "
13358	13366	13268	13268	she	233	" What 's the news at Hetton ? "
13367	13384	13268	13268	she	233	" All the same . Tony madly feudal . John Andrew cursing like a stable boy . "
13385	13389	13268	13268	she	233	" And you ? "
13390	13400	13268	13268	she	233	" Me ? Oh , I 'm all right . "
13401	13408	13268	13268	she	233	" Who 's been to stay ? "
13409	13428	13268	13268	she	233	" No one . We had a friend of Tony 's called Mr Beaver last week - end . "
13429	13451	13268	13268	she	233	" John Beaver ? ... How very odd . I should n't have thought he was at all Tony 's ticket . "
13452	13462	13268	13268	she	233	" He was n't ... What 's he like ? "
13463	13486	13268	13268	she	233	" I hardly know him . I see him at Margot 's sometimes . He 's a great one for going everywhere . "
13487	13495	13268	13268	she	233	" I thought he was rather pathetic . "
13496	13511	13268	13268	she	233	" Oh , he 's _ pathetic _ all right . D'you fancy him ? "
13512	13517	13268	13268	she	233	" Heavens , no . "
13646	13659	13661	13661	Marjorie	228	" I do n't believe he has a spark of human feeling , "
13680	13689	13691	13691	Brenda	233	" He 's never done that to me , "
13696	13709	13691	13691	Brenda	233	" What do you suppose is Mr Beaver 's sex - life ? "
13710	13729	13775	13786	the lodgekeepers who was celebrating his sixtieth year of service at Hetton	705	" I should n't know . Pretty dim , I imagine ... You _ do _ fancy him ? "
13730	13734	13736	13736	Brenda	233	" Oh well , "
13738	13750	13736	13736	Brenda	233	" I do n't see such a lot of young men ... "
13819	13833	13811	13811	They	697	" Do come up for it . It 's certain to be amusing . "
13834	13864	13879	13882	a friend of theirs	707	" I might ... if I can find someone to take me . Tony does n't like her ... I ca n't go to parties alone at my age . "
13889	13895	13897	13897	Marjorie	228	" You 're in luck , "
13908	13917	13897	13897	Marjorie	228	" there 's your Mr Beaver 's mother . "
14072	14079	14081	14081	Marjorie	228	" God , what a party , "
14089	14100	14101	14102	Polly Cockpurse	222	" You 're both coming to my party , darlings ? "
14111	14143	14101	14102	Polly Cockpurse	222	" Only do n't tell anyone about it . It 's just a very small , secret party . The house will only hold a few people -- just old friends . "
14144	14162	14164	14164	Marjorie	228	" It would be wonderful to see what Polly 's _ real _ old friends were like , "
14166	14177	14164	14164	Marjorie	228	" She has n't known anyone more than five years . "
14178	14187	14203	14203	women	2479	" I wish Tony could see her point . "
14295	14342	14287	14288	Mrs Beaver	170	" I _ must _ come and speak to you , though I 'm in a great hurry . It 's _ so _ long since we met and John has been telling me about a _ delightful _ week - end he had with you . "
14343	14349	14271	14271	she	223	" It was very quiet . "
14350	14412	14413	14413	She	728	" That 's just what he _ loves _ . Poor boy , he gets rushed off his feet in London . Tell me , Lady Brenda , is it true you are looking for a flat?--because I think I 've got just the place for you . It 's being done up now and will be ready well before Christmas . "
14419	14448	14413	14413	She	728	" Oh dear , I must fly . You could n't possibly come in for a cocktail , this evening ? Then you could hear all about it . "
14449	14455	14457	14457	Brenda	233	" I _ could _ ... "
14460	14483	14484	14484	She	728	" Then _ do _ . I 'll expect you about six . I daresay you do n't know where I live ? "
14492	14501	14502	14502	Marjorie	228	" What 's all this about a flat ? "
14505	14514	14538	14538	his	729	" Oh , just something I thought of ... "
14558	14571	14572	14572	she	233	" Probably not , if he 's so keen on going about , "
14575	14586	14572	14572	she	233	" and , anyhow , what 's the sense ? ... "
14705	14716	14701	14702	Mrs Beaver	170	" I 'll ask my husband and let you know . "
14717	14740	14701	14702	Mrs Beaver	170	" You _ will _ let me know soon , wo n't you , because _ everyone _ will be wanting one . "
14741	14750	14701	14702	Mrs Beaver	170	" I 'll let you know very soon . "
14809	14819	14801	14801	Beaver	170	" I 'm sure you want to go away . "
14820	14825	14801	14801	Beaver	170	" No , really . "
14826	14834	14801	14801	Beaver	170	" I 've got lots to read . "
14835	14843	14801	14801	Beaver	170	" I _ want _ to stay . "
14844	14852	14854	14854	she	170	" It 's very sweet of you . "
14873	14891	14861	14861	she	170	" I suppose you would n't like to take me to Polly 's party , would you ? "
14993	14999	15000	15000	he	743	" I wish I could , "
15003	15014	15000	15000	he	743	" but I 've promised to dine out for it . "
15021	15029	15015	15015	Brenda	233	" I was afraid you would have . "
15030	15037	15000	15000	he	743	" But we 'll meet there . "
15038	15045	15015	15015	Brenda	233	" Yes , if I go . "
15046	15055	15000	15000	he	743	" I wish I could have taken you . "
15056	15067	15015	15015	Brenda	233	" It 's quite all right ... I just wondered . "
15093	15105	15090	15090	Beaver	170	" Well , I think perhaps I 'll leave you now . "
15106	15117	15015	15015	Brenda	233	" Yes , run along . Thank you for coming . "
15144	15158	15159	15159	she	233	" Why _ should _ he want to take me , poor boy ? "
15162	15171	15159	15159	she	233	" Only he might have done it better . "
15177	15181	15159	15159	she	233	" Barnardo case ? "
15185	15190	15191	15191	she	233	" Down and out , "
15194	15200	15191	15191	she	233	" sunk , right under . "
15222	15226	15191	15191	she	233	" Good day ? "
15230	15257	15227	15227	She	233	" Saw Marjorie and her filthy dog . Bought some things . Lunched at Daisy 's new joint . Bone - setter . That 's all . "
15258	15282	15191	15191	she	233	" You know I wish you 'd give up these day - trips to London . They 're far too much for you . "
15283	15323	15227	15227	She	233	" Me ? Oh , I 'm all right . Wish I was dead , that 's all ... and please , please , darling Tony , do n't say anything about bed , because I ca n't move . "
15374	15384	15385	15385	Tony	219	" You seem in wonderful spirits to - day , "
15388	15414	15582	15586	this hairy , mischievous Countess	754	" I feel big . I think it 's Mr Cruttwell . He puts all one 's nerves right and one 's circulation and everything . "
15418	15424	15385	15385	Tony	219	" Where 's mummy gone ? "
15425	15428	15385	15385	Tony	219	" London . "
15429	15432	15385	15385	Tony	219	" Why ? "
15433	15443	15385	15385	Tony	219	" Someone called Lady Cockpurse is giving a party . "
15444	15449	15385	15385	Tony	219	" Is she nice ? "
15450	15459	15385	15385	Tony	219	" Mummy thinks so . I do n't . "
15460	15463	15385	15385	Tony	219	" Why ? "
15464	15472	15385	15385	Tony	219	" Because she looks like a monkey . "
15473	15529	15385	15385	Tony	219	" I should love to see her . Does she live in a cage ? Has she got a tail ? Ben saw a woman who looked like a fish , with scales all over instead of skin . It was in a circus in Cairo . Smelt like a fish too , Ben says . "
15543	15552	15530	15530	They	753	" Daddy , what does Lady Cockpurse eat ? "
15553	15560	15385	15385	Tony	219	" Oh , nuts and things . "
15561	15567	15530	15530	They	753	" Nuts and what things ? "
15568	15574	15385	15385	Tony	219	" Different kinds of nuts . "
15644	15656	15658	15658	nanny	2412	" You must n't say things like that about real people , "
15660	15672	15658	15658	nanny	2412	" Whatever would Lady Cockpurse do if she heard about it ? "
15673	15706	15640	15642	passers - by	760	" She 'd gibber and chatter and lash round with her tail , and then I expect she 'd catch some nice , big , juicy fleas and forget all about it . "
15734	15741	15722	15722	She	233	" Lovely , darling . New ? "
15742	15745	15751	15758	the woman at whose house she was dining	764	" Fairly . "
15761	15779	15722	15722	She	233	" Look here , are you absolutely sure you ca n't make Allan come to - night ? "
15780	15800	15722	15722	She	233	" Absolutely . He 's got a meeting in Camberwell . He may not even come to Polly 's . "
15801	15812	15722	15722	She	233	" Is there _ any _ man you can bring ? "
15813	15820	15722	15722	She	233	" Ca n't think of anybody . "
15821	15861	15722	15722	She	233	" Well , we shall have to be one short , that 's all . I ca n't think what 's happened to - night . I rang up John Beaver but even _ he _ wo n't come . "
15863	15867	15869	15869	Marjorie	228	" You know , "
15876	15895	15869	15869	Marjorie	228	" you 're causing a great deal of trouble . You 've taken London 's only spare man . "
15896	15905	15722	15722	She	233	" Oh dear , I did n't realize ... "
15983	15992	15994	15994	Marjorie	228	" I must see your Mr Beaver properly , "
15996	16009	15994	15994	Marjorie	228	" Let 's make him take off his coat and drink something . "
16041	16054	16055	16055	Marjorie	228	" Oh , he 's not so bad , your Mr Beaver , "
16062	16068	16055	16055	Marjorie	228	" not by any means , "
16140	16168	16130	16130	he	175	" Mrs Jimmy Deane 's very upset that she could n't get you for to - night . I did n't give away what you were doing . "
16169	16175	16177	16177	Beaver	191	" Give her my love , "
16179	16189	16177	16177	Beaver	191	" Anyway we 'll all meet at Polly 's . "
16190	16201	16130	16130	he	175	" I must go , we 're dining at nine . "
16202	16207	16209	16209	Brenda	233	" Stay a bit , "
16211	16219	16209	16209	Brenda	233	" She 's sure to be late . "
16237	16251	16252	16252	She	233	" No , I must go . Enjoy yourselves , bless you both . "
16357	16367	16350	16350	he	191	" I suppose we ought to be going too . "
16368	16373	16350	16350	he	191	" Yes , where ? "
16374	16380	16350	16350	he	191	" I thought Espinosa 's . "
16381	16404	16350	16350	he	191	" Yes , lovely . Only listen . I want you to understand right away that it 's _ my _ dinner . "
16405	16415	16350	16350	he	191	" Of course not ... nothing of the sort . "
16416	16447	16350	16350	he	191	" Yes it is . I 'm a year older than you and an old married woman and quite rich , so , please , I 'm going to pay . "
16470	16478	16465	16465	Beaver	191	" Does she expect me to pounce ? "
16513	16520	16510	16510	He	191	" _ Please _ , Brenda , "
16624	16643	16618	16618	Brenda	233	" You choose . Very little for me , but it must only have starch , no protein . "
16709	16734	16694	16694	she	233	" You ca n't think how exciting it is for me to take a young man out . I 've never done it before . "
16791	16805	16787	16788	Presently Beaver	191	" I 'm sorry I was an ass in the taxi just now . "
16806	16809	16787	16788	Presently Beaver	191	" Eh ? "
16816	16829	16810	16810	He	191	" Did you mind when I tried to kiss you just now ? "
16830	16838	16787	16788	Presently Beaver	191	" Me ? No , not particularly . "
16839	16848	16810	16810	He	191	" Then why would n't you let me ? "
16849	16861	16787	16788	Presently Beaver	191	" Oh dear , you 've got a lot to learn . "
16862	16867	16810	16810	He	191	" How d'you mean ? "
16868	16884	16787	16788	Presently Beaver	191	" You must n't ever ask questions like that . Will you try and remember ? "
16890	16907	16886	16886	he	191	" You talk to me as if I was an undergraduate having his first walk out . "
16908	16917	16787	16788	Presently Beaver	191	" Oh , is this a walk out ? "
16918	16927	16886	16886	he	191	" Not as far as I am concerned . "
16937	16967	16934	16934	Brenda	233	" I am not sure it has n't been a mistake , taking you out to dinner . Let 's ask for the bill and go to Polly 's . "
16997	17009	17010	17010	she	233	" You 've got to _ learn _ to be nicer , "
17014	17025	17010	17010	she	233	" I do n't believe you 'd find it impossible . "
17035	17043	17032	17032	she	233	" How much do I tip him ? "
17049	17065	17045	17045	Beaver	191	" Are you sure that 's enough ? I should have given twice as much . "
17066	17072	17074	17074	Beaver	191	" It 's exactly right , "
17147	17151	17153	17153	Brenda	233	" Shut up , "
17155	17159	17153	17153	Brenda	233	" Come here . "
17491	17509	17488	17488	Brenda	233	" You 're not to leave me , please . I 'm not going to know anybody , "
17553	17572	17551	17551	she	233	" All right , I 'll give you a rest . Only do n't let me get left . "
17671	17676	17663	17663	he	191	" Time for supper . "
17714	17729	17730	17730	She	233	" I do n't propose to move for a long time , d'you mind ? "
17825	17835	17823	17823	Brenda	233	" How my poor young man must be hating this "
17879	17886	17887	17887	she	233	" Are you dying of it ? "
17890	17898	17856	17856	hers	233	" No , indeed , never happier . "
17899	17911	17937	17938	the crowd	834	" Well , I am . Let 's go and dance . "
17953	17957	17959	17959	Brenda	233	" Oh dear , "
17961	17988	17959	17959	Brenda	233	" now we 're done . We ca n't go back to the table ... it almost looks as though we should have to go home . "
17989	17995	18041	18041	his	191	" It 's not two . "
17996	18016	17959	17959	Brenda	233	" That 's late for me . Look here , do n't you come . Stay and enjoy yourself . "
18017	18024	18026	18026	Beaver	191	" Of course I 'll come , "
18055	18059	18041	18041	his	191	" There already ? "
18078	18109	18041	18041	his	191	" I am afraid I ca n't ask you in for a drink . You see it is n't my house and I should n't know where to find anything . "
18110	18117	18041	18041	his	191	" No , of course not . "
18118	18146	18041	18041	his	191	" Well , good night , my dear . Thank you a thousand times for looking after me . I 'm afraid I rather bitched your evening . "
18147	18154	18156	18156	Beaver	191	" No , of course not , "
18158	18169	18170	18170	She	233	" Will you ring me in the morning ... promise ? "
18267	18297	18239	18239	he	191	" Darling , I was just going to ring off . I thought you must have gone back to Polly 's . Is the telephone not by your bed ? "
18298	18308	18239	18239	he	191	" No , it 's on the ground floor . "
18309	18328	18239	18239	he	191	" Oh dear , then it was n't a very good idea to ring up , was it ? "
18329	18341	18239	18239	he	191	" Oh , I do n't know . What is it ? "
18342	18346	18239	18239	he	191	" Just to say "
18349	18351	18239	18239	he	191	" . "
18352	18363	18239	18239	he	191	" Oh , I see , well -- good night . "
18364	18374	18239	18239	he	191	" And you 'll ring me in the morning ? "
18375	18378	18239	18239	he	191	" Yes . "
18379	18389	18239	18239	he	191	" Early , before you 've made any plans . "
18390	18393	18239	18239	he	191	" Yes . "
18394	18402	18239	18239	he	191	" Then good night , bless you . "
18423	18434	18239	18239	he	191	" ... going away in the middle of the party . "
18435	18453	18239	18239	he	191	" I ca n't tell you how innocent it was . He did n't even come in . "
18454	18463	18239	18239	he	191	" No one is going to know that . "
18464	18475	18239	18239	he	191	" And he was furious when I rang him up . "
18476	18484	18239	18239	he	191	" What does he think of you ? "
18485	18504	18239	18239	he	191	" Simply ca n't make me out at all ... terribly puzzled , and rather bored in bits . "
18505	18515	18239	18239	he	191	" Are you going to go on with it ? "
18516	18522	18239	18239	he	191	" I should n't know . "
18527	18533	18239	18239	he	191	" Perhaps that 's him . "
18566	18583	18554	18554	Marjorie	228	" But , really , Brenda , he 's such a _ dreary _ young man . "
18584	18718	18239	18239	he	191	" I know it all . He 's second rate and a snob and , I should think , as cold as a fish , but I happen to have a fancy for him , that 's all ... besides I 'm not sure he 's _ altogether _ awful ... he 's got that odious mother whom he adores ... and he 's always been very poor . I do n't think he 's had a fair deal . I heard all about it last night . He got engaged once but they could n't get married because of money and since then he 's never had a proper affair with anyone decent ... he 's got to be taught a whole lot of things . That 's part of his attraction . "
18719	18730	18554	18554	Marjorie	228	" Oh dear , I see you 're very serious . "
18735	18743	18239	18239	he	191	" Perhaps _ that 's _ him . "
18760	18774	18755	18755	Brenda	233	" Good morning , darling , what 's the dirt to - day ? "
18775	18787	18554	18554	Marjorie	228	" Oh , Polly , what a good party last night . "
18788	18811	18755	18755	Brenda	233	" Not so bad for the old girl , was it ? I say , what about your sister and Mr Beaver ? "
18812	18817	18554	18554	Marjorie	228	" What about them ? "
18818	18828	18755	18755	Brenda	233	" How long has _ that _ been on ? "
18829	18838	18554	18554	Marjorie	228	" There 's nothing doing there , Polly . "
18839	18878	18755	18755	Brenda	233	" Do n't you tell me . They were well away last night . How 's the boy managed it ? That 's what I want to know . He must have something we did n't know about ... "
18879	18899	18554	18554	Marjorie	228	" So Polly 's on to your story . She 'll be telling everyone in London at this moment . "
18900	18951	18755	18755	Brenda	233	" How I wish there was anything to tell ! The cub has n't even rung me up ... Well , I 'll leave him in peace . If he does n't do anything about me , I 'll go down to Hetton this afternoon . Perhaps that 's him . "
18980	18987	18988	18988	he	239	" I hear Brenda disgraced herself , "
18991	18994	18996	18996	Brenda	233	" Goodness , "
18998	19010	18996	18996	Brenda	233	" People do think that young men are easily come by . "
19016	19027	19029	19030	Mrs Beaver	170	" I scarcely saw you at Polly 's last night , "
19032	19038	19029	19030	Mrs Beaver	170	" What became of you ? "
19039	19049	18967	18967	he	239	" We went early . Brenda Last was tired . "
19050	19076	19029	19030	Mrs Beaver	170	" She was looking lovely . I am so glad you 've made friends with her . When are you going to see her again ? "
19077	19085	18967	18967	he	239	" I said I 'd ring up . "
19086	19094	19029	19030	Mrs Beaver	170	" Well , why do n't you ? "
19095	19158	18967	18967	he	239	" Oh , mumsy , what 's the use ? I ca n't afford to start taking about women like Brenda Last . If I ring up she 'll say , what are you doing , and I shall have to ask her to something , and it will be the same thing every day . I simply have n't the money . "
19159	19241	19029	19030	Mrs Beaver	170	" I know , my son . It 's very difficult for you ... and you 're wonderful about money . I ought to be grateful that I have n't a son always coming to me with debts . Still , it does n't do to deny yourself _ everything _ , you know . You 're getting to be an old bachelor already at twenty - five . I could see Brenda liked you , that evening she came here . "
19242	19251	18967	18967	he	239	" Oh , she likes me all right . "
19252	19372	19029	19030	Mrs Beaver	170	" I hope she makes up her mind about that flat . They 're going like hot cakes . I shall have to look about for another suitable house to split up . You 'd be surprised who 've been taking them -- quite a number of people with houses in London already ... Well , I must be getting back to work . I 'm away for two nights by the way . See that Chambers looks after you properly . There are some Australians Sylvia Newport discovered who want to take a house in the country , so I 'm driving them round to one or two that might do for them . Where are you lunching ? "
19373	19377	18967	18967	he	239	" Margot 's . "
19399	19405	19407	19407	Brenda	233	" So that 's that , "
19409	19417	19407	19407	Brenda	233	" I daresay I 'm glad really . "
19445	19456	19457	19457	she	233	" I do n't seem to have anywhere to lunch , "
19460	19477	19507	19508	each other	672	" Why do n't you come to Margot 's ? I know she 'd love it . "
19478	19487	19507	19508	each other	672	" Well , ring up and ask her . "
19514	19526	19527	19527	he	219	" I kept trying to get through to you this morning , "
19530	19538	19527	19527	he	219	" but the line was always engaged . "
19539	19545	19547	19547	Brenda	233	" Oh , come on , "
19549	19557	19547	19547	Brenda	233	" I 'll sock you a movie . "
19582	19591	19559	19559	she	233	" Is mummy coming back to - day ? "
19592	19597	19559	19559	she	233	" I hope so . "
19598	19622	19559	19559	she	233	" That monkey - woman 's party has lasted a long time . Can I come in to the station and meet her ? "
19623	19631	19559	19559	she	233	" Yes , we 'll both go . "
19632	19659	19559	19559	she	233	" She has n't seen Thunderclap for four days . She has n't seen me jump the new post and rail , has she , daddy ? "
19702	19711	19712	19712	He	855	" Her ladyship coming back to - day ? "
19721	19741	19712	19712	He	855	" I 've been expecting her every day . You know what it is when ladies get to London . "
19742	19775	19712	19712	He	855	" Sam Brace 's wife went to London and he could n't get her back . Had to go up and fetch her himself . And then she give him a hiding . "
19792	19813	19782	19782	Brenda	233	" You 've _ both _ come . What angels you are . I do n't at all deserve it . "
19814	19827	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" Oh , mummy , have you brought the monkey - lady ? "
19828	19837	19782	19782	Brenda	233	" What _ does _ the child mean ? "
19838	19854	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" He 's got it into his head that your chum Polly has a tail . "
19855	19871	19782	19782	Brenda	233	" Come to think of it , I should n't be surprised if she had . "
19895	19902	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" What 's all the news ? "
19903	20015	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" Ben 's put the rail up ever so high and Thunderclap and I jumped it six times yesterday and six times again to - day and two more of the fish in the little pond are dead , floating upside down all swollen and nanny burnt her finger on the kettle yesterday and daddy and I saw a fox just as near as anything and he sat quite still and then went away into the wood and I began drawing a picture of a battle only I could n't finish it because the paints were n't right and the grey carthorse the one that had worms is quite well again . "
20016	20022	20024	20024	Tony	219	" Nothing much has happened , "
20026	20044	20024	20024	Tony	219	" We 've missed you . What did you find to do in London all this time ? "
20045	20062	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" Me ? Oh , I 've been behaving rather badly to tell you the truth . "
20063	20067	20024	20024	Tony	219	" Buying things ? "
20068	20103	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" Worse . I 've been carrying on madly with young men and I 've spent heaps of money and I 've enjoyed it very much indeed . But there 's one awful thing . "
20104	20109	20024	20024	Tony	219	" What 's that ? "
20110	20130	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" No , I think it had better keep . It 's something you wo n't like at all . "
20131	20138	20024	20024	Tony	219	" You 've bought a Pekingese . "
20139	20161	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" Worse , far worse . Only I have n't done it yet . But I _ want _ to dreadfully . "
20162	20166	20024	20024	Tony	219	" Go on . "
20167	20176	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" Tony , I 've found a flat . "
20177	20189	20024	20024	Tony	219	" Well , you 'd better lose it again , quick . "
20190	20212	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" All right . I 'll attack you about it again later . Meanwhile , try not to brood about it . "
20213	20222	20024	20024	Tony	219	" I sha n't give it another thought . "
20223	20231	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" What 's a flat , daddy ? "
20262	20279	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" I suppose all this means that you 're going to start again about your flat ? "
20280	20283	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" Mmmm . "
20284	20296	19880	19881	The chauffeur	859	" You have n't signed any papers yet , have you ? "
20297	20301	20302	20302	Brenda	233	" Oh no . "
20308	20316	20317	20317	Tony	219	" Then no great harm 's done . "
20336	20345	20324	20324	Brenda	233	" Listen , you have n't been brooding ? "
20346	20349	20317	20317	Tony	219	" No . "
20350	20430	20324	20324	Brenda	233	" Because , you see , when you say ' flat ' you 're thinking of something quite different to me . _ You _ mean by a flat , a lift and a man in uniform , and a big front door with knobs , and an entrance hall and doors opening in all directions , with kitchens and sculleries and dining - rooms and drawing - rooms and servants ' bedrooms ... do n't you , Tony ? "
20431	20436	20317	20317	Tony	219	" More or less . "
20437	20467	20324	20324	Brenda	233	" _ Exactly . _ Now _ I _ mean just a bedroom and a bath and a telephone . You see the difference ? Now a woman I know-- "
20468	20471	20317	20317	Tony	219	" Who ? "
20472	20524	20324	20324	Brenda	233	" Just a woman -- has fixed up a whole house like that off Belgrave Square and they are three pounds a week , no rates and taxes , constant hot water and central heating , woman comes in to make the bed when required , what d'you think of that ? "
20525	20529	20317	20317	Tony	219	" I see . "
20530	20623	20324	20324	Brenda	233	" Now this is how I look at it . What 's three pounds a week ? Less than nine bob a night . Where could one stay for less than nine bob a night with all those advantages ? You 're always going to the club , and that costs more , and I ca n't stay often with Marjorie because it 's hell for her having me , and anyway she 's got that dog , and you 're always saying when I come back in the evenings after shopping , "
20632	20636	20640	20640	yourself	862	" you say , "
20642	20683	20640	20640	yourself	862	" Time and again you say it . I 'm sure we spend much more than three pounds a week through not having a flat . Tell you what , I 'll give up Mr Cruttwell . How 's that ? "
20684	20691	20317	20317	Tony	219	" D'you really want this thing ? "
20692	20695	20640	20640	yourself	862	" Mmm . "
20696	20723	20317	20317	Tony	219	" Well , I 'll have to see . We _ might _ manage it , but it 'll mean putting off the improvements down here . "
20724	20732	20733	20733	she	862	" I do n't really deserve it , "
20740	20752	20733	20733	she	862	" I 've been carrying on _ anyhow _ this week . "
20935	20937	20963	20977	a Canadian lady who was having her walls covered with chromium plating at immense expense	867	" suggestion "
20992	21000	21001	21001	she	233	" I 'm sorry to be pompous , "
21006	21027	21001	21001	she	233	" but I just do n't want your Mr Beaver hanging about the house all day and calling me Marjorie . "
21028	21040	20963	20977	a Canadian lady who was having her walls covered with chromium plating at immense expense	867	" Oh well , the flat wo n't be long now . "
21041	21058	21001	21001	she	233	" And I shall go on saying that I think you 're making a ridiculous mistake . "
21059	21071	20963	20977	a Canadian lady who was having her walls covered with chromium plating at immense expense	867	" It 's just that you do n't like Mr Beaver . "
21072	21088	21001	21001	she	233	" It is n't only that . I think it 's hard cheese on Tony . "
21089	21097	20963	20977	a Canadian lady who was having her walls covered with chromium plating at immense expense	867	" Oh , Tony 's all right . "
21098	21105	21001	21001	she	233	" And if there 's a row-- "
21106	21114	20963	20977	a Canadian lady who was having her walls covered with chromium plating at immense expense	867	" There wo n't be a row . "
21115	21139	21001	21001	she	233	" You never know . If there is , I do n't want Allan to think I 've been helping to arrange things . "
21140	21152	20963	20977	a Canadian lady who was having her walls covered with chromium plating at immense expense	867	" I was n't so disagreeable to you about Robin Beaseley . "
21153	21161	21163	21163	Marjorie	228	" There was never much in that , "
21459	21654	21450	21451	Mrs Beaver	170	" Of course the subject has not been mentioned between John and myself , but if what I hear is true , I think it will do the boy a world of good . Of course he 's always been very much in demand and had a great number of friends , but _ that is n't the same thing _ . I 've felt for a long time a Lack of Something in him , and I think that a charming and experienced woman like Brenda Last is just the person to help him . He 's got a _ very _ affectionate nature , but he 's so sensitive that he hardly ever lets it appear ... to tell you the truth I felt something of the kind was in the air last week , so I made an excuse to go away for a few days . If I had been there things might never have come to anything . He 's very shy and reserved even to me . I 'll have the chess - men done up and sent round to you this afternoon . Thank you so much . "
21709	21722	21723	21723	they	2479	" How on earth has _ he _ got away with it ? "
21750	21760	21739	21739	they	2479	" Well , old boy , how about one ? "
21871	21879	21866	21866	she	233	" I 'm talking from the flat . "
21880	21885	22147	22147	she	889	" Oh , ah . "
21886	21904	21866	21866	she	233	" _ Darling _ , do try to sound interested . It 's very exciting for me . "
21905	21911	22147	22147	she	889	" What 's it like ? "
21912	21992	21866	21866	she	233	" Well , there are a good many smells at present and the bath makes odd sounds and when you turn on the hot tap there 's just a rush of air and that 's all , and the cold tap keeps dripping and the water is rather brown and the cupboard doors are jammed and the curtains wo n't pull right across so that the street lamp shines in all night ... but it 's _ lovely _ . "
21993	22000	22147	22147	she	889	" You do n't say so . "
22001	22073	21866	21866	she	233	" Tony , you must be nice about it . It 's all so exciting -- front door and a latch - key and all ... And someone sent me a lot of flowers to - day -- so many that there 's hardly room for them and I 've had to put them in the basin on account of having no pots . It was n't you , was it ? "
22074	22083	22147	22147	she	889	" Yes ... as a matter of fact . "
22084	22098	21866	21866	she	233	" Darling , I did so hope it was ... how like you . "
22099	22105	22147	22147	she	889	" Three minutes , please . "
22106	22111	21866	21866	she	233	" Must stop now . "
22112	22119	22147	22147	she	889	" When are you coming back ? "
22120	22131	21866	21866	she	233	" Almost at once . Good night , my sweet . "
22132	22139	22141	22141	Beaver	170	" What a lot of talk , "
22172	22184	22147	22147	she	889	" Was n't it sweet of Tony to send those flowers ? "
22185	22194	22147	22147	she	889	" I 'm not awfully fond of Tony . "
22195	22216	22147	22147	she	889	" Do n't let that worry you , my beauty , he does n't like you _ at all _ . "
22217	22227	22147	22147	she	889	" _ Does n't _ he ? Why not ? "
22228	22251	22147	22147	she	889	" No one does except me . You must get that clear ... it 's very odd that _ I _ should . "
22540	22548	22549	22549	he	576	" How difficult it is for us , "
22571	22646	22648	22649	the vicar	576	" to realize that this is indeed Christmas . Instead of the glowing log fire and windows tight shuttered against the drifting snow , we have only the harsh glare of an alien sun ; instead of the happy circle of loved faces , of home and family , we have the uncomprehending stares of the subjugated , though no doubt grateful , heathen . Instead of the placid ox and ass of Bethlehem , "
22659	22680	22648	22649	the vicar	576	" we have for companions the ravening tiger and the exotic camel , the furtive jackal and the ponderous elephant ... "
22758	22765	22771	22772	the family	915	" The ravening tiger and exotic camel "
22910	22935	22891	22892	Aunt Frances	195	" Dear child , all these feelings of delicacy are valueless ; only the rich realize the gulf that separates them from the poor , "
23302	23326	23294	23294	she	233	" I ca n't complain , he 's never pretended to like me much . And anyway it was a damned silly present . "
23344	23360	23294	23294	she	233	" Do n't come , darling . I 'll make it all right with them . "
23361	23382	23406	23406	him	219	" No , I 'll come . I have n't seen so much of you in the last three weeks . "
23445	23454	23455	23455	he	219	" I 'll tell you something very odd , "
23458	23466	23455	23455	he	219	" Who do you think is here ? "
23467	23470	23413	23413	him	219	" Who ? "
23471	23477	23455	23455	he	219	" Our old friend Beaver . "
23478	23485	23413	23413	him	219	" Why 's that odd particularly ? "
23486	23517	23455	23455	he	219	" Oh , I do n't know . I 'd forgotten all about him , had n't you ? D'you think he sent a telegram as he did to us ? "
23518	23522	23413	23413	him	219	" I daresay . "
23542	23561	23539	23539	He	219	" All kinds of changes since we saw you last . Brenda 's taken a flat in London . "
23562	23568	23413	23413	him	219	" Yes , I know . "
23569	23572	23539	23539	He	219	" How ? "
23573	23586	23413	23413	him	219	" Well , my mother let it to her , you know . "
23597	23620	23587	23587	Tony	219	" You never told me who was behind your flat . I might not have been so amiable if I 'd known . "
23621	23630	23413	23413	him	219	" No , darling , that 's why . "
23677	23695	23671	23671	Angela	209	" I daresay it was a mistake to ask him . It 's so hard to know . "
23776	23785	23771	23771	she	233	" I 've made a New Year resolution . "
23786	23797	23771	23771	she	233	" Anything to do with spending more time at home ? "
23798	23826	23771	23771	she	233	" Oh no , _ quite _ the reverse . Listen , Tony , it 's serious . I think I 'll take a course of something . "
23827	23840	23771	23771	she	233	" Not bone - setters again ? I thought that was over . "
23841	23963	23771	23771	she	233	" No , something like economics . You see , I 've been thinking . I do n't really _ do _ anything at all at present . The house runs itself . It seems to me time I _ took _ to something . Now you 're always talking about going into Parliament . Well , if I had done a course of economics I could be some use canvassing and writing speeches and things -- you know , the way Marjorie did when Allan was standing on the Clydeside . There are all sorts of lectures in London , to do with the University , where girls go . Do n't you think it 's rather a good idea ? "
23964	23975	23976	23976	Tony	219	" It 's one better than the bone - setters , "
24186	24190	24218	24218	he	187	" Anyone here ? "
24191	24209	24218	24218	he	187	" Very quiet to - night , sir . Mr Last is in the dining - room . "
24268	24271	24272	24272	he	187	" Hullo , "
24275	24283	24272	24272	he	187	" Chucked ? Come and join me . "
24333	24337	24339	24339	Tony	219	" Been chucked ? "
24342	24356	24377	24377	They	949	" Yes , it 's the last time I ask that bitch out . "
24357	24376	24339	24339	Tony	219	" Better have a drink . I 've been drinking a whole lot . Much the best thing . "
24390	24398	24400	24400	Tony	219	" Just come up for the night , "
24402	24406	24400	24400	Tony	219	" Staying here . "
24407	24419	24377	24377	They	949	" You 've got a flat now , have n't you ? "
24420	24445	24400	24400	Tony	219	" Well , Brenda has . There is n't really room for two ... we tried it once and it was n't a success . "
24446	24455	24377	24377	They	949	" What 's she doing to - night ? "
24456	24557	24400	24400	Tony	219	" Out somewhere . I did n't let her know I was coming ... silly not to , but you see I got fed up with being alone at Hetton and thought I 'd like to see Brenda , so I came up suddenly on the spur of the moment , just like that . Damned silly thing to do . Might have known she 'd be going out somewhere ... she 's very high - principled about chucking ... so there it is . She 's going to ring me up here later , if she can get away . "
24570	24580	24581	24581	he	219	" Extraordinary idea of hers , taking up economics , "
24584	24718	24581	24581	he	219	" I never thought it would last , but she seems really keen on it ... I suppose it 's a good plan . You know there was n't really much for her to do all the time at Hetton . Of course she 'd rather die than admit it , but I believe she got a bit bored there sometimes . I 've been thinking it over and that 's the conclusion I came to . Brenda must have been bored ... Daresay she 'll get bored with economics some time ... Anyway , she seems cheerful enough now . We 've had parties every week - end lately ... I wish you 'd come down sometimes , Jock . I do n't seem to get on with Brenda 's new friends . "
24719	24727	24400	24400	Tony	219	" People from the school of economics ? "
24728	24766	24581	24581	he	219	" No , but ones I do n't know . I believe I bore them . Thinking it over , that 's the conclusion I 've come to . I bore them . They talk about me as "
24770	24776	24400	24400	Tony	219	" . John heard them . "
24777	24785	24767	24769	the old boy	951	" Well , that 's friendly enough . "
24786	24793	24400	24400	Tony	219	" Yes , that 's friendly . "
24807	24820	24803	24804	Presently Tony	219	" I say , come next week - end , will you ? "
24821	24829	24767	24769	the old boy	951	" I think I 'd love to . "
24830	24883	24884	24884	They	952	" Wish you would . I do n't see many old friends ... Sure to be lots of people in the house , but you wo n't mind that , will you ? ... sociable chap , Jock ... does n't mind people about . _ I _ mind it like hell . "
24893	24938	24890	24890	Tony	219	" Not enough bathrooms , you know ... but of course you know . You 've been there before , often . Not like the new friends who think me a bore . You do n't think I 'm a bore , do you ? "
24939	24945	24803	24804	Presently Tony	219	" No , old boy . "
24946	25015	24890	24890	Tony	219	" Not even when I 'm tight , like this ? ... There would have been bathrooms . I had the plans out . Four new ones . A chap down there made the plans ... but then Brenda wanted the flat so I had to postpone them as an economy ... I say , that 's funny . We had to economize because of Brenda 's economics . "
25016	25029	24803	24804	Presently Tony	219	" Yes , that 's funny . Let 's have some port . "
25033	25042	25030	25030	Tony	219	" You seem pretty low to - night . "
25043	25058	24890	24890	Tony	219	" I am rather . Worried about the Pig Scheme . Constituents keep writing . "
25059	25139	25030	25030	Tony	219	" _ I _ felt low , _ bloody _ low , but I 'm all right again now . The best thing is to get tight . That 's what I did and I do n't feel low any more ... discouraging to come to London and find you 're not wanted . Funny thing , _ you _ feel low because your girl 's chucked , and _ I _ feel low because mine wo n't chuck . "
25140	25147	24890	24890	Tony	219	" Yes , that 's funny . "
25148	25168	25030	25030	Tony	219	" But you know I 've felt low for weeks now ... bloody low ... how about some brandy ? "
25169	25189	24890	24890	Tony	219	" Yes , why not ? After all , there are other things in life besides women and pigs . "

25901	25940	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" He 's roaring . Look here , he threatens to come round . I simply ca n't face him to - night in that mood , I 'm tired out . You understand , do n't you ? "
25941	25947	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Yes , I understand . "
25948	25966	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" So will you , _ please _ , keep him away ? Are you tight too ? "

26059	26063	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Not exactly . "
26064	26086	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Far better to make it up . Shall we have some more brandy or go round to Brenda straight away ? "
26087	26095	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Let 's have some more brandy . "
26096	26136	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Jock , you are n't still feeling low , are you ? Does n't do to feel low . _ I 'm _ not feeling low . I _ was _ , but I 'm not any more . "
26137	26146	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" No , I 'm not feeling low . "
26147	26161	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Then we 'll have some brandy and then go to Brenda 's . "
26162	26166	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" All right . "
26178	26192	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Tell you what , I should n't drive if I were you . "
26193	26197	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Not drive ? "
26198	26213	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" No , I should n't drive . They 'd say you were drunk . "
26214	26218	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Who would ? "
26219	26232	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Anyone you ran over . They 'd say you were drunk . "
26233	26240	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Well , so I am . "
26241	26248	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Then I should n't drive . "
26249	26255	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Too far to walk . "
26256	26263	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" We 'll take a taxi . "
26264	26273	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Oh , hell , I can drive . "
26274	26286	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Or let 's not go to Brenda 's at all . "
26287	26296	26298	26298	Jock	187	" We 'd better go to Brenda 's , "
26300	26306	26298	26298	Jock	187	" She 's expecting us . "
26307	26331	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Well , I ca n't walk all that way . Besides , I do n't think she really wanted us to come . "
26332	26342	26298	26298	Jock	187	" She 'll be pleased when she sees us . "
26343	26360	25869	25869	Brenda	233	" Yes , but it 's a long way . Let 's go some other place . "
26361	26369	26371	26371	Jock	187	" I 'd like to see Brenda , "
26373	26381	26371	26371	Jock	187	" I 'm very fond of Brenda . "
26382	26389	26298	26298	Jock	187	" She 's a grand girl . "
26390	26397	26371	26371	Jock	187	" She 's a grand girl . "
26398	26410	26298	26298	Jock	187	" Well , let 's take a taxi to Brenda 's . "
26418	26441	26415	26415	Jock	187	" Do n't let 's go there . Let 's go some other place . Let 's go to some low joint . "
26442	26458	26371	26371	Jock	187	" All the same to me . Tell him to go to some lousy joint . "
26459	26466	26468	26468	Jock	187	" Go to some lousy joint , "
26487	26498	26585	26593	a seedy figure in peaked cap and braided overcoat	963	" We can always ring Brenda from the lousy joint . "
26499	26516	26585	26593	a seedy figure in peaked cap and braided overcoat	963	" Yes , I think we ought to do that . She 's a grand girl . "
26517	26521	26585	26593	a seedy figure in peaked cap and braided overcoat	963	" Grand girl . "
26546	26561	26371	26371	Jock	187	" D'you know , I believe he 's taking us to the Old Hundredth . "
26562	26577	26585	26593	a seedy figure in peaked cap and braided overcoat	963	" Ca n't still be open ? Thought they closed it down years ago . "
26788	26794	26795	26795	Tony	219	" D'you mind signing on ? "
26829	26838	26795	26795	Tony	219	" That 's five bob each , please . "
26900	26917	26855	26856	the band	808	" Last time I was here , Tony , was the bachelor party before your wedding . "
26918	26923	26855	26856	the band	808	" Tight that night . "
26924	26927	26855	26856	the band	808	" Stinking . "
26928	26948	26855	26856	the band	808	" I 'll tell you who else was tight that night -- Reggie . Broke a fruit gum machine . "
26949	26954	26855	26856	the band	808	" Reggie was stinking . "
26955	26969	26855	26856	the band	808	" I say , you do n't still feel low about that girl ? "
26970	26977	26855	26856	the band	808	" I do n't feel low . "
26978	26987	26855	26856	the band	808	" Come on , we 'll go downstairs . "
27010	27016	27018	27018	Jock	187	" I like this joint , "
27020	27026	27018	27018	Jock	187	" What 'll we drink ? "
27027	27030	27001	27002	the band	808	" Brandy . "
27104	27112	27113	27113	Babs	260	" Are you in town for long ? "
27116	27127	27113	27113	Babs	260	" Have you got such a thing as a cigarette ? "
27136	27143	27133	27133	She	999	" Are you fond of dancing ? "
27144	27150	27166	27167	The waiter	997	" No , are you ? "
27151	27156	27133	27133	She	999	" So - so . "
27157	27165	27166	27167	The waiter	997	" Well , let 's sit down . "
27170	27185	27166	27167	The waiter	997	" Will you buy a ticket in a raffle for a box of chocolates ? "
27186	27189	27212	27212	Milly	259	" No . "
27190	27196	27198	27198	Babs	260	" Buy one for me , "
27215	27224	27212	27212	Milly	259	" You 're married , are n't you ? "
27225	27228	27230	27230	Jock	187	" No , "
27232	27240	27242	27242	Milly	259	" Oh , I can always tell , "
27244	27250	27242	27242	Milly	259	" Your friend is too . "
27251	27259	27212	27212	Milly	259	" Yes , _ he _ is . "
27260	27277	27242	27242	Milly	259	" You 'd be surprised how many gentlemen come here just to talk about their wives . "
27278	27283	27212	27212	Milly	259	" He has n't . "
27295	27315	27284	27284	Tony	219	" You see , the trouble is my wife is studious . She 's taking a course in economics . "
27319	27334	27316	27316	Babs	260	" I think it 's nice for a girl to be interested in things . "
27339	27348	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" What will you be taking for supper ? "
27349	27359	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" Why , we 've only just had dinner . "
27360	27367	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" How about a nice haddock ? "
27368	27384	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" I tell you what I must do is to telephone . Where is it ? "
27385	27396	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" D'you mean really the telephone or the gentlemen 's ? "
27400	27406	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" No , the telephone . "
27407	27413	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" Upstairs in the office . "
27429	27436	27424	27424	she	233	" Yes , who is it ? "
27437	27454	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" I have a message here from Mr Anthony Last and Mr Jocelyn Grant - Menzies . "
27455	27471	27424	27424	she	233	" Oh , it 's you , Tony . Well , what do you want ? "
27472	27478	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" You recognized my voice ? "
27479	27483	27424	27424	she	233	" I did . "
27484	27511	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" Well , I only wanted to give a message but as I am speaking to you I can give it myself , ca n't I ? "
27512	27515	27424	27424	she	233	" Yes . "
27516	27536	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" Well , Jock and I are terribly sorry but we ca n't come round this evening after all . "
27537	27540	27424	27424	she	233	" Oh . "
27541	27562	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" You do n't think it very rude , I hope , but we have a lot to attend to . "
27563	27571	27424	27424	she	233	" That 's all right , Tony . "
27572	27582	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" Did I wake you up by any chance ? "
27583	27591	27424	27424	she	233	" That 's all right , Tony . "
27592	27598	27335	27336	The waiter	997	" Well , good night . "
27606	27630	27599	27599	Tony	219	" I 've been talking to Brenda . She sounded rather annoyed . D'you think we _ ought _ to go round there ? "
27631	27637	27639	27639	Jock	187	" We promised we would , "
27641	27649	27651	27651	Milly	259	" You should never disappoint a lady , "
27653	27662	27663	27663	Babs	260	" Oh , it 's too late now . "
27666	27676	27663	27663	Babs	260	" You two are officers , are n't you ? "
27677	27682	27599	27599	Tony	219	" No , why ? "
27683	27689	27663	27663	Babs	260	" I thought you were . "
27693	27708	27690	27690	Milly	259	" I like business gentlemen best , myself . They 've more to say . "
27709	27714	27599	27599	Tony	219	" What d'you do ? "
27715	27722	27724	27724	Jock	187	" I design postmen 's hats , "
27726	27732	27599	27599	Tony	219	" Oh , go on . "
27733	27743	27599	27599	Tony	219	" And my friend here trains sea - lions . "
27744	27749	27599	27599	Tony	219	" Tell us another . "
27753	27766	27750	27750	Babs	260	" I 've got a gentleman friend who works on a newspaper . "
27773	27785	27770	27770	Jock	187	" I say , ought we to do something about Brenda ? "
27786	27799	27599	27599	Tony	219	" I told her we were n't coming , did n't I ? "
27800	27812	27770	27770	Jock	187	" Yes ... but she might still be _ hoping _ . "
27813	27834	27599	27599	Tony	219	" I tell you what , you go and ring her up and find out if she really wants us . "
27835	27839	27840	27840	He	1002	" All right . "
27847	27857	27858	27858	he	1002	" _ I _ thought she sounded rather annoyed , "
27861	27873	27858	27858	he	1002	" But I said in the end we would n't come . "
27874	27880	27882	27882	Tony	219	" She may be tired , "
27884	27916	27882	27882	Tony	219	" Has to get up early to do economics . Now I come to think of it someone _ did _ say she was tired , earlier on in the evening . "
27917	27929	27968	27968	They	1003	" I say , what 's this frightful piece of fish ? "
27930	27938	27882	27882	Tony	219	" The waiter said you ordered it . "
27939	27944	27968	27968	They	1003	" Perhaps I did . "
27945	27955	27957	27957	Babs	260	" I 'll give it to the club cat , "
27959	27967	27957	27957	Babs	260	" She 's a dear called Blackberry . "
27978	27989	27975	27975	Jock	187	" D'you think we ought to ring up Brenda again ? "
27990	28001	27968	27968	They	1003	" Perhaps we ought . She sounded annoyed with us . "
28002	28016	27975	27975	Jock	187	" Let 's go now and ring her up on the way out . "
28017	28026	28028	28028	Babs	260	" Are n't you coming home with us ? "
28030	28040	27975	27975	Jock	187	" Not to - night , I 'm afraid . "
28041	28046	28048	28048	Milly	259	" Be a sport , "
28050	28058	27975	27975	Jock	187	" No , we ca n't really . "
28059	28080	28082	28082	Babs	260	" All right . Well , how about a little present ? We 're professional dancing partners , you know , "
28084	28093	27975	27975	Jock	187	" Oh yes , sorry , how much ? "
28094	28104	27975	27975	Jock	187	" Oh , we leave that to the gentlemen . "
28111	28120	28122	28122	Babs	260	" You might make it a bit more , "
28124	28133	28122	28122	Babs	260	" We 've sat with you two hours . "
28139	28154	28156	28156	Milly	259	" Come and see us again one evening when you 've got more time , "
28158	28165	28167	28167	Tony	219	" I 'm feeling rather ill , "
28173	28185	28167	28167	Tony	219	" Do n't think I shall bother to ring up Brenda . "
28186	28191	28206	28208	the seedy commissionaire	1006	" Send a message . "
28192	28202	28203	28203	he	219	" That 's a good idea ... Look here , "
28210	28246	28247	28247	He	219	" Will you ring up this Sloane number and speak to her ladyship and say Mr Grant - Menzies and Mr Last are very sorry but they can not call this evening ? Got that ? "
28262	28274	28275	28275	he	219	" Brenda ca n't expect us to do more than that , "
28278	28315	28249	28250	the man	1007	" I tell you what I 'll do . I go almost past her door , so I 'll ring the bell a bit just in case she 's awake and still waiting up for us . "
28316	28332	28371	28371	his	219	" Yes , you do that . What a good friend you are , Jock . "
28333	28346	28249	28250	the man	1007	" Oh , I 'm fond of Brenda ... a grand girl . "
28347	28359	28371	28371	his	219	" Grand girl ... I wish I did n't feel ill . "
28425	28435	28421	28421	her	233	" Well , Tony , how do you feel ? "
28436	28445	28421	28421	her	233	" Awful . I _ was _ tight . "
28446	28450	28421	28421	her	233	" You were . "
28451	28459	28421	28421	her	233	" I 'm feeling pretty guilty too . "
28460	28466	28421	28421	her	233	" I 'm not surprised . "
28467	28488	28421	28421	her	233	" I do n't remember everything very clearly but I have the impression that Jock and I were rather bores . "
28489	28493	28421	28421	her	233	" You were . "
28494	28501	28421	28421	her	233	" Are you in a rage ? "
28502	28525	28421	28421	her	233	" Well , I was last night . What made you do it , Tony , grown up men like you two ? "
28526	28531	28421	28421	her	233	" We felt low . "
28532	28552	28421	28421	her	233	" I bet you feel lower this morning ... A box of white roses has just arrived from Jock . "
28553	28562	28421	28421	her	233	" I wish I 'd thought of that . "
28563	28573	28421	28421	her	233	" You 're such infants , both of you . "
28574	28583	28421	28421	her	233	" You are n't really in a rage ? "
28584	28613	28421	28421	her	233	" Of course I 'm not , darling . Now just you go straight back to the country . You 'll feel all right again to - morrow . "
28614	28623	28421	28421	her	233	" Am I not going to see you ? "
28624	28661	28421	28421	her	233	" Not to - day , I 'm afraid . I 've got lectures all the morning and I 'm lunching out . But I 'll be coming down on Friday evening or anyway Saturday morning . "
28662	28678	28421	28421	her	233	" I see . You could n't possibly chuck lunch or one of the lectures ? "
28679	28685	28421	28421	her	233	" Not possibly , darling . "
28686	28702	28421	28421	her	233	" I see . You are an angel to be so sweet about last night . "
28703	28711	28712	28712	Brenda	233	" Nothing could have been more fortunate , "
28715	28807	28712	28712	Brenda	233	" If I know Tony , he 'll be tortured with guilt for weeks to come . It was maddening last night but it was worth it . He 's put himself so much in the wrong now that he wo n't dare to _ feel _ resentful , let alone say anything , whatever I do . And he has n't really enjoyed himself at all , the poor sweet , so _ that 's _ a good thing too . He had to learn not to make surprise visits . "
28808	28818	28820	28820	Beaver	175	" You are one for making people learn things , "
28848	28881	28837	28838	John Andrew	174	" Hullo , daddy , had a good time in London ? You did n't mind me coming to the station , did you ? I _ made _ nanny let me . "
28882	28891	28846	28846	him	219	" Very pleased to see you , John . "
28892	28897	28837	28838	John Andrew	174	" How was mummy ? "
28898	28910	28846	28846	him	219	" She sounded very well . I did n't see her . "
28911	28924	28837	28838	John Andrew	174	" But you _ said _ you were going to see her . "
28925	28951	28846	28846	him	219	" Yes , I thought I was , but I turned out to be wrong . I talked to her several times on the telephone . "
28952	28987	28837	28838	John Andrew	174	" But you can telephone her from here , ca n't you , daddy ? Why did you go all the way to London to telephone her ? ... _ Why _ , daddy ? "
28988	28997	28846	28846	him	219	" It would take too long to explain . "
28998	29012	28837	28838	John Andrew	174	" Well tell me some of it ... _ Why _ , daddy ? "
29013	29041	28846	28846	him	219	" Look here , I 'm tired . If you do n't stop asking questions I sha n't let you ever come and meet the train again . "
29050	29065	29042	29043	John Andrew	174	" I thought you 'd _ like _ me to come and meet you . "
29066	29088	29118	29119	the chauffeur	859	" If you cry I shall put you in front with Dawson . It 's absurd to cry at your age . "
29089	29101	29103	29104	John Andrew	174	" I 'd _ sooner _ go in front with Dawson , "
29166	29191	29163	29163	he	219	" Nanny , I do n't want John to come to the station in future unless her ladyship or I specially say he can . "
29192	29235	29163	29163	he	219	" No , sir , I would n't have let him go to - day , only he went on so . Come along now , John , and take off your coat . Goodness , child , where 's your handkerchief ? "
29248	29254	29255	29255	he	219	" Two men of thirty , "
29260	29303	29255	29255	he	219	" behaving as if they were up for the night from Sandhurst -- getting drunk and ringing people up and dancing with tarts at the Old Hundredth ... And it makes it all the worse that Brenda was so nice about it . "
29321	29340	29318	29318	he	219	" Ambrose , when I 'm alone I think in future I 'll have dinner in the library . "
29454	29467	29446	29446	he	219	" This time to - morrow Brenda and Jock will be here . "
29490	29515	29479	29479	He	219	" Ambrose , when I 'm alone I do n't really need a long dinner . In future I 'll just have two courses . "
29538	29551	29536	29536	himself	219	" When I wake up it will be the week - end . "
29594	29606	29607	29607	Tony	219	" I suppose he 's made it up with that girl , "
29895	29903	29892	29892	John	174	" She usually does better than this . "
29906	29913	29892	29892	John	174	" When 's mummy coming down ? "
29914	29921	29887	29887	he	219	" Not till to - morrow . "
29922	29925	29892	29892	John	174	" Oh . "
29926	29953	29887	29887	he	219	" I 've got to go over to Little Bayton this afternoon . Would you like to come too and perhaps we could see the kennels ? "
29965	29971	29972	29972	he	174	" No , thank you , "
29975	29986	29972	29972	he	174	" I want to finish a picture I 'm painting . "
29987	29995	29887	29887	he	219	" You can do that any time . "
29996	30005	29972	29972	he	174	" I want to do it this afternoon . "
30015	30039	30012	30012	Ben	212	" Whatever made you speak to your dad like that for ? You 've been going on about seeing the kennels since Christmas . "
30040	30047	30049	30049	John	174	" Not with _ him _ , "
30051	30068	30012	30012	Ben	212	" You ungrateful little bastard , that 's a lousy way to speak of your dad . "
30069	30088	30012	30012	Ben	212	" And you ought not to say bastard or lousy in front of me , nanny says not . "
30183	30194	30196	30197	Mrs Beaver	170	" My poor Brenda , it 's an appalling room , "
30199	30210	30212	30212	Tony	219	" It 's not one we use a great deal , "
30216	30222	30224	30228	the one they called Veronica	1044	" I should think not , "
30230	30240	30242	30242	Polly	1046	" I ca n't see much wrong with it , "
30244	30252	30242	30242	Polly	1046	" except it 's a bit mouldy . "
30253	30257	30258	30258	Brenda	233	" You see , "
30266	30333	30258	30258	Brenda	233	" What I thought was that I must have _ one _ habitable room downstairs . At present there 's only the smoking - room and the library . The drawing - room is vast and quite out of the question . I thought what I needed was a small sitting - room more or less to myself . Do n't you think it has possibilities ? "
30334	30348	30350	30350	Daisy	228	" But , my angel , the _ shape 's _ all wrong , "
30352	30390	30350	30350	Daisy	228	" and that chimney - piece -- what is it made of , pink granite , and all the plaster work and the dado . _ Everything 's _ horrible . It 's so _ dark _ . "
30391	30399	30401	30402	Mrs Beaver	170	" I know exactly what Brenda wants , "
30406	30502	30401	30402	Mrs Beaver	170	" I do n't think it will be impossible . I must think about it . As Veronica says , the structure does rather limit one ... you know , I think the only thing to do would be to disregard it altogether and find some treatment so definite that it _ carried _ the room , if you see what I mean ... supposing we covered the walls with white chromium plating and had natural sheepskin carpet ... I wonder if that would be running you in for more than you meant to spend ? "
30503	30514	30516	30516	Veronica	264	" I 'd blow the whole thing sky - high , "
30530	30544	30589	30589	he	219	" D'you really want Mrs Beaver to do up the morning - room ? "
30545	30554	30589	30589	he	219	" Not if you do n't , sweet . "
30555	30566	30589	30589	he	219	" But can you imagine it -- white chromium plating ? "
30567	30576	30589	30589	he	219	" Oh , that was just an idea . "
30597	30601	30602	30602	he	219	" I say , "
30610	30624	30602	30602	he	219	" You are n't going away to - morrow too , are you ? "
30625	30628	30593	30593	they	1047	" Must . "
30660	30665	30667	30667	Brenda	233	" By the way , "
30669	30683	30667	30667	Brenda	233	" what did you think about keeping on Grimshawe?--it seems rather a waste . "
30684	30698	30602	30602	he	219	" You used always to say you could n't get on without her . "
30699	30715	30667	30667	Brenda	233	" Yes , but now I 'm living at the flat everything 's so simple . "
30716	30734	30602	30602	he	219	" _ Living ? _ Darling , you talk as though you had settled there for good . "
30735	30750	30667	30667	Brenda	233	" D'you mind moving a second , sweet ? I ca n't see properly . "
30751	30766	30602	30602	he	219	" Brenda , how long are you going on with this course of economics ? "
30767	30775	30667	30667	Brenda	233	" Me ? I do n't know . "
30776	30784	30602	30602	he	219	" But you must have some idea ? "
30785	30807	30667	30667	Brenda	233	" Oh , it 's surprising what a lot there is to learn ... I was so backward when I started ... "
30808	30811	30602	30602	he	219	" Brenda ... "
30812	30830	30667	30667	Brenda	233	" Now run and put on your coat . They 'll all be downstairs waiting for us . "
31008	31013	31014	31014	she	233	" Why , Tony , "
31060	31065	31066	31066	she	233	" Why , Tony , "
31069	31075	31066	31066	she	233	" I was almost asleep . "
31076	31080	31032	31032	her	233	" Very tired ? "
31081	31084	31066	31066	she	233	" Mm . "
31085	31092	31032	31032	her	233	" Want to be left alone ? "
31093	31111	31066	31066	she	233	" So tired ... and I 've just drunk a lot of that stuff of Polly 's . "
31112	31121	31032	31032	her	233	" I see ... well , good night . "
31122	31137	31066	31066	she	233	" Good night ... do n't mind , do you ? ... so tired . "
31176	31185	31147	31147	she	233	" Lady Brenda not ill , I hope ? "
31186	31219	31147	31147	she	233	" No , nothing serious , thank you very much . She gets rather done up in London , you know , during the week , and likes to take Sunday quietly . "
31220	31229	31147	31147	she	233	" And how are the great studies progressing ? "
31230	31244	31147	31147	she	233	" Very well , I gather . She seems keen on it still . "
31245	31271	31147	31147	she	233	" Splendid . We shall all be coming to her soon to solve our economic problems . But I daresay you and John miss her ? "
31272	31279	31147	31147	she	233	" Yes , we do rather . "
31280	31290	31147	31147	she	233	" Well , please give her my kindest regards . "
31291	31301	31147	31147	she	233	" I will indeed . Thank you so much . "
31354	31386	31345	31345	He	219	" Come in , darling , it is n't anything . It 's only we had a bet on what coloured buttonhole you 'd be wearing and none of us won . "
31411	31463	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" Any time you are buying cuttings or seeds do get them through me . I 've made quite a little business of it , perhaps you did n't know ... all kinds of rather unusual flowers . I do everything like that for Sylvia Newport and all sorts of people . "
31464	31475	31345	31345	He	219	" You must talk to my head man about it . "
31476	31500	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" Well , to tell you the truth I _ have_--this morning while you were in church . He seems quite to understand . "
31521	31528	31518	31518	Daisy	228	" Golly , what a house . "
31529	31543	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" Now you can see what I 've been through all these years . "
31544	31549	31551	31551	Veronica	264	" My poor Brenda , "
31569	31573	31574	31574	Brenda	233	" You know , "
31579	31590	31574	31574	Brenda	233	" I 'm not _ absolutely _ happy about Tony . "
31591	31601	31603	31603	Polly	223	" What 's the old boy been up to ? "
31605	31626	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" Nothing much yet , but I do see it 's pretty boring for him at Hetton all this time . "
31627	31633	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" I should n't worry . "
31634	31663	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" Oh , I 'm not _ worrying _ . It 's only , supposing he took to drink or something . It would make everything very difficult . "
31664	31684	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" I should n't have said that was his thing ... We must get him interested in a girl . "
31685	31695	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" If only we could ... Who is there ? "
31696	31703	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" There 's always old Sybil . "
31704	31715	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" Darling , he 's known her all his life . "
31716	31724	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" Or Souki de Foucauld - Esterhazy . "
31725	31734	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" He is n't his best with Americans . "
31735	31744	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" Well , we 'll find him someone . "
31745	31780	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" The trouble is that I 've become such a habit with him -- he wo n't take easily to a new one ... ought she to be like me , or quite different ? "
31781	31794	31405	31406	Mrs Beaver	170	" I 'd say different , but it 's hard to tell . "
32004	32017	31990	31990	him	187	" Are you _ certain _ Jenny will be Tony 's tea ? "
32018	32026	32028	32028	Polly	223	" You ca n't ever be certain , "
32030	32044	32028	32028	Polly	223	" She bores my pants off , but she 's a good trier . "
32050	32061	31990	31990	him	187	" Is mummy coming down to - day , daddy ? "
32062	32065	31990	31990	him	187	" Yes . "
32066	32070	31990	31990	him	187	" Who else ? "
32071	32078	31990	31990	him	187	" Someone called Jenny Abdul Akbar . "
32079	32089	31990	31990	him	187	" What a silly name . Is she foreign ? "
32090	32096	31990	31990	him	187	" I do n't know . "
32097	32123	31990	31990	him	187	" Sounds foreign , does n't she , daddy ? D'you think she wo n't be able to talk any English ? Is she black ? "
32124	32129	31990	31990	him	187	" Mummy says not . "
32130	32136	31990	31990	him	187	" Oh ... who else ? "
32137	32141	31990	31990	him	187	" Lady Cockpurse . "
32142	32197	31990	31990	him	187	" The monkey - woman . You know she was n't a bit like a monkey except perhaps her face and I do n't think she had a tail because I looked as close as anything ... unless perhaps she has it rolled up between her legs . D'you think she has , daddy ? "
32198	32205	31990	31990	him	187	" I should n't be surprised . "
32206	32212	31990	31990	him	187	" _ Very _ uncomfortable . "
32247	32259	32260	32260	she	223	" Give the girl a chance to get down to it , "
32389	32394	32369	32371	men at work	1080	" Princess Abdul Akbar . "
32411	32417	32418	32418	she	1077	" Oh , Mr Last , "
32421	32430	32418	32418	she	1077	" what a sweet old place this is . "
32431	32443	32445	32445	Tony	219	" I 'm afraid it 's been restored a great deal , "
32447	32497	32418	32418	she	1077	" Ah , but its _ atmosphere _ . I always think that 's what counts in a house . Such dignity , and repose . But of course you 're used to it . When you 've been very unhappy as I have , you appreciate these things . "
32501	32520	32498	32498	Tony	219	" I 'm afraid Brenda has n't arrived yet . She 's coming by car with Lady Cockpurse . "
32521	32533	32534	32535	The Princess	1082	" Brenda 's been _ such _ a friend to me . "
32555	32565	32534	32535	The Princess	1082	" D'you mind if I take off my hat ? "
32566	32574	32498	32498	Tony	219	" No , no ... of course . "
32595	32629	32630	32630	Princess	1083	" D'you know , Mr Last , I 'm going to call you Teddy right away . You do n't think that very fresh of me ? And you must call me Jenny . "
32631	32651	32652	32652	she	1082	" is so formal , is n't it , and suggests tight trousers and gold braid ... Of course , "
32675	32681	32658	32658	her	1082	" my husband was not called "
32683	32736	32665	32665	her	1082	" in Morocco ; his title was Moulay -- but there 's no proper equivalent for a woman , so I 've always called myself Princess in Europe ... Moulay is _ far _ higher really ... my husband was a descendant of the Prophet . Are you interested in the East ? "
32737	32751	32658	32658	her	1082	" No ... yes . I mean I know very little about it . "
32752	32784	32665	32665	her	1082	" It has an uncanny fascination for me . You must go there , Teddy . I know you 'd like it . I 've been saying the same to Brenda . "
32785	32796	32798	32798	Tony	219	" I expect you 'd like to see your room , "
32800	32807	32798	32798	Tony	219	" They 'll bring tea soon . "
32808	32865	32665	32665	her	1082	" No , I 'll stay here . I like just to curl up like a cat in front of the fire , and if you 're nice to me I 'll purr , and if you 're cruel I shall pretend not to notice -- just like a cat ... Shall I purr , Teddy ? "
32866	32883	32798	32798	Tony	219	" Er ... yes ... do , please , if that 's what you like doing . "
32884	32948	32665	32665	her	1082	" Englishmen are so gentle and considerate . It 's wonderful to be back among them ... mine own people . Sometimes when I look back at my life , especially at times like this , among lovely old English things and kind people , I think the whole thing must be a frightful nightmare ... then I remember my _ scars _ ... "
32949	32973	32798	32798	Tony	219	" Brenda tells me you 've taken one of the flats in the same house as hers . They must be very convenient . "
32974	33023	32665	32665	her	1082	" How English you are , Teddy -- so shy of talking about personal things , intimate things ... I like you for that , you know . I love everything that 's solid and homely and _ good _ after ... after all I 've been through . "
33024	33038	32798	32798	Tony	219	" You 're not studying economics too , are you , like Brenda ? "
33039	33066	32665	32665	her	1082	" No ; is Brenda ? She never told me . What a wonderful person she is . When _ does _ she find the time ? "
33067	33076	33078	33078	Tony	219	" Ah , here comes tea at last , "
33080	33116	33078	33078	Tony	219	" I hope you allow yourself to eat muffins . So many of our guests nowadays are on a diet . I think muffins one of the few things that make the English winter endurable . "
33117	33124	33126	33126	Jenny	271	" Muffins stand for so much , "
33184	33194	33227	33227	her	1084	" Come and be introduced to Princess Abdul Akbar . "
33211	33222	33229	33229	she	1084	" Are n't you going to give me a kiss ? "
33236	33239	33240	33240	he	174	" Oh , "
33256	33262	33240	33240	he	174	" What a beautiful smell . "
33263	33273	33274	33274	she	1084	" It 's my last link with the East , "
33277	33286	33240	33240	he	174	" You 've got butter on your chin . "
33295	33312	33287	33287	She	1084	" Why , so I have . Teddy , you _ might _ have told me . "
33313	33321	33240	33240	he	174	" Why do you call daddy Teddy ? "
33322	33334	33287	33287	She	1084	" Because I hope we are going to be great friends . "
33335	33341	33240	33240	he	174	" What a funny reason . "
33358	33365	33366	33366	he	174	" Have you got a crown ? "
33369	33402	33366	33366	he	174	" How did you learn to speak English ? What is that big ring made of ? Did it cost much ? Why are your nails that colour ? Can you ride ? "
33431	33440	33441	33441	she	1084	" That is my only crown ... now , "
33484	33490	33446	33446	him	174	" On the Moulay 's birthday-- "
33491	33497	33446	33446	him	174	" What 's the Moulay ? "
33498	33507	33508	33508	she	1084	" A beautiful and a very bad man , "
33512	33559	33508	33508	she	1084	" and on his birthday all his horsemen used to assemble round a great square , with all their finest clothes and trappings and jewels , with long swords in their hands . The Moulay used to sit on a throne under a great crimson canopy . "
33560	33566	33446	33446	him	174	" What 's a canopy ? "
33567	33572	33573	33573	she	1084	" Like a tent , "
33586	33674	33573	33573	she	1084	" and all the horsemen used to gallop across the plain , in a great cloud of dust , waving their swords , straight towards the Moulay . And everyone used to hold their breath , thinking the horsemen were bound to ride right on top of the Moulay , but when they were a few feet away , as near as I am to you , galloping at full speed , they used to rein their horses back , up on to their hind legs and salute-- "
33675	33685	33687	33687	John	174	" Oh , but they _ should n't _ , "
33689	33703	33687	33687	John	174	" It 's _ very _ bad horsemanship indeed . Ben says so . "
33704	33719	33573	33573	she	1084	" They 're the most wonderful horsemen in the world . Everyone knows that . "
33720	33751	33687	33687	John	174	" Oh , no , they ca n't be , if they do _ that _ . It 's one of the _ worst _ things . Were they natives ? "
33752	33758	33573	33573	she	1084	" Yes , of course . "
33759	33770	33687	33687	John	174	" Ben says natives are n't humans at all really . "
33771	33790	33573	33573	she	1084	" Ah , but he 's thinking of Negroes , I expect . These are pure Semitic type . "
33791	33796	33687	33687	John	174	" What 's that ? "
33797	33803	33573	33573	she	1084	" The same as Jews . "
33804	33813	33687	33687	John	174	" Ben says Jews are worse than natives . "
33814	33839	33573	33573	she	1084	" Oh dear , what a very severe boy you are . I was like that once . Life teaches one to be tolerant . "
33840	33847	33849	33849	John	174	" It has n't taught Ben , "
33851	33874	33849	33849	John	174	" When 's mummy coming ? I thought she 'd be here , otherwise I would n't have stopped painting my picture . "
33896	33904	33905	33905	she	2412	" Good night , Johnny - boy , "
33908	33915	33942	33942	he	174	" What did you call me ? "
33916	33921	33942	33942	he	174	" Johnny - boy . "
33922	33929	33942	33942	he	174	" You are funny with names . "
33945	33960	33942	33942	he	174	" Nanny , I do think that Princess is beautiful , do n't you ? "
33964	33977	33978	33978	she	217	" It would be a dull world if we all thought alike , "
33981	34017	33942	33942	he	174	" She 's more beautiful than Miss Tendril , even . I think she 's the most beautiful lady I 've ever seen ... D'you think she 'd like to watch me have my bath ? "
34023	34141	34020	34020	Jenny	271	" What a heavenly child ... I love children . That has been my great tragedy . It was when he found I could n't have children that the Moulay first showed the Other Side of his Nature . It was n't my fault ... you see my womb is out of place ... I do n't know why I 'm telling you all this , but I feel you 'll understand . It 's such a _ waste of time _ , is n't it , when one knows one is going to like someone and one goes on _ pretending _ ... I know at once if someone is going to be a real friend ... "
34158	34163	34165	34165	John	174	" Oh , mummy , "
34167	34195	34165	34165	John	174	" there 's such a beautiful lady downstairs . Do ask her to come and say good night . Nanny does n't think she 'd want to . "
34196	34204	34236	34236	Brenda	233	" Did daddy seem to like her ? "
34205	34235	34165	34165	John	174	" He did n't talk much ... She does n't know anything about horses or natives but she _ is _ beautiful . Please tell her to come up . "
34252	34276	34236	34236	Brenda	233	" You 've made a wild success with John Andrew . He wo n't go to sleep until he 's seen you again . "
34286	34293	34283	34283	Jenny	271	" They 're both such dears . "
34294	34314	34236	34236	Brenda	233	" Did you and Tony get on ? I was so sorry not to be here when you arrived . "
34315	34329	34283	34283	Jenny	271	" He was _ so _ sympathetic and gentle ... and so wistful . "
34356	34361	34362	34362	she	271	" Back to bed , "
34365	34372	34362	34362	she	271	" or I shall spank you . "
34373	34385	34418	34418	nanny	1096	" Would you do it hard ? I should n't mind . "
34386	34390	34392	34392	Brenda	233	" Oh dear , "
34394	34413	34392	34392	Brenda	233	" what a terrible effect you seem to have . He 's never like this as a rule . "
34424	34427	34428	34428	she	1096	" Poof ! "
34431	34438	34428	34428	she	1096	" making the whole place stink . "
34439	34454	34418	34418	nanny	1096	" Do n't you like it ? _ I _ think it 's lovely . "
34495	34501	34502	34502	she	233	" How 's it going ? "
34506	34521	34418	34418	nanny	1096	" Too soon to tell . I 'm sure it will be all right . "
34522	34540	34491	34491	he	274	" She 's got the wrong chap . John Andrew 's mad about her ... quite embarrassing . "
34541	34568	34418	34418	nanny	1096	" I should say Tony was a slow starter . It 's a pity she 's got his name wrong . Ought we to tell her ? "
34569	34577	34491	34491	he	274	" No , let 's leave it . "
34586	34598	34583	34583	Tony	219	" Brenda , who _ is _ this joke - woman ? "
34599	34608	34614	34614	her	233	" Darling , do n't you like her ? "
34624	34645	34620	34620	Tony	219	" I do n't know about not liking her exactly . She 's just a joke , is n't she ? "
34646	34663	34614	34614	her	233	" Is she ... oh dear ... She 's had a terrible life , you know . "
34664	34669	34620	34620	Tony	219	" So I gathered . "
34670	34680	34614	34614	her	233	" Be nice to her , Tony , please . "
34681	34696	34620	34620	Tony	219	" Oh , I 'll be nice to her . Is she a Jewess ? "
34697	34711	34614	34614	her	233	" I do n't know . I never thought . Perhaps she is . "
34731	34739	34740	34740	she	233	" Leave the young couple to it , "
34746	34781	34620	34620	Tony	219	" My dear , I do n't believe it 's going to be any good ... the poor old boy 's got _ some _ taste you know , and a sense of humour . "
34782	34796	34620	34620	Tony	219	" She did n't show up too well at dinner , did she ? "
34797	34828	34620	34620	Tony	219	" She will _ go on _ so ... and , after all , Tony 's been used to me for seven years . It 's rather a sudden change . "
34834	34837	34740	34740	she	233	" Tired ? "
34838	34844	34740	34740	she	233	" Mmm . Little bit . "
34845	34857	34740	34740	she	233	" You gave me a pretty long bout of Abdul Akbar . "
34858	34889	34740	34740	she	233	" I know . I 'm sorry , darling , but Polly takes so long to get to bed ... Was it awful ? I wish you liked her more . "
34890	34895	34740	34740	she	233	" She 's awful . "
34896	34911	34740	34740	she	233	" One has to make allowances ... she 's got the most terrible scars . "
34912	34918	34740	34740	she	233	" So she told me . "
34919	34925	34740	34740	she	233	" I 've seen them . "
34926	34937	34740	34740	she	233	" Besides , I hoped to see something of you . "
34938	34941	34740	34740	she	233	" Oh . "
34942	34961	34740	34740	she	233	" Brenda , you are n't angry still about my getting tight that night and waking you up ? "
34962	34972	34740	34740	she	233	" No , sweet , do I seem angry ? "
34973	34991	34740	34740	she	233	" ... I do n't know . You do rather ... Has it been an amusing week ? "
34992	35005	34740	34740	she	233	" Not amusing , very hard work . Bimetallism , you know . "
35006	35022	34740	34740	she	233	" Oh , yes ... well , I suppose you want to go to sleep . "
35023	35034	34740	34740	she	233	" Mm ... so tired . Good night , darling . "
35035	35039	34740	34740	she	233	" Good night . "
35045	35059	34740	34740	she	233	" Can I go and say good morning to the Princess , mummy ? "
35060	35070	34740	34740	she	233	" I do n't expect she 's awake yet . "
35071	35096	34740	34740	she	233	" Please , mummy , may I go and see ? I 'll just peep and , if she 's asleep , go away . "
35097	35108	34740	34740	she	233	" I do n't know what room she 's in . "
35109	35115	35117	35117	Grimshawe	267	" Galahad , my lady , "
35126	35136	35192	35192	He	174	" Oh dear , why was she put there ? "
35137	35148	35192	35192	He	174	" It was Mr Last 's orders , my lady . "
35149	35159	35192	35192	He	174	" Well , she 's probably awake , then . "
35174	35180	35160	35160	John	174	" May I come in ? "
35181	35191	35192	35192	He	174	" Hullo , Johnny - boy . Come in . "
35210	35224	35192	35192	He	174	" Have you had breakfast ? Mummy said you would n't be awake . "
35225	35263	35192	35192	He	174	" I 've been awake a long time . You see I was once very badly hurt , and now I do n't always sleep well . Even the softest beds are too hard for me now . "
35264	35280	35192	35192	He	174	" Ooh . What did you do ? Was it a motor - car accident ? "
35281	35321	35192	35192	He	174	" Not an accident , Johnny - boy , not an accident ... but come in . It 's cold with the door open . Look , there are some grapes here . Would you like to eat them ? "
35329	35340	35322	35322	Johnny	279	" What are you going to do to - day ? "
35341	35354	35160	35160	John	174	" I do n't know yet . I have n't been told . "
35355	35480	35482	35482	Father	281	" Well , I 'll tell you . We 'll go to church in the morning because I have to and then we 'll go and look at Thunderclap and I 'll show you the place we jump and then you can come with me while I have dinner because I have it early and afterwards we can go down to Bruton Wood and we need n't take nanny because it makes her so muddy and you can see where they dug out a fox in the drain just outside the wood , he nearly got away , and then you can come and have tea in the nursery and I 've got a little gramophone Uncle Reggie gave me for Christmas and it plays "
35486	35519	35192	35192	He	174	" , do you know that song ? Ben can sing it and I 've got some books to show you and a picture I did of the battle of Marston Moor . "
35520	35548	35192	35192	He	174	" I think that sounds a lovely day . But do n't you think I ought to spend some time with daddy and mummy and Lady Cockpurse ? "
35549	35582	35192	35192	He	174	" Oh , _ them _ ... besides , it 's all my foot about Lady Cockpurse having a tail . Please , you _ will _ spend the day with me ? "
35583	35590	35192	35192	He	174	" Well , we 'll see . "
35596	35615	35753	35753	Brenda	233	" She 's gone to church with him . That 's a good sign , is n't it ? "
35616	35643	35753	35753	Brenda	233	" Well , not really , Polly . He likes going alone , or with me . It 's the time he gossips to the village . "
35644	35651	35753	35753	Brenda	233	" She wo n't stop him . "
35652	35674	35753	35753	Brenda	233	" I 'm afraid you do n't understand the old boy altogether . He 's much odder than you 'd think . "
35680	35695	35783	35783	he	219	" I could see from your sermon that you knew the East , Rector . "
35696	35706	35783	35783	he	219	" Yes , yes , most of my life . "
35707	35718	35783	35783	he	219	" It has an uncanny fascination , has n't it ? "
35719	35725	35727	35727	John	174	" Oh , come on , "
35734	35742	35727	35727	John	174	" We must go and see Thunderclap . "
35756	35766	35753	35753	Brenda	233	" Why do n't you show Jenny the house ? "
35767	35775	35783	35783	he	219	" Oh yes , _ do _ . "
35786	35794	35783	35783	he	219	" Brenda 's having it done up . "
35806	35822	35783	35783	he	219	" Oh , Teddy , what a shame . I do hate seeing things modernized . "
35823	35834	35783	35783	he	219	" It is n't a room we used very much . "
35835	35841	35783	35783	he	219	" No , but still ... "
35867	35912	35842	35842	She	233	" You know , Brenda 's been a wonderful friend to me . I would n't say anything against her ... but ever since I came here I 've been wondering whether she really understands this beautiful place and all it means to you . "
35913	35922	35924	35924	Tony	219	" Tell me more about your terrible life , "
35934	35972	35842	35842	She	233	" You _ are _ shy of talking about yourself , are n't you , Teddy ? It 's a mistake , you know , to keep things bottled up . I 've been very unhappy too . "
35987	35994	35996	35999	a firm , child	1109	" Oh , there you are , "
36003	36026	35996	35999	a firm , child	1109	" Come on . We 're going down to the woods now . We must hurry , otherwise it will be dark . "
36027	36045	36092	36092	him	219	" Oh , Johnny - boy , must I really ? I was just talking to daddy . "
36046	36071	35996	35999	a firm , child	1109	" _ Come on . _ It 's all arranged . And afterwards you 're to be allowed to have tea with me upstairs . "
36098	36121	36090	36090	Brenda	233	" _ Tony _ , here all alone ? We thought you were with Jenny . What have you done with her ? "
36122	36137	36092	36092	him	219	" John took her off ... just in time before I said something rude . "
36138	36171	36090	36090	Brenda	233	" Oh dear ... well there 's only me and Polly in the smoking - room . Come and have some tea . You look all funny -- have you been asleep ? "
36177	36188	36090	36090	Brenda	233	" We must write it down a failure , definitely . "
36189	36210	36092	36092	him	219	" What _ does _ the old boy expect ? It is n't as though he was everybody 's money . "
36211	36230	36090	36090	Brenda	233	" I daresay it would have been all right , if she had n't got his name wrong . "
36231	36257	36092	36092	him	219	" Anyway , this lets _ you _ out . You 've done far more than most wives would to cheer the old boy up . "
36258	36266	36268	36268	Brenda	233	" Yes , that 's certainly true , "
36284	36295	36296	36296	she	233	" I sha n't be here next week - end , "
36299	36308	36296	36296	she	233	" I 'm going to stay with Veronica . "
36309	36314	36092	36092	him	219	" Am I asked ? "
36315	36340	36296	36296	she	233	" Well , you _ were _ , of course , but I refused for you . You know you always hate staying away . "
36341	36348	36092	36092	him	219	" I would n't mind coming . "
36349	36400	36296	36296	she	233	" Oh , darling , I wish I 'd known . Veronica would have loved it so ... but I 'm afraid it will be too late now . She 's only got a tiny house ... to tell you the truth I did n't think you liked her much . "
36401	36408	36092	36092	him	219	" I hated her like hell . "
36409	36415	36296	36296	she	233	" Well , then ... ? "
36416	36443	36092	36092	him	219	" Oh , it does n't matter . I suppose you must go back on Monday ? The hounds are meeting on Wednesday , you know . "
36444	36452	36296	36296	she	233	" Are we giving them a lawner ? "
36453	36465	36092	36092	him	219	" Yes , darling , you know we do every year . "
36466	36471	36296	36296	she	233	" So we do . "
36472	36481	36092	36092	him	219	" You could n't stay down till then ? "
36482	36518	36296	36296	she	233	" Not possibly , darling . You see if I miss one lecture I get right behind and ca n't follow the next . Besides , I am not mad keen to see the hounds . "
36519	36531	36092	36092	him	219	" Ben was asking if we 'd let John go out . "
36532	36541	36296	36296	she	233	" Oh , he 's far too young . "
36542	36573	36092	36092	him	219	" Not to hunt . But I thought he might bring his pony to the meet and ride with them to the first covert . He 'd love it so . "
36574	36580	36296	36296	she	233	" Is it quite safe ? "
36581	36588	36092	36092	him	219	" Oh , yes , surely ? "
36589	36604	36296	36296	she	233	" Bless his heart , I wish I could be here to see him . "
36605	36611	36092	36092	him	219	" Do change your mind . "
36612	36634	36296	36296	she	233	" Oh no , that 's quite out of the question . Do n't make a thing about it , Tony . "
36711	36721	36723	36723	Brenda	233	" The old boy 's happy as a lark , "
36727	36738	36723	36723	Brenda	233	" He 's settling down wonderfully to the new r?gime . "
36751	36760	36762	36762	Jock	187	" Tony nearly had one through the window , "
36771	36783	36784	36784	he	219	" Everything _ is _ all right , is n't it ? "
36788	36796	36723	36723	Brenda	233	" Yes , of course , darling . "
36797	36809	36854	36854	him	219	" I get depressed down here all alone and imagine things . "
36810	36834	36723	36723	Brenda	233	" You are n't to _ brood _ , Tony . You know that 's one of the things that are n't allowed . "
36835	36843	36845	36845	Tony	219	" I wo n't brood any more , "
36878	36889	36723	36723	Brenda	233	" And how are the abstruse sciences , Lady Brenda ? "
36890	36893	36867	36867	him	219	" Absorbing . "
36894	36908	36723	36723	Brenda	233	" We shall all be coming to you for advice about our overdrafts . "
36909	36914	36867	36867	him	219	" Ha , ha . "
36915	36921	36923	36924	Miss Tendril	236	" And how 's Thunderclap ? "
36926	36936	36938	36938	John	174	" I 'm taking her out hunting on Wednesday , "
36954	36998	36999	36999	he	174	" Please God make there be a good scent . Please God make me see the kill . Please God do n't let me do anything wrong . God bless Ben and Thunderclap . Please God make me jump an enormous great oxer , "
37069	37089	37066	37066	Tony	219	" We 've got the hounds meeting at Hetton on Wednesday . Could n't you stay down till then ? "
37090	37107	37022	37022	his	219	" Must be back . There 's going to be a debate on the Pig Scheme . "
37108	37143	37066	37066	Tony	219	" I wish you 'd stay . Look here , why do n't you ask that girl down ? Everyone goes to - morrow . You could ring her up , could n't you ? "
37144	37150	37022	37022	his	219	" I _ could _ . "
37151	37179	37066	37066	Tony	219	" Would she hate it ? She could have Lyonesse -- Polly slept there two week - ends running , so it ca n't be too uncomfortable . "
37180	37195	37022	37022	his	219	" She 'd probably love it . I 'll ring up and ask her . "
37196	37221	37066	37066	Tony	219	" Why do n't you hunt too ? There 's a chap called Brinkwell who 's got some quite decent hirelings , I believe . "
37222	37228	37022	37022	his	219	" Yes , I might . "
37234	37253	37022	37022	his	219	" Jock 's staying on . He 's having the Shameless Blonde down . You do n't mind ? "
37254	37261	37022	37022	his	219	" Me ? Of course not . "
37262	37274	37022	37022	his	219	" This _ has _ been a jolly week - end . "
37275	37283	37022	37022	his	219	" I thought you were enjoying it . "
37284	37295	37022	37022	his	219	" Just like old times -- before the economics began . "
37306	37315	37301	37301	Marjorie	228	" D'you think Tony knows about Mr Beaver ? "
37316	37321	37066	37066	Tony	219	" Not a thing . "
37322	37336	37301	37301	Marjorie	228	" I have n't mentioned it to Allan . D'you suppose he knows ? "
37337	37342	37066	37066	Tony	219	" I doubt it . "
37343	37355	37301	37301	Marjorie	228	" Oh , Jock , how d'you think it 'll end ? "
37356	37366	37066	37066	Tony	219	" She 'll get bored with Beaver soon enough . "
37367	37399	37301	37301	Marjorie	228	" The trouble is that he does n't care for her in the least . If he did , it would soon be over ... What an ass she is being . "
37400	37416	37066	37066	Tony	219	" I should say she was managing it unusually well , if you ask me . "
37431	37441	37428	37429	each other	672	" D'you think Marjorie and Allan know about Brenda ? "
37442	37450	37521	37521	Brenda	233	" I 'm sure they do n't . "
37461	37474	37456	37456	Brenda	233	" Tony 's as happy as a sandboy , is n't he ? "
37475	37480	37428	37429	each other	672	" Full of beans . "
37481	37503	37456	37456	Brenda	233	" I was getting worried about him ... You do n't think he 's got any idea about my goings on ? "
37504	37520	37428	37429	each other	672	" Lord no . It 's the last thing that would come into his head . "
37524	37547	37521	37521	Brenda	233	" I do n't want him to be unhappy , you know ... Marjorie 's been frightfully governessy about the whole thing . "
37548	37560	37428	37429	each other	672	" Has she ? I have n't discussed it with her . "
37561	37569	37521	37521	Brenda	233	" How did _ you _ hear ? "
37570	37599	37428	37429	each other	672	" My dear girl , until this minute I did n't know you had any goings on . And I 'm not asking any questions about them now . "
37600	37608	37521	37521	Brenda	233	" Oh ... I thought everyone knew . "
37609	37665	37428	37429	each other	672	" That 's always the trouble with people when they start walking out . They either think no one knows , or everybody . The truth is that a few people like Polly and Sybil make a point of finding out about everyone 's private life ; the rest of us just are n't interested . "
37666	37669	37521	37521	Brenda	233	" Oh . "
37681	37692	37676	37676	he	1123	" Brenda tried to be confidential about Beaver this evening . "
37693	37701	37428	37429	each other	672	" I did n't know you knew . "
37702	37725	37676	37676	he	1123	" Oh , I knew all right . But I was n't going to let her feel important by talking about it . "
37726	37742	37428	37429	each other	672	" I could n't disapprove more of the whole thing . Do you know Beaver ? "
37743	37763	37676	37676	he	1123	" I 've seen him about . Anyway , it 's her business and Tony 's , not ours . "
38105	38111	38112	38112	she	1138	" Forty - two minutes , "
38115	38126	38112	38112	she	1138	" not at all bad with the wind against me . "
38187	38192	38193	38194	Mrs Rattery	286	" Whoopee , boys . "
38202	38211	38213	38213	John	174	" Are you going to hunt on Wednesday ? "
38215	38224	38213	38213	John	174	" They 're meeting here , you know . "
38225	38251	38193	38194	Mrs Rattery	286	" I might go out for half the day , if I can find a horse . It 'll be the first time this year . "
38252	38260	38213	38213	John	174	" It 's my first time too . "
38261	38269	38273	38273	him	219	" We shall both be terribly stiff . "
38286	38296	38277	38277	he	219	" You 'll have to show me the country . "
38297	38320	38273	38273	him	219	" I expect they 'll draw Bruton Wood first . There 's a big fox there , daddy and I saw him . "
38335	38349	38332	38332	Jock	187	" It 's delightful your coming down . What d'you think of Tony ? "
38350	38368	38277	38277	he	219	" Is he married to that rather lovely woman we saw at the Caf ? de Paris ? "
38369	38372	38332	38332	Jock	187	" Yes . "
38373	38386	38277	38277	he	219	" The one you said was in love with that young man ? "
38387	38390	38332	38332	Jock	187	" Yes . "
38391	38404	38277	38277	he	219	" Funny of her ... What 's this one 's name again ? "
38405	38420	38332	38332	Jock	187	" Tony Last . It 's a pretty ghastly house , is n't it ? "
38421	38431	38277	38277	he	219	" Is it ? I never notice houses much . "
38474	38482	38483	38483	she	1143	" Do n't wait up for me , "
38486	38502	38483	38483	she	1143	" I shall stay here until it comes out . It often takes several hours . "
38523	38533	38520	38520	Jock	187	" Have you got any pigs at the farm ? "
38534	38537	38520	38520	Jock	187	" Yes . "
38538	38549	38520	38520	Jock	187	" Would you mind if I went to see them ? "
38550	38559	38520	38520	Jock	187	" Not in the least -- but why ? "
38560	38580	38520	38520	Jock	187	" And is there a man who looks after them , who will be able to explain about them ? "
38581	38584	38520	38520	Jock	187	" Yes . "
38585	38611	38520	38520	Jock	187	" Well , I think I 'll spend the morning with him . I 've got to make a speech about pigs , fairly soon . "
38637	38643	38644	38644	she	286	" I was down early , "
38647	38672	38644	38644	she	286	" and found the men at work stripping the ceiling . I could n't resist joining in . I hope you do n't mind . "
39254	39270	39244	39244	She	2412	" If I 'm in at the death I expect Colonel Inch will blood me . "
39271	39279	39281	39281	nanny	2412	" You wo n't see any death , "
39302	39315	39316	39316	she	2412	" It 's all a lot of nonsense of Ben Hacket 's , "
39432	39446	39447	39447	she	2412	" It was after eleven before the child got to sleep last night , "
39450	39458	39447	39447	she	2412	" he was that over - excited . "
39492	39504	39505	39505	Tony	219	" He can ride with them as far as the covert , "
39509	39534	39505	39505	Tony	219	" Yes , sir , and there 'd be no harm in his stayin ' a bit to see hounds working , would there ? "
39535	39542	39505	39505	Tony	219	" No , I suppose not . "
39543	39577	39505	39505	Tony	219	" And if he breaks away towards home , there 'd be no harm in our following a bit , if we keeps to the lanes and gates , would there , sir ? "
39578	39593	39505	39505	Tony	219	" No , but he 's not to stay out more than an hour . "
39594	39612	39505	39505	Tony	219	" You would n't have me take him home with hounds running , would you , sir ? "
39613	39625	39505	39505	Tony	219	" Well , he 's got to be in before one . "
39626	39643	39644	39644	he	1198	" I 'll see to that , sir . Do n't you worry , my beauty , "
39649	39658	39644	39644	he	1198	" you 'll get a hunt right enough . "
39743	39750	39739	39739	Ben	212	" Hold on to her , son "
39814	39833	39796	39796	he	174	" I 'm afraid I 'm riding very badly to - day . D'you think anyone has noticed ? "
39834	39855	39890	39890	she	213	" That 's all right , son . You ca n't keep riding - school manners when you 're hunting . "
39865	39873	39874	39874	she	213	" I rather like this absurd horse , "
40150	40159	40161	40161	Jock	187	" That girl will come to no good , "
40226	40236	40209	40209	she	289	" What 's happening , Mr Grant - Menzies ? "
40237	40244	40209	40209	she	289	" Hounds are drawing the covert . "
40245	40248	40209	40209	she	289	" Oh . "
40249	40255	40209	40209	she	289	" Are you enjoying yourself ? "
40256	40274	40209	40209	she	289	" Oh , yes . Thunderclap 's terribly fresh . I 've never known her like this . "
40346	40353	40343	40343	Jock	187	" They 're calling hounds off . "
40354	40363	40343	40343	Jock	187	" Does that mean it 's a blank ? "
40364	40370	40343	40343	Jock	187	" I 'm afraid so . "
40371	40382	40384	40384	Ben	212	" I hate this happening in _ our _ woods , "
40386	40390	40384	40384	Ben	212	" Looks bad . "
40456	40470	40449	40449	Ben	212	" D'you think I ought to take the young gentleman home , sir ? "
40471	40478	40426	40427	the keepers	1225	" What did Mr Last say ? "
40479	40499	40449	40449	Ben	212	" He said he could go as far as the covert . He did n't say which , sir . "
40500	40513	40426	40427	the keepers	1225	" I 'm afraid it sounds as if he ought to go . "
40514	40522	40449	40449	Ben	212	" _ Oh , Mr Menzies ! _ "
40523	40541	40426	40427	the keepers	1225	" Yes , come along , Master John . You 've had enough for to - day . "
40542	40552	40449	40449	Ben	212	" But I have n't had _ any _ . "
40553	40580	40426	40427	the keepers	1225	" If you come back in good time to - day your dad will be all the more willing to let you come out another day . "
40581	40613	40449	40449	Ben	212	" But there may n't _ be _ another day . The world may come to an end . _ Please _ , Ben . _ Please _ , Mr Menzies . "
40614	40625	40627	40627	Ben	212	" It is a shame they should n't have found , "
40629	40638	40627	40627	Ben	212	" He 's been looking forward to it . "
40639	40653	40655	40655	Jock	187	" Still , I think Mr Last would want him to go back , "
40688	40691	40693	40693	Ben	212	" Look , "
40699	40728	40693	40693	Ben	212	" Here comes Miss Ripon on that nappy bay . Seems as if she 's going in , too . Had a fall by the looks of her . "
40753	40760	40761	40761	she	289	" I 'm taking him away , "
40764	40775	40761	40761	she	289	" I ca n't do anything with him this morning . "
40785	40828	40829	40829	she	289	" I thought perhaps Mr Last would let me come up to the house and telephone for the car . I do n't feel like hacking him home in his present state . I ca n't think what 's come over him , "
40833	40849	40829	40829	she	289	" He was out on Saturday . I 've never known him like this before . "
40850	40857	40859	40859	Ben	212	" He wants a man up , "
40861	40880	40882	40883	Miss Ripon	289	" Oh , he 's no better with the groom , and daddy wo n't go near him , "
40889	40912	40882	40883	Miss Ripon	289	" At least ... I mean ... I do n't think that they 'd be any better with him in this state . "
41050	41076	41047	41047	Ben	212	" Let me go first , Miss. He 'll follow . Do n't hold too hard on his mouth and just give him a tap . "
41218	41230	41232	41232	Ben	212	" Take a hold of him , Miss. Use your whip , "
41234	41240	41260	41260	he	1241	" The boy 's down . "
41420	41428	41430	41430	Jock	187	" It 's the most appalling thing , "
41436	41448	41430	41430	Jock	187	" What on earth are we going to say to Tony ? "
41449	41464	41466	41467	Mrs Rattery	286	" I 'm the last person to have about on an occasion like this , "
41511	41515	41516	41516	he	1267	" Killed instantly , "
41519	41546	41516	41516	he	1267	" Took it full on the base of the skull . Very sad , awfully fond of the kid . No one to blame , though . "
41581	41590	41592	41592	Ben	212	" It was n't the kid 's fault , "
41594	41602	41603	41603	they	1273	" It was n't anyone 's fault , "
41606	41620	41622	41622	Ben	212	" He 'd had a lousy day , too , poor little bastard , "
41624	41642	41670	41670	he	219	" If it was anyone 's fault it was Mr Grant - Menzies making him go in . "
41643	41651	41652	41652	they	1273	" It was n't anyone 's fault , "
41680	41688	41670	41670	he	219	" We 've got to tell Brenda . "
41689	41697	41670	41670	he	219	" D'you know where to get her ? "
41698	41743	41670	41670	he	219	" She 's probably at that school ... But we ca n't tell her over the telephone ... Anyway , Ambrose has tried there and the flat but he ca n't get through ... What on earth are we going to say to her ? "
41773	41783	41769	41770	Presently Tony	219	" You were n't anywhere near , were you ? "
41784	41795	41670	41670	he	219	" No , we 'd gone on to another covert . "
41796	41829	41769	41770	Presently Tony	219	" That niece of Mr Tendril 's told me first ... then we met them coming up , and Ben told me all that happened ... It 's awful for the girl . "
41830	41834	41670	41670	he	219	" Miss Ripon ? "
41835	41938	41769	41770	Presently Tony	219	" Yes , she 's just left ... she had a nasty fall too , just after . Her horse slipped up in the village ... she was in a terrible state , poor child , what with that and ... John . She did n't know she 'd hurt him until quite a time afterwards ... she was in the chemist 's shop having a bandage put on her head , when they told her . She cut it falling . She was in a terrible state . I sent her back in the car ... it was n't her fault . "
41939	41953	41670	41670	he	219	" No , it was n't anybody 's fault . It just happened . "
41954	41959	41961	41961	Tony	219	" That 's it , "
41963	41976	41961	41961	Tony	219	" It just happened ... how are we going to tell Brenda ? "
41977	41987	41670	41670	he	219	" One of us will have to go up . "
41988	42027	41961	41961	Tony	219	" Yes ... I think I shall have to stay here . I do n't know why really , but there will be things to see to . It 's an awful thing to ask anyone to do ... "
42028	42033	42035	42035	Jock	187	" I 'll go , "
42037	42144	42145	42147	The two men	1275	" There 'll be things to see to there ... there 's got to be an inquest the doctor says . It 's purely formal , of course , but it will be ghastly for that Ripon girl . She 'll have to give evidence ... she was in a terrible state . I hope I was all right to her . They 'd just brought John in and I was rather muddled . She looked awful . I believe her father 's bloody to her ... I wish Brenda had been here . She 's so good with everyone . I get in a muddle . "
42155	42166	42152	42152	Tony	219	" Can you really face going up and seeing Brenda ? "
42167	42174	42176	42176	Jock	187	" Yes , I 'll go , "
42184	42191	42192	42192	she	1276	" Colonel Inch has been here , "
42195	42209	42192	42192	she	1276	" I talked to him . He wanted to give you his sympathy . "
42210	42216	42152	42152	Tony	219	" Is he still here ? "
42217	42245	42192	42192	she	1276	" No , I told him you 'd probably prefer to be left alone . He thought you 'd be glad to hear he stopped the hunt . "
42246	42260	42152	42152	Tony	219	" Nice of him to come ... Were you having a good day ? "
42261	42264	42192	42192	she	1276	" No . "
42265	42294	42152	42152	Tony	219	" I 'm sorry . We saw a fox in Bruton Wood last week . John and I ... Jock 's going up to London to fetch Brenda . "
42295	42309	42192	42192	she	1276	" I 'll take him in the aeroplane . It 'll be quicker . "
42310	42318	42152	42152	Tony	219	" Yes , that will be quicker . "
42319	42334	42192	42192	she	1276	" I 'll go and change now . I wo n't be ten minutes . "
42335	42342	42344	42344	Jock	187	" I 'll change , too , "
42372	42408	42355	42357	A young footman	1277	" Will you tell Mr Ambrose that Mrs Rattery is leaving to - day . She is flying up with Mr Grant - Menzies . Her ladyship will probably be coming by the evening train . "
42409	42415	42360	42360	he	1277	" Very good , sir . "
42416	42489	42355	42357	A young footman	1277	" They had better have some luncheon before they go . I will have it with them ... And will you put a call through to Colonel Inch and thank him for coming ? Say I will write . And to Mr Ripon 's to enquire how Miss Ripon is ? And to the vicarage and ask Mr Tendril if I can see him this evening ? He 's not here still ? "
42490	42502	42360	42360	he	1277	" No , sir , he left a few minutes ago . "
42503	42515	42355	42357	A young footman	1277	" Tell him I shall have to discuss arrangements with him . "
42516	42522	42360	42360	he	1277	" Very good , sir . "
42569	42576	42533	42534	the footman	1278	" They 're just getting luncheon . "
42577	42584	42585	42585	she	286	" We sha n't want any , "
42588	42596	42585	42585	she	286	" You forget we were going hunting . "
42597	42602	42604	42604	Tony	219	" Better have something , "
42609	42632	42604	42604	Tony	219	" It 's awful for Jock , having to tell Brenda . I wonder how long it will be before she arrives . "
42650	42662	42646	42647	Mrs Rattery	286	" What are you going to do while you 're waiting ? "
42663	42679	42585	42585	she	286	" I do n't know . I suppose there will be things to see to . "
42680	42684	42686	42687	Mrs Rattery	286	" Look here , "
42689	42707	42686	42687	Mrs Rattery	286	" Jock had better go up by car . I 'll stay here until Lady Brenda comes . "
42708	42716	42585	42585	she	286	" It would be awful for you . "
42717	42724	42686	42687	Mrs Rattery	286	" No , I 'll stay . "
42728	42773	42725	42725	Tony	219	" I suppose it 's ridiculous of me , but I wish you would ... I mean , wo n't it be awful for you ? I am all in a muddle . It 's so hard to believe yet that it really happened . "
42774	42780	42781	42782	The footman	1278	" It happened all right . "
42808	42828	42830	42830	Tony	219	" Mr Grant - Menzies is going up in his car . He may be back to - night , "
42832	42842	42830	42830	Tony	219	" Mrs Rattery is waiting until her ladyship arrives . "
42843	42864	42781	42782	The footman	1278	" Very good , sir . And Colonel Inch wanted to know whether you would care to have the huntsmen blow "
42868	42873	42887	42888	the footman	1278	" at the funeral . "
42874	42883	42894	42894	Tony	219	" Say that I 'll write to him , "
42897	42902	42894	42894	Tony	219	" An atrocious suggestion . "
42903	42919	42887	42888	the footman	1278	" Oh , I do n't know . He 's very anxious to be helpful . "
42920	42930	42894	42894	Tony	219	" They do n't like him much as Master . "
42950	42961	42963	42963	Tony	219	" I 'm afraid this is a very difficult situation , "
42965	42974	42963	42963	Tony	219	" After all we scarcely know each other . "
42975	42985	42894	42894	Tony	219	" You do n't have to think about me . "
42986	42995	42963	42963	Tony	219	" But it must be awful for you . "
42996	43004	42894	42894	Tony	219	" And you must stop thinking that . "
43005	43035	42963	42963	Tony	219	" I 'll try ... the absurd thing is that I 'm not thinking it , just saying it ... I keep thinking of other things all the time . "
43036	43048	42894	42894	Tony	219	" I know . You do n't have to say anything . "
43053	43131	43049	43050	Presently Tony	219	" It 's going to be so much worse for Brenda . You see she 'd got nothing else , much , except John . I 've got her , and I love the house ... but with Brenda John always came first ... naturally ... And then you know she 's seen so little of John lately . She 's been in London such a lot . I 'm afraid that 's going to hurt her . "
43132	43145	43208	43208	Tony	219	" You ca n't ever tell what 's going to hurt people . "
43146	43158	43049	43050	Presently Tony	219	" But , you see , I know Brenda so well . "
43242	43247	43248	43248	he	219	" Only four o'clock ? "
43251	43258	43225	43225	he	219	" I thought you were asleep . "
43259	43282	43225	43225	he	219	" No , just thinking ... Jock will be more than half - way there by now , about Aylesbury or Tring . "
43283	43292	43225	43225	he	219	" It 's a slow way to travel . "
43293	43334	43225	43225	he	219	" It 's less than four hours ago that it happened ... it 's odd to think that this is the same day ; that it 's only five hours ago they were all here at the meet having drinks . "
43354	43408	43341	43342	Mrs Rattery	286	" It was twenty - eight minutes past twelve when I heard . I looked at my watch ... It was ten to one when they brought John in ... just over three hours ago ... It 's almost incredible , is n't it , everything becoming absolutely different , suddenly like that ? "
43409	43416	43418	43419	Mrs Rattery	286	" It 's always that way , "
43421	43610	43341	43342	Mrs Rattery	286	" Brenda will hear in an hour now ... if Jock finds her in . Of course she may very likely be out . He wo n't know where to find her , because there 's no one else in the flat . She leaves it locked up , empty , when she goes out ... and she 's out half the day . I know because I sometimes ring up and ca n't get an answer . He may not find her for hours ... It may be as long again as the time since it happened . That would only make it eight o'clock . It 's quite likely she wo n't come in until eight ... Think of it , all the time between now and when it happened , before Brenda hears . It 's scarcely credible , is it ? And then she 's got to get down here . There 's a train that leaves at nine something . She might get that . I wonder if I ought to have gone up too ... I did n't like to leave John . "
43663	43756	43647	43647	she	286	" ... Of course she may be at home when he arrives . In that case she can get the evening train she used always to come by , when she went to London for the day , before she got the flat ... I 'm trying to see it all , as it 's going to happen , Jock coming and her surprise at seeing him , and then his telling her ... It 's awful for Jock ... She may know at half - past five or a bit earlier . "
43757	43768	43770	43771	Mrs Rattery	286	" It 's a pity you do n't play patience , "
43773	43862	43647	43647	she	286	" In a way I shall feel happier when she knows ... it feels all wrong as it is at present , having it as a secret that Brenda does n't know ... I 'm not sure how she fits in her day . I suppose her last lecture is over at about five ... I wonder if she goes home first to change if she 's going out to tea or cocktails . She ca n't sit about much in the flat , it 's so small . "
43925	43934	43935	43935	she	286	" It 's a heart - breaking game , "
43943	43980	44143	44143	him	1290	" Is that only a quarter - past ? ... You know , I think I should have gone off my head if I were alone . It 's nice of you to stay with me . "
43981	43987	44143	44143	him	1290	" Do you play bezique ? "
43988	43994	44143	44143	him	1290	" I 'm afraid not . "
43995	43999	44143	44143	him	1290	" Or piquet ? "
44000	44017	44143	44143	him	1290	" No . I 've never been able to learn any card game except animal snap . "
44018	44021	44143	44143	him	1290	" Pity . "
44022	44059	44143	44143	him	1290	" There 's Marjorie and several people I ought to wire to , but I 'd better wait until I know that Jock has seen Brenda . Suppose she was with Marjorie when the telegram arrived . "
44060	44077	44143	44143	him	1290	" You 've got to try and stop thinking about things . Can you throw craps ? "
44078	44081	44143	44143	him	1290	" No . "
44082	44102	44143	44143	him	1290	" That 's easy ; I 'll show you . There 'll be some dice in the backgammon board . "
44103	44117	44143	44143	him	1290	" I 'm all right , really . I 'd sooner not play . "
44118	44140	44143	44143	him	1290	" You get the dice and sit up here at the table . We 've got six hours to get through . "
44152	44167	44149	44149	He	1290	" I 've seen it on the cinema -- pullman porters and taxi men . "
44168	44189	44143	44143	him	1290	" Of course you have , it 's easy ... there you see you 've won , you take all . "
44194	44202	44190	44191	Presently Tony	219	" I 've just thought of something . "
44203	44214	44149	44149	He	1290	" Do n't you ever take a rest from thinking ? "
44215	44253	44190	44191	Presently Tony	219	" Suppose the evening papers have got hold of it already . Brenda may see it on a placard , or just pick up a paper casually and there it will be ... perhaps with a photograph . "
44254	44271	44149	44149	He	1290	" Yes , I thought of that just now , when you were talking about telegraphing . "
44272	44298	44190	44191	Presently Tony	219	" But it 's quite likely , is n't it ? They get hold of everything so quickly . What can we do about it ? "
44299	44323	44149	44149	He	1290	" There is n't anything we can do . We 've just got to wait ... Come on , boy , throw up . "
44324	44338	44190	44191	Presently Tony	219	" I do n't want to play any more . I 'm worried . "
44339	44371	44149	44149	He	1290	" I know you 're worried . You do n't have to tell me ... you are n't going to give up playing just when the luck 's running your way ? "
44372	44383	44190	44191	Presently Tony	219	" I 'm sorry ... it is n't any good . "
44407	44436	44400	44400	He	1291	" At least we can find out whether the evening papers have got it in . We can ring up and ask the hall porter at my club . "
44437	44468	44530	44530	Tony	219	" That 's not going to prevent your wife reading it . We 've just got to wait . What was the game you said you knew ? Animal something ? "
44469	44472	44400	44400	He	1291	" Snap . "
44473	44479	44530	44530	Tony	219	" I 'll buy it . "
44480	44496	44400	44400	He	1291	" It 's just a child 's game . It would be ridiculous with two . "
44497	44501	44530	44530	Tony	219	" Show me . "
44502	44511	44400	44400	He	1291	" Well each of us chooses an animal . "
44512	44529	44530	44530	Tony	219	" All right , I 'm a dog and you 're a hen . Now what ? "
44533	44558	44560	44561	Mrs Rattery	286	" I 'd say it was one of those games that you have to feel pretty good first , before you can enjoy them , "
44563	44570	44560	44561	Mrs Rattery	286	" But I 'll try anything . "
44587	44592	44594	44595	Mrs Rattery	286	" Bow - wow , "
44605	44610	44612	44613	Mrs Rattery	286	" Bow - wow , "
44615	44627	44612	44613	Mrs Rattery	286	" You know you are n't putting your heart into this . "
44628	44631	44633	44633	Tony	219	" Oh , "
44635	44642	44633	44633	Tony	219	" Coop - coop - coop . "
44648	44655	44644	44644	he	219	" Coop - coop - coop . "
44656	44662	44664	44665	Mrs Rattery	286	" Do n't be dumb , "
44667	44674	44664	44665	Mrs Rattery	286	" that is n't a pair ... "
44728	44736	44738	44738	Tony	219	" What must that man have thought ? "
44747	44756	44757	44757	Albert	295	" Sitting there clucking like a ' en , "
44760	44769	44757	44757	Albert	295	" and the little fellow lying dead upstairs . "
44771	44777	44809	44809	their	1293	" We 'd better stop . "
44778	44798	44757	44757	Albert	295	" It was n't a very good game . And to think it 's the only one you know . "
44826	44851	44820	44820	Tony	219	" Five o'clock . Now that the shutters are up we sha n't hear the chimes . Jock must be in London by now . "
44856	44864	44852	44853	Mrs Rattery	286	" I 'd rather like some whisky . "
45135	45144	45117	45117	she	1309	" Are you looking for Lady Brenda Last ? "
45145	45156	45117	45117	she	1309	" I am . Is she a friend of yours ? "
45157	45166	45168	45170	Princess Abdul Akbar	273	" Oh , _ such _ a friend , "
45172	45185	45117	45117	she	1309	" Then perhaps you can tell me where I can find her ? "
45186	45213	45117	45117	she	1309	" I think she 's bound to be at Lady Cockpurse 's . I 'm just going there myself . Can I give her any message ? "
45214	45223	45117	45117	she	1309	" I had better come and see her . "
45224	45240	45117	45117	she	1309	" Well , wait five minutes and you can go with me . Come inside . "
45458	45464	45465	45465	she	1082	" What 's your name ? "
45475	45503	45471	45471	He	1317	" Oh yes , I 've heard them mention you . I was at Hetton the week - end before last ... such a quaint old place . "
45504	45521	45539	45539	her	271	" I 'd better tell you . There 's been a frightful accident there this morning . "
45546	45549	45550	45550	she	271	" Quick , "
45553	45571	45550	45550	she	271	" _ tell me _ . I ca n't bear it . Is it _ death _ ? "
45575	45585	45572	45572	Jock	187	" Their little boy ... kicked by a horse . "
45586	45592	45550	45550	she	271	" _ Little Jimmy . _ "
45593	45596	45572	45572	Jock	187	" John . "
45597	45611	45550	45550	she	271	" John ... _ dead _ . It 's _ too _ horrible . "
45612	45620	45572	45572	Jock	187	" It was n't anybody 's fault . "
45621	45625	45627	45627	Jenny	271	" Oh yes , "
45629	45698	45627	45627	Jenny	271	" It was . It was _ my _ fault . I ought never to have gone there ... a terrible curse hangs over me . Wherever I go I bring nothing but sorrow ... if only it was _ I _ that was dead ... I shall never be able to face them again . I feel like a murderess ... that brave little life snuffed out . "
45699	45717	45572	45572	Jock	187	" I say , you know , really , I should n't take that line about it . "
45718	45744	45746	45748	Jenny Abdul Akbar	271	" It is n't the first time it 's happened ... always , anywhere , I am hunted down ... without remorse . O God , "
45750	45759	45746	45748	Jenny Abdul Akbar	271	" What have I done to deserve it ? "
45783	45797	45776	45776	Jock	187	" Well , I must go along to Polly 's and see Brenda . "
45798	45808	45809	45809	She	271	" Wait a minute and I 'll come too . "
45818	45826	45827	45827	she	271	" Have you got a car here , "
45830	45839	45827	45827	she	271	" or shall I ring up a taxi ? "
45904	45908	45909	45909	she	286	" Bad interview ? "
45916	45919	45920	45920	He	219	" Awful . "
45931	45940	45920	45920	He	219	" Bring me one too , will you ? "
45944	45983	45941	45941	Tony	219	" I only wanted to see him about arrangements . He tried to be comforting . It was very painful ... after all the last thing one wants to talk about at a time like this is religion . "
45984	45989	45991	45992	Mrs Rattery	286	" Some like it , "
45994	45998	45999	45999	Tony	219	" Of course , "
46006	46014	45999	45999	Tony	219	" when you have n't got children yourself-- "
46015	46022	46024	46025	Mrs Rattery	286	" I 've got two sons , "
46027	46054	45999	45999	Tony	219	" Have you ? I 'm so sorry . I did n't realize ... we know each other so little . How very impertinent of me . "
46055	46110	45999	45999	Tony	219	" That 's all right . People are always surprised . I do n't see them often . They 're at school somewhere . I took them to the cinema last summer . They 're getting quite big . One 's going to be good - looking , I think . His father is . "
46111	46117	46119	46119	Tony	219	" Quarter - past six , "
46121	46132	46119	46119	Tony	219	" He 's bound to have told her by now . "
46233	46243	46227	46227	They	1324	" What a time she is taking over Daisy . "
46244	46250	46252	46252	Polly	1326	" She is very thorough , "
46254	46260	46252	46252	Polly	1326	" and it tickles rather . "
46265	46271	46272	46272	they	1324	" What was she like ? "
46275	46286	46288	46288	Daisy	228	" I must n't tell or it spoils it all , "
46403	46412	46400	46400	they	1324	" Where 's Mr Beaver to - day ? "
46413	46442	46365	46365	she	298	" He 's flown over to France with his mother to see some new wallpapers . She 's been worrying all day thinking he 's had an accident . "
46443	46463	46400	46400	they	1324	" It 's all very touching , is n't it ? Though I ca n't see his point myself ... "
46464	46473	46475	46476	Mrs Northcote	298	" You must never do anything on Thursdays , "
46478	46481	46400	46400	they	1324	" Nothing ? "
46482	46517	46400	46400	they	1324	" Nothing important . You are intellectual , imaginative , sympathetic , easily led by others , impulsive , affectionate . You are highly artistic and are not giving full scope to your capabilities . "
46518	46526	46400	46400	they	1324	" Is n't there anything about love ? "
46527	46547	46400	46400	they	1324	" I am coming to love . All these lines from the great toe to the instep represent lovers . "
46548	46558	46400	46400	they	1324	" Yes , go on some more about that ... "
46565	46570	46571	46571	she	273	" Where 's Brenda ? "
46574	46582	46571	46571	she	273	" I thought she 'd be here . "
46583	46591	46400	46400	they	1324	" Mrs Northcote 's doing her now . "
46592	46604	46571	46571	she	273	" Jock Menzies wants to see her . He 's downstairs . "
46605	46619	46400	46400	they	1324	" Darling Jock ... Why on earth did n't you bring him up ? "
46620	46637	46571	46571	she	273	" No , it 's something terribly important . He 's got to see Brenda alone . "
46638	46666	46400	46400	they	1324	" My dear , how mysterious . Well , she wo n't be long now . We ca n't disturb them . It would upset Mrs Northcote . "
46691	46698	46699	46700	Mrs Northcote	298	" Four men dominate your fate , "
46704	46733	46699	46700	Mrs Northcote	298	" one is loyal and tender but he has not yet disclosed his love , one is passionate and overpowering , you are a little afraid of him . "
46734	46738	46740	46740	Brenda	293	" Dear me , "
46742	46754	46740	46740	Brenda	293	" How very exciting . Who _ can _ they be ? "
46755	46775	46699	46700	Mrs Northcote	298	" One you must avoid ; he bodes no good for you , he is steely hearted and rapacious . "
46776	46788	46740	46740	Brenda	293	" I bet that 's my Mr Beaver , bless him . "
46829	46835	46836	46836	she	293	" _ Most _ enjoyable , "
46839	46848	46836	46836	she	293	" Why , how odd you all look . "
46849	46860	46813	46814	Soon Brenda	293	" Jock Grant - Menzies wants to see you downstairs . "
46861	46877	46836	46836	she	293	" Jock ? How very extraordinary . It is n't anything awful , is it ? "
46878	46887	46813	46814	Soon Brenda	293	" You 'd better go and see him . "
46920	46943	46909	46909	She	293	" What is it , Jock ? Tell me quickly , I 'm scared . It 's nothing awful , is it ? "
46944	46959	46995	46995	her	293	" I 'm afraid it is . There 's been a very serious accident . "
46960	46963	46909	46909	She	293	" John ? "
46964	46967	46995	46995	her	293	" Yes . "
46968	46971	46909	46909	She	293	" Dead ? "
47020	47034	47017	47017	She	293	" Tell me what happened . Why do you know about it first ? "
47035	47048	47077	47077	he	187	" I 've been down at Hetton since the week - end . "
47049	47052	47017	47017	She	293	" Hetton ? "
47053	47067	47077	47077	he	187	" Do n't you remember ? John was going hunting to - day . "
47081	47094	47096	47096	she	293	" John ... John Andrew ... I ... oh , thank God ... "
47134	47156	47120	47121	Mrs Northcote	298	" There are four men dominating your fate . One is loyal and tender but has not yet disclosed his love ... "
47186	47208	47336	47336	she	1344	" This is Jock speaking . I 've just seen Brenda . She 's coming down by the seven o'clock train . "
47209	47215	47120	47121	Mrs Northcote	298	" Is she terribly upset ? "
47216	47221	47336	47336	she	1344	" Yes , naturally . "
47222	47228	47120	47121	Mrs Northcote	298	" Where is she now ? "
47229	47242	47336	47336	she	1344	" She 's with me . I 'm speaking from Polly 's . "
47243	47250	47120	47121	Mrs Northcote	298	" Shall I talk to her ? "
47251	47255	47336	47336	she	1344	" Better not . "
47256	47271	47120	47121	Mrs Northcote	298	" All right ... I 'll meet that train . Are you coming too ? "
47272	47275	47336	47336	she	1344	" No . "
47276	47299	47120	47121	Mrs Northcote	298	" Well , you 've been wonderful . I do n't know what I should have done without you and Mrs Rattery . "
47300	47314	47336	47336	she	1344	" Oh , that 's all right . I 'll see Brenda off . "
47339	47349	47336	47336	she	1344	" Yes , I 'll go by that train . "
47350	47369	47336	47336	she	1344	" We ought to start . I suppose you will have to get some things from the flat . "
47370	47388	47336	47336	she	1344	" My bag ... upstairs . You get it . I ca n't go in there again . "
47440	47454	47432	47432	She	1344	" There 's plenty of time really . Tell me exactly what happened . "
47459	47464	47465	47465	she	1344	" Poor little boy , "
47468	47473	47465	47465	she	1344	" Poor little boy . "
47502	47507	47508	47508	she	1344	" That 's everything , "
47511	47519	47508	47508	she	1344	" There 's still too much time . "
47520	47528	47490	47490	she	1344	" Would you like anything to eat ? "
47529	47537	47508	47508	she	1344	" Oh no , nothing to eat . "
47561	47568	47569	47569	she	1344	" When you first told me , "
47572	47587	47569	47569	she	1344	" I did n't understand . I did n't know what I was saying . "
47588	47592	47490	47490	she	1344	" I know . "
47593	47603	47569	47569	she	1344	" I did n't say anything , did I ? "
47604	47611	47490	47490	she	1344	" You know what you said . "
47612	47635	47569	47569	she	1344	" Yes , I know ... I did n't mean ... I do n't think it 's any good trying to explain . "
47639	47648	47636	47636	Jock	187	" Are you sure you 've got everything ? "
47649	47656	47657	47657	she	1344	" Yes , that 's everything , "
47672	47683	47569	47569	she	1344	" Well , we 'd better go to the station . "
47684	47698	47636	47636	Jock	187	" All right . It 's early . But it does n't matter . "
47723	47731	47764	47764	she	1344	" Why not go first - class ? "
47732	47742	47764	47764	she	1344	" No , no . I always go third . "
47768	47777	47752	47756	The women on either side	1351	" Do n't you want anything to read ? "
47778	47783	47752	47756	The women on either side	1351	" Nothing to read . "
47784	47788	47752	47756	The women on either side	1351	" Or eat ? "
47789	47793	47752	47756	The women on either side	1351	" Or eat . "
47794	47803	47752	47756	The women on either side	1351	" Then I 'll say good - bye . "
47804	47809	47752	47756	The women on either side	1351	" Good - bye . "
47840	47854	47835	47835	Marjorie	228	" Well , anyway , this will mean the end of Mr Beaver . "
47862	47876	47856	47857	Polly Cockpurse	223	" That 's the end of Tony so far as Brenda is concerned . "
47954	47963	47945	47951	One of the men by the bar	1358	" Ghastly thing about Tony Last 's boy . "
47964	47971	47947	47951	the men by the bar	1359	" Yes , I was there . "
47972	47983	47945	47951	One of the men by the bar	1358	" No , were you ? What a ghastly thing . "
47990	48004	47947	47951	the men by the bar	1359	" Princess Abdul Akbar wishes to know whether you are in the club . "
48005	48017	48019	48019	Jock	187	" No , no , tell her I 'm not here , "
48191	48206	48188	48188	Brenda	233	" Wait a minute . I must just speak to that poor Ripon girl . "
48220	48246	48217	48217	Tony	184	" I wish you had been here yesterday . There were so many people about and I did n't know what to say to them . "
48247	48255	48188	48188	Brenda	233	" What did you do all day ? "
48256	48272	48217	48217	Tony	184	" There was the Shameless Blonde ... we played animal snap some of the time . "
48273	48282	48188	48188	Brenda	233	" Animal snap ? Was that any good ? "
48283	48301	48217	48217	Tony	184	" Not much ... It 's odd to think that yesterday this time it had n't happened . "
48302	48307	48309	48309	Brenda	233	" Poor little boy , "
48482	48490	48466	48466	Brenda	233	" Nothing to say , is there ? "
48491	48499	48559	48559	her	233	" There 's no need to talk . "
48500	48513	48466	48466	Brenda	233	" No . I suppose there 'll have to be a funeral . "
48514	48520	48559	48559	her	233	" Well , of course . "
48521	48528	48466	48466	Brenda	233	" Yes : to - morrow ? "
48537	48549	48529	48529	She	233	" They 've done quite a lot , have n't they ? "
48602	48605	48600	48600	she	233	" Do n't "
48619	48628	48616	48616	Tony	184	" I 'll go and finish those letters . "
48629	48632	48600	48600	she	233	" Yes . "
48633	48639	48616	48616	Tony	184	" See you at luncheon . "
48640	48643	48600	48600	she	233	" Yes . "
48752	48779	48740	48740	Nanny	217	" If you please , my lady , I 've been going through John 's things . There 's this handkerchief does n't belong to him . "
48793	48808	48740	48740	Nanny	217	" I know whose it is . I 'll send it back to her . "
48809	48820	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" Ca n't think how it came to be there , "
48824	48833	48835	48835	Brenda	293	" Poor little boy . Poor little boy , "
48858	48868	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" I was thinking about the pony , sir . "
48869	48875	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" Oh yes , Ben ? "
48876	48886	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" Will you want to be keeping her now ? "
48887	48899	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" I had n't thought ... no , I suppose not . "
48900	48921	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" Mr Westmacott over at Restall was asking about her . He thought she might do for his little girl . "
48922	48925	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" Yes . "
48926	48934	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" How much shall we be asking ? "
48935	48949	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" Oh , I do n't know ... whatever you think is right . "
48950	48981	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" She 's a good little pony and she 's always been treated well . I do n't think she ought to go under twenty - five quid , sir . "
48982	48993	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" All right , Ben , you see about it . "
48994	49011	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" I 'll ask thirty , shall I , sir , and come down a bit ? "
49012	49020	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" Do just what you think best . "
49021	49027	48822	48822	nanny	2412	" Very good , sir . "
49038	49055	49035	49035	Tony	184	" Jock rang up . He wanted to know if there was anything he could do . "
49056	49075	49035	49035	Tony	184	" How sweet of him . Why do n't you have him down for the week - end ? "
49076	49082	49035	49035	Tony	184	" Would you like that ? "
49083	49097	49035	49035	Tony	184	" I sha n't be here . I 'm going to Veronica 's . "
49098	49106	49035	49035	Tony	184	" You 're going to Veronica 's ? "
49107	49115	49035	49035	Tony	184	" Yes , do n't you remember ? "
49141	49148	49190	49190	him	1398	" Are you really going away ? "
49149	49166	49190	49190	him	1398	" Yes . I ca n't stay here . You understand that , do n't you ? "
49167	49185	49190	49190	him	1398	" Yes , of course . I was thinking we might both go away , abroad somewhere . "
49198	49220	49194	49194	her	293	" I could n't stay here . It 's all over , do n't you see , our life down here . "
49221	49231	49190	49190	him	1398	" Darling , what _ do _ you mean ? "
49232	49244	49194	49194	her	293	" Do n't ask me to explain ... not just now . "
49245	49281	49190	49190	him	1398	" But , Brenda , sweet , I do n't understand . We 're both young . Of course , we can never forget John . He 'll always be our eldest son , but ... "
49282	49296	49194	49194	her	293	" Do n't go on , Tony , please do n't go on . "
49306	49318	49298	49298	Tony	219	" So you 're going to Veronica 's to - morrow ? "
49319	49322	49194	49194	her	293	" Mmmm . "
49323	49333	49298	49298	Tony	219	" I think I will ask Jock to come . "
49334	49340	49194	49194	her	293	" Yes , I should . "
49341	49358	49298	49298	Tony	219	" And we can think about plans later when we 've got more used to things . "
49359	49364	49194	49194	her	293	" Yes , later . "
49368	49375	49377	49377	Brenda	293	" A sweet letter from mother , "
49464	49472	49474	49474	Tony	219	" I got a telegram from Jock , "
49476	49483	49474	49474	Tony	219	" he _ can _ come . "
49484	49497	49499	49499	Veronica	264	" It 's really rather embarrassing for us all , Brenda coming , "
49501	49523	49499	49499	Veronica	264	" I do think she might have chucked . I sha n't in the least know what to say to her . "
49541	49688	49529	49529	Tony	219	" I 've been trying to understand , and I think I do now . It 's not how I feel myself , but Brenda and I are quite different in lots of ways . It 's _ because _ they were strangers and did n't know John , and were never in our life here , that she wants to be with them . That 's it , do n't you think ? She wants to be absolutely alone and away from everything that reminds her of what has happened ... all the same I feel awful about letting her go . I ca n't tell you what she was like here ... quite mechanical . It 's so much worse for her than it is for me , I see that . It 's so terrible not being able to do anything to help . "
49711	49733	49706	49706	Brenda	293	" Until Wednesday , when I thought something had happened to you , I had no idea that I loved you . "
49734	49743	49709	49709	him	191	" Well you 've said it often enough . "
49744	49753	49755	49755	Brenda	293	" I 'm going to make you understand , "
49757	49761	49755	49755	Brenda	293	" You clod . "
49939	49950	49951	49951	he	219	" She 's only seen Beaver twice to my knowledge , "
49966	49977	49956	49956	he	219	" I 'm sorry it should have happened like this . "
49978	49988	49936	49936	her	293	" But it 's not true , is it ? "
49989	50005	49956	49956	he	219	" Yes , I 'm afraid it is . Everyone has known for some time . "
50040	50049	49936	49936	her	293	" How 's the old boy taking it ? "
50050	50063	50065	50065	Brenda	293	" Not so well . It makes me feel rather a beast , "
50067	50076	50065	50065	Brenda	293	" I 'm afraid he minds a lot . "
50077	50090	50092	50092	Polly	1408	" Well , you would n't like it if he did n't , "
50097	50104	49936	49936	her	293	" No , I suppose not . "
50105	50114	50116	50118	Jenny Abdul Akbar	271	" I shall stick by you whatever happens , "
50120	50130	50132	50132	Brenda	293	" Oh , everything is going quite smoothly now , "
50134	50147	50132	50132	Brenda	293	" There was a certain amount of _ g?ne _ with relatives . "
50285	50293	50294	50294	he	239	" You just wait a few weeks , "
50298	50312	50294	50294	he	239	" Brenda will come back . She 'll soon get sick of Beaver . "
50313	50322	50283	50283	peacemaker	1416	" But I do n't want her back . "
50323	50410	50294	50294	he	239	" I know just how you feel , but it does n't do to be medieval about it . If Brenda had n't been upset at John 's death this need never have come to a crisis . Why , last year Marjorie was going everywhere with that ass Robin Beaseley . She was mad about him at the time , but I pretended not to notice and it all blew over . If I were you I should refuse to recognize that anything has happened . "
50415	50471	50411	50411	Marjorie	228	" Of _ course _ Brenda does n't love Beaver . How could she ? ... And if she thinks she does at the moment , it 's your duty to prevent her making a fool of herself . You must refuse to be divorced -- anyway , until she has found someone more reasonable . "
50478	50652	50472	50474	Lady St Cloud	303	" Brenda has been very , very foolish . She always was an excitable girl , but I am sure there was never anything _ wrong _ , quite sure . _ That _ would n't be like Brenda at all . I have n't met Mr Beaver and I do not wish to . I understand he is unsuitable in every way . Brenda would never want to marry anyone like that . I will tell you exactly how it happened , Tony . Brenda must have felt a tiny bit neglected -- people often do at that stage of marriage . I have known countless cases -- and it was naturally flattering to find a young man to beg and carry for her . That 's all it was , nothing _ wrong _ . And then the terrible shock of little John 's accident unsettled her and she did n't know what she was saying or writing . You 'll both laugh over this little fracas in years to come . "
50703	50711	50712	50712	he	219	" I 've been talking to Brenda , "
50716	50742	50712	50712	he	219	" She 's sick of Beaver already . The one thing she wants is to go back to Hetton and settle down with you again . "
50784	50791	50777	50777	she	293	" Brenda , this is Tony . "
50792	50801	50777	50777	she	293	" Hullo , Tony , what is it ? "
50802	50821	50777	50777	she	293	" I 've been talking to Allan . He 's just told me about your change of mind . "
50822	50833	50777	50777	she	293	" I 'm not sure I know what you mean . "
50834	50847	50777	50777	she	293	" That you want to leave Beaver and come back to Hetton . "
50848	50854	50777	50777	she	293	" Did Allan say that ? "
50855	50863	50777	50777	she	293	" Yes ; is n't it true ? "
50864	50965	50777	50777	she	293	" I 'm afraid it 's not . Allan is an interfering ass . I had him here this afternoon . He told me that you did n't want a divorce but that you were willing to let me stay on alone in London and do as I liked provided there was no public scandal . It seemed a good idea and I was going to ring you up about it . But I suppose that 's just his diplomacy too . Anyway , I 'm afraid there 's no prospect of my coming back to Hetton just at present . "
50966	50986	50777	50777	she	293	" Oh , I see . I did n't think it was likely ... I just rang you up . "
50987	50999	50777	50777	she	293	" That 's all right . How are you , Tony ? "
51000	51006	50777	50777	she	293	" All right , thanks . "
51007	51017	50777	50777	she	293	" Good , so am I. Good - bye . "
51100	51159	51060	51062	the family solicitors	1422	" I gather Lady Brenda is being far from discreet . It is quite likely that the King 's Proctor may intervene ... Moreover , there is the question of money . You understand that by the present arrangement since she is the innocent and injured party she will be entitled to claim substantial alimony from the courts ? "
51160	51168	51170	51170	Tony	219	" Oh , that 's all right , "
51172	51214	51170	51170	Tony	219	" I 've been into all that with her brother - in - law and have decided to make a settlement of five hundred a year . She has four hundred of her own and I understand Mr Beaver has something . "
51215	51228	51230	51231	the solicitor	1425	" It 's a pity we ca n't put it in writing , "
51233	51240	51230	51231	the solicitor	1425	" but that might constitute Conspiracy . "
51241	51251	51253	51253	Tony	219	" Lady Brenda 's word is quite good enough , "
51255	51269	51271	51272	the lawyer	1426	" We like to protect our clients against even the most remote contingencies , "
51329	51345	51348	51349	private detectives	1429	" We always send our clients there . The servants are well accustomed to giving evidence "
51353	51362	51364	51365	the solicitor	1425	" It only remains to select a partner , "
51375	51451	51364	51365	the solicitor	1425	" We have on occasions been instrumental in accommodating our clients but there have been frequent complaints , so we find it best to leave the choice to them . Lately we had a particularly delicate case involving a man of very rigid morality and a certain diffidence . In the end his own wife consented to go with him and supply the evidence . She wore a red wig . It was quite successful . "
51452	51464	51348	51349	private detectives	1429	" I do n't think that would do in this case . "
51465	51481	51364	51365	the solicitor	1425	" No . Exactly . I was merely quoting it as a matter of interest . "
51482	51493	51495	51495	Tony	219	" I expect I shall be able to find someone , "
51497	51505	51507	51508	the solicitor	1425	" I have no doubt of it , "
51532	51546	51547	51547	he	1425	" It 's not a thing one can ask every girl to do , "
51550	51619	51547	51547	he	1425	" whichever way you put it . If you say it is merely a legal form it is rather insulting , and if you suggest going the whole hog it 's rather fresh -- suddenly , I mean , if you 've never paid any particular attention to her before and do n't propose to carry on with it afterwards ... Of course there 's always old Sybil . "
51625	51637	51638	51638	she	270	" I 'd do it like a shot any other time , "
51641	51688	51638	51638	she	270	" but just at the moment it would n't suit my book . There 's a certain person who might hear about it and take it wrong ... There 's an awfully pretty girl called Jenny Abdul Akbar . I wonder if you 've met her . "
51689	51697	51547	51547	he	1425	" Yes , I 've met her . "
51698	51706	51638	51638	she	270	" Well , wo n't she do ? "
51707	51710	51547	51547	he	1425	" No . "
51711	51723	51638	51638	she	270	" Oh dear , I do n't know who to suggest . "
51724	51738	51740	51740	Jock	187	" We 'd better go and study the market at the Old Hundredth , "
51803	51812	51800	51800	Tony	219	" Is it any good going there yet ? "
51813	51831	51857	51858	The waiters	1437	" We may as well try . After all , we are n't going there for enjoyment . "
51832	51837	51800	51800	Tony	219	" No , indeed . "
51908	51914	51916	51916	Jock	187	" Any of those do ? "
51918	51925	51869	51872	Two or three girls	1438	" I do n't much care . "
51926	51946	51916	51916	Jock	187	" Better get someone you like . You 've got to put in a lot of time with her . "
51954	51962	51964	51964	Milly	259	" How are the postmen 's hats ? "
51973	51989	51916	51916	Jock	187	" You are the two boys who were here last month , are n't you ? "
51990	52001	51916	51916	Jock	187	" Yes . I 'm afraid we were rather tight . "
52002	52008	51916	51916	Jock	187	" You do n't say ? "
52028	52041	51916	51916	Jock	187	" Well , come and sit down . How are you both ? "
52042	52051	52053	52053	Babs	260	" I think I 'm starting a cold , "
52055	52072	52053	52053	Babs	260	" I feel awful . Why ca n't they heat this hole , the mean hounds ? "
52086	52091	52092	52092	she	259	" Care to dance ? "
52107	52121	52123	52123	Jock	187	" My friend is looking for a lady to take to the seaside , "
52125	52142	52143	52143	Babs	260	" What , this weather ? That 'll be a nice treat for a lonely girl . "
52153	52160	52092	52092	she	259	" It 's for a divorce . "
52161	52223	52092	52092	she	259	" Oh , I see . Well , why does n't he take Milly ? She does n't catch cold easy . Besides , she knows how to behave at an hotel . Lots of the girls here are all right to have a lark with in town , but you have to have a _ lady _ for a divorce . "
52224	52233	52092	52092	she	259	" D'you often get asked to do that ? "
52234	52265	52092	52092	she	259	" Now and then . It 's a nice rest -- but it means so much _ talking _ and the gentlemen will always go on so about their wives . "
52276	52292	52293	52293	he	219	" I suppose you would n't care to come away for the week - end ? "
52296	52301	52303	52303	Milly	259	" Should n't mind , "
52305	52308	52303	52303	Milly	259	" Where ? "
52309	52315	52092	52092	she	259	" I thought of Brighton . "
52316	52325	52303	52303	Milly	259	" Oh ... Is it for a divorce ? "
52326	52329	52092	52092	she	259	" Yes . "
52330	52351	52303	52303	Milly	259	" You would n't mind if I brought my little girl with us ? She would n't be any trouble . "
52352	52355	52092	52092	she	259	" Yes . "
52356	52364	52303	52303	Milly	259	" You mean you would n't mind ? "
52365	52372	52092	52092	she	259	" I mean I should mind . "
52373	52391	52303	52303	Milly	259	" Oh ... You would n't think I had a little girl of eight , would you ? "
52392	52395	52092	52092	she	259	" No . "
52396	52467	52303	52303	Milly	259	" She 's called Winnie . I was only sixteen when I had her . I was the youngest of the family and our stepfather would n't leave any of us girls alone . That 's why I have to work . She lives with a lady at Finchley . Twenty - eight bob a week it costs me , not counting her clothes . She does like the seaside . "
52468	52471	52473	52473	Tony	219	" No , "
52475	52500	52473	52473	Tony	219	" I 'm sorry but it would be quite impossible . We 'll get a lovely present for you to take back to her . "
52501	52529	52303	52303	Milly	259	" All right ... One gentleman gave her a fairy - cycle for Christmas . She fell off and cut her knee ... When do we start ? "
52530	52541	52473	52473	Tony	219	" Would you like to go by train or car ? "
52542	52557	52303	52303	Milly	259	" Oh , train . Winnie 's sick if she goes in a car . "
52558	52564	52473	52473	Tony	219	" Winnie 's not coming . "
52565	52576	52303	52303	Milly	259	" No , but let 's go by train anyway . "
52916	52924	52926	52926	Tony	219	" This is going to be hell , "
52998	53005	53006	53006	she	259	" Sorry if I 'm late , "
53009	53039	53006	53006	she	259	" Winnie here could n't find her shoes . I brought her along too . I knew you would n't mind really . She travels on a half ticket . "
53066	53079	53055	53055	she	304	" I hope you do n't imagine she 's coming with us . "
53080	53087	53089	53089	Milly	259	" Yes , that the idea , "
53091	53105	53089	53089	Milly	259	" She wo n't be any trouble -- she 's got her puzzle . "
53116	53119	53120	53120	he	219	" Listen , "
53123	53184	53120	53120	he	219	" You do n't want to come to a nasty big hotel . You go with this kind gentleman here . He 'll take you to a shop and let you choose the biggest doll you can find and then he 'll drive you back in his motor to your home . You 'll like that , wo n't you ? "
53185	53188	53190	53190	Winnie	304	" No , "
53192	53227	53190	53190	Winnie	304	" I want to go to the seaside . I wo n't go with that man . I do n't want a doll . I want to go to the seaside with my mummy . "
53244	53248	53250	53250	Tony	219	" Oh God ! "
53252	53261	53250	53250	Tony	219	" I suppose she 's got to come . "
53281	53284	53286	53286	Milly	259	" Look , "
53288	53306	53286	53286	Milly	259	" we 're travelling first - class . Is n't that fun ? We can have tea . "
53307	53314	53250	53250	Tony	219	" Can I have an ice ? "
53315	53334	53286	53286	Milly	259	" I do n't expect they 've got an ice . But you can have some nice tea . "
53335	53342	53250	53250	Tony	219	" But I want an ice . "
53343	53376	53286	53286	Milly	259	" You shall have an ice when you get to Brighton . Now be a good girl and play with your puzzle or mother wo n't take you to the seaside again . "
53377	53385	53387	53387	Jock	187	" The Awful Child of popular fiction , "
53463	53482	53483	53483	he	1468	" We have reserved in your name double and single communicating rooms , bathroom and sitting - room , "
53486	53504	53483	53483	he	1468	" We did not understand you were bringing your daughter . Will you require a further room ? "
53505	53515	53517	53517	Milly	259	" Oh , Winnie can come in with me , "
53548	53552	53554	53555	the clerk	1471	" And daughter , "
53566	53572	53573	53573	he	219	" She is my niece , "
53601	53664	53590	53591	The detective	1473	" He got out of that all right . Quite smart . But I do n't like the look of this case . Most irregular . Sets a nasty , respectable note bringing a kid into it . We 've got the firm to consider . It does n't do them any good to get mixed up with the King 's Proctor . "
53665	53672	53674	53675	his colleague	1474	" How about a quick one ? "
53683	53689	53680	53680	Winnie	304	" Where 's the sea ? "
53690	53697	53590	53591	The detective	1473	" Just there across the street . "
53698	53707	53680	53680	Winnie	304	" I want to go and see it . "
53708	53725	53590	53591	The detective	1473	" But it 's dark now , pet . You shall see it to - morrow . "
53726	53736	53680	53680	Winnie	304	" I want to see it to - night . "
53737	53746	53748	53748	Tony	219	" You take her to see it now , "
53750	53758	53680	53680	Winnie	304	" Sure you wo n't be lonely ? "
53759	53763	53680	53680	Winnie	304	" Quite sure . "
53764	53771	53680	53680	Winnie	304	" We wo n't be long . "
53772	53785	53680	53680	Winnie	304	" That 's all right . You let her see it properly . "
53810	53814	53815	53815	he	219	" Good evening , "
53843	53847	53849	53851	the senior detective	1479	" Good evening , "
53853	53859	53849	53851	the senior detective	1479	" Nasty , raw evening . "
53860	53865	53882	53884	the junior detective	1480	" Have a drink . "
53890	53898	53882	53884	the junior detective	1480	" Do n't mind if I do . "
53899	53910	53849	53851	the senior detective	1479	" Come and sit down . I feel rather lonely . "
53925	53938	53940	53942	the senior detective	1479	" Mr Last , sir , this is all _ wrong _ , "
53944	53968	53940	53942	the senior detective	1479	" You have n't no business to recognize us at all . I do n't know what they 'd say at the office . "
53969	53973	53975	53977	the junior detective	1480	" Best respects , "
53979	53988	53990	53992	the senior detective	1479	" This is Mr James , my colleague , "
53994	54009	53990	53992	the senior detective	1479	" My name is Blenkinsop . James is new to this kind of work . "
54010	54015	54017	54017	Tony	219	" So am I , "
54019	54034	54036	54036	Blenkinsop	307	" A pity we 've such a nasty week - end for the job , "
54038	54050	54036	54036	Blenkinsop	307	" very damp and blowy . Gets me in the joints . "
54051	54055	54057	54057	Tony	219	" Tell me , "
54059	54073	54057	54057	Tony	219	" Is it usual to bring children on an expedition of this kind ? "
54074	54081	53990	53992	the senior detective	1479	" It is _ not _ . "
54082	54090	54057	54057	Tony	219	" I thought it could n't be . "
54091	54205	53990	53992	the senior detective	1479	" Since you ask me , Mr Last , I regard it as most irregular and injudicious . It looks wrong , and cases of this kind depend very much on making the right impression . Of course as far as James and me are concerned , the matter is O.K. There wo n't be a word about it in our evidence . But you ca n't trust the servants . You might very likely happen to strike one who was new to the courts , who 'd blurt it out , and then where would we be . I do n't like it , Mr Last , and that 's the truth . "
54206	54219	54057	54057	Tony	219	" You ca n't feel more strongly about it than I do . "
54220	54226	54228	54228	James	306	" Fond of kids myself , "
54239	54246	54228	54228	James	306	" How about one with us ? "
54247	54251	54253	54253	Tony	219	" Tell me , "
54266	54293	54253	54253	Tony	219	" You must have observed numerous couples in your time , qualifying for a divorce ; tell me , how do they get through their day ? "
54294	54302	54304	54304	Blenkinsop	307	" It 's easier in the summer , "
54306	54343	54304	54304	Blenkinsop	307	" the young ladies usually bathe and the gentlemen read the papers on the esplanade ; some goes for motor drives and some just hangs around the bar . They 're mostly glad when Monday comes . "
54364	54371	54373	54373	Milly	259	" I 've ordered an ice , "
54375	54379	54351	54351	her	259	" Quite right . "
54380	54391	54351	54351	her	259	" I want late dinner . I want late dinner . "
54392	54408	54351	54351	her	259	" No , dear , not late dinner . You have an ice up here . "
54415	54419	54420	54420	he	219	" Mr James , "
54423	54436	54420	54420	he	219	" Did I understand you to say you were fond of children . "
54437	54445	54351	54351	her	259	" Yes , in their right place . "
54446	54477	54420	54420	he	219	" You would n't , I suppose , consider dining to - night with the little girl who has accompanied me ? I should take it as a great kindness . "
54478	54487	54351	54351	her	259	" Oh no , sir , hardly that . "
54488	54496	54420	54420	he	219	" You would not find me ungrateful . "
54497	54519	54351	54351	her	259	" Well , sir , I do n't want to appear unobliging , but it 's not part of my duties . "
54529	54538	54526	54526	Blenkinsop	307	" Quite out of the question , sir . "
54578	54598	54567	54567	he	307	" Our trouble is always the same -- to make the clients realize that divorce is a serious matter . "
54625	54633	54635	54635	Milly	259	" How are we going to sleep ? "
54637	54645	54567	54567	he	307	" Oh , just as you like . "
54646	54654	54567	54567	he	307	" Just as _ you _ like . "
54655	54688	54567	54567	he	307	" Well , perhaps Winnie would be happier with you ... she 'll have to go into the other room to - morrow morning when they bring in breakfast , of course . "
54972	54975	54976	54976	he	219	" Charming , "
54979	54990	54976	54976	he	219	" perfectly charming . Shall we go down to dinner ? "
55020	55024	55026	55026	Milly	259	" Cheer up , "
55028	55041	55026	55026	Milly	259	" You have a tongue sandwich . That 'll make you talk . "
55042	55051	55004	55004	her	259	" Sorry , am I being a bore ? "
55052	55068	55026	55026	Milly	259	" I was only joking . You are a serious boy , are n't you ? "
55106	55109	55111	55111	Milly	259	" Yids , "
55114	55132	55111	55111	Milly	259	" Still , it 's nice to get a change from the club once in a while . "
55187	55189	55190	55190	em	1506	" Take "
55194	55202	55203	55203	he	1503	" em unpacked and quick about it , "
55234	55242	55243	55243	she	1508	" Oh , for Christ 's sake , "
55255	55260	55261	55261	she	259	" This is Dan , "
55264	55271	55273	55273	Dan	309	" Well , well , well , "
55275	55279	55273	55273	Dan	309	" what next ? "
55280	55287	55289	55289	Dan	309	" Do I get a drink ? "
55293	55322	55273	55273	Dan	309	" Baby , you do , if I have to get it myself . Wo n't you two join us , or are we _ de trop _ ? "
55331	55338	55340	55340	Baby	310	" I 'm cold like hell , "
55373	55381	55382	55382	he	309	" We 'll soon warm you up , "
55385	55392	55394	55394	Baby	310	" This place stinks of Yids , "
55396	55413	55415	55415	Tony	219	" I always think that 's the sign of a good hotel , do n't you ? "
55417	55421	55423	55423	Baby	310	" Like hell , "
55425	55436	55437	55437	Dan	309	" You must n't mind Baby , she 's cold , "
55440	55451	55471	55471	they	1516	" Who would n't be , in your lousy car ? "
55505	55513	55514	55514	she	259	" He 's a very nice boy , "
55517	55561	55514	55514	she	259	" and comes to the club a lot . We get all sorts there , but Dan 's one of the decent ones . I was going to have gone abroad with him once but in the end he could n't get away . "
55562	55573	55604	55604	he	219	" His girl did n't seem to like us much . "
55574	55581	55514	55514	she	259	" Oh , she was cold . "
55614	55624	55593	55593	he	219	" That 's a pretty girl in the corner . "
55625	55638	55640	55640	Milly	259	" I wonder you do n't go and join her , dear , "
55643	55659	55593	55593	he	219	" Look at that woman 's diamonds . Do you think they can be real ? "
55660	55674	55593	55593	he	219	" Why do n't you ask her , if you 're so interested ? "
55675	55687	55593	55593	he	219	" That 's an interesting type -- the dark woman dancing . "
55688	55700	55593	55593	he	219	" I 'm sure she 'd be delighted to hear it . "
55831	55835	55836	55836	he	219	" Look here , "
55839	55882	55836	55836	he	219	" if you two are n't doing anything special , why do n't you join up with us and come to the party at my friend 's place . You 'll like it . He always gives one the best of everything . "
55883	55890	55892	55892	Milly	259	" Oh , do let 's , "
55995	56002	56003	56003	he	1529	" This stuff 's all right , "
56010	56023	56003	56003	he	1529	" it wo n't hurt you . It 's the right stuff . "
56063	56072	56073	56073	he	219	" I 'm so glad Dan brought you , "
56077	56109	56073	56073	he	219	" Hope you 're getting all you want . Delighted to see you . Come again when there is n't a crowd and see over the place . Interested in roses ? "
56110	56119	56056	56056	his	219	" Yes , I like them very much . "
56120	56149	56073	56073	he	219	" Come when the roses are out . You 'd like that if you 're interested in roses . Damn that radio , it 's going wonky again . "
56189	56195	56184	56184	Dan	309	" Nice kid , Milly . "
56196	56199	56073	56073	he	219	" Yes . "
56200	56230	56184	56184	Dan	309	" I 'll tell you a thing I 've noticed about her . She attracts quite a different type from the other girls . People like you and me . "
56231	56234	56073	56073	he	219	" Yes . "
56235	56250	56184	56184	Dan	309	" You would n't think she had a daughter of eight , would you ? "
56251	56259	56073	56073	he	219	" No , it 's very surprising . "
56260	56317	56318	56318	He	1537	" I did n't know for ages . Then I was taking her to Dieppe for the week - end and she wanted to bring the child along too . Of course that put the kybosh on it , but I 've always liked Milly just the same . You can trust her to behave anywhere . "
56364	56383	56384	56384	he	1537	" I doubt if you 'll find a better show of roses anywhere in the south of England , "
56407	56412	56413	56413	she	310	" Where were you ? "
56417	56448	56413	56413	she	310	" Never saw you all the evening . Where did you get to ? Where were you hiding ? I call it a lousy way to take a girl out . "
56485	56497	56482	56482	she	310	" Go quietly . We do n't want to wake Winnie . "
56541	56547	56548	56548	she	304	" Mother 's still asleep , "
56557	56563	56564	56564	he	219	" So I should think , "
56575	56581	56564	56564	he	219	" Go back to bed . "
56582	56594	56564	56564	he	219	" No , I 'm dressed . Let 's go out . "
56615	56623	56624	56624	she	310	" It 's hardly raining at all , "
56627	56635	56564	56564	he	219	" What do you want to do ? "
56636	56645	56564	56564	he	219	" I want to go on the pier . "
56646	56654	56564	56564	he	219	" It wo n't be open yet . "
56655	56670	56564	56564	he	219	" Well , I want to go down to the sea . Come on . "
56684	56696	56671	56671	Tony	219	" All right . You go and wait while I dress . "
56697	56707	56564	56564	he	219	" I 'll wait here . Mother snores so . "
56792	56798	56800	56800	Winnie	304	" Oh , come on , "
56845	56852	56854	56854	Winnie	304	" Why do n't you bathe ? "
56856	56861	56836	56836	them	1556	" Far too cold . "
56862	56874	56836	56836	them	1556	" But _ they 're _ bathing . I want to . "
56875	56882	56836	56836	them	1556	" You must ask your mother . "
56883	56894	56836	56836	them	1556	" I believe you 're afraid . Can you swim ? "
56895	56898	56836	56836	them	1556	" Yes . "
56899	56912	56836	56836	them	1556	" Well , why do n't you ? Bet you ca n't . "
56913	56921	56836	56836	them	1556	" All right . I ca n't . "
56922	56933	56836	56836	them	1556	" Then why did you say you could . Fibber . "
56947	56954	56955	56955	she	304	" Now my knickers are wet , "
56958	56965	56836	56836	them	1556	" Better come back and change . "
56966	56978	56836	56836	them	1556	" It feels horrible . Let 's go and have breakfast . "
57078	57085	57086	57086	he	219	" We missed you last night , "
57089	57096	57069	57069	he	219	" We went to a party . "
57097	57124	57069	57069	he	219	" You should n't have done that -- not strictly , but I daresay no harm will come of it . Have you had your breakfast ? "
57125	57136	57069	57069	he	219	" Yes , in the dining - room with Winnie . "
57137	57160	57069	57069	he	219	" But , Mr Last , what are you thinking of ? You 've got to get evidence from the hotel servants . "
57161	57172	57069	57069	he	219	" Well , I did n't like to wake Milly . "
57173	57215	57069	57069	he	219	" She 's paid for it , is n't she ? Come , come , Mr Last , this wo n't do at all . You 'll never get your divorce if you do n't give your mind to it more . "
57216	57220	57222	57222	Tony	219	" All right , "
57224	57231	57222	57222	Tony	219	" I 'll have breakfast again . "
57232	57238	57069	57069	he	219	" In bed , mind . "
57239	57243	57245	57245	he	219	" In bed . "
57265	57290	57253	57253	Winnie	304	" She woke up once and then turned over . Do get her to come out . I want to go on the pier . "
57291	57294	57296	57296	Tony	219	" Milly , "
57299	57302	57296	57296	Tony	219	" Milly . "
57303	57306	57307	57307	she	304	" Oh , "
57310	57316	57307	57307	she	304	" What time is it ? "
57317	57325	57253	57253	Winnie	304	" We 've got to have breakfast . "
57326	57341	57307	57307	she	304	" Do n't want any breakfast . I think I 'll sleep a little . "
57342	57348	57350	57350	Winnie	304	" You 've had breakfast , "
57352	57356	57358	57358	Tony	219	" Come on , "
57360	57375	57358	57358	Tony	219	" Plenty of time to sleep afterwards . This is what we came for . "
57382	57385	57386	57386	she	259	" O.K. , "
57389	57402	57403	57403	She	304	" Winnie , darling , give mother her jacket off the chair . "
57423	57429	57403	57403	She	304	" But it 's early . "
57457	57462	57464	57464	Winnie	304	" You are greedy , "
57466	57471	57464	57464	Winnie	304	" eating two breakfasts . "
57472	57522	57403	57403	She	304	" When you 're a little older you 'll understand these things . It 's the Law . Now I want you to stay in the sitting - room for a quarter of an hour very quietly . Promise ? And afterwards you can do exactly what you like . "
57523	57528	57464	57464	Winnie	304	" Can I bathe ? "
57529	57540	57403	57403	She	304	" Yes , certainly , if you 're quiet now . "
57558	57565	57541	57541	Tony	219	" Does that look all right ? "
57566	57572	57574	57574	Milly	259	" Love 's young dream , "
57576	57588	57541	57541	Tony	219	" All right , then . I 'll ring the bell . "
57607	57614	57615	57615	he	219	" So much for my infidelity , "
57618	57633	57615	57615	he	219	" It is curious to reflect that this will be described in the papers as "
57635	57637	57541	57541	Tony	219	" . "
57638	57644	57615	57615	he	219	" Can I bathe now ? "
57645	57648	57541	57541	Tony	219	" Certainly . "
57678	57687	57689	57689	Tony	219	" This little girl would like to bathe , "
57691	57700	57702	57704	the beach attendant	1570	" No bathing for children to - day , "
57706	57711	57713	57714	various onlookers	1571	" The very idea , "
57716	57725	57713	57714	various onlookers	1571	" Does he want to drown the child ? "
57726	57737	57713	57714	various onlookers	1571	" He 's no business to be trusted with children . "
57738	57744	57785	57786	one another	1573	" _ Unnatural beast . _ "
57745	57754	57756	57756	Winnie	304	" But I _ want _ to bathe , "
57758	57770	57756	57756	Winnie	304	" You said I could bathe if you had two breakfasts . "
57789	57805	57785	57786	one another	1573	" Two breakfasts ? Wanting to let the child bathe ? The man 's balmy . "
57806	57810	57812	57812	Tony	219	" Never mind , "
57814	57822	57812	57812	Tony	219	" We 'll go on the pier . "
57845	57863	57864	57864	they	1574	" There 's a man who 's eaten two breakfasts and tries to drown his little girl , "
57909	57912	57914	57914	Brenda	233	" Well , "
57918	57989	57914	57914	Brenda	233	" We have our case now , all quite regular and complete . I do n't think it can come on until next term -- there 's a great rush at the moment , but there 's no harm in you having your own evidence ready . I 've got it typed out for you . You 'd better keep it by you and get it clear in your mind . "
57990	58002	58003	58003	she	233	" _ ... My marriage was an ideally happy one _ , "
58005	58096	58003	58003	she	233	" _ until shortly before Christmas last year when I began to suspect that my husband 's attitude had changed towards me . He always remained in the country when my studies took me to London . I realized that he no longer cared for me as he used to . He began to drink heavily and on one occasion made a disturbance at our flat in London , constantly ringing up when drunk and sending a drunken friend round to knock on the door . _ Is that necessary ? "
58097	58160	58237	58237	her	303	" Not strictly , but it is advisable to put it in . A great deal depends on psychological impression . Judges in their more lucid moments sometimes wonder why perfectly respectable , happily married men go off for week - ends to the seaside with women they do not know . It is always helpful to offer evidence of general degeneracy . "
58161	58165	58167	58167	Brenda	233	" I see , "
58169	58210	58167	58167	Brenda	233	" _ From then onwards I had him watched by private agents and as a result of what they told me , I left my husband 's house on April 5th . _ Yes , that all seems quite clear . "
58716	58728	58730	58732	Reggie St Cloud	315	" This whole business of Brenda is _ very _ unfortunate , "
58737	58786	58703	58709	a possible son - in - law	1596	" My mother is extremely upset about it , naturally . I 'm upset myself . I do n't mind admitting , perfectly frankly , that I think she has behaved very foolishly , foolishly and wrongly . I can quite understand your being upset about it too . "
58787	58790	58792	58792	Tony	219	" Yes , "
58794	58820	58703	58709	a possible son - in - law	1596	" But all the same , making every allowance for your feelings , I do think that you are behaving rather vindictively in the matter . "
58821	58830	58703	58709	a possible son - in - law	1596	" I 'm doing exactly what Brenda wanted . "
58831	58864	58703	58709	a possible son - in - law	1596	" My dear fellow , she does n't know what she wants . I saw this chap Beaver yesterday . I did n't like him _ at all _ . Do you ? "
58865	58871	58703	58709	a possible son - in - law	1596	" I hardly know him . "
58872	58966	58703	58709	a possible son - in - law	1596	" Well , I can assure you I did n't like him . Now you 're just throwing Brenda into his arms . That 's what it amounts to , as I see it , and I call it vindictive . Of course , at the moment Brenda 's got the idea that she 's in love with him . But it wo n't last . It could n't with a chap like Beaver . She 'll want to come back in a year , just you see . Allan says the same . "
58967	58980	58703	58709	a possible son - in - law	1596	" I 've told Allan . I do n't want her back . "
58981	58988	58703	58709	a possible son - in - law	1596	" Well , that 's vindictive . "
58989	59003	58703	58709	a possible son - in - law	1596	" No , I just could n't feel the same about her again . "
59004	59056	58703	58709	a possible son - in - law	1596	" Well , why feel _ the same _ ? One has to change as one gets older . Why , ten years ago I could n't be interested in anything later than the Sumerian age and I assure you that now I find even the Christian era full of significance . "
59074	59081	59082	59082	he	1597	" Almost every grave had them , "
59085	59137	59082	59082	he	1597	" mostly referring to the circus factions , scratched on lead . They used to be dropped in through a funnel . We had found forty - three up - to - date , before this wretched business happened , and I had to come back . Naturally I 'm upset . "
59241	59247	59248	59248	he	1597	" Besides , you know , "
59251	59264	59248	59248	he	1597	" it is n't as though it was all Brenda 's fault . "
59265	59277	59535	59540	The fat young man opposite Tony	1599	" I have n't been thinking particularly whose fault it is . "
59278	59357	59248	59248	he	1597	" Well , that 's all very well , but you seem rather to be taking the line of the injured husband -- saying you ca n't feel the same again , and all that . I mean to say , it takes two to make a quarrel and I gather things had been going wrong for some time . For instance , you 'd been drinking a lot -- have some more burgundy , by the way . "
59358	59364	59535	59540	The fat young man opposite Tony	1599	" Did Brenda say that ? "
59365	59439	59248	59248	he	1597	" Yes . And then you 'd been going round a bit with other girls yourself . There was some woman with a Moorish name you had to stay at Hetton while Brenda was there . Well , that 's a bit thick , you know . I 'm all for people going their own way , but if they do they ca n't blame others , if you see what I mean . "
59440	59446	59535	59540	The fat young man opposite Tony	1599	" Did Brenda say that ? "
59447	59483	59248	59248	he	1597	" Yes . Do n't think I 'm trying to lecture you or anything , but all I feel is that you have n't any right to be vindictive to Brenda , as things are . "
59484	59502	59535	59540	The fat young man opposite Tony	1599	" She said I drank and was having an affair with the woman with a Moorish name ? "
59503	59534	59248	59248	he	1597	" Well , I do n't know she actually said that , but she said you 'd been getting tight lately and that you were certainly interested in that girl . "
59569	59580	59582	59582	Reggie	315	" So that really explains what I want to say , "
59585	59621	59582	59582	Reggie	315	" It 's about money . I understand that when Brenda was in a very agitated state just after the death of her child , she consented to some verbal arrangement with you about settlements . "
59622	59634	59535	59540	The fat young man opposite Tony	1599	" Yes , I 'm allowing her five hundred a year . "
59635	59685	59582	59582	Reggie	315	" Well , you know , I do n't think that you have any right to take advantage of her generosity in that way . It was most imprudent of her to consider your proposal -- she admits now that she was not really herself when she did so . "
59686	59693	59535	59540	The fat young man opposite Tony	1599	" What does she suggest instead ? "
59694	59703	59582	59582	Reggie	315	" Let 's go outside and have coffee . "
59723	59750	59720	59720	he	1602	" Well , I 've discussed it with the lawyers and with the family and we decided that the sum should be increased to two thousand . "
59751	59768	59535	59540	The fat young man opposite Tony	1599	" That 's quite out of the question . I could n't begin to afford it . "
59769	59865	59720	59720	he	1602	" Well , you know , I have to consider Brenda 's interests . She has very little of her own and there will be no more coming to her . My mother 's income is an allowance which I pay under my father 's will . I sha n't be able to give her anything . I am trying to raise everything I can for an expedition to one of the oases in the Libyan desert . This chap Beaver has got practically nothing and does n't look like earning any . So you see-- "
59866	59888	59535	59540	The fat young man opposite Tony	1599	" But , my dear Reggie , you know as well as I do that it 's out of the question . "
59889	59901	59720	59720	he	1602	" It 's rather less than a third of your income . "
59902	59951	59535	59540	The fat young man opposite Tony	1599	" Yes , but almost every penny goes straight back to the estate . Do you realize that Brenda and I together have n't spent half that amount a year on our personal expenses ? It 's all I can do to keep things going as it is . "
59952	60010	59720	59720	he	1602	" I did n't expect you 'd take this line , Tony . I think it 's extremely unreasonable of you . After all , it 's absurd to pretend in these days that a single man ca n't be perfectly comfortable on four thousand a year . It 's as much as I 've ever had . "
60011	60019	59535	59540	The fat young man opposite Tony	1599	" It would mean giving up Hetton . "
60020	60088	59720	59720	he	1602	" Well , I gave up Brakeleigh , and I assure you , my dear fellow , I never regret it . It was a nasty wrench at the time , of course , old association and everything like that , but I can tell you this , that when the sale was finally through I felt a different man , free to go where I liked ... "
60089	60104	59535	59540	The fat young man opposite Tony	1599	" But I do n't happen to want to go anywhere else except Hetton . "
60105	60131	59720	59720	he	1602	" There 's a lot in what these Labour fellows say , you know . Big houses are a thing of the past in England . "
60132	60152	59535	59540	The fat young man opposite Tony	1599	" Tell me , did Brenda realize when she agreed to this proposal that it meant my leaving Hetton ? "
60153	60236	59720	59720	he	1602	" Yes , it was mentioned , I think . I daresay you 'll find it quite easy to sell to a school or something like that . I remember the agent said when I was trying to get rid of Brakeleigh that it was a pity it was n't Gothic , because schools and convents always go for Gothic . I daresay you 'll get a very comfortable price and find yourself better off in the end than you are now . "
60237	60244	60246	60246	Tony	219	" No . It 's impossible , "
60248	60258	60260	60260	Reggie	315	" You 're making things extremely awkward for everyone , "
60262	60275	60260	60260	Reggie	315	" I ca n't understand why you are taking up this attitude . "
60276	60295	59720	59720	he	1602	" What is more , I do n't believe that Brenda ever expected or wanted me to agree . "
60296	60313	60260	60260	Reggie	315	" Oh yes , she did , my dear fellow . I assure you of that . "
60314	60319	59720	59720	he	1602	" It 's inconceivable . "
60320	60323	60325	60325	Reggie	315	" Well , "
60332	60397	60325	60325	Reggie	315	" there 's more to it than just money . Perhaps I 'd better tell you everything . I had n't meant to . The truth is that Beaver is cutting up nasty . He says he ca n't marry Brenda unless she 's properly provided for . Not fair on her , he says . I quite see his point in a way . "
60398	60406	60408	60408	Tony	219	" Yes , I see his point , "
60410	60434	60408	60408	Tony	219	" So what your proposal really amounts to , is that I should give up Hetton in order to buy Beaver for Brenda . "
60435	60446	60448	60448	Reggie	315	" It 's not how I should have put it , "
60450	60482	59720	59720	he	1602	" Well , I 'm not going to and that 's the end of it . If that 's all you wanted to say , I may as well leave you . "
60483	60595	60408	60408	Tony	219	" No , it is n't quite all I wanted to say . In fact I think I must have put things rather badly . It comes from trying to respect people 's feelings too much . You see , I was n't so much asking you to agree to anything as explaining what our side propose to do . I 've tried to keep everything on a friendly basis but I see it 's not possible . Brenda will ask for alimony of two thousand a year from the Court and on our evidence we shall get it . I 'm sorry you oblige me to put it so bluntly . "
60596	60604	59720	59720	he	1602	" I had n't thought of that . "
60605	60623	60408	60408	Tony	219	" No , nor had we , to be quite frank . It was Beaver 's idea . "
60624	60637	59720	59720	he	1602	" You seem to have got me in a fairly hopeless position . "
60638	60649	60408	60408	Tony	219	" It 's not how I should have put it . "
60650	60673	59720	59720	he	1602	" I should like to make absolutely sure that Brenda is in on this . D'you mind if I ring her up ? "
60674	60696	60408	60408	Tony	219	" Not at all , my dear fellow . I happen to know she 's at Marjorie 's to - night . "
60702	60717	59720	59720	he	1602	" Brenda , this is Tony ... I 've just been dining with Reggie . "
60718	60727	59720	59720	he	1602	" Yes , he said something about it . "
60728	60745	59720	59720	he	1602	" He tells me that you are going to sue for alimony . Is that so ? "
60746	60769	59720	59720	he	1602	" Tony , do n't be so bullying . The lawyers are doing everything . It 's no use coming to me . "
60770	60784	59720	59720	he	1602	" But did you know that they proposed to ask for two thousand ? "
60785	60801	59720	59720	he	1602	" Yes . They did say that . I know it sounds a lot but ... "
60802	60835	59720	59720	he	1602	" And you know exactly how my money stands , do n't you ? You know it means selling Hetton , do n't you ? ... hullo , are you still there ? "
60836	60843	59720	59720	he	1602	" Yes , I 'm here . "
60844	60851	59720	59720	he	1602	" You know it means that ? "
60852	60869	59720	59720	he	1602	" Tony , do n't make me feel a beast . Everything has been so difficult . "
60870	60880	59720	59720	he	1602	" You do know just what you are asking ? "
60881	60888	59720	59720	he	1602	" Yes ... I suppose so . "
60889	60901	59720	59720	he	1602	" All right , that 's all I wanted to know . "
60902	60915	59720	59720	he	1602	" Tony , how odd you sound ... do n't ring off . "
60987	60990	60980	60980	Reggie	315	" Well ? "
60991	61019	60984	60984	his	315	" I got on to her . You were quite right . I 'm sorry I did n't believe you . It seemed so unlikely at first . "
61020	61030	60980	60980	Reggie	315	" That 's all right , my dear fellow . "
61031	61042	60984	60984	his	315	" I 've decided exactly what 's going to happen . "
61043	61046	60980	60980	Reggie	315	" Good . "
61047	61156	60984	60984	his	315	" Brenda is not going to get her divorce . The evidence I provided at Brighton is n't worth anything . There happens to have been a child there all the time . She slept both nights in the room I am supposed to have occupied . If you care to bring the case I shall defend it and win , but I think when you have seen my evidence you will drop it . I am going away for six months or so . When I come back , if she wishes it , I shall divorce Brenda without settlements of any kind . Is that clear ? "
61157	61166	60980	60980	Reggie	315	" But look here , my dear fellow . "
61167	61183	60984	60984	his	315	" Good night . Thank you for the dinner . Good luck to the excavations . "
61210	61226	61228	61229	Polly Cockpurse	223	" Who on earth would have expected the old boy to turn up like that ? "
61231	61248	61250	61250	Veronica	264	" Now I understand why they keep going on in the papers about divorce law reform , "
61252	61270	61250	61250	Veronica	264	" It 's _ too _ monstrous that he should be allowed to get away with it . "
61271	61282	61284	61284	Souki	301	" The mistake they made was in telling him first , "
61286	61296	61298	61300	Jenny Abdul Akbar	271	" It 's so like Brenda to trust everyone , "
61307	61319	61321	61321	Marjorie	228	" I do think Tony comes out of this pretty poorly , "
61323	61331	61333	61333	Allan	239	" Oh , I do n't know , "
61335	61348	61333	61333	Allan	239	" I expect your ass of a brother put the thing wrong . "
61359	61372	61357	61357	I	0	" any idea how many times round the deck make a mile ? "
61373	61380	61382	61382	Tony	219	" None , I 'm afraid , "
61384	61397	61382	61382	Tony	219	" But I should think you must have walked a great distance . "
61398	61435	61357	61357	I	0	" Twenty - two times . One soon gets out of sorts at sea if you 're used to an active life . She 's not much of a boat . Travel with this line often ? "
61436	61440	61382	61382	Tony	219	" Never before . "
61441	61485	61357	61357	I	0	" Ah . Thought you might have been in business in the islands . Not many tourists going out this time of year . Just the other way about . All coming home , if you see what I mean . Going far ? "
61486	61489	61382	61382	Tony	219	" Demerara . "
61490	61498	61357	61357	I	0	" Ah . Looking for minerals perhaps ? "
61499	61514	61382	61382	Tony	219	" No , to tell you the truth I am looking for a city . "
61524	61537	61515	61517	The genial passenger	1608	" Sounded just like you said you were looking for a city . "
61538	61541	61625	61625	Tony	219	" Yes . "
61542	61551	61515	61517	The genial passenger	1608	" That _ was _ what you said ? "
61552	61555	61625	61625	Tony	219	" Yes . "
61556	61578	61515	61517	The genial passenger	1608	" I thought it sounded like that ... well , so long . I must do another few rounds before dinner . "
61653	61655	61643	61644	the man	1007	" Hullo "
61657	61660	61643	61644	the man	1007	" Bit choppy "
61662	61667	61670	61670	he	1007	" Here we are again "
62032	62048	62049	62049	he	219	" I 'm afraid our table is not showing up very well to - night , "
62052	62075	62049	62049	he	219	" I see you are not a sufferer . My wife is in her cabin . _ She _ is a sufferer . "
62182	62191	62193	62195	the genial passenger	1608	" It 's not much of a boat , "
62202	62217	62193	62195	the genial passenger	1608	" But I expect things will look brighter when we get into the sun . "
62237	62243	62245	62247	the genial passenger	1608	" That 's all right , "
62249	62262	62263	62263	he	1608	" we 're just going down to the bar . You know , "
62270	62356	62263	62263	he	1608	" I feel I owe you an apology . I thought you were potty just now before dinner . Honestly I did , when you said you were going to Demerara to look for a city . Well , it sounded pretty potty . Then the purser -- I'm at his table . Always get the cheeriest crowd at the purser 's table _ and _ the best attention -- the purser told me about you . You 're the explorer , are n't you ? "
62357	62371	62373	62373	Tony	219	" Yes , come to think of it , I suppose I am , "
62476	62478	62473	62474	Dr Messinger	316	" trade goods"--failed
62539	62542	62545	62546	Dr Messinger	316	" trade goods "
62567	62569	62561	62563	the Negro clergyman	1649	" suffering "
62659	62661	62653	62655	The old man	1654	" Stop "
63427	63434	63436	63437	Dr Messinger	316	" I am going away shortly , "
63439	63494	63436	63437	Dr Messinger	316	" to Brazil . At least it may be Brazil or Dutch Guiana . One can not tell . The frontier has never been demarcated . I ought to have started last week , only my plans were upset . Do you by any chance know a Nicaraguan calling himself alternately Ponsonby and FitzClarence ? "
63495	63505	63393	63393	he	219	" No , I do n't think I do . "
63506	63526	63436	63437	Dr Messinger	316	" You are fortunate . That man has just robbed me of two hundred pounds and some machine guns . "
63527	63531	63393	63393	he	219	" Machine guns ? "
63532	63567	63436	63437	Dr Messinger	316	" Yes , I travel with one or two , mostly for show , you know , or for trade , and they are not easy to buy nowadays . Have you ever tried ? "
63568	63571	63393	63393	he	219	" No . "
63572	63599	63436	63437	Dr Messinger	316	" Well you can take it from me that it 's not easy . You ca n't just walk into a shop and order machine guns . "
63600	63607	63393	63393	he	219	" No , I suppose not . "
63608	63630	63436	63437	Dr Messinger	316	" Still , at a pinch I can do without them . But I ca n't do without two hundred pounds . "
63656	63660	63661	63661	he	316	" Ah yes , "
63664	63676	63661	63661	he	316	" interesting little place . I expect you know Zingermaun there ? "
63677	63687	63636	63636	his	219	" No , I 've not been there yet . "
63688	63748	63750	63750	he	316	" You 'd like him -- a very straight fellow . He used to do quite a lot , selling ammunition to the Atlas caids before the pacification . Of course it was easy money with the capitulations , but he did it better than most of them . I believe he 's running a restaurant now in Mogador . "
63754	63778	63750	63750	he	316	" The pity is I ca n't let the R.G.S. in on this expedition . I 've got to find the money privately . "
63810	63819	63821	63822	Dr Messinger	316	" We 'd better go up and lunch , "
63861	63872	63873	63873	he	219	" I have to be very careful what I eat , "
63964	64203	63958	63959	Dr Messinger	316	" ... You see , there has been a continuous tradition about the City since the first explorers of the sixteenth century . It has been variously allocated , sometimes down in Matto Grosso , sometimes on the upper Orinoco in what is now Venezuela . I myself used to think it lay somewhere on the Uraricuera . I was out there last year and it was then that I established contact with the Pie - wie Indians ; no white man had ever visited them and got out alive . And it was from the Pie - wies that I learned where to look . None of them had ever visited the City , of course , but they _ knew about it _ . Every Indian between Ciudad Bolivar and Para knows about it . But they wo n't talk . Queer people . But I became blood - brother with a Pie - wie -- interesting ceremony . They buried me up to the neck in mud and all the women of the tribe spat on my head . Then we ate a toad and snake and a beetle and after that I was blood - brother -- well , he told me that the City lies between the head waters of the Courantyne and the Takutu . There 's a vast track of unexplored country there . I 've often thought of visiting it . "
64204	64305	64487	64489	the genial passenger	1608	" I 've been looking up the historical side too , and I more or less know how the City got there . It was the result of a migration from Peru at the beginning of the fifteenth century , when the Incas were at the height of their power . It is mentioned in all the early Spanish documents as a popular legend . One of the younger princes rebelled and led his people off into the forest . Most of the tribes had a tradition in one form or another of a strange race passing through their territory . "
64306	64318	63958	63959	Dr Messinger	316	" But what do you suppose this city will be like ? "
64319	64410	64487	64489	the genial passenger	1608	" Impossible to say . Every tribe has a different word for it . The Pie - wies call it the ' Shining ' or ' Glittering ' , the Arekuna the ' Many Watered ' , the Patamonas the ' Bright Feathered ' , the Warau , oddly enough , use the same word for it that they use for a kind of aromatic jam they make . Of course , one ca n't tell how a civilization may have developed or degenerated in five hundred years of isolation ... "
64445	64454	64487	64489	the genial passenger	1608	" Done much of that kind of thing ? "
64455	64469	64487	64489	the genial passenger	1608	" No , to tell you the truth it is the first time . "
64470	64485	64487	64489	the genial passenger	1608	" Ah . Well , I daresay it 's more interesting than it sounds , "
64491	64501	64487	64489	the genial passenger	1608	" else people would n't do it so much . "
64776	64788	64790	64792	the genial passenger	1608	" I wonder if anyone is doing anything about those dogs , "
64799	64825	64790	64792	the genial passenger	1608	" I 'll ask the purser to - morrow . We might exercise them a bit . Kind of mournful the way they go on . "
64994	65002	65003	65003	he	1007	" Been talking to the wireless operator , "
65006	65020	65003	65003	he	1007	" We ought to pass quite near the Yarmouth Castle at about eleven . "
65290	65303	65367	65367	they	1242	" Look , Ernie , come quick , there 's a shark . "
65304	65316	65367	65367	they	1242	" That 's not a shark , it 's a dolphin . "
65317	65326	65367	65367	they	1242	" Mr Brink said it was a porpoise . "
65327	65341	65367	65367	they	1242	" There he is again . Oh , if I had my camera . "
65494	65513	65491	65491	She	1755	" The last days have been terrible . I saw you walking about . How I envied you . "
65514	65525	65684	65684	she	1759	" It ought to be calm all the way now , "
65529	65535	65491	65491	She	1755	" Are you going far ? "
65536	65556	65491	65491	She	1755	" Trinidad . That is my home ... I tried to decide who you were from the passenger list . "
65557	65562	65491	65491	She	1755	" Who was I ? "
65563	65571	65491	65491	She	1755	" Well ... someone called Colonel Strapper . "
65572	65579	65491	65491	She	1755	" Do I look so old ? "
65580	65621	65491	65491	She	1755	" Are colonels old ? I did n't know . It 's not a thing we have much in Trinidad . Now I know who you are because I asked the head steward . Do tell me about your exploring . "
65622	65639	65491	65491	She	1755	" You 'd better ask Doctor Messinger . He knows more about it than I do . "
65640	65649	65491	65491	She	1755	" No , _ you _ tell me . "
65734	65805	65726	65726	she	1759	" ... Some of us used to keep lipstick and rouge secretly in our bedrooms and try it on at night . One girl called Antoinette came to Mass on Sunday wearing it . There was a terrible row with Madame de Supplice and she left after that term . It was awfully brave . We all envied her ... But she was an ugly girl , always eating chocolates ... "
65806	65944	65726	65726	she	1759	" ... Now I am coming home to be married ... No , I am not yet engaged , but you see there are so few young men I can marry . They must be Catholic and of an island family . It would not do to marry an official and go back to live in England . But it will be easy because I have no brothers or sisters and my father has one of the best houses in Trinidad . You must come and see it . It is a stone house , outside the town . My family came to Trinidad in the French Revolution . There are two or three other rich families and I shall marry into one of them . Our son will have the house . It will be easy ... "
65968	66047	65945	65945	She	1760	" ... There was an American girl at Madame de Supplice 's who was engaged . She had a ring with a big diamond but she could never wear it except in bed . Then one day she had a letter from her young man saying he was going to marry another girl . How she cried . We all read the letter and most of us cried too ... But in Trinidad it will be quite easy . "
66165	66170	66171	66171	he	316	" But of course , "
66174	66193	66171	66171	he	316	" there may be nothing in it . It ought to be an interesting journey in any case . "
66194	66203	66205	66207	Th?r?se de Vitr	329	" How I wish I was a man , "
66376	66385	66386	66387	Dr Messinger	316	" We 'll go in a small boat , "
66391	66404	66386	66387	Dr Messinger	316	" so as to escape all that hideous nonsense of deck games . "
66446	66448	66443	66443	Tony	219	" Miss "
66478	66480	66473	66473	Th?r?se	329	" Tony "
66494	66498	66499	66499	she	329	" How funny , "
66502	66522	66499	66499	she	329	" that was the name of the man who did n't marry the American girl at Madame de Supplice 's "
66559	66577	66579	66579	Th?r?se	329	" I ca n't believe this is the same ship as in those cold , rough days , "
66986	67002	67004	67004	Th?r?se	329	" You must come to my home and see what real creole cooking is like , "
67006	67029	67004	67004	Th?r?se	329	" We have a lot of old recipes that the planters used to use . You must meet my father and mother . "
67060	67069	67071	67071	Tony	219	" Trinidad the day after to - morrow , "
67088	67098	67099	67099	she	329	" I do n't like Doctor Messinger at all , "
67102	67108	67099	67099	she	329	" Not anything about him . "
67109	67119	67079	67079	she	329	" And you will have to choose your husband . "
67120	67234	67099	67099	she	329	" Yes . There are seven of them . There was one called Honor ? I liked , but of course I have n't seen him for two years . He was studying to be an engineer . There 's one called Mendoza who 's very rich but he is n't really a Trinidadian . His grandfather came from Dominica and they say he has coloured blood . I expect it will be Honor ? . Mother always brought in his name when she wrote to me and he sent me things at Christmas and on my f?te . Rather silly things , because the shops are n't good in Port of Spain . "
67239	67269	67236	67236	she	1824	" You 'll be coming back by Trinidad , wo n't you ? So I shall see you then . Will you be a long time in the bush ? "
67270	67280	67079	67079	she	329	" I expect you 'll be married by then . "
67281	67292	67236	67236	she	1824	" Tony , why have n't you ever got married ? "
67293	67298	67079	67079	she	329	" But I am . "
67299	67302	67236	67236	she	1824	" Married ? "
67303	67306	67079	67079	she	329	" Yes . "
67307	67313	67236	67236	she	1824	" You 're teasing me . "
67314	67326	67079	67079	she	329	" No , honestly I am . At least I was . "
67327	67330	67236	67236	she	1824	" Oh . "
67331	67336	67079	67079	she	329	" Are you surprised ? "
67337	67355	67236	67236	she	1824	" I do n't know . Somehow I did n't think you were . Where is she ? "
67356	67365	67079	67079	she	329	" In England . We had a row . "
67366	67374	67236	67236	she	1824	" Oh ... What 's the time ? "
67375	67379	67079	67079	she	329	" Quite early . "
67380	67386	67236	67236	she	1824	" Let 's go back . "
67387	67392	67079	67079	she	329	" D'you want to ? "
67393	67405	67236	67236	she	1824	" Yes , please . It 's been a delightful day . "
67406	67419	67079	67079	she	329	" You said that as if you were saying good - bye . "
67420	67429	67236	67236	she	1824	" Did I ? I do n't know . "
67485	67491	67492	67492	she	329	" It does n't matter , "
67614	67622	67623	67623	she	329	" He was someone on the ship , "
67655	67664	67648	67648	She	329	" Reserved lot , these real old creoles , "
67682	67734	67648	67648	She	329	" Poor as church mice most of them , but stinking proud . Time and again I 've palled up with them on board and when we got to port it 's been good - bye . Do they ever so much as ask you to their houses ? Not they . "

68913	68919	68921	68921	Tony	219	" Half - past eight , "
68923	68935	68910	68911	Dr Messinger	316	" In London they are just beginning to collect for dinner . "
69306	69355	69356	69358	The black boys	1898	" A vampire bat got it . I must have gone to sleep with my foot against the netting . God knows how long he had been at it , before I woke up . That lamp ought to keep them off but it does n't seem to . "
69368	69377	69378	69378	they	1898	" Vampires plenty bad this side , Chief , "
69381	69391	69378	69378	they	1898	" Dat for why us no leave de fire . "
69392	69405	69407	69408	Dr Messinger	316	" It 's just the way to get sick , blast it , "
69410	69419	69407	69408	Dr Messinger	316	" I may have lost pints of blood . "
69485	69493	69494	69494	Brenda	233	" How I hate staying up late , "
69497	69538	69539	69539	she	233	" but it seems a shame to take my Mr Beaver away . He 's so thrilled to be here , bless him , and it was a great effort to get him asked ... Come to think of it , "
69543	69566	69494	69494	Brenda	233	" I suppose that this is the last year _ I _ shall be able to go to this kind of party . "
69567	69576	69478	69478	her	342	" You 're going through with the divorce ? "
69577	69644	69494	69494	Brenda	233	" I do n't know , Jock . It does n't really depend on me . It 's all a matter of holding down Mr Beaver . He 's getting very restive . I have to feed him a bit of high - life every week or so , and I suppose that 'll all stop if there 's a divorce . Any news of Tony ? "
69645	69672	69478	69478	her	342	" Not for some time now . I got a cable when he landed . He 's gone off on some expedition with a crook doctor . "
69673	69681	69494	69494	Brenda	233	" Is it _ absolutely _ safe ? "
69682	69707	69478	69478	her	342	" Oh , I imagine so . The whole world is civilized now , is n't it -- charabancs and Cook 's offices everywhere . "
69708	69736	69494	69494	Brenda	233	" Yes , I suppose it is ... I hope he 's not _ brooding _ . I should n't like to think of him being unhappy . "
69737	69747	69478	69478	her	342	" I expect he 's getting used to things . "
69748	69773	69494	69494	Brenda	233	" I do hope so . I 'm very fond of Tony , you know , in spite of the monstrous way he behaved . "

70428	70459	70425	70425	she	1938	" How do you do ? I am Rosa . I speak English good . I live bottom - side two years with Mr Forbes . You give me cigarette . "

70469	70475	70425	70425	she	1938	" She no speak English . "
70476	70483	70413	70413	she	1938	" But I was speaking Wapishiana . "

70496	70509	70413	70413	she	1938	" Oh . I did n't know . Where are the men ? "
70510	70518	70425	70425	she	1938	" Men all go hunting three days . "
70519	70526	70413	70413	she	1938	" When will they be back ? "
70527	70535	70425	70425	she	1938	" They go after bush - pig . "

70789	70825	70786	70787	Dr Messinger	316	" We 'd better go back to camp and wait . The men have been away three days . It 's not likely they will be much longer ... I wish I could speak Macushi . "

70991	71107	70985	70988	the under - secretary	1949	" The matter is receiving the closest attention . As the honourable member is no doubt aware , the question of the importation of pork pies is a matter for the Board of Trade , not for the Board of Agriculture . With regard to the specifications of the basic pig , I must remind the honourable member that , as he is doubtless aware , the eight - and - a - half - score pig is modelled on the requirements of the bacon curers and has no direct relation to pig meat for sale in pies . That is being dealt with by a separate committee who have not yet made their report . "
71108	71126	70985	70988	the under - secretary	1949	" Would the honourable member consider an increase of the specified maximum of fatness on the shoulders ? "
71127	71136	70985	70988	the under - secretary	1949	" I must have notice of that question . "

71973	72001	71910	71911	William Pitt	348	" Just like everybody else , short of money and nothing to do . She wondered if she could be any use to you at the shop . "
72002	72049	71910	71911	William Pitt	348	" Well ... It 's hard to say . At any other time she is exactly the kind of saleswoman I am always looking for ... but I do n't know . _ As things are _ , I 'm not sure it would be wise . "
72050	72062	71910	71911	William Pitt	348	" I said I 'd ask you , that 's all . "

72215	72234	71910	71911	William Pitt	348	" I 've an idea I sha n't get in ... anyway I could n't really afford it . "
72235	72264	72143	72144	Mrs Beaver	170	" I 'm not happy about you , John . I 'm not sure that things are working out as well as I hoped about Christmas - time . "
72265	72286	71910	71911	William Pitt	348	" There 's my telephone . Perhaps it 's Margot . She has n't asked me to anything for weeks . "

72349	72365	71910	71911	William Pitt	348	" Yes , I did . He says they elected about ten chaps last week . "
72366	72377	72143	72144	Mrs Beaver	170	" Oh , does that mean I 've been blackballed ? "
72378	72392	71910	71911	William Pitt	348	" I should n't know . Gentlemen are so odd about their clubs . "
72393	72408	72143	72144	Mrs Beaver	170	" I thought that you were going to make Allan and Reggie support me . "
72409	72433	71910	71911	William Pitt	348	" I asked them . What does it matter anyway ? D'you want to come to Veronica 's for the week - end ? "
72434	72443	72143	72144	Mrs Beaver	170	" I 'm not sure that I do . "
72444	72452	71910	71911	William Pitt	348	" _ I 'd _ like it . "
72453	72475	72143	72144	Mrs Beaver	170	" It 's a beastly little house -- and I do n't think Veronica likes me . Who 'll be there ? "
72476	72481	71910	71911	William Pitt	348	" I shall be . "
72482	72493	72143	72144	Mrs Beaver	170	" Yes ... well , I 'll let you know . "
72494	72502	71910	71911	William Pitt	348	" Am I seeing you this evening ? "
72503	72510	72143	72144	Mrs Beaver	170	" I 'll let you know . "
72511	72515	72517	72517	Brenda	233	" Oh dear , "
72523	72559	72517	72517	Brenda	233	" Now he 's taken against me . It is n't my fault he ca n't get into Brown 's . As a matter of fact I believe Reggie _ did _ try to help . "
72598	72611	72612	72612	she	271	" Let 's go and have a cosy lunch at the Ritz , "
72615	72658	72517	72517	Brenda	233	" The Ritz is n't cosy at lunch - time and it costs eight and six . I dare n't cash a cheque for three weeks , Jenny . The lawyers are so disagreeable . I 've never been like this before . "
72659	72674	72568	72568	her	271	" What would n't I do to Tony ? Leaving you stranded like this . "
72675	72705	72517	72517	Brenda	233	" Oh , what 's the good of knocking Tony ? I do n't suppose he 's having a packet of fun himself in Brazil or wherever it is . "
72706	72735	72568	72568	her	271	" I hear they are putting in bathrooms at Hetton -- while you are practically starving . And he has n't even gone to Mrs Beaver for them . "
72736	72748	72517	72517	Brenda	233	" Yes , I _ do _ think that was mean . "
72829	72882	72883	72883	She	233	" If I went there without him it would be a major bust - up ... Come to think of it , Marjorie 's probably going . Well , I can always have sandwiches for dinner here . They make all kinds . Thank God for the little shop round the corner . "
72938	72945	72946	72946	she	271	" I got Polly and Souki , "
72949	72966	72946	72946	she	271	" We 're going to Daisy 's joint . I _ wish _ you were coming . "
72967	72977	72979	72979	Brenda	233	" Me ? Oh , I 'm all right , "
72985	73002	72979	72979	Brenda	233	" It might occur to her to sock a girl a meal once in a way . "
73101	73114	73089	73089	he	316	" _ Dry watercourse , three deserted huts , stony ground .... _ "
73115	73126	73127	73127	he	316	" We are now in the Amazon system of rivers , "
73134	73144	73089	73089	he	316	" You see , the water is running south . "
73158	73162	73164	73165	Dr Messinger	316	" Very curious , "
73167	73175	73164	73165	Dr Messinger	316	" A discovery of genuine scientific value . "
73204	73215	73216	73216	he	316	" Is there a name for any of these streams ? "
73220	73227	73164	73165	Dr Messinger	316	" Macushi people called him Waurupang . "
73228	73244	73164	73165	Dr Messinger	316	" No , not the river where we first camped . _ These rivers . _ "
73245	73250	73164	73165	Dr Messinger	316	" Yes , Waurupang . "
73251	73258	73164	73165	Dr Messinger	316	" _ This river here . _ "
73259	73267	73164	73165	Dr Messinger	316	" Macushi people call him all Waurupang . "
73268	73273	73275	73276	Dr Messinger	316	" It 's hopeless , "
73761	73774	73898	73900	the cabouri fly	2028	" John , I think it 's time you had a holiday . "
73775	73783	73898	73900	the cabouri fly	2028	" A holiday what from , mumsy ? "
73784	73824	73898	73900	the cabouri fly	2028	" A change ... I 'm going to California in July . To the Fischbaums -- Mrs Arnold Fischbaum , not the one who lives in Paris . I think it would do you good to come with me . "
73825	73830	73898	73900	the cabouri fly	2028	" Yes , mumsy . "
73831	73843	73898	73900	the cabouri fly	2028	" You _ would _ like it , would n't you ? "
73844	73854	73898	73900	the cabouri fly	2028	" Me ? Yes , I 'd like it . "
73855	73874	73898	73900	the cabouri fly	2028	" You 've picked up that way of talking from Brenda . It sounds ridiculous in a man . "
73875	73880	73898	73900	the cabouri fly	2028	" Sorry , mumsy . "
73881	73890	73898	73900	the cabouri fly	2028	" All right then , that 's settled . "
74238	74249	74251	74252	Dr Messinger	316	" We ca n't go on breaking into tinned stores , "
74255	74265	74251	74252	Dr Messinger	316	" The men must go out and shoot something . "
74281	74289	74291	74291	Rosa	345	" No birds , no animals here , "
74293	74303	74291	74291	Rosa	345	" All gone . Maybe they get some fish . "
74354	74361	74363	74364	Dr Messinger	316	" This is clearly Amazon water , "
74366	74425	74363	74364	Dr Messinger	316	" It probably flows into the Rio Branco or the Rio Negro . The Pie - wies live along the bank , and the City , from all accounts , must be downstream of us , up one of the tributaries . When we reach the first Pie - wie village we will be able to get guides . "
74849	74861	74863	74863	she	345	" When will the boats be ready ? Ask the men . "
74866	74870	74863	74863	she	345	" Just now . "
74871	74879	74844	74845	Dr Messinger	316	" How many days -- four?--five?--how many ? "
74880	74891	74863	74863	she	345	" No , not many . Boats finish just now . "
74998	75001	75147	75147	Rosa	345	" emergency dump "
75011	75075	75147	75147	Rosa	345	" We shall take eight men with us . Four can stay behind with the women to guard the camp . Once we are among the Pie - wies , everything will be easy . These Macushis can go home then . I do n't think they will rob the stores . There is nothing here that would be much use to them . "
75076	75093	75147	75147	Rosa	345	" Had n't we better keep Rosa with us to act as interpreter with the Macushis ? "
75094	75106	75147	75147	Rosa	345	" Yes , perhaps we had . I will tell her . "
75161	75189	75145	75145	they	2061	" Rosa , we have decided to take you down the river with us . We need you to help us talk to the men . Understand ? "
75253	75256	75263	75263	she	345	" Understand ? "
75284	75347	75263	75263	she	345	" Listen , Rosa , all women and four men stay here in camp . Eight men come in boats to Pie - wie village . You come with boats . When we reach Pie - wie village , you and eight men and boats go back to camp to other women and men . Then back to Macushi country . Understand ? "
75353	75364	75350	75350	Rosa	345	" Macushi peoples no go with Pie - wie peoples . "
75365	75404	75263	75263	she	345	" I am not asking you to go _ with _ Pie - wie people . You and the men take us as far as Pie - wies , then you go back to Macushi people . Understand ? "
75430	75435	75436	75436	she	345	" Macushi peoples there , "
75454	75461	75462	75462	she	345	" Pie - wie peoples there , "
75465	75476	75462	75462	she	345	" Macushi peoples no go with Pie - wie peoples . "
75477	75504	75440	75440	she	345	" Now listen , Rosa . You are sensible , civilized woman . You lived two years with black gentleman , Mr Forbes . You like cigarettes-- "
75505	75512	75462	75462	she	345	" Yes , give me cigarettes . "
75513	75529	75440	75440	she	345	" You come with men in boats , I give you plenty , plenty cigarettes . "
75540	75564	75462	75462	she	345	" Listen . You will have your man and seven others to protect you . How can we talk with men without you ? "
75565	75570	75572	75572	Rosa	345	" Men no go , "
75574	75592	75462	75462	she	345	" Of course the men will go . The only question is , will you come too ? "
75593	75604	75606	75606	Rosa	345	" Macushi peoples no go with Pie - wie peoples , "
75608	75612	75614	75615	Dr Messinger	316	" Oh God , "
75618	75631	75614	75615	Dr Messinger	316	" All right , we 'll talk about it in the morning . "
75632	75638	75462	75462	she	345	" You give me cigarette .... "
75639	75653	75614	75615	Dr Messinger	316	" It 's going to be awkward if that woman does n't come . "
75654	75669	75671	75671	Tony	219	" It 's going to be much more awkward if none of them come , "
75723	75731	75733	75734	Dr Messinger	316	" We 're all right for stores , "
75736	75770	75733	75734	Dr Messinger	316	" There 's enough for three weeks at the shortest and we are bound to come across the Pie - wies in a day or two . We will start to - morrow . "

75864	75871	75872	75872	he	316	" We start to - morrow , "
75875	75881	75856	75857	Dr Messinger	316	" Yes , just now . "
75882	75927	75872	75872	he	316	" Tell the men what I told you last night . Eight men to come in boats , others wait here . You come in boats . All these stores stay here . All these stores go in boats . You tell men that . "
75932	75935	75872	75872	he	316	" Understand ? "
75936	75943	75944	75944	she	345	" No peoples go in boats , "
75947	75954	75956	75956	she	345	" All peoples go this way , "
75969	75983	75956	75956	she	345	" To - morrow or next day all people go back to village . "
75996	76012	75992	75993	Dr Messinger	316	" You tell the men to come here .... It 's no use threatening them , "
76026	76061	76013	76013	he	316	" They are a queer , timid lot . If you threaten them they take fright and disappear , leaving you stranded . Do n't worry , I shall be able to persuade them . "
76120	76131	76148	76148	they	922	" We 'd better go across and talk to them . "
76203	76209	76211	76212	Dr Messinger	316	" What 's the matter ? "
76214	76224	76211	76212	Dr Messinger	316	" I told you to bring the men here . "
76229	76245	76183	76183	her	345	" So Macushi people are cowards . They are afraid of Pie - wie people . "
76246	76253	76255	76255	Rosa	345	" It is the cassava field , "
76257	76273	76255	76255	Rosa	345	" We must go back to dig the cassava . Otherwise it will be bad . "
76274	76301	76183	76183	her	345	" Listen . I want the men for one , two weeks . No more . After that , all finish . They can go home . "
76302	76328	76255	76255	Rosa	345	" It is the time to dig the cassava . Macushi people dig cassava before the big rains . All people go home just now . "
76329	76335	76337	76338	Dr Messinger	316	" It 's pure blackmail , "
76340	76349	76337	76338	Dr Messinger	316	" Let 's get out some trade goods . "
76446	76452	76454	76454	Rosa	345	" You give me this , "
76472	76477	76478	76478	she	345	" Give me this , "
76496	76513	76478	76478	she	345	" Each man can choose three things from this box if he comes in the boats . "
76519	76528	76515	76515	Rosa	345	" Macushi peoples dig cassava field just now . "
76529	76535	76537	76538	Dr Messinger	316	" It 's no good , "
76547	76594	76515	76515	Rosa	345	" We shall have to try with the mice . I wanted to keep them till we reached the Pie - wies . It 's a pity . But they 'll fall for the mice , you see . I _ know _ the Indian mind . "
76914	76921	76923	76924	Dr Messinger	316	" Well , I 'm damned , "
76926	76934	76923	76924	Dr Messinger	316	" that 's better than I expected . "
76935	76943	77008	77009	Dr Messinger	316	" More than you expected , anyway . "
76944	76961	77008	77009	Dr Messinger	316	" Oh , it 's all right . They 'll come back . I know them . "
77012	77029	77008	77009	Dr Messinger	316	" We 'd better make a fire . They 'll come back when it is dark . "
77054	77062	77064	77064	Tony	219	" We 'd better get some supper , "
77123	77134	77136	77137	Dr Messinger	316	" We shall find them all here in the morning , "
77139	77146	77136	77137	Dr Messinger	316	" They 're an odd bunch . "
77251	77259	77261	77261	Brenda	233	" Let 's have the window open , "
77263	77270	77261	77261	Brenda	233	" It 's stuffy in here . "
77282	77288	77289	77289	she	233	" It 's quite light , "
77292	77304	77271	77272	The waiter	997	" After five . Ought n't we to go to bed ? "
77305	77308	77271	77272	The waiter	997	" Yes . "
77309	77322	77324	77324	Beaver	170	" Only another week and then all the parties will be over , "
77326	77329	77271	77272	The waiter	997	" Yes . "
77330	77337	77271	77272	The waiter	997	" Well , let 's go . "
77338	77353	77271	77272	The waiter	997	" All right . Can you pay ? I just have n't any money . "
77379	77383	77384	77384	he	997	" Eight shillings , "
77387	77406	77384	77384	he	997	" How does Daisy expect to make a success of the place when she charges prices like that ? "
77407	77424	77271	77272	The waiter	997	" It does seem a lot .... So you really _ are _ going to America ? "
77425	77435	77384	77384	he	997	" I must . Mother has taken the tickets . "
77436	77448	77271	77272	The waiter	997	" Nothing I 've said to - night makes any difference ? "
77449	77483	77384	77384	he	997	" Darling , do n't go on . We 've been through all that . You know it 's the only thing that _ can _ happen . Why spoil the last week ? "
77484	77497	77271	77272	The waiter	997	" You _ have _ enjoyed the summer , have n't you ? "
77498	77508	77384	77384	he	997	" Of course ... well , shall we go ? "
77509	77521	77271	77272	The waiter	997	" Yes . You need n't bother to see me home . "
77522	77543	77384	77384	he	997	" Sure you do n't mind ? It _ is _ miles out of the way and it 's late . "
77544	77553	77271	77272	The waiter	997	" There 's no knowing what I mind . "
77554	77575	77384	77384	he	997	" Brenda , darling , for heaven 's sake ... It is n't like you to go on like this . "
77576	77586	77271	77272	The waiter	997	" I never was one for making myself expensive . "
77743	77749	77751	77752	Dr Messinger	316	" The situation is grave , "
77754	77759	77751	77752	Dr Messinger	316	" But not desperate . "
78302	78314	78315	78315	he	219	" It was just a passing attack , was n't it ? "
78318	78332	78315	78315	he	219	" I shall be perfectly fit to - morrow , sha n't I ? "
78333	78338	78340	78341	Dr Messinger	316	" I hope so , "
78358	78363	78364	78364	he	219	" I feel grand , "
78367	78370	78315	78315	he	219	" Good . "
78481	78489	78491	78492	Dr Messinger	316	" We 've got to go on , "
78494	78505	78491	78492	Dr Messinger	316	" We ca n't be far from a village now . "
78506	78527	78465	78465	he	219	" I feel awful . Would n't it be better to wait a day till I am perfectly fit again ? "
78528	78553	78491	78492	Dr Messinger	316	" It 's no good waiting . We 've got to get on . D'you think you can manage to get into the canoe ? "
78690	78697	78698	78698	he	219	" So the Indians came back ? "
78701	78704	78686	78688	a human being	2117	" Yes . "
78705	78728	78686	78688	a human being	2117	" I knew they would . Silly of them to be scared by a toy . I suppose the others are following . "
78729	78741	78686	78688	a human being	2117	" Yes , I expect so . Try and sit still . "
78742	78753	78754	78754	Tony	219	" Damned fool , being frightened of a toy mouse , "
78770	78775	78776	78776	he	219	" I 'm sorry , "
78779	78798	78776	78776	he	219	" I did n't see it was you . You would n't be frightened of a toy mouse . "
78872	78879	78881	78881	Tony	219	" That 's what poise means , "
78883	78919	78921	78921	you	233	" D'you know , I once saw a questionnaire that people had to fill in when they applied for a job in an American firm , and one of the things they had to answer was "
78924	78925	78921	78921	you	233	" "
78938	78958	78959	78959	he	316	" What was so absurd about the question was that they only had the applicant 's word for it , "
78963	78979	78959	78959	he	316	" I mean -- is it a sign of poise to think you have it ? "
78980	78991	79036	79036	her	233	" Just sit quiet here while I sling your hammock . "
78992	79019	78959	78959	he	316	" Yes , I 'll sit here with Brenda . I am so glad she could come . She must have caught the three - eighteen . "
79090	79098	79084	79084	he	219	" You 're down to normal again . "
79099	79119	79145	79145	Their	2125	" Thank God . I 've been pretty ill , have n't I ? I ca n't remember much . "
79170	79175	79145	79145	Their	2125	" How d'you feel ? "
79176	79179	79181	79181	Tony	219	" Grand , "
79200	79225	79191	79191	he	219	" Of course , I have n't eaten anything . I expect it will be a day or two before I 'm really well . "
79259	79267	79318	79318	he	316	" See if you can drink this . "
79278	79287	79288	79288	he	219	" Are we going on to - day ? "
79291	79298	79299	79299	He	316	" We 'll think about it . "
79321	79407	79318	79318	he	316	" I think I 'd better explain things . It 's no use your thinking you are cured because you are out of fever for one day . That 's the way it goes . One day fever and one day normal . It may take a week or it may take much longer . That 's a thing we 've got to face . I ca n't risk taking you in the canoe . You nearly upset us several times the day before yesterday . "
79408	79418	79318	79318	he	316	" I thought there was someone there I knew . "
79419	79480	79318	79318	he	316	" You thought a lot of things . It 'll go on like that . Meanwhile we 've provisions for about ten days . There 's no immediate anxiety there but it 's a thing to remember . Besides , what you need is a roof over your head and constant nursing . If only we were at a village .... "
79481	79492	79318	79318	he	316	" I 'm afraid I 'm being a great nuisance . "
79493	79513	79318	79318	he	316	" That 's not the point . The thing is to find what is best for us to do . "
79543	79556	79534	79535	Dr Messinger	316	" I 'm going to fix up the tarpaulin as a roof . "
79583	79602	79580	79580	he	219	" Look here , why do n't you leave me here and go down the river for help ? "
79603	79616	79580	79580	he	219	" I thought of that . It 's too big a risk . "
79671	79679	79668	79668	He	219	" How long have we been here ? "
79680	79685	79627	79627	he	219	" Only three days . "
79686	79693	79668	79668	He	219	" What time is it now ? "
79694	79703	79627	79627	he	219	" Getting on for ten in the morning . "
79704	79709	79668	79668	He	219	" I feel awful . "
79717	79726	79727	79727	he	316	" I am going downstream for the day , "
79730	79796	79727	79727	he	316	" to see if there 's any sign of a village . I hate leaving you but it 's a chance worth taking . I shall be able to get a long way in the canoe now it 's empty . Lie quiet . Do n't move from the hammock . I shall be back before night . I hope with some Indians to help . "
79797	79801	79803	79803	Tony	219	" All right , "
80355	80359	80360	80360	she	233	" Mr Graceful , "
80363	80373	80360	80360	she	233	" I 've got to have some more money . "
80381	80416	80374	80375	Mr Graceful	356	" I should have thought that was really a question for your bank manager . I understand that your securities are in your own name and that the dividends are paid into your account . "
80417	80439	80351	80353	the family solicitors	1422	" They never seem to pay dividends nowadays . Besides , it 's really very difficult to live on so little . "
80440	80447	80374	80375	Mr Graceful	356	" No doubt . No doubt . "
80448	80462	80351	80353	the family solicitors	1422	" Mr Last left you with power of attorney , did n't he ? "
80463	80533	80374	80375	Mr Graceful	356	" With strictly limited powers , Lady Brenda . I am instructed to pay the wage bill at Hetton and all expenses connected with the upkeep of the estate -- he is putting in new bathrooms and restoring some decorations in the morning - room which had been demolished . But I am afraid that I have no authority to draw on Mr Last 's account for other charges . "
80534	80573	80351	80353	the family solicitors	1422	" But , Mr Graceful , I am sure he did n't intend to stay abroad so long . He ca n't possibly have meant to leave me stranded like this , can he ? ... Can he ? "
80582	80618	80574	80575	Mr Graceful	356	" To be quite frank , Lady Brenda , I fear that _ was _ his intention . I raised this particular point shortly before his departure . He was quite resolved on the subject . "
80619	80646	80351	80353	the family solicitors	1422	" But is he _ allowed _ to do that ? I mean , have n't I got any rights under the marriage settlement or anything ? "
80647	80728	80574	80575	Mr Graceful	356	" Nothing which you can claim without application to the courts . You _ might _ find solicitors who would advise you to take action . I can not say that I should be one of them . Mr Last would oppose any such order to the utmost and I think that , in the present circumstances , the courts would undoubtedly find for him . In any case it would be a prolonged , costly and slightly undignified proceeding . "
80729	80745	80351	80353	the family solicitors	1422	" Oh , I see ... well , that 's that , is n't it ? "
80746	80755	80574	80575	Mr Graceful	356	" It certainly looks as though it were . "
80783	80807	80574	80575	Mr Graceful	356	" There 's one thing . Do you know , I mean , can you tell me whether Mr Last made another will ? "
80808	80821	80574	80575	Mr Graceful	356	" I 'm afraid that is a thing I can not discuss . "
80822	80850	80574	80575	Mr Graceful	356	" No , I suppose not . I 'm sorry if it was wrong to ask . I just wanted to know how I am with him . "
80870	80946	80851	80851	She	233	" Perhaps I can say as much as this to guide you . The heirs - presumptive to Hetton are now his cousins , the Richard Lasts at Princes Risborough . I think that your knowledge of Mr Last 's character and opinions will tell you that he would always wish his fortune to go with the estate , in order that it may be preserved in what he holds to be its right condition . "
80947	80950	80952	80952	Brenda	233	" Yes , "
80954	80969	80952	80952	Brenda	233	" I ought to have thought of that . Well , good - bye . "
81701	81709	81691	81691	Tony	219	" Why are you dressed like that ? "
81710	81723	81837	81837	they	2175	" Do n't you like it ? I got it from Polly . "
81724	81730	81691	81691	Tony	219	" It looks so dirty . "
81731	81753	81837	81837	they	2175	" Well , Polly travels about a lot . You must get up now to go to the County Council meeting . "
81754	81761	81691	81691	Tony	219	" But it is n't Wednesday ? "
81762	81776	81837	81837	they	2175	" No , but time is different in Brazil ; surely you remember ? "
81777	81815	81691	81691	Tony	219	" I ca n't get as far as Pigstanton . I 've got to stay here until Messinger comes back . I 'm ill . He told me to be quiet . He 's coming this evening . "
81816	81834	81837	81837	they	2175	" But all the County Council are here . The Shameless Blonde brought them in her aeroplane . "
81851	81870	81848	81848	He	315	" I strongly object to Milly being on the committee . She is a woman of low repute . "
81874	81890	81871	81871	Tony	219	" She has a daughter . She has as much right here as Lady Cockpurse . "
81891	81894	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" Order , "
81899	81952	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" I must ask you gentlemen to confine your remarks to the subject under discussion . We have to decide about the widening of the Bayton - Pigstanton road . There have been several complaints that it 's impossible for the Green Line buses to turn the corner safely at Hetton Cross . "
81953	81960	81871	81871	Tony	219	" Green Line _ rats _ . "
81961	81988	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" I said Green Line rats . Mechanical green line rats . Many of the villagers have been scared by them and have evacuated their cottages . "
81989	81993	81995	81997	Reggie St Cloud	315	" I evacuated , "
81999	82012	81995	81997	Reggie St Cloud	315	" I was driven out of my house by mechanical green rats . "
82013	82016	82018	82019	Polly Cockpurse	222	" Order , "
82021	82031	82018	82019	Polly Cockpurse	222	" I move that Mr Last address the meeting . "
82032	82037	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" Hear , hear . "
82038	82043	82045	82045	Tony	219	" Ladies and gentlemen , "
82047	82073	82045	82045	Tony	219	" I beg you to understand that I am ill and must not move from the hammock . Dr Messinger has given the clearest instructions . "
82074	82080	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" Winnie wants to bathe . "
82081	82092	82045	82045	Tony	219	" No bathing in Brazil . No bathing in Brazil . "
82100	82106	82045	82045	Tony	219	" No bathing in Brazil . "
82107	82114	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" But you had two breakfasts . "
82115	82118	82120	82121	the Mayor	2413	" Order , "
82123	82138	82120	82121	the Mayor	2413	" Lord St Cloud , I suggest you put the question to the vote . "
82139	82193	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" The question is whether the contract for the widening of the corner of Hetton Cross shall be given to Mrs Beaver . Of the tenders submitted hers was by far the most expensive but I understand that her plans include a chromium - plated wall on the south side of the village ... "
82194	82200	82202	82202	Winnie	304	" ... and two breakfasts , "
82204	82241	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" ... and two breakfasts for the men engaged on the work . Those in favour of the motion will make a clucking sound in imitation of hens , those against will say bow - wow . "
82242	82248	82250	82250	Reggie	315	" A most improper proceeding , "
82252	82259	82250	82250	Reggie	315	" What will the servants think ? "
82260	82273	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" We have got to do something until Brenda has been told . "
82274	82283	82250	82250	Reggie	315	" ... Me ? I 'm all right . "
82284	82294	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" Then I take it the motion is carried . "
82295	82309	82311	82311	Brenda	233	" Oh , I _ am _ glad Mrs Beaver got the job , "
82313	82340	82311	82311	Brenda	233	" You see I 'm in love with John Beaver , I 'm in love with John Beaver , I 'm in love with John Beaver . "
82341	82350	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" Is that the decision of the committee ? "
82351	82362	82311	82311	Brenda	233	" Yes , she is in love with John Beaver . "
82363	82370	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" Then that is carried unanimously . "
82371	82374	82376	82376	Winnie	304	" No , "
82378	82384	82376	82376	Winnie	304	" He ate two breakfasts . "
82385	82392	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" ... by an overwhelming majority . "
82393	82402	82404	82404	Tony	219	" Why are you all changing your clothes ? "
82414	82428	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" For the lawn meet . Hounds are meeting here to - day . "
82429	82438	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" But you ca n't hunt in summer . "
82439	82451	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" Time is different in Brazil and there is no bathing . "
82452	82515	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" I saw a fox yesterday in Bruton Wood . A mechanical green fox with a bell inside him that jingled as he ran . It frightened them so much that they ran away and the whole beach was deserted and there was no bathing except for Beaver . He can bathe every day , for the time is different in Brazil . "
82516	82525	82527	82527	Ambrose	263	" I 'm in love with John Beaver , "
82529	82540	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" Why , I did n't know you were here . "
82541	82563	82527	82527	Ambrose	263	" I came to remind you that you were ill , sir . You must on no account leave your hammock . "
82564	82577	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" But how can I reach the City if I stay here ? "
82578	82591	82527	82527	Ambrose	263	" I will serve it directly , sir , in the library . "
82592	82620	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" Yes , in the library . There is no point in using the dining - hall now that her Ladyship has gone to live in Brazil . "
82621	82633	82527	82527	Ambrose	263	" I will send the order to the stables , sir . "
82634	82650	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" But I do n't want the pony . I told Ben to sell her . "
82651	82672	82527	82527	Ambrose	263	" You will have to ride to the smoking - room , sir . Dr Messinger has taken the canoe . "
82673	82679	81896	81897	the Mayor	2413	" Very well , Ambrose . "
82680	82686	82527	82527	Ambrose	263	" Thank you , sir . "
82721	82726	82727	82727	she	286	" Bow - wow , "
82735	82741	82727	82727	she	286	" That carries the motion . "
82952	82958	82949	82949	Ambrose	263	" The City is served . "
83421	83435	83437	83437	Tony	219	" You 're the first person who 's spoken to me for days , "
83439	83515	83437	83437	Tony	219	" The others wo n't stop . They keep bicycling by ... I 'm tired ... Brenda was with me at first but she was frightened by a mechanical mouse , so she took the canoe and went off . She said she would come back that evening but she did n't . I expect she 's staying with one of her new friends in Brazil ... You have n't seen her , have you ? "
83516	83531	83600	83600	Tony	219	" You are the first stranger I have seen for a very long time . "
83532	83549	83551	83551	he	2215	" She was wearing a top hat when she left . You ca n't miss her . "
83567	83599	83600	83600	Tony	219	" Do you see that house over there ? Do you think you can manage to walk to it ? If not , I can send some Indians to carry you . "
83611	83618	83619	83619	he	219	" Architecture harmonizing with local character , "
83622	83644	83619	83619	he	219	" indigenous material employed throughout . Do n't let Mrs Beaver see it or she will cover it with chromium plating . "
83645	83650	83651	83652	Mr Todd	358	" Try and walk . "
83666	83708	83619	83619	he	219	" I 'll ride your bicycle . It _ was _ you I passed just now on a bicycle , was n't it ? ... except that your beard is a different colour . His was green ... green as mice . "
83722	83744	83709	83710	Mr Todd	358	" It is a very short way . When we get there I will give you something to make you better . "
83745	83778	83780	83780	he	358	" Very kind of you ... rotten thing for a man to have his wife go away in a canoe . That was a long time ago . Nothing to eat since . "
83783	83801	83780	83780	he	358	" I say , you 're English . I 'm English too . My name is Last . "
83802	83835	83709	83710	Mr Todd	358	" Well , Mr Last , you are n't to bother about anything more . You 're ill and you 've had a rough journey . I 'll take care of you . "
83841	83847	83836	83836	Tony	219	" Are you all English ? "
83848	83855	83709	83710	Mr Todd	358	" Yes , all of us . "
83856	83883	83836	83836	Tony	219	" That dark girl married a Moor ... It 's very lucky I met you all . I suppose you 're some kind of cycling club ? "
83884	83887	83709	83710	Mr Todd	358	" Yes . "
83888	83924	83836	83836	Tony	219	" Well , I feel too tired for bicycling ... never liked it much ... you fellows ought to get motor bicycles , you know , much faster and noisier ... Let 's stop here . "
83925	83944	83709	83710	Mr Todd	358	" No , you must come as far as the house . It 's not very much farther . "
83945	83960	83836	83836	Tony	219	" All right ... I suppose you would have some difficulty getting petrol here . "
83973	83980	83709	83710	Mr Todd	358	" Lie there in the hammock . "
83981	83996	83709	83710	Mr Todd	358	" That 's what Messinger said . He 's in love with John Beaver . "
83997	84005	83709	83710	Mr Todd	358	" I will get something for you . "
84006	84042	83709	83710	Mr Todd	358	" Very good of you . Just my usual morning tray -- coffee , toast , fruit . And the morning papers . If her Ladyship has been called I will have it with her ... "
84103	84321	84089	84089	he	358	" ... You would hear better and it would be more polite if you stood still when I addressed you instead of walking round in a circle . It is for your own good that I am telling you ... I know you are friends of my wife and that is why you will not listen to me . But be careful . She will say nothing cruel , she will not raise her voice , there will be no hard words . She hopes you will be great friends afterwards as before . But she will leave you . She will go away quietly during the night . She will take her hammock and her rations of farine ... Listen to me . I know I am not clever but that is no reason why we should forget all courtesy . Let us kill in the gentlest manner . I will tell you what I have learned in the forest , where time is different . There is no City . Mrs Beaver has covered it with chromium plating and converted it into flats . Three guineas a week , each with a separate bathroom . Very suitable for base love . And Polly will be there . She and Mrs Beaver under the fallen battlements ... "
84350	84354	84355	84355	he	219	" Nasty medicine , "
84497	84503	84505	84505	Tony	219	" It 's very nasty , "
84507	84514	84505	84505	Tony	219	" but it does do good . "
84515	84525	84527	84528	Mr Todd	358	" There is medicine for everything in the forest , "
84530	84648	84527	84528	Mr Todd	358	" to make you well and to make you ill . My mother was an Indian and she taught me many of them . I have learned others from time to time from my wives . There are plants to cure you and give you fever , to kill you and send you mad , to keep away snakes , to intoxicate fish so that you can pick them out of the water with your hands like fruit from a tree . There are medicines even I do not know . They say that it is possible to bring dead people to life after they have begun to stink , but I have not seen it done . "
84649	84656	84505	84505	Tony	219	" But surely you are English ? "
84657	84773	84527	84528	Mr Todd	358	" My father was -- at least a Barbadian . He came to Guiana as a missionary . He was married to a white woman but he left her in Guiana to look for gold . Then he took my mother . The Pie - wie women are ugly but very devoted . I have had many . Most of the men and women living in this savannah are my children . That is why they obey -- for that reason and because I have the gun . My father lived to a great age . It is not twenty years since he died . He was a man of education . Can you read ? "
84774	84780	84505	84505	Tony	219	" Yes , of course . "
84781	84795	84527	84528	Mr Todd	358	" It is not everyone who is so fortunate . I can not . "
84800	84811	84796	84796	Tony	219	" But I suppose you have n't much opportunity here . "
84812	84887	84527	84528	Mr Todd	358	" Oh yes , that is just it . I have a _ great _ many books . I will show you when you are better . Until five years ago there was an Englishman -- at least a black man , but he was well educated in Georgetown . He died . He used to read to me every day until he died . You shall read to me when you are better . "
84888	84895	84796	84796	Tony	219	" I shall be delighted to . "
84896	84905	84906	84907	Mr Todd	358	" Yes , you shall read to me , "
85009	85020	85021	85021	he	358	" I will show you the black man 's grave , "
85034	85084	85021	85021	he	358	" He was very kind . Every afternoon until he died , for two hours , he used to read to me . I think I will put up a cross -- to commemorate his death and your arrival -- a pretty idea . Do you believe in God ? "
85085	85099	85021	85021	he	358	" I suppose so . I 've never really thought about it much . "
85100	85121	85021	85021	he	358	" I have thought about it a _ great _ deal and I still do not know ... Dickens did . "
85122	85127	85021	85021	he	358	" I suppose so . "
85128	85144	85021	85021	he	358	" Oh yes , it is apparent in all his books . You will see . "
85201	85214	85197	85198	Mr Todd	358	" Now I think you are well enough to see the books . "
85296	85326	85547	85547	his	219	" It has been hard to keep out the worms and ants . Two are practically destroyed . But there is an oil the Indians make that is useful . "
85353	85363	85547	85547	his	219	" It does not matter which we take first . "
85364	85371	85547	85547	his	219	" You are fond of Dickens ? "
85372	85485	85547	85547	his	219	" Why , yes , of course . More than fond , far more . You see , they are the only books I have ever heard . My father used to read them and then later the black man ... and now you . I have heard them all several times by now but I never get tired ; there is always more to be learned and noticed , so many characters , so many changes of scene , so many words ... I have all Dickens 's books here except those that the ants devoured . It takes a long time to read them all -- more than two years . "
85486	85489	85491	85491	Tony	219	" Well , "
85494	85503	85491	85491	Tony	219	" they will well last out my visit . "
85504	85530	85547	85547	his	219	" Oh , I hope not . It is delightful to start again . Each time I think I find more to enjoy and admire . "
85668	85678	85664	85664	he	1654	" Repeat the name , I have forgotten him , "
85680	85696	85664	85664	he	1654	" Yes , yes , I remember her well . She dies , poor woman . "
85754	85787	85788	85788	He	1654	" Now , why does she say that ? Does she really mean it ? Did she feel faint because of the heat of the fire or of something in that paper ? "
85829	85836	85840	85840	his	219	" Tom - all - alone 's "
85855	85866	85846	85846	His	1654	" I think the Dedlock is a very proud man , "
85869	85881	85846	85846	His	1654	" Mrs Jellyby does not take enough care of her children . "
85905	85936	85900	85902	the old man	1654	" You read beautifully , with a far better accent than the black man . And you explain better . It is almost as though my father were here again . "
85951	85982	85945	85945	he	1654	" I enjoyed that _ very _ much . It was an extremely distressing chapter . But , if I remember it rightly , it will all turn out well . "
86079	86102	86076	86076	Tony	219	" We still have a lot to get through . I hope I shall be able to finish it before I go . "
86103	86107	86109	86110	Mr Todd	358	" Oh yes , "
86112	86131	86109	86110	Mr Todd	358	" Do not disturb yourself about that . You will have time to finish it , my friend . "
86171	86205	86076	86076	Tony	219	" You know , Mr Todd , the time has come when I must be thinking about getting back to civilization . I have already imposed myself on your hospitality far too long . "
86223	86271	86377	86377	he	219	" How soon do you think I shall be able to get a boat ? ... I said , how soon do you think I shall be able to get a boat ? I appreciate all your kindness to me more than I can say , but ... "
86272	86300	86377	86377	he	219	" My friend , any kindness I may have shown is amply repaid by your reading of Dickens . Do not let us mention the subject again . "
86301	86328	86377	86377	he	219	" Well , I 'm very glad you have enjoyed it . I have , too . But I really must be thinking of getting back ... "
86329	86332	86334	86335	Mr Todd	358	" Yes , "
86337	86358	86334	86335	Mr Todd	358	" The black man was like that . He thought of it all the time . But he died here ... "
86380	86402	86377	86377	he	219	" Forgive me , Mr Todd , but I really must press the point . When can I get a boat ? "
86403	86409	86377	86377	he	219	" There is no boat . "
86410	86419	86377	86377	he	219	" Well , the Indians can build one . "
86420	86438	86377	86377	he	219	" You must wait for the rains . There is not enough water in the river now . "
86439	86446	86377	86377	he	219	" How long will that be ? "
86447	86454	86377	86377	he	219	" A month ... two months ... "
86478	86489	86377	86377	he	219	" Now it is time to make preparations to go . "
86490	86516	86377	86377	he	219	" Oh , that is impossible . The Indians will not make a boat during the rainy season -- it is one of their superstitions . "
86517	86524	86377	86377	he	219	" You might have told me . "
86525	86535	86377	86377	he	219	" Did I not mention it ? I forgot . "
86705	86765	86701	86702	Mr Todd	358	" Mr Last , the Indians tell me that you have been trying to speak with them . It is easier that you say anything you wish through me . You realize , do you not , that they would do nothing without my authority . They regard themselves , quite rightly in many cases , as my children . "
86766	86783	86841	86841	his	219	" Well , as a matter of fact , I was asking them about a canoe . "
86784	86815	86701	86702	Mr Todd	358	" So they gave me to understand ... and now if you have finished your meal perhaps we might have another chapter . I am quite absorbed in the book . "
86930	86934	86936	86936	Tony	219	" Mr Todd , "
86938	86993	86936	86936	Tony	219	" I must speak frankly . You saved my life , and when I get back to civilization I will reward you to the best of my ability . I will give you anything within reason . But at present you are keeping me here against my will . I demand to be released . "
86994	87016	86889	86889	he	366	" But , my friend , what is keeping you ? You are under no restraint . Go when you like . "
87017	87032	86936	86936	Tony	219	" You know very well that I ca n't get away without your help . "
87033	87049	86889	86889	he	366	" In that case you must humour an old man . Read me another chapter . "
87050	87087	86936	86936	Tony	219	" Mr Todd , I swear by anything you like that when I get to Man?os I will find someone to take my place . I will pay a man to read to you all day . "
87088	87103	86889	86889	he	366	" But I have no need of another man . You read so well . "
87104	87113	86936	86936	Tony	219	" I have read for the last time . "
87114	87119	87121	87122	Mr Todd	358	" I hope not , "
87626	87647	87613	87613	he	219	" _ Darling _ , you 've been much longer than you said . I quite thought you were lost ... "
87656	87674	87652	87653	Mr Todd	358	" May I trouble you to read that passage again ? It is one I particularly enjoy . "
87736	87746	87747	87747	he	219	" It is one of the local feast days , "
87750	87784	87747	87747	he	219	" and they have been making _ pivari _ . You may not like it but you should try some . We will go across to this man 's home to - night . "
87853	87869	87845	87845	they	2285	" You must drink it all without lowering the cup . That is the etiquette . "
87940	88014	87931	87933	the search party	2289	" journey from them . Meanwhile he was warm and drowsy . The cadence of song rose and fell interminably , liturgically . Another calabash of _ pivari _ was offered him and he handed it back empty . He lay full length watching the play of shadows on the thatch as the Pie - wies began to dance . Then he shut his eyes and thought of England and Hetton and fell asleep .
88094	88103	88104	88104	he	219	" I must have been tight last night , "
88111	88192	88104	88104	he	219	" He had a headache and feared a recurrence of fever . He found when he set his feet to the ground that he stood with difficulty ; his walk was unsteady and his mind confused as it had been during the first weeks of his convalescence . On his way across the savannah he was obliged to stop more than once , shutting his eyes and breathing deeply . When he reached the house he found Mr Todd sitting there .
88193	88222	88104	88104	he	219	" Ah , my friend , you are late for the reading this afternoon . There is scarcely another half hour of light . How do you feel ? "
88223	88236	88104	88104	he	219	" Rotten . That drink does n't seem to agree with me . "
88237	88265	88104	88104	he	219	" I will give you something to make you better . The forest has remedies for everything ; to make you awake and to make you sleep . "
88266	88275	88104	88104	he	219	" You have n't seen my watch anywhere ? "
88276	88282	88104	88104	he	219	" You have missed it ? "
88283	88303	88104	88104	he	219	" Yes . I thought I was wearing it . I say , I 've never slept so long . "
88304	88321	88104	88104	he	219	" Not since you were a baby . Do you know how long ? Two days . "
88322	88330	88104	88104	he	219	" Nonsense . I ca n't have . "
88331	88352	88104	88104	he	219	" Yes , indeed . It is a long time . It is a pity because you missed our guests . "
88353	88356	88104	88104	he	219	" Guests ? "
88357	88619	88104	88104	he	219	" Why , yes . I have been quite gay while you were asleep . Three men from outside . Englishmen . It is a pity you missed them . A pity for them , too , as they particularly wished to see you . But what could I do ? You were so sound asleep . They had come all the way to find you , so -- I thought you would not mind -- as you could not greet them yourself , I gave them a little souvenir , your watch . They wanted something to take back to England where a reward is being offered for news of you . They were very pleased with it . And they took some photographs of the little cross I put up to commemorate your coming . They were pleased with that , too . They were very easily pleased . But I do not suppose they will visit us again , our life here is so retired ... no pleasures except reading ... I do not suppose we shall ever have visitors again ... well , well , I will get you some medicine to make you feel better . Your head aches , does it not ? ... We will not have any Dickens to - day ... but to - morrow , and the day after that , and the day after that . Let us read _ Little Dorrit _ again . There are passages in that book I can never hear without the temptation to weep . "

89081	89093	89077	89078	Mr Last	254	" _ Jamboree ? _ Is nothing sacred to you children ? "
89097	89140	89094	89094	Teddy	274	" Another casualty at the stinkeries . That little vixen we bought from the people at Okehampton got her brush bitten off during the night . Must have got it through the wire into the next cage . Tricky birds , foxes . "

89208	89248	89206	89206	Teddy	274	" I 've got to run over to Bayton and get some more rabbits for the foxes . Chivers says he 's got about fifty waiting for me . We ca n't shoot enough here . Greedy little beggars . "
89249	89292	89168	89168	mother	2445	" It will be all over by half - past eleven . Mr Tendril is n't going to preach a sermon . It 's just as well really . He 's got it into his head that Cousin Tony died in Afghanistan . "
89293	89318	89206	89206	Teddy	274	" There 's a letter here from Cousin Brenda . She 's very sorry but she ca n't get down here for the dedication . "
89319	89322	89168	89168	mother	2445	" Oh . "
89329	89344	89168	89168	mother	2445	" She says that Jock has a three - line whip for this afternoon . "
89345	89348	89168	89168	mother	2445	" Oh . "
89349	89357	89359	89359	Molly	223	" She could have come without him , "
89361	89373	89168	89168	mother	2445	" She sends her love to us all and to Hetton . "
89379	89391	89393	89393	Molly	223	" Well , I think it 's a jolly good thing , "
89395	89416	89393	89393	Molly	223	" She could n't show much widowly grief . It did n't take her long to get hitched up again . "

89423	89432	89393	89393	Molly	223	" And you know you think the same . "
89433	89472	89168	89168	mother	2445	" I will not allow you to talk like that about Cousin Brenda , whatever we think . She had a perfect right to marry again and I hope she and Mr Grant - Menzies are very happy . "
89473	89488	89490	89490	Agnes	370	" She was always jolly decent to us when she used to live here , "
89492	89500	89502	89502	Teddy	274	" Well , I should hope so , "
89504	89513	89502	89502	Teddy	274	" After all , it 's our place . "
89724	89733	89734	89734	he	252	" I 'm glad we put that up , "
89737	89795	89734	89734	he	252	" You know , I should never have thought of it , if it had not been for a Mrs Beaver . She wrote to me as soon as the news of Tony 's death was published . I did n't know her at the time . Of course we knew very few of Tony 's friends . "
89796	89802	89692	89693	the relatives	2333	" It was her suggestion ? "
89803	89891	89734	89734	he	252	" Yes , she said that as one of Tony 's closest friends she knew he would wish to have some monument at Hetton . She was most considerate -- even offering to arrange with the contractors for it . Her own plans were more ambitious . She proposed that we should have the chapel redecorated as a chantry . But I think this is what he would have preferred . The stone comes from one of our own quarries and was cut by the estate workmen . "
89892	89903	89905	89907	Lady St Cloud	303	" Yes , I think he would have preferred this , "
89975	89981	89982	89982	he	274	" Coming to the stinkeries ? "
89986	90009	89982	89982	he	274	" No , I 'm looking after Cousin Frances . She got rather on mother 's nerves through crabbing the new boiler . "
