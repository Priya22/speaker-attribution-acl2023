767	790	791	793	the worthy woman	365	" I 'll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla where he 's gone and why , "
797	899	791	793	the worthy woman	365	" He does n't generally go to town this time of year and he _ never _ visits ; if he 'd run out of turnip seed he would n't dress up and take the buggy to go for more ; he was n't driving fast enough to be going for a doctor . Yet something must have happened since last night to start him off . I 'm clean puzzled , that 's what , and I wo n't know a minute 's peace of mind or conscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea today . "
1052	1064	1065	1065	she	105	" It 's just _ staying _ , that 's what , "
1084	1170	1065	1065	she	105	" It 's no wonder Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd , living away back here by themselves . Trees are n't much company , though dear knows if they were there 'd be enough of them . I 'd ruther look at people . To be sure , they seem contented enough ; but then , I suppose , they 're used to it . A body can get used to anything , even to being hanged , as the Irishman said . "
1560	1566	1567	1567	Marilla	113	" Good evening , Rachel , "
1571	1595	1567	1567	Marilla	113	" This is a real fine evening , is n't it ? Wo n't you sit down ? How are all your folks ? "
1720	1727	1729	1730	Mrs. Rachel	105	" We 're all pretty well , "
1732	1765	1729	1730	Mrs. Rachel	105	" I was kind of afraid _ you _ were n't , though , when I saw Matthew starting off today . I thought maybe he was going to the doctor 's . "
1801	1818	1819	1819	she	113	" Oh , no , I 'm quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday , "
1822	1851	1819	1819	she	113	" Matthew went to Bright River . We 're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he 's coming on the train tonight . "
1908	1916	1917	1917	she	105	" Are you in earnest , Marilla ? "
1925	1931	1933	1933	Marilla	113	" Yes , of course , "
2025	2037	2038	2038	she	113	" What on earth put such a notion into your head ? "
2058	2076	2078	2078	Marilla	113	" Well , we 've been thinking about it for some time -- all winter in fact , "
2080	2493	2078	2078	Marilla	113	" Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before Christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in Hopeton in the spring . Her cousin lives there and Mrs. Spencer has visited here and knows all about it . So Matthew and I have talked it over off and on ever since . We thought we 'd get a boy . Matthew is getting up in years , you know -- he 's sixty -- and he is n't so spry as he once was . His heart troubles him a good deal . And you know how desperate hard it 's got to be to get hired help . There 's never anybody to be had but those stupid , half - grown little French boys ; and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he 's up and off to the lobster canneries or the States . At first Matthew suggested getting a Home boy . But I said ? no ' flat to that . ? They may be all right -- I'm not saying they 're not -- but no London street Arabs for me , ' I said . ? Give me a native born at least . There 'll be a risk , no matter who we get . But I 'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born Canadian . ' So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl . We heard last week she was going , so we sent her word by Richard Spencer 's folks at Carmody to bring us a smart , likely boy of about ten or eleven . We decided that would be the best age -- old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper . We mean to give him a good home and schooling . We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer today -- the mail - man brought it from the station -- saying they were coming on the five - thirty train tonight . So Matthew went to Bright River to meet him . Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there . Of course she goes on to White Sands station herself . "
2523	2726	2078	2078	Marilla	113	" Well , Marilla , I 'll just tell you plain that I think you 're doing a mighty foolish thing -- a risky thing , that 's what . You do n't know what you 're getting . You 're bringing a strange child into your house and home and you do n't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had nor how he 's likely to turn out . Why , it was only last week I read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night -- set it _ on purpose _ , Marilla -- and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds . And I know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs -- they could n't break him of it . If you had asked my advice in the matter -- which you did n't do , Marilla -- I'd have said for mercy 's sake not to think of such a thing , that 's what . "
2745	2890	2078	2078	Marilla	113	" I do n't deny there 's something in what you say , Rachel . I 've had some qualms myself . But Matthew was terrible set on it . I could see that , so I gave in . It 's so seldom Matthew sets his mind on anything that when he does I always feel it 's my duty to give in . And as for the risk , there 's risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world . There 's risks in people 's having children of their own if it comes to that -- they do n't always turn out well . And then Nova Scotia is right close to the Island . It is n't as if we were getting him from England or the States . He ca n't be much different from ourselves . "
2891	2903	2905	2906	Mrs. Rachel	105	" Well , I hope it will turn out all right , "
2917	2975	2905	2906	Mrs. Rachel	105	" Only do n't say I did n't warn you if he burns Green Gables down or puts strychnine in the well -- I heard of a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies . Only , it was a girl in that instance . "
2976	2986	2988	2988	Marilla	113	" Well , we 're not getting a girl , "
3011	3057	2905	2906	Mrs. Rachel	105	" I 'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up . I wonder at Mrs. Alexander Spencer for doing it . But there , _ she _ would n't shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head . "
3155	3168	3170	3171	Mrs. Rachel	105	" Well , of all things that ever were or will be ! "
3181	3321	3170	3171	Mrs. Rachel	105	" It does really seem as if I must be dreaming . Well , I 'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake . Matthew and Marilla do n't know anything about children and they 'll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather , if so be 's he ever had a grandfather , which is doubtful . It seems uncanny to think of a child at Green Gables somehow ; there 's never been one there , for Matthew and Marilla were grown up when the new house was built -- if they ever _ were _ children , which is hard to believe when one looks at them . I would n't be in that orphan 's shoes for anything . My , but I pity him , that 's what . "
3459	3478	3525	3525	them	423	" The little birds sang as if it were The one day of summer in all the year . "
3810	3826	3828	3830	that brisk official	441	" The five - thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago , "
3832	3901	3828	3830	that brisk official	441	" But there was a passenger dropped off for you -- a little girl . She 's sitting out there on the shingles . I asked her to go into the ladies ' waiting room , but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside . ? There was more scope for imagination , ' she said . She 's a case , I should say . "
3902	3910	3912	3912	Matthew	107	" I 'm not expecting a girl , "
3915	3944	3912	3912	Matthew	107	" It 's a boy I 've come for . He should be here . Mrs. Alexander Spencer was to bring him over from Nova Scotia for me . "
3949	3956	3957	3957	he	437	" Guess there 's some mistake , "
3960	4018	3957	3957	he	437	" Mrs. Spencer came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge . Said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently . That 's all I know about it -- and I have n't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts . "
4019	4025	4027	4027	Matthew	107	" I do n't understand , "
4042	4052	4054	4057	the station - master	443	" Well , you 'd better question the girl , "
4060	4096	4054	4057	the station - master	443	" I dare say she 'll be able to explain -- she 's got a tongue of her own , that 's certain . Maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted . "
4446	4458	4459	4459	she	2066	" I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables ? "
4469	4619	4459	4459	she	2066	" I 'm very glad to see you . I was beginning to be afraid you were n't coming for me and I was imagining all the things that might have happened to prevent you . I had made up my mind that if you did n't come for me to - night I 'd go down the track to that big wild cherry - tree at the bend , and climb up into it to stay all night . I would n't be a bit afraid , and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry - tree all white with bloom in the moonshine , do n't you think ? You could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls , could n't you ? And I was quite sure you would come for me in the morning , if you did n't to - night . "
4705	4713	4714	4714	he	107	" I 'm sorry I was late , "
4718	4735	4714	4714	he	107	" Come along . The horse is over in the yard . Give me your bag . "
4736	4744	4745	4746	the child	460	" Oh , I can carry it , "
4750	5140	4745	4746	the child	460	" It is n't heavy . I 've got all my worldly goods in it , but it is n't heavy . And if it is n't carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out -- so I 'd better keep it because I know the exact knack of it . It 's an extremely old carpet - bag . Oh , I 'm very glad you 've come , even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry - tree . We 've got to drive a long piece , have n't we ? Mrs. Spencer said it was eight miles . I 'm glad because I love driving . Oh , it seems so wonderful that I 'm going to live with you and belong to you . I 've never belonged to anybody -- not really . But the asylum was the worst . I 've only been in it four months , but that was enough . I do n't suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum , so you ca n't possibly understand what it is like . It 's worse than anything you could imagine . Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like that , but I did n't mean to be wicked . It 's so easy to be wicked without knowing it , is n't it ? They were good , you know -- the asylum people . But there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum -- only just in the other orphans . It was pretty interesting to imagine things about them -- to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really the daughter of a belted earl , who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess . I used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that , because I did n't have time in the day . I guess that 's why I 'm so thin -- I _ am _ dreadful thin , ai n't I ? There is n't a pick on my bones . I do love to imagine I 'm nice and plump , with dimples in my elbows . "
5247	5274	5275	5275	she	460	" Is n't that beautiful ? What did that tree , leaning out from the bank , all white and lacy , make you think of ? "
5278	5285	5287	5287	Matthew	107	" Well now , I dunno , "
5289	5901	6045	6045	his	107	" Why , a bride , of course -- a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil . I 've never seen one , but I can imagine what she would look like . I do n't ever expect to be a bride myself . I 'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me -- unless it might be a foreign missionary . I suppose a foreign missionary might n't be very particular . But I do hope that some day I shall have a white dress . That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss . I just love pretty clothes . And I 've never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember -- but of course it 's all the more to look forward to , is n't it ? And then I can imagine that I 'm dressed gorgeously . This morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear this horrid old wincey dress . All the orphans had to wear them , you know . A merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum . Some people said it was because he could n't sell it , but I 'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart , would n't you ? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me . But I just went to work and imagined that I had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress -- because when you _ are _ imagining you might as well imagine something worth while -- and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes , and a gold watch , and kid gloves and boots . I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island with all my might . I was n't a bit sick coming over in the boat . Neither was Mrs. Spencer although she generally is . She said she had n't time to get sick , watching to see that I did n't fall overboard . She said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about . But if it kept her from being seasick it 's a mercy I did prowl , is n't it ? And I wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat , because I did n't know whether I 'd ever have another opportunity . Oh , there are a lot more cherry - trees all in bloom ! This Island is the bloomiest place . I just love it already , and I 'm so glad I 'm going to live here . I 've always heard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world , and I used to imagine I was living here , but I never really expected I would . It 's delightful when your imaginations come true , is n't it ? But those red roads are so funny . When we got into the train at Charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer what made them red and she said she did n't know and for pity 's sake not to ask her any more questions . She said I must have asked her a thousand already . I suppose I had , too , but how you going to find out about things if you do n't ask questions ? And what _ does _ make the roads red ? "
5902	5909	5911	5911	Matthew	107	" Well now , I dunno , "
5913	6040	6045	6045	his	107	" Well , that is one of the things to find out sometime . Is n't it splendid to think of all the things there are to find out about ? It just makes me feel glad to be alive -- it 's such an interesting world . It would n't be half so interesting if we know all about everything , would it ? There 'd be no scope for imagination then , would there ? But am I talking too much ? People are always telling me I do . Would you rather I did n't talk ? If you say so I 'll stop . I can _ stop _ when I make up my mind to it , although it 's difficult . "
6190	6197	6199	6199	he	107	" kind of liked her chatter . "
6206	6223	6199	6199	he	107	" Oh , you can talk as much as you like . I do n't mind . "
6224	6315	6199	6199	he	107	" Oh , I 'm so glad . I know you and I are going to get along together fine . It 's such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told that children should be seen and not heard . I 've had that said to me a million times if I have once . And people laugh at me because I use big words . But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them , have n't you ? "
6316	6324	6326	6326	Matthew	107	" Well now , that seems reasonable , "
6328	6570	6199	6199	he	107	" Mrs. Spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle . But it isn't -- it 's firmly fastened at one end . Mrs. Spencer said your place was named Green Gables . I asked her all about it . And she said there were trees all around it . I was gladder than ever . I just love trees . And there were n't any at all about the asylum , only a few poor weeny - teeny things out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them . They just looked like orphans themselves , those trees did . It used to make me want to cry to look at them . I used to say to them , ? Oh , you _ poor _ little things ! If you were out in a great big woods with other trees all around you and little mosses and June bells growing over your roots and a brook not far away and birds singing in you branches , you could grow , could n't you ? But you ca n't where you are . I know just exactly how you feel , little trees . ' I felt sorry to leave them behind this morning . You do get so attached to things like that , do n't you ? Is there a brook anywhere near Green Gables ? I forgot to ask Mrs. Spencer that . "
6571	6585	6715	6715	he	107	" Well now , yes , there 's one right below the house . "
6586	6658	6199	6199	he	107	" Fancy . It 's always been one of my dreams to live near a brook . I never expected I would , though . Dreams do n't often come true , do they ? Would n't it be nice if they did ? But just now I feel pretty nearly perfectly happy . I ca n't feel exactly perfectly happy because -- well , what color would you call this ? "
6705	6714	6715	6715	he	107	" It 's red , ai n't it ? "
6747	6754	6755	6755	she	2093	" Yes , it 's red , "
6759	6937	6755	6755	she	2093	" Now you see why I ca n't be perfectly happy . Nobody could who has red hair . I do n't mind the other things so much -- the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness . I can imagine them away . I can imagine that I have a beautiful rose - leaf complexion and lovely starry violet eyes . But I _ can not _ imagine that red hair away . I do my best . I think to myself , ? Now my hair is a glorious black , black as the raven 's wing . ' But all the time I _ know _ it is just plain red and it breaks my heart . It will be my lifelong sorrow . I read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it was n't red hair . Her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster brow . What is an alabaster brow ? I never could find out . Can you tell me ? "
6938	6949	6951	6951	Matthew	107	" Well now , I 'm afraid I ca n't , "
6988	7020	6755	6755	she	2093	" Well , whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was divinely beautiful . Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be divinely beautiful ? "
7021	7031	7033	7033	Matthew	107	" Well now , no , I have n't , "
7036	7062	6755	6755	she	2093	" I have , often . Which would you rather be if you had the choice -- divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good ? "
7063	7075	6755	6755	she	2093	" Well now , I -- I do n't know exactly . "
7076	7136	6755	6755	she	2093	" Neither do I. I can never decide . But it does n't make much real difference for it is n't likely I 'll ever be either . It 's certain I 'll never be angelically good . Mrs. Spencer says -- oh , Mr. Cuthbert ! Oh , Mr. Cuthbert ! ! Oh , Mr. Cuthbert ! ! ! "
7176	7179	6755	6755	she	2093	" Avenue . "
7181	7184	6755	6755	she	2093	" Avenue , "
7410	7421	7422	7422	Matthew	107	" I guess you 're feeling pretty tired and hungry , "
7445	7460	7422	7422	Matthew	107	" But we have n't very far to go now -- only another mile . "
7492	7498	7499	7499	she	460	" Oh , Mr. Cuthbert , "
7502	7517	7499	7499	she	460	" that place we came through -- that white place -- what was it ? "
7518	7528	7530	7530	Matthew	107	" Well now , you must mean the Avenue , "
7539	7548	7530	7530	Matthew	107	" It is a kind of pretty place . "
7549	7607	7612	7612	her	460	" Pretty ? Oh , _ pretty _ does n't seem the right word to use . Nor beautiful , either . They do n't go far enough . Oh , it was wonderful -- wonderful . It 's the first thing I ever saw that could n't be improved upon by imagination . It just satisfies me here"--she
7613	7639	7480	7490	a soul that had been wondering afar , star - led	490	breast--"it made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache . Did you ever have an ache like that , Mr. Cuthbert ? "
7640	7654	7480	7490	a soul that had been wondering afar , star - led	490	" Well now , I just ca n't recollect that I ever had . "
7655	7908	7480	7490	a soul that had been wondering afar , star - led	490	" I have it lots of time -- whenever I see anything royally beautiful . But they should n't call that lovely place the Avenue . There is no meaning in a name like that . They should call it -- let me see -- the White Way of Delight . Is n't that a nice imaginative name ? When I do n't like the name of a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of them so . There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins , but I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere . Other people may call that place the Avenue , but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight . Have we really only another mile to go before we get home ? I 'm glad and I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and I 'm always sorry when pleasant things end . Something still pleasanter may come after , but you can never be sure . And it 's so often the case that it is n't pleasanter . That has been my experience anyhow . But I 'm glad to think of getting home . You see , I 've never had a real home since I can remember . It gives me that pleasant ache again just to think of coming to a really truly home . Oh , is n't that pretty ! "
8111	8118	8120	8120	Matthew	107	" That 's Barry 's pond , "
8122	8189	8724	8724	his	107	" Oh , I do n't like that name , either . I shall call it -- let me see -- the Lake of Shining Waters . Yes , that is the right name for it . I know because of the thrill . When I hit on a name that suits exactly it gives me a thrill . Do things ever give you a thrill ? "
8193	8228	8120	8120	Matthew	107	" Well now , yes . It always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly white grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds . I hate the look of them . "
8229	8283	8120	8120	Matthew	107	" Oh , I do n't think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill . Do you think it can ? There does n't seem to be much connection between grubs and lakes of shining waters , does there ? But why do other people call it Barry 's pond ? "
8284	8347	8120	8120	Matthew	107	" I reckon because Mr. Barry lives up there in that house . Orchard Slope 's the name of his place . If it was n't for that big bush behind it you could see Green Gables from here . But we have to go over the bridge and round by the road , so it 's near half a mile further . "
8348	8368	8120	8120	Matthew	107	" Has Mr. Barry any little girls ? Well , not so very little either -- about my size . "
8369	8382	8120	8120	Matthew	107	" He 's got one about eleven . Her name is Diana . "
8383	8386	8120	8120	Matthew	107	" Oh ! "
8394	8401	8120	8120	Matthew	107	" What a perfectly lovely name ! "
8402	8459	8120	8120	Matthew	107	" Well now , I dunno . There 's something dreadful heathenish about it , seems to me . I 'd ruther Jane or Mary or some sensible name like that . But when Diana was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they gave him the naming of her and he called her Diana . "
8460	8666	8120	8120	Matthew	107	" I wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when I was born , then . Oh , here we are at the bridge . I 'm going to shut my eyes tight . I 'm always afraid going over bridges . I ca n't help imagining that perhaps just as we get to the middle , they 'll crumple up like a jack - knife and nip us . So I shut my eyes . But I always have to open them for all when I think we 're getting near the middle . Because , you see , if the bridge _ did _ crumple up I 'd want to _ see _ it crumple . What a jolly rumble it makes ! I always like the rumble part of it . Is n't it splendid there are so many things to like in this world ? There we 're over . Now I 'll look back . Good night , dear Lake of Shining Waters . I always say good night to the things I love , just as I would to people . I think they like it . That water looks as if it was smiling at me . "
8682	8695	8679	8679	Matthew	107	" We 're pretty near home now . That 's Green Gables over-- "
8696	8704	8705	8705	she	510	" Oh , do n't tell me , "
8727	8740	8705	8705	she	510	" Let me guess . I 'm sure I 'll guess right . "
8882	8891	8892	8892	she	510	" That 's it , is n't it ? "
8908	8930	8892	8892	she	510	" Well now , you 've guessed it ! But I reckon Mrs. Spencer described it so 's you could tell . "
8931	9098	8892	8892	she	510	" No , she didn't -- really she did n't . All she said might just as well have been about most of those other places . I had n't any real idea what it looked like . But just as soon as I saw it I felt it was home . Oh , it seems as if I must be in a dream . Do you know , my arm must be black and blue from the elbow up , for I 've pinched myself so many times today . Every little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and I 'd be so afraid it was all a dream . Then I 'd pinch myself to see if it was real -- until suddenly I remembered that even supposing it was only a dream I 'd better go on dreaming as long as I could ; so I stopped pinching . But it _ is _ real and we 're nearly home . "
9316	9326	9327	9327	she	460	" Listen to the trees talking in their sleep , "
9338	9346	9327	9327	she	460	" What nice dreams they must have ! "
9358	9364	9365	9365	she	460	" all her worldly goods , "
9426	9434	9435	9435	she	460	" Matthew Cuthbert , who 's that ? "
9438	9444	9435	9435	she	460	" Where is the boy ? "
9445	9452	9454	9454	Matthew	107	" There was n't any boy , "
9457	9465	9454	9454	Matthew	107	" There was only _ her _ . "
9482	9496	9498	9498	Marilla	113	" No boy ! But there _ must _ have been a boy , "
9500	9512	9498	9498	Marilla	113	" We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring a boy . "
9513	9557	9576	9577	the child	460	" Well , she did n't . She brought _ her _ . I asked the station - master . And I had to bring her home . She could n't be left there , no matter where the mistake had come in . "
9558	9569	9571	9571	Marilla	113	" Well , this is a pretty piece of business ! "
9630	9637	9638	9638	she	460	" You do n't want me ! "
9641	9703	9638	9638	she	460	" You do n't want me because I 'm not a boy ! I might have expected it . Nobody ever did want me . I might have known it was all too beautiful to last . I might have known nobody really did want me . Oh , what shall I do ? I 'm going to burst into tears ! "
9769	9784	9762	9762	Marilla	113	" Well , well , there 's no need to cry so about it . "
9785	9794	9795	9796	The child	460	" Yes , there _ is _ need ! "
9812	9870	9795	9796	The child	460	" _ You _ would cry , too , if you were an orphan and had come to a place you thought was going to be home and found that they did n't want you because you were n't a boy . Oh , this is the most _ tragical _ thing that ever happened to me ! "
9889	9931	10027	10031	the owner of that name	540	" Well , do n't cry any more . We 're not going to turn you out - of - doors to - night . You 'll have to stay here until we investigate this affair . What 's your name ? "
9939	9947	9948	9948	she	460	" Will you please call me Cordelia ? "
9952	9964	9795	9796	The child	460	" _ Call _ you Cordelia ? Is that your name ? "
9965	9996	9795	9796	The child	460	" No - o - o , it 's not exactly my name , but I would love to be called Cordelia . It 's such a perfectly elegant name . "
9997	10018	9795	9796	The child	460	" I do n't know what on earth you mean . If Cordelia is n't your name , what is ? "
10019	10023	10027	10031	the owner of that name	540	" Anne Shirley , "
10033	10078	10027	10031	the owner of that name	540	" but , oh , please do call me Cordelia . It ca n't matter much to you what you call me if I 'm only going to be here a little while , can it ? And Anne is such an unromantic name . "
10079	10083	10087	10087	Marilla	113	" Unromantic fiddlesticks ! "
10089	10109	10087	10087	Marilla	113	" Anne is a real good plain sensible name . You 've no need to be ashamed of it . "
10110	10120	10122	10122	Anne	124	" Oh , I 'm not ashamed of it , "
10124	10184	10122	10122	Anne	124	" only I like Cordelia better . I 've always imagined that my name was Cordelia -- at least , I always have of late years . When I was young I used to imagine it was Geraldine , but I like Cordelia better now . But if you call me Anne please call me Anne spelled with an E. "
10185	10196	10198	10198	Marilla	113	" What difference does it make how it 's spelled ? "
10210	10302	10087	10087	Marilla	113	" Oh , it makes _ such _ a difference . It _ looks _ so much nicer . When you hear a name pronounced ca n't you always see it in your mind , just as if it was printed out ? I can ; and A - n - n looks dreadful , but A - n - n - e looks so much more distinguished . If you 'll only call me Anne spelled with an E I shall try to reconcile myself to not being called Cordelia . "
10303	10347	10122	10122	Anne	124	" Very well , then , Anne spelled with an E , can you tell us how this mistake came to be made ? We sent word to Mrs. Spencer to bring us a boy . Were there no boys at the asylum ? "
10348	10408	10409	10409	she	541	" Oh , yes , there was an abundance of them . But Mrs. Spencer said _ distinctly _ that you wanted a girl about eleven years old . And the matron said she thought I would do . You do n't know how delighted I was . I could n't sleep all last night for joy . Oh , "
10417	10461	10409	10409	she	541	" why did n't you tell me at the station that you did n't want me and leave me there ? If I had n't seen the White Way of Delight and the Lake of Shining Waters it would n't be so hard . "
10462	10470	10472	10472	Marilla	113	" What on earth does she mean ? "
10478	10494	10496	10496	Matthew	107	" She -- she 's just referring to some conversation we had on the road , "
10499	10520	10496	10496	Matthew	107	" I 'm going out to put the mare in , Marilla . Have tea ready when I come back . "
10521	10531	10533	10533	Marilla	113	" Did Mrs. Spencer bring anybody over besides you ? "
10540	10582	10625	10625	Anne	124	" She brought Lily Jones for herself . Lily is only five years old and she is very beautiful and had nut - brown hair . If I was very beautiful and had nut - brown hair would you keep me ? "
10583	10624	10674	10674	her	124	" No . We want a boy to help Matthew on the farm . A girl would be of no use to us . Take off your hat . I 'll lay it and your bag on the hall table . "
10687	10694	10696	10696	Marilla	113	" You 're not eating anything , "
10712	10737	10929	10929	his	107	" I ca n't . I 'm in the depths of despair . Can you eat when you are in the depths of despair ? "
10738	10755	10757	10757	Marilla	113	" I 've never been in the depths of despair , so I ca n't say , "
10759	10782	10929	10929	his	107	" Were n't you ? Well , did you ever try to _ imagine _ you were in the depths of despair ? "
10783	10790	10929	10929	his	107	" No , I did n't . "
10791	10912	10929	10929	his	107	" Then I do n't think you can understand what it 's like . It 's a very uncomfortable feeling indeed . When you try to eat a lump comes right up in your throat and you ca n't swallow anything , not even if it was a chocolate caramel . I had one chocolate caramel once two years ago and it was simply delicious . I 've often dreamed since then that I had a lot of chocolate caramels , but I always wake up just when I 'm going to eat them . I do hope you wo n't be offended because I ca n't eat . Everything is extremely nice , but still I can not eat . "
10913	10920	10922	10922	Matthew	107	" I guess she 's tired , "
10935	10944	10922	10922	Matthew	107	" Best put her to bed , Marilla . "
11091	11099	11100	11100	she	113	" I suppose you have a nightgown ? "
11106	11187	11066	11066	herself	124	" Yes , I have two . The matron of the asylum made them for me . They 're fearfully skimpy . There is never enough to go around in an asylum , so things are always skimpy -- at least in a poor asylum like ours . I hate skimpy night - dresses . But one can dream just as well in them as in lovely trailing ones , with frills around the neck , that 's one consolation . "
11188	11234	11261	11261	their	553	" Well , undress as quick as you can and go to bed . I 'll come back in a few minutes for the candle . I dare n't trust you to put it out yourself . You 'd likely set the place on fire . "
11515	11519	11520	11520	she	113	" Good night , "
11547	11573	11574	11574	she	113	" How can you call it a _ good _ night when you know it must be the very worst night I 've ever had ? "
11661	11672	11673	11673	she	113	" Well , this is a pretty kettle of fish , "
11677	11730	11673	11673	she	113	" This is what comes of sending word instead of going ourselves . Richard Spencer 's folks have twisted that message somehow . One of us will have to drive over and see Mrs. Spencer tomorrow , that 's certain . This girl will have to be sent back to the asylum . "
11731	11738	11740	11740	Matthew	107	" Yes , I suppose so , "
11743	11756	11673	11673	she	113	" You _ suppose _ so ! Do n't you know it ? "
11757	11790	11673	11673	she	113	" Well now , she 's a real nice little thing , Marilla . It 's kind of a pity to send her back when she 's so set on staying here . "
11791	11809	11673	11673	she	113	" Matthew Cuthbert , you do n't mean to say you think we ought to keep her ! "
11830	11844	11846	11846	Matthew	107	" Well , now , no , I suppose not -- not exactly , "
11858	11871	11846	11846	Matthew	107	" I suppose -- we could hardly be expected to keep her . "
11872	11886	11673	11673	she	113	" I should say not . What good would she be to us ? "
11887	11896	11898	11898	Matthew	107	" We might be some good to her , "
11903	11929	11673	11673	she	113	" Matthew Cuthbert , I believe that child has bewitched you ! I can see as plain as plain that you want to keep her . "
11930	11942	11944	11944	Matthew	107	" Well now , she 's a real interesting little thing , "
11946	11958	11944	11944	Matthew	107	" You should have heard her talk coming from the station . "
11959	12044	11673	11673	she	113	" Oh , she can talk fast enough . I saw that at once . It 's nothing in her favour , either . I do n't like children who have so much to say . I do n't want an orphan girl and if I did she is n't the style I 'd pick out . There 's something I do n't understand about her . No , she 's got to be despatched straight - way back to where she came from . "
12045	12056	12058	12058	Matthew	107	" I could hire a French boy to help me , "
12060	12069	12058	12058	Matthew	107	" and she 'd be company for you . "
12070	12078	12080	12080	Marilla	113	" I 'm not suffering for company , "
12083	12093	12080	12080	Marilla	113	" And I 'm not going to keep her . "
12094	12110	12112	12112	Matthew	107	" Well now , it 's just as you say , of course , Marilla , "
12120	12127	12112	12112	Matthew	107	" I 'm going to bed . "
12702	12710	12711	12711	she	113	" It 's time you were dressed , "
12753	12761	12762	12762	she	124	" Oh , is n't it wonderful ? "
12775	12782	12784	12784	Marilla	113	" It 's a big tree , "
12786	12806	12784	12784	Marilla	113	" and it blooms great , but the fruit do n't amount to much never -- small and wormy . "
12807	13094	12762	12762	she	124	" Oh , I do n't mean just the tree ; of course it 's lovely -- yes , it 's _ radiantly _ lovely -- it blooms as if it meant it -- but I meant everything , the garden and the orchard and the brook and the woods , the whole big dear world . Do n't you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning like this ? And I can hear the brook laughing all the way up here . Have you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are ? They 're always laughing . Even in winter - time I 've heard them under the ice . I 'm so glad there 's a brook near Green Gables . Perhaps you think it does n't make any difference to me when you 're not going to keep me , but it does . I shall always like to remember that there is a brook at Green Gables even if I never see it again . If there was n't a brook I 'd be _ haunted _ by the uncomfortable feeling that there ought to be one . I 'm not in the depths of despair this morning . I never can be in the morning . Is n't it a splendid thing that there are mornings ? But I feel very sad . I 've just been imagining that it was really me you wanted after all and that I was to stay here for ever and ever . It was a great comfort while it lasted . But the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts . "
13095	13112	13114	13114	Marilla	113	" You 'd better get dressed and come down - stairs and never mind your imaginings , "
13126	13162	13114	13114	Marilla	113	" Breakfast is waiting . Wash your face and comb your hair . Leave the window up and turn your bedclothes back over the foot of the bed . Be as smart as you can . "
13232	13240	13241	13241	she	124	" I 'm pretty hungry this morning , "
13254	13397	13241	13241	she	124	" The world does n't seem such a howling wilderness as it did last night . I 'm so glad it 's a sunshiny morning . But I like rainy mornings real well , too . All sorts of mornings are interesting , do n't you think ? You do n't know what 's going to happen through the day , and there 's so much scope for imagination . But I 'm glad it 's not rainy today because it 's easier to be cheerful and bear up under affliction on a sunshiny day . I feel that I have a good deal to bear up under . It 's all very well to read about sorrows and imagine yourself living through them heroically , but it 's not so nice when you really come to have them , is it ? "
13398	13407	13409	13409	Marilla	113	" For pity 's sake hold your tongue , "
13411	13422	13409	13409	Marilla	113	" You talk entirely too much for a little girl . "
13652	13659	13661	13661	Marilla	113	" Can you wash dishes right ? "
13664	13703	13643	13643	her	124	" Pretty well . I 'm better at looking after children , though . I 've had so much experience at that . It 's such a pity you have n't any here for me to look after . "
13704	13755	13643	13643	her	124	" I do n't feel as if I wanted any more children to look after than I 've got at present . _ You 're _ problem enough in all conscience . What 's to be done with you I do n't know . Matthew is a most ridiculous man . "
13756	13763	13765	13765	Anne	124	" I think he 's lovely , "
13768	13806	13765	13765	Anne	124	" He is so very sympathetic . He did n't mind how much I talked -- he seemed to like it . I felt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him . "
13807	13824	13826	13826	Marilla	113	" You 're both queer enough , if that 's what you mean by kindred spirits , "
13831	13913	13826	13826	Marilla	113	" Yes , you may wash the dishes . Take plenty of hot water , and be sure you dry them well . I 've got enough to attend to this morning for I 'll have to drive over to White Sands in the afternoon and see Mrs. Spencer . You 'll come with me and we 'll settle what 's to be done with you . After you 've finished the dishes go up - stairs and make your bed . "
14043	14050	14052	14052	Marilla	113	" What 's the matter now ? "
14054	14062	14064	14064	Anne	124	" I do n't dare go out , "
14077	14293	14064	14064	Anne	124	" If I ca n't stay here there is no use in my loving Green Gables . And if I go out there and get acquainted with all those trees and flowers and the orchard and the brook I 'll not be able to help loving it . It 's hard enough now , so I wo n't make it any harder . I want to go out so much -- everything seems to be calling to me , ? Anne , Anne , come out to us . Anne , Anne , we want a playmate'--but it 's better not . There is no use in loving things if you have to be torn from them , is there ? And it 's so hard to keep from loving things , is n't it ? That was why I was so glad when I thought I was going to live here . I thought I 'd have so many things to love and nothing to hinder me . But that brief dream is over . I am resigned to my fate now , so I do n't think I 'll go out for fear I 'll get unresigned again . What is the name of that geranium on the window - sill , please ? "
14294	14303	14070	14075	a martyr relinquishing all earthly joys	591	" That 's the apple - scented geranium . "
14304	14371	14064	14064	Anne	124	" Oh , I do n't mean that sort of a name . I mean just a name you gave it yourself . Did n't you give it a name ? May I give it one then ? May I call it -- let me see -- Bonny would do -- may I call it Bonny while I 'm here ? Oh , do let me ! "
14372	14392	14070	14075	a martyr relinquishing all earthly joys	591	" Goodness , I do n't care . But where on earth is the sense of naming a geranium ? "
14393	14509	14064	14064	Anne	124	" Oh , I like things to have handles even if they are only geraniums . It makes them seem more like people . How do you know but that it hurts a geranium 's feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else ? You would n't like to be called nothing but a woman all the time . Yes , I shall call it Bonny . I named that cherry - tree outside my bedroom window this morning . I called it Snow Queen because it was so white . Of course , it wo n't always be in blossom , but one can imagine that it is , ca n't one ? "
14510	14525	14527	14527	Marilla	113	" I never in all my life saw or heard anything to equal her , "
14539	14643	14527	14527	Marilla	113	" She is kind of interesting as Matthew says . I can feel already that I 'm wondering what on earth she 'll say next . She 'll be casting a spell over me , too . She 's cast it over Matthew . That look he gave me when he went out said everything he said or hinted last night over again . I wish he was like other men and would talk things out . A body could answer back then and argue him into reason . But what 's to be done with a man who just _ looks ? _ "
14684	14699	14701	14701	Marilla	113	" I suppose I can have the mare and buggy this afternoon , Matthew ? "
14719	14777	14711	14711	Marilla	113	" I 'm going to drive over to White Sands and settle this thing . I 'll take Anne with me and Mrs. Spencer will probably make arrangements to send her back to Nova Scotia at once . I 'll set your tea out for you and I 'll be home in time to milk the cows . "
14859	14885	14848	14848	he	107	" Little Jerry Buote from the Creek was here this morning , and I told him I guessed I 'd hire him for the summer . "
14953	14958	14960	14960	Anne	124	" DO you know , "
14963	15152	14960	14960	Anne	124	" I 've made up my mind to enjoy this drive . It 's been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will . Of course , you must make it up _ firmly _ . I am not going to think about going back to the asylum while we 're having our drive . I 'm just going to think about the drive . Oh , look , there 's one little early wild rose out ! Is n't it lovely ? Do n't you think it must be glad to be a rose ? Would n't it be nice if roses could talk ? I 'm sure they could tell us such lovely things . And is n't pink the most bewitching color in the world ? I love it , but I ca n't wear it . Redheaded people ca n't wear pink , not even in imagination . Did you ever know of anybody whose hair was red when she was young , but got to be another color when she grew up ? "
15153	15165	15167	15167	Marilla	113	" No , I do n't know as I ever did , "
15170	15185	15167	15167	Marilla	113	" and I should n't think it likely to happen in your case either . "
15189	15236	14960	14960	Anne	124	" Well , that is another hope gone . ? My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes . ' That 's a sentence I read in a book once , and I say it over to comfort myself whenever I 'm disappointed in anything . "
15237	15249	15251	15251	Marilla	113	" I do n't see where the comforting comes in myself , "
15253	15326	14960	14960	Anne	124	" Why , because it sounds so nice and romantic , just as if I were a heroine in a book , you know . I am so fond of romantic things , and a graveyard full of buried hopes is about as romantic a thing as one can imagine is n't it ? I 'm rather glad I have one . Are we going across the Lake of Shining Waters today ? "
15327	15358	14960	14960	Anne	124	" We 're not going over Barry 's pond , if that 's what you mean by your Lake of Shining Waters . We 're going by the shore road . "
15359	15365	15367	15367	Anne	124	" Shore road sounds nice , "
15370	15443	15367	15367	Anne	124	" Is it as nice as it sounds ? Just when you said ? shore road ' I saw it in a picture in my mind , as quick as that ! And White Sands is a pretty name , too ; but I do n't like it as well as Avonlea . Avonlea is a lovely name . It just sounds like music . How far is it to White Sands ? "
15444	15475	15571	15571	herself	124	" It 's five miles ; and as you 're evidently bent on talking you might as well talk to some purpose by telling me what you know about yourself . "
15476	15492	15494	15494	Anne	124	" Oh , what I _ know _ about myself is n't really worth telling , "
15497	15523	15494	15494	Anne	124	" If you 'll only let me tell you what I _ imagine _ about myself you 'll think it ever so much more interesting . "
15524	15558	15571	15571	herself	124	" No , I do n't want any of your imaginings . Just you stick to bald facts . Begin at the beginning . Where were you born and how old are you ? "
15559	15566	15568	15568	Anne	124	" I was eleven last March , "
15580	15657	15568	15568	Anne	124	" And I was born in Bolingbroke , Nova Scotia . My father 's name was Walter Shirley , and he was a teacher in the Bolingbroke High School . My mother 's name was Bertha Shirley . Are n't Walter and Bertha lovely names ? I 'm so glad my parents had nice names . It would be a real disgrace to have a father named -- well , say Jedediah , would n't it ? "
15658	15678	15680	15680	Marilla	113	" I guess it does n't matter what a person 's name is as long as he behaves himself , "
15694	15702	15703	15703	Anne	124	" Well , I do n't know . "
15707	16219	15703	15703	Anne	124	" I read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet , but I 've never been able to believe it . I do n't believe a rose _ would _ be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage . I suppose my father could have been a good man even if he had been called Jedediah ; but I 'm sure it would have been a cross . Well , my mother was a teacher in the High school , too , but when she married father she gave up teaching , of course . A husband was enough responsibility . Mrs. Thomas said that they were a pair of babies and as poor as church mice . They went to live in a weeny - teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke . I 've never seen that house , but I 've imagined it thousands of times . I think it must have had honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and lilies of the valley just inside the gate . Yes , and muslin curtains in all the windows . Muslin curtains give a house such an air . I was born in that house . Mrs. Thomas said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw , I was so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes , but that mother thought I was perfectly beautiful . I should think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came in to scrub , would n't you ? I 'm glad she was satisfied with me anyhow , I would feel so sad if I thought I was a disappointment to her -- because she did n't live very long after that , you see . She died of fever when I was just three months old . I do wish she 'd lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother . I think it would be so sweet to say ? mother , ' do n't you ? And father died four days afterwards from fever too . That left me an orphan and folks were at their wits ' end , so Mrs. Thomas said , what to do with me . You see , nobody wanted me even then . It seems to be my fate . Father and mother had both come from places far away and it was well known they had n't any relatives living . Finally Mrs. Thomas said she 'd take me , though she was poor and had a drunken husband . She brought me up by hand . Do you know if there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other people ? Because whenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be such a bad girl when she had brought me up by hand -- reproachful - like .
16220	16451	15703	15703	Anne	124	" Mr. and Mrs. Thomas moved away from Bolingbroke to Marysville , and I lived with them until I was eight years old . I helped look after the Thomas children -- there were four of them younger than me -- and I can tell you they took a lot of looking after . Then Mr. Thomas was killed falling under a train and his mother offered to take Mrs. Thomas and the children , but she did n't want me . Mrs. Thomas was at _ her _ wits ' end , so she said , what to do with me . Then Mrs. Hammond from up the river came down and said she 'd take me , seeing I was handy with children , and I went up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the stumps . It was a very lonesome place . I 'm sure I could never have lived there if I had n't had an imagination . Mr. Hammond worked a little sawmill up there , and Mrs. Hammond had eight children . She had twins three times . I like babies in moderation , but twins three times in succession is _ too much _ . I told Mrs. Hammond so firmly , when the last pair came . I used to get so dreadfully tired carrying them about .
16452	16544	15703	15703	Anne	124	" I lived up river with Mrs. Hammond over two years , and then Mr. Hammond died and Mrs. Hammond broke up housekeeping . She divided her children among her relatives and went to the States . I had to go to the asylum at Hopeton , because nobody would take me . They did n't want me at the asylum , either ; they said they were over - crowded as it was . But they had to take me and I was there four months until Mrs. Spencer came . "
16575	16583	16585	16585	Marilla	113	" Did you ever go to school ? "
16596	16788	16585	16585	Marilla	113	" Not a great deal . I went a little the last year I stayed with Mrs. Thomas . When I went up river we were so far from a school that I could n't walk it in winter and there was a vacation in summer , so I could only go in the spring and fall . But of course I went while I was at the asylum . I can read pretty well and I know ever so many pieces of poetry off by heart--?The Battle of Hohenlinden ' and ? Edinburgh after Flodden , ' and ? Bingen of the Rhine , ' and most of the ? Lady of the Lake ' and most of ? The Seasons ' by James Thompson . Do n't you just love poetry that gives you a crinkly feeling up and down your back ? There is a piece in the Fifth Reader--?The Downfall of Poland'--that is just full of thrills . Of course , I was n't in the Fifth Reader -- I was only in the Fourth -- but the big girls used to lend me theirs to read . "
16789	16804	16806	16806	Marilla	113	" Were those women -- Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Hammond -- good to you ? "
16819	16828	16830	16830	Anne	124	" O - o - o - h , "
16846	16951	16832	16832	Her	124	" Oh , they _ meant _ to be -- I know they meant to be just as good and kind as possible . And when people mean to be good to you , you do n't mind very much when they 're not quite -- always . They had a good deal to worry them , you know . It 's a very trying to have a drunken husband , you see ; and it must be very trying to have twins three times in succession , do n't you think ? But I feel sure they meant to be good to me . "
17090	17099	17101	17101	Marilla	113	" She 's got too much to say , "
17103	17139	17101	17101	Marilla	113	" but she might be trained out of that . And there 's nothing rude or slangy in what she does say . She 's ladylike . It 's likely her people were nice folks . "
17144	17151	17080	17081	the child	460	" woodsy and wild and lonesome . "
17263	17270	17272	17272	Anne	124	" Is n't the sea wonderful ? "
17284	17447	17272	17272	Anne	124	" Once , when I lived in Marysville , Mr. Thomas hired an express wagon and took us all to spend the day at the shore ten miles away . I enjoyed every moment of that day , even if I had to look after the children all the time . I lived it over in happy dreams for years . But this shore is nicer than the Marysville shore . Are n't those gulls splendid ? Would you like to be a gull ? I think I would -- that is , if I could n't be a human girl . Do n't you think it would be nice to wake up at sunrise and swoop down over the water and away out over that lovely blue all day ; and then at night to fly back to one 's nest ? Oh , I can just imagine myself doing it . What big house is that just ahead , please ? "
17448	17489	17561	17561	she	114	" That 's the White Sands Hotel . Mr. Kirke runs it , but the season has n't begun yet . There are heaps of Americans come there for the summer . They think this shore is just about right . "
17490	17502	17504	17504	Anne	124	" I was afraid it might be Mrs. Spencer 's place , "
17507	17527	17504	17504	Anne	124	" I do n't want to get there . Somehow , it will seem like the end of everything . "
17576	17581	17582	17582	she	114	" Dear , dear , "
17585	17620	17582	17582	she	114	" you 're the last folks I was looking for today , but I 'm real glad to see you . You 'll put your horse in ? And how are you , Anne ? "
17621	17634	17636	17636	Anne	124	" I 'm as well as can be expected , thank you , "
17648	17662	17664	17664	Marilla	113	" I suppose we 'll stay a little while to rest the mare , "
17666	17740	17664	17664	Marilla	113	" but I promised Matthew I 'd be home early . The fact is , Mrs. Spencer , there 's been a queer mistake somewhere , and I 've come over to see where it is . We send word , Matthew and I , for you to bring us a boy from the asylum . We told your brother Robert to tell you we wanted a boy ten or eleven years old . "
17741	17751	17753	17754	Mrs. Spencer	114	" Marilla Cuthbert , you do n't say so ! "
17758	17782	17753	17754	Mrs. Spencer	114	" Why , Robert sent word down by his daughter Nancy and she said you wanted a girl -- didn't she Flora Jane ? "
17795	17803	17805	17806	Flora Jane	141	" She certainly did , Miss Cuthbert , "
17809	17815	17817	17818	Mrs. Spencer	114	" I 'm dreadful sorry , "
17820	17874	17817	17818	Mrs. Spencer	114	" It 's too bad ; but it certainly was n't my fault , you see , Miss Cuthbert . I did the best I could and I thought I was following your instructions . Nancy is a terrible flighty thing . I 've often had to scold her well for her heedlessness . "
17875	17882	17884	17884	Marilla	113	" It was our own fault , "
17887	17954	17884	17884	Marilla	113	" We should have come to you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along by word of mouth in that fashion . Anyhow , the mistake has been made and the only thing to do is to set it right . Can we send the child back to the asylum ? I suppose they 'll take her back , wo n't they ? "
17955	17960	17962	17963	Mrs. Spencer	114	" I suppose so , "
17966	18046	17962	17963	Mrs. Spencer	114	" but I do n't think it will be necessary to send her back . Mrs. Peter Blewett was up here yesterday , and she was saying to me how much she wished she 'd sent by me for a little girl to help her . Mrs. Peter has a large family , you know , and she finds it hard to get help . Anne will be the very girl for you . I call it positively providential . "
18122	18129	18130	18131	Mrs. Peter	142	" A terrible worker and driver , "
18177	18192	18193	18193	she	113	" Well , I 'll go in and we 'll talk the matter over , "
18196	18212	18214	18215	Mrs. Spencer	114	" And if there is n't Mrs. Peter coming up the lane this blessed minute ! "
18263	18369	18370	18371	Mrs. Spencer	114	" That is real lucky , for we can settle the matter right away . Take the armchair , Miss Cuthbert . Anne , you sit here on the ottoman and do n't wiggle . Let me take your hats . Flora Jane , go out and put the kettle on . Good afternoon , Mrs. Blewett . We were just saying how fortunate it was you happened along . Let me introduce you two ladies . Mrs. Blewett , Miss Cuthbert . Please excuse me for just a moment . I forgot to tell Flora Jane to take the buns out of the oven . "
18485	18501	18502	18502	she	114	" It seems there 's been a mistake about this little girl , Mrs. Blewett , "
18505	18563	18502	18502	she	114	" I was under the impression that Mr. and Miss Cuthbert wanted a little girl to adopt . I was certainly told so . But it seems it was a boy they wanted . So if you 're still of the same mind you were yesterday , I think she 'll be just the thing for you . "
18576	18587	18588	18588	she	142	" How old are you and what 's your name ? "
18591	18595	18597	18599	the shrinking child	624	" Anne Shirley , "
18612	18620	18597	18599	the shrinking child	624	" and I 'm eleven years old . "
18621	18738	18748	18749	the child	460	" Humph ! You do n't look as if there was much to you . But you 're wiry . I do n't know but the wiry ones are the best after all . Well , if I take you you 'll have to be a good girl , you know -- good and smart and respectful . I 'll expect you to earn your keep , and no mistake about that . Yes , I suppose I might as well take her off your hands , Miss Cuthbert . The baby 's awful fractious , and I 'm clean worn out attending to him . If you like I can take her right home now . "
18823	18825	18820	18826	a sensitive , " highstrung " child	627	" highstrung "
18845	18853	18854	18854	she	113	" Well , I do n't know , "
18858	18979	18854	18854	she	113	" I did n't say that Matthew and I had absolutely decided that we would n't keep her . In fact I may say that Matthew is disposed to keep her . I just came over to find out how the mistake had occurred . I think I 'd better take her home again and talk it over with Matthew . I feel that I ought n't to decide on anything without consulting him . If we make up our mind not to keep her we 'll bring or send her over to you tomorrow night . If we do n't you may know that she is going to stay with us . Will that suit you , Mrs. Blewett ? "
18980	18988	18990	18991	Mrs. Blewett	142	" I suppose it 'll have to , "
19076	19097	19098	19098	she	124	" Oh , Miss Cuthbert , did you really say that perhaps you would let me stay at Green Gables ? "
19116	19132	19098	19098	she	124	" Did you really say it ? Or did I only imagine that you did ? "
19133	19163	19165	19165	Marilla	113	" I think you 'd better learn to control that imagination of yours , Anne , if you ca n't distinguish between what is real and what is n't , "
19168	19211	19165	19165	Marilla	113	" Yes , you did hear me say just that and no more . It is n't decided yet and perhaps we will conclude to let Mrs. Blewett take you after all . She certainly needs you much more than I do . "
19212	19228	19230	19230	Anne	124	" I 'd rather go back to the asylum than go to live with her , "
19233	19244	19230	19230	Anne	124	" She looks exactly like a -- like a gimlet . "
19262	19281	19282	19282	she	113	" A little girl like you should be ashamed of talking so about a lady and a stranger , "
19286	19305	19282	19282	she	113	" Go back and sit down quietly and hold your tongue and behave as a good girl should . "
19306	19326	19328	19328	Anne	124	" I 'll try to do and be anything you want me , if you 'll only keep me , "
19438	19452	19454	19454	Matthew	107	" I would n't give a dog I liked to that Blewett woman , "
19459	19468	19470	19470	Marilla	113	" I do n't fancy her style myself , "
19472	19572	19470	19470	Marilla	113	" but it 's that or keeping her ourselves , Matthew . And since you seem to want her , I suppose I 'm willing -- or have to be . I 've been thinking over the idea until I 've got kind of used to it . It seems a sort of duty . I 've never brought up a child , especially a girl , and I dare say I 'll make a terrible mess of it . But I 'll do my best . So far as I 'm concerned , Matthew , she may stay . "
19583	19601	19602	19602	he	107	" Well now , I reckoned you 'd come to see it in that light , Marilla , "
19605	19614	19602	19602	he	107	" She 's such an interesting little thing . "
19615	19634	19636	19636	Marilla	113	" It 'd be more to the point if you could say she was a useful little thing , "
19638	19718	19636	19636	Marilla	113	" but I 'll make it my business to see she 's trained to be that . And mind , Matthew , you 're not to go interfering with my methods . Perhaps an old maid does n't know much about bringing up a child , but I guess she knows more than an old bachelor . So you just leave me to manage her . When I fail it 'll be time enough to put your oar in . "
19719	19733	19735	19735	Matthew	107	" There , there , Marilla , you can have your own way , "
19738	19778	19735	19735	Matthew	107	" Only be as good and kind to her as you can without spoiling her . I kind of think she 's one of the sort you can do anything with if you only get her to love you . "
19804	19816	19817	19817	she	113	" I wo n't tell her tonight that she can stay , "
19829	19923	19821	19821	she	113	" She 'd be so excited that she would n't sleep a wink . Marilla Cuthbert , you 're fairly in for it . Did you ever suppose you 'd see the day when you 'd be adopting an orphan girl ? It 's surprising enough ; but not so surprising as that Matthew should be at the bottom of it , him that always seemed to have such a mortal dread of little girls . Anyhow , we 've decided on the experiment and goodness only knows what will come of it . "
19944	20019	19940	19940	she	113	" Now , Anne , I noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about the floor when you took them off . That is a very untidy habit , and I ca n't allow it at all . As soon as you take off any article of clothing fold it neatly and place it on the chair . I have n't any use at all for little girls who are n't neat . "
20020	20042	20044	20044	Anne	124	" I was so harrowed up in my mind last night that I did n't think about my clothes at all , "
20046	20092	20044	20044	Anne	124	" I 'll fold them nicely tonight . They always made us do that at the asylum . Half the time , though , I 'd forget , I 'd be in such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine things . "
20093	20107	20109	20109	Marilla	113	" You 'll have to remember a little better if you stay here , "
20111	20128	20109	20109	Marilla	113	" There , that looks something like . Say your prayers now and get into bed . "
20129	20136	20138	20138	Anne	124	" I never say any prayers , "
20145	20184	20109	20109	Marilla	113	" Why , Anne , what do you mean ? Were you never taught to say your prayers ? God always wants little girls to say their prayers . Do n't you know who God is , Anne ? "
20185	20216	20218	20218	Anne	124	" ? God is a spirit , infinite , eternal and unchangeable , in His being , wisdom , power , holiness , justice , goodness , and truth , ' "
20228	20252	20109	20109	Marilla	113	" So you do know something then , thank goodness ! You 're not quite a heathen . Where did you learn that ? "
20253	20338	20109	20109	Marilla	113	" Oh , at the asylum Sunday - school . They made us learn the whole catechism . I liked it pretty well . There 's something splendid about some of the words . ? Infinite , eternal and unchangeable . ' Is n't that grand ? It has such a roll to it -- just like a big organ playing . You could n't quite call it poetry , I suppose , but it sounds a lot like it , does n't it ? "
20339	20386	20109	20109	Marilla	113	" We 're not talking about poetry , Anne -- we are talking about saying your prayers . Do n't you know it 's a terrible wicked thing not to say your prayers every night ? I 'm afraid you are a very bad little girl . "
20387	20404	20406	20406	Anne	124	" You 'd find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair , "
20409	20487	20406	20406	Anne	124	" People who have n't red hair do n't know what trouble is . Mrs. Thomas told me that God made my hair red _ on purpose _ , and I 've never cared about Him since . And anyhow I 'd always be too tired at night to bother saying prayers . People who have to look after twins ca n't be expected to say their prayers . Now , do you honestly think they can ? "
20510	20525	20109	20109	Marilla	113	" You must say your prayers while you are under my roof , Anne . "
20526	20538	20540	20540	Anne	124	" Why , of course , if you want me to , "
20543	20601	20540	20540	Anne	124	" I 'd do anything to oblige you . But you 'll have to tell me what to say for this once . After I get into bed I 'll imagine out a real nice prayer to say always . I believe that it will be quite interesting , now that I come to think of it . "
20602	20608	20610	20610	Marilla	113	" You must kneel down , "
20625	20724	20540	20540	Anne	124	" Why must people kneel down to pray ? If I really wanted to pray I 'll tell you what I 'd do . I 'd go out into a great big field all alone or into the deep , deep , woods , and I 'd look up into the sky -- up -- up -- up -- into that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness . And then I 'd just _ feel _ a prayer . Well , I 'm ready . What am I to say ? "
20742	20751	20753	20753	she	113	" Now I lay me down to sleep . "
20842	20854	20855	20855	she	113	" You 're old enough to pray for yourself , Anne , "
20859	20876	20855	20855	she	113	" Just thank God for your blessings and ask Him humbly for the things you want . "
20877	20886	20888	20888	Anne	124	" Well , I 'll do my best , "
20898	20929	20930	20930	she	124	" Gracious heavenly Father -- that 's the way the ministers say it in church , so I suppose it 's all right in private prayer , is n't it ? "
20940	21050	21051	21051	Yours	640	" Gracious heavenly Father , I thank Thee for the White Way of Delight and the Lake of Shining Waters and Bonny and the Snow Queen . I 'm really extremely grateful for them . And that 's all the blessings I can think of just now to thank Thee for . As for the things I want , they 're so numerous that it would take a great deal of time to name them all so I will only mention the two most important . Please let me stay at Green Gables ; and please let me be good - looking when I grow up . I remain , "
21057	21066	21067	21067	she	124	" There , did I do all right ? "
21074	21096	21067	21067	she	124	" I could have made it much more flowery if I 'd had a little more time to think it over . "
21166	21233	21141	21141	she	113	" I 've just thought of it now . I should have said , ? Amen ' in place of ? yours respectfully , ' should n't I?--the way the ministers do . I 'd forgotten it , but I felt a prayer should be finished off in some way , so I put in the other . Do you suppose it will make any difference ? "
21234	21244	21246	21246	Marilla	113	" I -- I do n't suppose it will , "
21248	21261	21246	21246	Marilla	113	" Go to sleep now like a good child . Good night . "
21262	21275	21277	21277	Anne	124	" I can only say good night tonight with a clear conscience , "
21305	21452	21468	21468	herself	645	" Matthew Cuthbert , it 's about time somebody adopted that child and taught her something . She 's next door to a perfect heathen . Will you believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight ? I 'll send her to the manse tomorrow and borrow the Peep of the Day series , that 's what I 'll do . And she shall go to Sunday - school just as soon as I can get some suitable clothes made for her . I foresee that I shall have my hands full . Well , well , we ca n't get through this world without our share of trouble . I 've had a pretty easy life of it so far , but my time has come at last and I suppose I 'll just have to make the best of it . "
21634	21692	21622	21622	she	124	" Oh , please , Miss Cuthbert , wo n't you tell me if you are going to send me away or not ? I 've tried to be patient all the morning , but I really feel that I can not bear not knowing any longer . It 's a dreadful feeling . Please tell me . "
21693	21711	21713	21713	Marilla	113	" You have n't scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you to do , "
21716	21731	21713	21713	Marilla	113	" Just go and do it before you ask any more questions , Anne . "
21755	21758	21760	21760	Marilla	113	" Well , "
21773	21819	21760	21760	Marilla	113	" I suppose I might as well tell you . Matthew and I have decided to keep you -- that is , if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself grateful . Why , child , whatever is the matter ? "
21820	21825	21827	21827	Anne	124	" I 'm crying , "
21834	21939	21827	21827	Anne	124	" I ca n't think why . I 'm glad as glad can be . Oh , _ glad _ does n't seem the right word at all . I was glad about the White Way and the cherry blossoms -- but this ! Oh , it 's something more than glad . I 'm so happy . I 'll try to be so good . It will be uphill work , I expect , for Mrs. Thomas often told me I was desperately wicked . However , I 'll do my very best . But can you tell me why I 'm crying ? "
21940	21954	21956	21956	Marilla	113	" I suppose it 's because you 're all excited and worked up , "
21959	22030	21956	21956	Marilla	113	" Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself . I 'm afraid you both cry and laugh far too easily . Yes , you can stay here and we will try to do right by you . You must go to school ; but it 's only a fortnight till vacation so it is n't worth while for you to start before it opens again in September . "
22031	22039	22041	22041	Anne	124	" What am I to call you ? "
22043	22058	22041	22041	Anne	124	" Shall I always say Miss Cuthbert ? Can I call you Aunt Marilla ? "
22059	22086	21827	21827	Anne	124	" No ; you 'll call me just plain Marilla . I 'm not used to being called Miss Cuthbert and it would make me nervous . "
22087	22097	22099	22099	Anne	124	" It sounds awfully disrespectful to just say Marilla , "
22101	22145	21827	21827	Anne	124	" I guess there 'll be nothing disrespectful in it if you 're careful to speak respectfully . Everybody , young and old , in Avonlea calls me Marilla except the minister . He says Miss Cuthbert -- when he thinks of it . "
22146	22156	22158	22158	Anne	124	" I 'd love to call you Aunt Marilla , "
22161	22200	22158	22158	Anne	124	" I 've never had an aunt or any relation at all -- not even a grandmother . It would make me feel as if I really belonged to you . Ca n't I call you Aunt Marilla ? "
22201	22225	21827	21827	Anne	124	" No . I 'm not your aunt and I do n't believe in calling people names that do n't belong to them . "
22226	22236	22158	22158	Anne	124	" But we could imagine you were my aunt . "
22237	22242	22244	22244	Marilla	110	" I could n't , "
22247	22260	22262	22262	Anne	124	" Do you never imagine things different from what they really are ? "
22267	22270	22158	22158	Anne	124	" No . "
22271	22274	22275	22275	Anne	124	" Oh ! "
22281	22293	22275	22275	Anne	124	" Oh , Miss -- Marilla , how much you miss ! "
22294	22309	22311	22311	Marilla	110	" I do n't believe in imagining things different from what they really are , "
22313	22411	22311	22311	Marilla	110	" When the Lord puts us in certain circumstances He does n't mean for us to imagine them away . And that reminds me . Go into the sitting room , Anne -- be sure your feet are clean and do n't let any flies in -- and bring me out the illustrated card that 's on the mantelpiece . The Lord 's Prayer is on it and you 'll devote your spare time this afternoon to learning it off by heart . There 's to be no more of such praying as I heard last night . "
22412	22420	22422	22422	Anne	124	" I suppose I was very awkward , "
22425	22550	22422	22422	Anne	124	" but then , you see , I 'd never had any practice . You could n't really expect a person to pray very well the first time she tried , could you ? I thought out a splendid prayer after I went to bed , just as I promised you I would . It was nearly as long as a minister 's and so poetical . But would you believe it ? I could n't remember one word when I woke up this morning . And I 'm afraid I 'll never be able to think out another one as good . Somehow , things never are so good when they 're thought out a second time . Have you ever noticed that ? "
22551	22599	22629	22629	her	124	" Here is something for you to notice , Anne . When I tell you to do a thing I want you to obey me at once and not stand stock - still and discourse about it . Just you go and do as I bid you . "
22687	22696	22698	22698	Marilla	110	" Anne , whatever are you thinking of ? "
22710	22713	22714	22714	she	124	" That , "
22728	22732	22733	22733	I	0	" Christ Blessing Little Children"--"and
22985	22985	22964	22964	I	0	"
22986	22989	22991	22991	Marilla	110	" Anne , "
23005	23020	22991	22991	Marilla	110	" you should n't talk that way . It 's irreverent -- positively irreverent . "
23026	23049	22964	22964	I	0	" Why , I felt just as reverent as could be . I 'm sure I did n't mean to be irreverent . "
23050	23130	23169	23169	her	110	" Well I do n't suppose you did -- but it does n't sound right to talk so familiarly about such things . And another thing , Anne , when I send you after something you 're to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and imagining before pictures . Remember that . Take that card and come right to the kitchen . Now , sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by heart . "
23183	23188	23189	23189	she	110	" I like this , "
23194	23309	23189	23189	she	110	" It 's beautiful . I 've heard it before -- I heard the superintendent of the asylum Sunday school say it over once . But I did n't like it then . He had such a cracked voice and he prayed it so mournfully . I really felt sure he thought praying was a disagreeable duty . This is n't poetry , but it makes me feel just the same way poetry does . ? Our Father who art in heaven hallowed be Thy name . ' That is just like a line of music . Oh , I 'm so glad you thought of making me learn this , Miss -- Marilla . "
23310	23320	23322	23322	Marilla	113	" Well , learn it and hold your tongue , "
23355	23358	23359	23359	she	124	" Marilla , "
23363	23378	23359	23359	she	124	" do you think that I shall ever have a bosom friend in Avonlea ? "
23379	23388	23189	23189	she	110	" A -- a what kind of friend ? "
23389	23459	23359	23359	she	124	" A bosom friend -- an intimate friend , you know -- a really kindred spirit to whom I can confide my inmost soul . I 've dreamed of meeting her all my life . I never really supposed I would , but so many of my loveliest dreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will , too . Do you think it 's possible ? "
23460	23546	23189	23189	she	110	" Diana Barry lives over at Orchard Slope and she 's about your age . She 's a very nice little girl , and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when she comes home . She 's visiting her aunt over at Carmody just now . You 'll have to be careful how you behave yourself , though . Mrs. Barry is a very particular woman . She wo n't let Diana play with any little girl who is n't nice and good . "
23562	23605	23189	23189	she	110	" What is Diana like ? Her hair is n't red , is it ? Oh , I hope not . It 's bad enough to have red hair myself , but I positively could n't endure it in a bosom friend . "
23606	23639	23359	23359	she	124	" Diana is a very pretty little girl . She has black eyes and hair and rosy cheeks . And she is good and smart , which is better than being pretty . "
23692	24144	24811	24811	Her	124	" Oh , I 'm so glad she 's pretty . Next to being beautiful oneself -- and that 's impossible in my case -- it would be best to have a beautiful bosom friend . When I lived with Mrs. Thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting room with glass doors . There were n't any books in it ; Mrs. Thomas kept her best china and her preserves there -- when she had any preserves to keep . One of the doors was broken . Mr. Thomas smashed it one night when he was slightly intoxicated . But the other was whole and I used to pretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in it . I called her Katie Maurice , and we were very intimate . I used to talk to her by the hour , especially on Sunday , and tell her everything . Katie was the comfort and consolation of my life . We used to pretend that the bookcase was enchanted and that if I only knew the spell I could open the door and step right into the room where Katie Maurice lived , instead of into Mrs. Thomas ' shelves of preserves and china . And then Katie Maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a wonderful place , all flowers and sunshine and fairies , and we would have lived there happy for ever after . When I went to live with Mrs. Hammond it just broke my heart to leave Katie Maurice . She felt it dreadfully , too , I know she did , for she was crying when she kissed me good - bye through the bookcase door . There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammond 's . But just up the river a little way from the house there was a long green little valley , and the loveliest echo lived there . It echoed back every word you said , even if you did n't talk a bit loud . So I imagined that it was a little girl called Violetta and we were great friends and I loved her almost as well as I loved Katie Maurice -- not quite , but almost , you know . The night before I went to the asylum I said good - bye to Violetta , and oh , her good - bye came back to me in such sad , sad tones . I had become so attached to her that I had n't the heart to imagine a bosom friend at the asylum , even if there had been any scope for imagination there . "
24145	24157	24159	24159	Marilla	113	" I think it 's just as well there was n't , "
24162	24227	24159	24159	Marilla	113	" I do n't approve of such goings - on . You seem to half believe your own imaginations . It will be well for you to have a real live friend to put such nonsense out of your head . But do n't let Mrs. Barry hear you talking about your Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she 'll think you tell stories . "
24228	24331	24811	24811	Her	124	" Oh , I wo n't . I could n't talk of them to everybody -- their memories are too sacred for that . But I thought I 'd like to have you know about them . Oh , look , here 's a big bee just tumbled out of an apple blossom . Just think what a lovely place to live -- in an apple blossom ! Fancy going to sleep in it when the wind was rocking it . If I was n't a human girl I think I 'd like to be a bee and live among the flowers . "
24332	24342	24344	24344	Marilla	113	" Yesterday you wanted to be a sea gull , "
24346	24396	24344	24344	Marilla	113	" I think you are very fickle minded . I told you to learn that prayer and not talk . But it seems impossible for you to stop talking if you 've got anybody that will listen to you . So go up to your room and learn it . "
24397	24415	24811	24811	Her	124	" Oh , I know it pretty nearly all now -- all but just the last line . "
24416	24452	24344	24344	Marilla	113	" Well , never mind , do as I tell you . Go to your room and finish learning it well , and stay there until I call you down to help me get tea . "
24453	24465	24467	24467	Anne	124	" Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company ? "
24469	24496	24344	24344	Marilla	113	" No ; you do n't want your room cluttered up with flowers . You should have left them on the tree in the first place . "
24497	24508	24510	24510	Anne	124	" I did feel a little that way , too , "
24512	24562	24510	24510	Anne	124	" I kind of felt I should n't shorten their lovely lives by picking them -- I would n't want to be picked if I were an apple blossom . But the temptation was _ irresistible _ . What do you do when you meet with an irresistible temptation ? "
24563	24578	24344	24344	Marilla	113	" Anne , did you hear me tell you to go to your room ? "
24598	24796	24344	24344	Marilla	113	" There -- I know this prayer . I learned that last sentence coming upstairs . Now I 'm going to imagine things into this room so that they 'll always stay imagined . The floor is covered with a white velvet carpet with pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the windows . The walls are hung with gold and silver brocade tapestry . The furniture is mahogany . I never saw any mahogany , but it does sound _ so _ luxurious . This is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions , pink and blue and crimson and gold , and I am reclining gracefully on it . I can see my reflection in that splendid big mirror hanging on the wall . I am tall and regal , clad in a gown of trailing white lace , with a pearl cross on my breast and pearls in my hair . My hair is of midnight darkness and my skin is a clear ivory pallor . My name is the Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald . No , it isn't -- I ca n't make _ that _ seem real . "
24824	24833	24834	24834	she	124	" You 're only Anne of Green Gables , "
24838	24886	24834	24834	she	124	" and I see you , just as you are looking now , whenever I try to imagine I 'm the Lady Cordelia . But it 's a million times nicer to be Anne of Green Gables than Anne of nowhere in particular , is n't it ? "
24904	25015	24887	24887	She	124	" Dear Snow Queen , good afternoon . And good afternoon dear birches down in the hollow . And good afternoon , dear gray house up on the hill . I wonder if Diana is to be my bosom friend . I hope she will , and I shall love her very much . But I must never quite forget Katie Maurice and Violetta . They would feel so hurt if I did and I 'd hate to hurt anybody 's feelings , even a little bookcase girl 's or a little echo girl 's . I must be careful to remember them and send them a kiss every day . "
25387	25391	25353	25353	Anne	124	" June bells , "
25498	25500	25492	25492	his	107	" chatter "
25604	25617	25601	25601	her	105	" I 've been hearing some surprising things about you and Matthew . "
25618	25633	25635	25635	Marilla	113	" I do n't suppose you are any more surprised than I am myself , "
25637	25646	25635	25635	Marilla	113	" I 'm getting over my surprise now . "
25647	25658	25660	25661	Mrs. Rachel	105	" It was too bad there was such a mistake , "
25664	25673	25660	25661	Mrs. Rachel	105	" Could n't you have sent her back ? "
25674	25726	25635	25635	Marilla	113	" I suppose we could , but we decided not to . Matthew took a fancy to her . And I must say I like her myself -- although I admit she has her faults . The house seems a different place already . She 's a real bright little thing . "
25750	25762	25764	25765	that lady	686	" It 's a great responsibility you 've taken on yourself , "
25768	25823	25764	25765	that lady	686	" especially when you 've never had any experience with children . You do n't know much about her or her real disposition , I suppose , and there 's no guessing how a child like that will turn out . But I do n't want to discourage you I 'm sure , Marilla . "
25824	25831	25833	25833	Marilla	113	" I 'm not feeling discouraged , "
25838	25869	25833	25833	Marilla	113	" when I make up my mind to do a thing it stays made up . I suppose you 'd like to see Anne . I 'll call her in . "
25974	25992	25994	25996	Mrs. Rachel Lynde	105	" Well , they did n't pick you for your looks , that 's sure and certain , "
26023	26073	26001	26002	Mrs. Rachel	105	" She 's terrible skinny and homely , Marilla . Come here , child , and let me have a look at you . Lawful heart , did any one ever see such freckles ? And hair as red as carrots ! Come here , child , I say . "
26075	26079	26074	26074	Anne	124	" came there , "
26123	26128	26129	26129	she	124	" I hate you , "
26143	26155	26129	26129	she	124	" I hate you -- I hate you -- I hate you-- "
26165	26195	26129	26129	she	124	" How dare you call me skinny and ugly ? How dare you say I 'm freckled and redheaded ? You are a rude , impolite , unfeeling woman ! "
26196	26199	26201	26201	Marilla	113	" Anne ! "
26232	26242	26243	26243	she	124	" How dare you say such things about me ? "
26247	26338	26243	26243	she	124	" How would you like to have such things said about you ? How would you like to be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably had n't a spark of imagination in you ? I do n't care if I do hurt your feelings by saying so ! I hope I hurt them . You have hurt mine worse than they were ever hurt before even by Mrs. Thomas ' intoxicated husband . And I 'll _ never _ forgive you for it , never , never ! "
26343	26352	26356	26357	Mrs. Rachel	105	" Did anybody ever see such a temper ! "
26359	26373	26375	26375	Marilla	113	" Anne go to your room and stay there until I come up , "
26443	26461	26463	26464	Mrs. Rachel	105	" Well , I do n't envy you your job bringing _ that _ up , Marilla , "
26498	26511	26485	26485	she	113	" You should n't have twitted her about her looks , Rachel . "
26512	26540	26542	26543	Mrs. Rachel	105	" Marilla Cuthbert , you do n't mean to say that you are upholding her in such a terrible display of temper as we 've just seen ? "
26546	26549	26551	26551	Marilla	113	" No , "
26554	26610	26551	26551	Marilla	113	" I 'm not trying to excuse her . She 's been very naughty and I 'll have to give her a talking to about it . But we must make allowances for her . She 's never been taught what is right . And you _ were _ too hard on her , Rachel . "
26643	26854	26632	26633	Mrs. Rachel	105	" Well , I see that I 'll have to be very careful what I say after this , Marilla , since the fine feelings of orphans , brought from goodness knows where , have to be considered before anything else . Oh , no , I 'm not vexed -- don't worry yourself . I 'm too sorry for you to leave any room for anger in my mind . You 'll have your own troubles with that child . But if you 'll take my advice -- which I suppose you wo n't do , although I 've brought up ten children and buried two -- you'll do that ? talking to ' you mention with a fair - sized birch switch . I should think _ that _ would be the most effective language for that kind of a child . Her temper matches her hair I guess . Well , good evening , Marilla . I hope you 'll come down to see me often as usual . But you ca n't expect me to visit here again in a hurry , if I 'm liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion . It 's something new in _ my _ experience . "
27069	27072	27073	27073	she	113	" Anne , "
27081	27084	27122	27122	her	124	" Anne , "
27089	27107	27122	27122	her	124	" get off that bed this minute and listen to what I have to say to you . "
27138	27158	27122	27122	her	124	" This is a nice way for you to behave . Anne ! Are n't you ashamed of yourself ? "
27159	27172	27174	27174	Anne	124	" She had n't any right to call me ugly and redheaded , "
27180	27268	27122	27122	her	124	" You had n't any right to fly into such a fury and talk the way you did to her , Anne . I was ashamed of you -- thoroughly ashamed of you . I wanted you to behave nicely to Mrs. Lynde , and instead of that you have disgraced me . I 'm sure I do n't know why you should lose your temper like that just because Mrs. Lynde said you were red - haired and homely . You say it yourself often enough . "
27269	27290	27292	27292	Anne	124	" Oh , but there 's such a difference between saying a thing yourself and hearing other people say it , "
27294	27361	27292	27292	Anne	124	" You may know a thing is so , but you ca n't help hoping other people do n't quite think it is . I suppose you think I have an awful temper , but I could n't help it . When she said those things something just rose right up in me and choked me . I _ had _ to fly out at her . "
27362	27413	27452	27455	a very small child	701	" Well , you made a fine exhibition of yourself I must say . Mrs. Lynde will have a nice story to tell about you everywhere -- and she 'll tell it , too . It was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that , Anne . "
27414	27435	27437	27437	Anne	124	" Just imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that you were skinny and ugly , "
27468	27482	27449	27449	She	113	" What a pity she is such a dark , homely little thing . "
27499	27522	27523	27523	she	702	" I do n't say that I think Mrs. Lynde was exactly right in saying what she did to you , Anne , "
27530	27579	27523	27523	she	702	" Rachel is too outspoken . But that is no excuse for such behavior on your part . She was a stranger and an elderly person and my visitor -- all three very good reasons why you should have been respectful to her . You were rude and saucy and"--Marilla
27585	27608	27523	27523	she	702	punishment--"you must go to her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her to forgive you . "
27609	27616	27618	27618	Anne	124	" I can never do that , "
27623	27677	27618	27618	Anne	124	" You can punish me in any way you like , Marilla . You can shut me up in a dark , damp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and water and I shall not complain . But I can not ask Mrs. Lynde to forgive me . "
27678	27694	27696	27696	Marilla	113	" We 're not in the habit of shutting people up in dark damp dungeons , "
27699	27738	27696	27696	Marilla	113	" especially as they 're rather scarce in Avonlea . But apologize to Mrs. Lynde you must and shall and you 'll stay here in your room until you can tell me you 're willing to do it . "
27739	27749	27751	27751	Anne	124	" I shall have to stay here forever then , "
27754	27837	27751	27751	Anne	124	" because I ca n't tell Mrs. Lynde I 'm sorry I said those things to her . How can I ? I 'm _ not _ sorry . I 'm sorry I 've vexed you ; but I 'm _ glad _ I told her just what I did . It was a great satisfaction . I ca n't say I 'm sorry when I 'm not , can I ? I ca n't even _ imagine _ I 'm sorry . "
27838	27852	27854	27854	Marilla	113	" Perhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the morning , "
27860	27915	27854	27854	Marilla	113	" You 'll have the night to think over your conduct in and come to a better frame of mind . You said you would try to be a very good girl if we kept you at Green Gables , but I must say it has n't seemed very much like it this evening . "
28043	28063	28065	28065	Matthew	107	" It 's a good thing Rachel Lynde got a calling down ; she 's a meddlesome old gossip , "
28070	28114	28065	28065	Matthew	107	" Matthew Cuthbert , I 'm astonished at you . You know that Anne 's behavior was dreadful , and yet you take her part ! I suppose you 'll be saying next thing that she ought n't to be punished at all ! "
28115	28124	28126	28126	Matthew	107	" Well now -- no -- not exactly , "
28129	28178	28126	28126	Matthew	107	" I reckon she ought to be punished a little . But do n't be too hard on her , Marilla . Recollect she has n't ever had anyone to teach her right . You're -- you're going to give her something to eat , are n't you ? "
28179	28193	28195	28195	Marilla	113	" When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior ? "
28198	28239	28195	28195	Marilla	113	" She 'll have her meals regular , and I 'll carry them up to her myself . But she 'll stay up there until she 's willing to apologize to Mrs. Lynde , and that 's final , Matthew . "
28486	28489	28490	28490	he	107	" Anne , "
28500	28509	28490	28490	he	107	" how are you making it , Anne ? "
28514	28552	28510	28510	Anne	124	" Pretty well . I imagine a good deal , and that helps to pass the time . Of course , it 's rather lonesome . But then , I may as well get used to that . "
28590	28611	28612	28612	he	107	" Well now , Anne , do n't you think you 'd better do it and have it over with ? "
28615	28657	28612	28612	he	107	" It 'll have to be done sooner or later , you know , for Marilla 's a dreadful deter - mined woman -- dreadful determined , Anne . Do it right off , I say , and have it over . "
28658	28667	28575	28575	he	107	" Do you mean apologize to Mrs. Lynde ? "
28668	28679	28681	28681	Matthew	107	" Yes -- apologize -- that 's the very word , "
28684	28703	28681	28681	Matthew	107	" Just smooth it over so to speak . That 's what I was trying to get at . "
28704	28715	28717	28717	Anne	124	" I suppose I could do it to oblige you , "
28720	28865	28717	28717	Anne	124	" It would be true enough to say I am sorry , because I _ am _ sorry now . I was n't a bit sorry last night . I was mad clear through , and I stayed mad all night . I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just furious every time . But this morning it was over . I was n't in a temper anymore -- and it left a dreadful sort of goneness , too . I felt so ashamed of myself . But I just could n't think of going and telling Mrs. Lynde so . It would be so humiliating . I made up my mind I 'd stay shut up here forever rather than do that . But still -- I'd do anything for you -- if you really want me to-- "
28866	28896	29026	29026	herself	113	" Well now , of course I do . It 's terrible lonesome downstairs without you . Just go and smooth things over -- that 's a good girl . "
28897	28901	28903	28903	Anne	124	" Very well , "
28906	28921	28903	28903	Anne	124	" I 'll tell Marilla as soon as she comes in I 've repented . "
28922	28961	29026	29026	herself	113	" That 's right -- that 's right , Anne . But do n't tell Marilla I said anything about it . She might think I was putting my oar in and I promised not to do that . "
28962	28973	28975	28975	Anne	124	" Wild horses wo n't drag the secret from me , "
28978	28991	28975	28975	Anne	124	" How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow ? "
29045	29047	29026	29026	herself	113	" Marilla "
29052	29055	29056	29056	she	113	" Well ? "
29064	29089	29056	29056	she	113	" I 'm sorry I lost my temper and said rude things , and I 'm willing to go and tell Mrs. Lynde so . "
29090	29094	29095	29095	Marilla	113	" Very well . "
29123	29132	29105	29105	She	113	" I 'll take you down after milking . "
29223	29232	29233	29233	she	113	" What are you thinking of , Anne ? "
29237	29250	29252	29252	Anne	124	" I 'm imagining out what I must say to Mrs. Lynde , "
29357	29369	29370	29370	she	124	" Oh , Mrs. Lynde , I am so extremely sorry , "
29379	29581	29370	29370	she	124	" I could never express all my sorrow , no , not if I used up a whole dictionary . You must just imagine it . I behaved terribly to you -- and I 've disgraced the dear friends , Matthew and Marilla , who have let me stay at Green Gables although I 'm not a boy . I 'm a dreadfully wicked and ungrateful girl , and I deserve to be punished and cast out by respectable people forever . It was very wicked of me to fly into a temper because you told me the truth . It _ was _ the truth ; every word you said was true . My hair is red and I 'm freckled and skinny and ugly . What I said to you was true , too , but I should n't have said it . Oh , Mrs. Lynde , please , please , forgive me . If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow on a poor little orphan girl , would you , even if she had a dreadful temper ? Oh , I am sure you would n't . Please say you forgive me , Mrs. Lynde . "
29719	29729	29730	29730	she	152	" There , there , get up , child , "
29734	29844	29730	29730	she	152	" Of course I forgive you . I guess I was a little too hard on you , anyway . But I 'm such an outspoken person . You just must n't mind me , that 's what . It ca n't be denied your hair is terrible red ; but I knew a girl once -- went to school with her , in fact -- whose hair was every mite as red as yours when she was young , but when she grew up it darkened to a real handsome auburn . I would n't be a mite surprised if yours did , too -- not a mite . "
29845	29851	29852	29852	Anne	124	" Oh , Mrs. Lynde ! "
29864	29964	29858	29858	she	124	" You have given me a hope . I shall always feel that you are a benefactor . Oh , I could endure anything if I only thought my hair would be a handsome auburn when I grew up . It would be so much easier to be good if one 's hair was a handsome auburn , do n't you think ? And now may I go out into your garden and sit on that bench under the apple - trees while you and Marilla are talking ? There is so much more scope for imagination out there . "
29965	29994	29730	29730	she	152	" Laws , yes , run along , child . And you can pick a bouquet of them white June lilies over in the corner if you like . "
30011	30210	29858	29858	she	124	" She 's a real odd little thing . Take this chair , Marilla ; it 's easier than the one you 've got ; I just keep that for the hired boy to sit on . Yes , she certainly is an odd child , but there is something kind of taking about her after all . I do n't feel so surprised at you and Matthew keeping her as I did -- nor so sorry for you , either . She may turn out all right . Of course , she has a queer way of expressing herself -- a little too -- well , too kind of forcible , you know ; but she 'll likely get over that now that she 's come to live among civilized folks . And then , her temper 's pretty quick , I guess ; but there 's one comfort , a child that has a quick temper , just blaze up and cool down , ai n't never likely to be sly or deceitful . Preserve me from a sly child , that 's what . On the whole , Marilla , I kind of like her . "
30235	30245	30246	30246	she	153	" I apologized pretty well , did n't I ? "
30256	30273	30246	30246	she	153	" I thought since I had to do it I might as well do it thoroughly . "
30274	30284	30286	30286	Marilla	113	" You did it thoroughly , all right enough , "
30336	30364	30327	30327	She	113	" I hope you wo n't have occasion to make many more such apologies . I hope you 'll try to control your temper now , Anne . "
30365	30382	30384	30384	Anne	153	" That would n't be so hard if people would n't twit me about my looks , "
30389	30437	30384	30384	Anne	153	" I do n't get cross about other things ; but I 'm _ so _ tired of being twitted about my hair and it just makes me boil right over . Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when I grow up ? "
30438	30462	30327	30327	She	113	" You should n't think so much about your looks , Anne . I 'm afraid you are a very vain little girl . "
30463	30476	30478	30478	Anne	153	" How can I be vain when I know I 'm homely ? "
30480	30530	30478	30478	Anne	153	" I love pretty things ; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that is n't pretty . It makes me feel so sorrowful -- just as I feel when I look at any ugly thing . I pity it because it is n't beautiful . "
30531	30538	30540	30540	Marilla	113	" Handsome is as handsome does , "
30542	30560	30562	30563	skeptical Anne	153	" I 've had that said to me before , but I have my doubts about it , "
30570	30656	30562	30563	skeptical Anne	153	" Oh , are n't these flowers sweet ! It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give them to me . I have no hard feelings against Mrs. Lynde now . It gives you a lovely , comfortable feeling to apologize and be forgiven , does n't it ? Are n't the stars bright tonight ? If you could live in a star , which one would you pick ? I 'd like that lovely clear big one away over there above that dark hill . "
30657	30665	30667	30667	Marilla	113	" Anne , do hold your tongue , "
30755	30769	30770	30770	she	153	" It 's lovely to be going home and know it 's home , "
30773	30817	30770	30770	she	153	" I love Green Gables already , and I never loved any place before . No place ever seemed like home . Oh , Marilla , I 'm so happy . I could pray right now and not find it a bit hard . "
30873	30901	30844	30844	she	113	" If you 'll be a good girl you 'll always be happy , Anne . And you should never find it hard to say your prayers . "
30902	30916	30918	30918	Anne	153	" Saying one 's prayers is n't exactly the same thing as praying , "
30921	31040	30918	30918	Anne	153	" But I 'm going to imagine that I 'm the wind that is blowing up there in those tree tops . When I get tired of the trees I 'll imagine I 'm gently waving down here in the ferns -- and then I 'll fly over to Mrs. Lynde 's garden and set the flowers dancing -- and then I 'll go with one great swoop over the clover field -- and then I 'll blow over the Lake of Shining Waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling waves . Oh , there 's so much scope for imagination in a wind ! So I 'll not talk any more just now , Marilla . "
31041	31049	31051	31051	Marilla	113	" Thanks be to goodness for that , "
31066	31075	31077	31077	Marilla	113	" WELL , how do you like them ? "
31206	31215	31217	31217	Anne	153	" I 'll imagine that I like them , "
31220	31230	31232	31232	Marilla	113	" I do n't want you to imagine it , "
31236	31265	31232	31232	Marilla	113	" Oh , I can see you do n't like the dresses ! What is the matter with them ? Are n't they neat and clean and new ? "
31266	31269	31217	31217	Anne	153	" Yes . "
31270	31279	31232	31232	Marilla	113	" Then why do n't you like them ? "
31280	31288	31290	31290	Anne	153	" They're -- they're not -- pretty , "
31293	31296	31297	31297	Marilla	113	" Pretty ! "
31300	31424	31297	31297	Marilla	113	" I did n't trouble my head about getting pretty dresses for you . I do n't believe in pampering vanity , Anne , I 'll tell you that right off . Those dresses are good , sensible , serviceable dresses , without any frills or furbelows about them , and they 're all you 'll get this summer . The brown gingham and the blue print will do you for school when you begin to go . The sateen is for church and Sunday school . I 'll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear them . I should think you 'd be grateful to get most anything after those skimpy wincey things you 've been wearing . "
31425	31434	31436	31436	Anne	153	" Oh , I _ am _ grateful , "
31438	31487	31436	31436	Anne	153	" But I 'd be ever so much gratefuller if -- if you 'd made just one of them with puffed sleeves . Puffed sleeves are so fashionable now . It would give me such a thrill , Marilla , just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves . "
31488	31529	31297	31297	Marilla	113	" Well , you 'll have to do without your thrill . I had n't any material to waste on puffed sleeves . I think they are ridiculous - looking things anyhow . I prefer the plain , sensible ones . "
31530	31549	31551	31551	Anne	153	" But I 'd rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and sensible all by myself , "
31554	31600	31602	31602	Marilla	113	" Trust you for that ! Well , hang those dresses carefully up in your closet , and then sit down and learn the Sunday school lesson . I got a quarterly from Mr. Bell for you and you 'll go to Sunday school tomorrow , "
31620	31634	31635	31635	she	153	" I did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeves , "
31639	31713	31635	31635	she	153	" I prayed for one , but I did n't much expect it on that account . I did n't suppose God would have time to bother about a little orphan girl 's dress . I knew I 'd just have to depend on Marilla for it . Well , fortunately I can imagine that one of them is of snow - white muslin with lovely lace frills and three - puffed sleeves . "
31733	31748	31749	31749	she	113	" You 'll have to go down and call for Mrs. Lynde , Anne , "
31752	31817	31749	31749	she	113	" She 'll see that you get into the right class . Now , mind you behave yourself properly . Stay to preaching afterwards and ask Mrs. Lynde to show you our pew . Here 's a cent for collection . Do n't stare at people and do n't fidget . I shall expect you to tell me the text when you come home . "
32266	32276	32277	32277	Marilla	113	" Well , how did you like Sunday school ? "
32311	32324	32277	32277	Marilla	113	" I did n't like it a bit . It was horrid . "
32325	32329	32331	32331	Marilla	113	" Anne Shirley ! "
32361	32372	32373	32373	she	124	" They might have been lonesome while I was away , "
32376	32493	32373	32373	she	124	" And now about the Sunday school . I behaved well , just as you told me . Mrs. Lynde was gone , but I went right on myself . I went into the church , with a lot of other little girls , and I sat in the corner of a pew by the window while the opening exercises went on . Mr. Bell made an awfully long prayer . I would have been dreadfully tired before he got through if I had n't been sitting by that window . But it looked right out on the Lake of Shining Waters , so I just gazed at that and imagined all sorts of splendid things . "
32494	32513	32354	32354	her	124	" You should n't have done anything of the sort . You should have listened to Mr. Bell . "
32514	32523	32525	32525	Anne	153	" But he was n't talking to me , "
32527	32628	32525	32525	Anne	153	" He was talking to God and he did n't seem to be very much inter - ested in it , either . I think he thought God was too far off though . There was a long row of white birches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through them , ? way , ? way down , deep into the water . Oh , Marilla , it was like a beautiful dream ! It gave me a thrill and I just said , ? Thank you for it , God , ' two or three times . "
32629	32637	32639	32639	Marilla	113	" Not out loud , I hope , "
32642	32746	32354	32354	her	124	" Oh , no , just under my breath . Well , Mr. Bell did get through at last and they told me to go into the classroom with Miss Rogerson 's class . There were nine other girls in it . They all had puffed sleeves . I tried to imagine mine were puffed , too , but I could n't . Why could n't I ? It was as easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when I was alone in the east gable , but it was awfully hard there among the others who had really truly puffs . "
32747	32776	32354	32354	her	124	" You should n't have been thinking about your sleeves in Sunday school . You should have been attending to the lesson . I hope you knew it . "
32777	32955	32354	32354	her	124	" Oh , yes ; and I answered a lot of questions . Miss Rogerson asked ever so many . I do n't think it was fair for her to do all the asking . There were lots I wanted to ask her , but I did n't like to because I did n't think she was a kindred spirit . Then all the other little girls recited a paraphrase . She asked me if I knew any . I told her I did n't , but I could recite , ? The Dog at His Master 's Grave ' if she liked . That 's in the Third Royal Reader . It is n't a really truly religious piece of poetry , but it 's so sad and melancholy that it might as well be . She said it would n't do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next Sunday . I read it over in church afterwards and it 's splendid . There are two lines in particular that just thrill me .
32956	32970	32354	32354	her	124	" ? Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell In Midian 's evil day . '
32971	33148	32354	32354	her	124	" I do n't know what ? squadrons ' means nor ? Midian , ' either , but it sounds _ so _ tragical . I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it . I 'll practice it all the week . After Sunday school I asked Miss Rogerson -- because Mrs. Lynde was too far away -- to show me your pew . I sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations , third chapter , second and third verses . It was a very long text . If I was a minister I 'd pick the short , snappy ones . The sermon was awfully long , too . I suppose the minister had to match it to the text . I did n't think he was a bit interesting . The trouble with him seems to be that he has n't enough imagination . I did n't listen to him very much . I just let my thoughts run and I thought of the most surprising things . "
33284	33328	33237	33242	this outspoken morsel of neglected humanity	769	" Anne , Mrs. Rachel says you went to church last Sunday with your hat rigged out ridiculous with roses and buttercups . What on earth put you up to such a caper ? A pretty - looking object you must have been ! "
33329	33343	33345	33345	Anne	153	" Oh . I know pink and yellow are n't becoming to me , "
33347	33379	33237	33242	this outspoken morsel of neglected humanity	769	" Becoming fiddlesticks ! It was putting flowers on your hat at all , no matter what color they were , that was ridiculous . You are the most aggravating child ! "
33380	33402	33404	33404	Anne	153	" I do n't see why it 's any more ridiculous to wear flowers on your hat than on your dress , "
33406	33424	33404	33404	Anne	153	" Lots of little girls there had bouquets pinned on their dresses . What 's the difference ? "
33442	33547	33237	33242	this outspoken morsel of neglected humanity	769	" Do n't answer me back like that , Anne . It was very silly of you to do such a thing . Never let me catch you at such a trick again . Mrs. Rachel says she thought she would sink through the floor when she saw you come in all rigged out like that . She could n't get near enough to tell you to take them off till it was too late . She says people talked about it something dreadful . Of course they would think I had no better sense than to let you go decked out like that . "
33548	33556	33558	33558	Anne	153	" Oh , I 'm so sorry , "
33566	33675	33558	33558	Anne	153	" I never thought you 'd mind . The roses and buttercups were so sweet and pretty I thought they 'd look lovely on my hat . Lots of the little girls had artificial flowers on their hats . I 'm afraid I 'm going to be a dreadful trial to you . Maybe you 'd better send me back to the asylum . That would be terrible ; I do n't think I could endure it ; most likely I would go into consumption ; I 'm so thin as it is , you see . But that would be better than being a trial to you . "
33676	33679	33681	33681	Marilla	113	" Nonsense , "
33693	33781	33681	33681	Marilla	113	" I do n't want to send you back to the asylum , I 'm sure . All I want is that you should behave like other little girls and not make yourself ridiculous . Do n't cry any more . I 've got some news for you . Diana Barry came home this afternoon . I 'm going up to see if I can borrow a skirt pattern from Mrs. Barry , and if you like you can come with me and get acquainted with Diana . "
33813	33851	33803	33803	she	153	" Oh , Marilla , I 'm frightened -- now that it has come I 'm actually frightened . What if she should n't like me ! It would be the most tragical disappointment of my life . "
33852	33980	33803	33803	she	153	" Now , do n't get into a fluster . And I do wish you would n't use such long words . It sounds so funny in a little girl . I guess Diana ? ll like you well enough . It 's her mother you 've got to reckon with . If she does n't like you it wo n't matter how much Diana does . If she has heard about your outburst to Mrs. Lynde and going to church with buttercups round your hat I do n't know what she 'll think of you . You must be polite and well behaved , and do n't make any of your startling speeches . For pity 's sake , if the child is n't actually trembling ! "
33994	34030	34031	34031	she	153	" Oh , Marilla , you 'd be excited , too , if you were going to meet a little girl you hoped to be your bosom friend and whose mother might n't like you , "
34106	34114	34115	34115	she	118	" How do you do , Marilla ? "
34119	34136	34115	34115	she	118	" Come in . And this is the little girl you have adopted , I suppose ? "
34137	34145	34147	34147	Marilla	113	" Yes , this is Anne Shirley , "
34149	34155	34157	34157	Anne	124	" Spelled with an E , "
34196	34201	34180	34181	Mrs. Barry	118	" How are you ? "
34202	34219	34221	34221	Anne	124	" I am well in body although considerable rumpled up in spirit , thank you ma'am , "
34233	34247	34227	34227	Marilla	113	" There was n't anything startling in that , was there , Marilla ? "
34299	34307	34309	34310	Mrs. Barry	118	" This is my little girl Diana , "
34312	34348	34309	34310	Mrs. Barry	118	" Diana , you might take Anne out into the garden and show her your flowers . It will be better for you than straining your eyes over that book . She reads entirely too much-- "
34357	34403	34309	34310	Mrs. Barry	118	out--"and I ca n't prevent her , for her father aids and abets her . She 's always poring over a book . I 'm glad she has the prospect of a playmate -- perhaps it will take her more out - of - doors . "
34624	34629	34631	34631	Anne	124	" Oh , Diana , "
34645	34665	34631	34631	Anne	124	" oh , do you think you can like me a little -- enough to be my bosom friend ? "
34676	34683	34684	34684	she	120	" Why , I guess so , "
34688	34735	34684	34684	she	120	" I 'm awfully glad you 've come to live at Green Gables . It will be jolly to have somebody to play with . There is n't any other girl who lives near enough to play with , and I 've no sisters big enough . "
34736	34748	34750	34750	Anne	124	" Will you swear to be my friend forever and ever ? "
34757	34766	34767	34767	she	120	" Why it 's dreadfully wicked to swear , "
34771	34789	34684	34684	she	120	" Oh no , not my kind of swearing . There are two kinds , you know . "
34790	34799	34801	34801	Diana	120	" I never heard of but one kind , "
34804	34827	34684	34684	she	120	" There really is another . Oh , it is n't wicked at all . It just means vowing and promising solemnly . "
34828	34838	34840	34840	Diana	120	" Well , I do n't mind doing that , "
34844	34851	34840	34840	Diana	120	" How do you do it ? "
34852	34860	34862	34862	Anne	124	" We must join hands -- so , "
34865	34925	34862	34862	Anne	124	" It ought to be over running water . We 'll just imagine this path is running water . I 'll repeat the oath first . I solemnly swear to be faithful to my bosom friend , Diana Barry , as long as the sun and moon shall endure . Now you say it and put my name in . "
34929	34931	34926	34926	Diana	120	" oath "
34943	34972	34940	34940	she	120	" You 're a queer girl , Anne . I heard before that you were queer . But I believe I 'm going to like you real well . "
35017	35028	35030	35030	Marilla	113	" Well , did you find Diana a kindred spirit ? "
35042	35046	35048	35048	Anne	124	" Oh yes , "
35060	35385	35048	35048	Anne	124	" Oh Marilla , I 'm the happiest girl on Prince Edward Island this very moment . I assure you I 'll say my prayers with a right good - will tonight . Diana and I are going to build a playhouse in Mr. William Bell 's birch grove tomorrow . Can I have those broken pieces of china that are out in the woodshed ? Diana 's birthday is in February and mine is in March . Do n't you think that is a very strange coincidence ? Diana is going to lend me a book to read . She says it 's perfectly splendid and tremendously exciting . She 's going to show me a place back in the woods where rice lilies grow . Do n't you think Diana has got very soulful eyes ? I wish I had soulful eyes . Diana is going to teach me to sing a song called ? Nelly in the Hazel Dell . ' She 's going to give me a picture to put up in my room ; it 's a perfectly beautiful picture , she says -- a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress . A sewing - machine agent gave it to her . I wish I had something to give Diana . I 'm an inch taller than Diana , but she is ever so much fatter ; she says she 'd like to be thin because it 's so much more graceful , but I 'm afraid she only said it to soothe my feelings . We 're going to the shore some day to gather shells . We have agreed to call the spring down by the log bridge the Dryad 's Bubble . Is n't that a perfectly elegant name ? I read a story once about a spring called that . A dryad is sort of a grown - up fairy , I think . "
35386	35401	35403	35403	Marilla	113	" Well , all I hope is you wo n't talk Diana to death , "
35405	35446	35403	35403	Marilla	113	" But remember this in all your planning , Anne . You 're not going to play all the time nor most of it . You 'll have your work to do and it 'll have to be done first . "
35499	35515	35516	35516	he	107	" I heard you say you liked chocolate sweeties , so I got you some , "
35519	35522	35524	35524	Marilla	113	" Humph , "
35526	35583	35524	35524	Marilla	113	" It 'll ruin her teeth and stomach . There , there , child , do n't look so dismal . You can eat those , since Matthew has gone and got them . He 'd better have brought you peppermints . They 're wholesomer . Do n't sicken yourself eating all them at once now . "
35584	35595	35597	35597	Anne	124	" Oh , no , indeed , I wo n't , "
35600	35652	35597	35597	Anne	124	" I 'll just eat one tonight , Marilla . And I can give Diana half of them , ca n't I ? The other half will taste twice as sweet to me if I give some to her . It 's delightful to think I have something to give her . "
35653	35662	35664	35664	Marilla	113	" I will say it for the child , "
35673	35797	35664	35664	Marilla	113	" she is n't stingy . I 'm glad , for of all faults I detest stinginess in a child . Dear me , it 's only three weeks since she came , and it seems as if she 'd been here always . I ca n't imagine the place without her . Now , do n't be looking I told - you - so , Matthew . That 's bad enough in a woman , but it is n't to be endured in a man . I 'm perfectly willing to own up that I 'm glad I consented to keep the child and that I 'm getting fond of her , but do n't you rub it in , Matthew Cuthbert . "
35805	35817	35819	35819	Marilla	113	" IT 'S time Anne was in to do her sewing , "
35840	35948	35819	35819	Marilla	113	" She stayed playing with Diana more than half an hour more ? n I gave her leave to ; and now she 's perched out there on the woodpile talking to Matthew , nineteen to the dozen , when she knows perfectly well she ought to be at her work . And of course he 's listening to her like a perfect ninny . I never saw such an infatuated man . The more she talks and the odder the things she says , the more he 's delighted evidently . Anne Shirley , you come right in here this minute , do you hear me ! "
35986	35991	35992	35992	she	124	" Oh , Marilla , "
35996	36060	35992	35992	she	124	" there 's going to be a Sunday - school picnic next week -- in Mr. Harmon Andrews 's field , right near the lake of Shining Waters . And Mrs. Superintendent Bell and Mrs. Rachel Lynde are going to make ice cream -- think of it , Marilla--_ice cream ! _ And , oh , Marilla , can I go to it ? "
36061	36084	35819	35819	Marilla	113	" Just look at the clock , if you please , Anne . What time did I tell you to come in ? "
36085	36124	35992	35992	she	124	" Two o'clock -- but is n't it splendid about the picnic , Marilla ? Please can I go ? Oh , I 've never been to a picnic -- I've dreamed of picnics , but I 've never-- "
36125	36159	35819	35819	Marilla	113	" Yes , I told you to come at two o'clock . And it 's a quarter to three . I 'd like to know why you did n't obey me , Anne . "
36160	36212	35992	35992	she	124	" Why , I meant to , Marilla , as much as could be . But you have no idea how fascinating Idlewild is . And then , of course , I had to tell Matthew about the picnic . Matthew is such a sympathetic listener . Please can I go ? "
36213	36312	35819	35819	Marilla	113	" You 'll have to learn to resist the fascination of Idle - whatever - you - call - it . When I tell you to come in at a certain time I mean that time and not half an hour later . And you need n't stop to discourse with sympathetic listeners on your way , either . As for the picnic , of course you can go . You 're a Sunday - school scholar , and it 's not likely I 'd refuse to let you go when all the other little girls are going . "
36313	36318	36320	36320	Anne	124	" But -- but , "
36322	36393	36320	36320	Anne	124	" Diana says that everybody must take a basket of things to eat . I ca n't cook , as you know , Marilla , and -- and -- I do n't mind going to a picnic without puffed sleeves so much , but I 'd feel terribly humiliated if I had to go without a basket . It 's been preying on my mind ever since Diana told me . "
36394	36411	36467	36467	her	124	" Well , it need n't prey any longer . I 'll bake you a basket . "
36412	36439	36320	36320	Anne	124	" Oh , you dear good Marilla . Oh , you are so kind to me . Oh , I 'm so much obliged to you . "
36444	36446	36447	36447	Anne	124	" ohs "
36511	36624	36507	36507	she	124	" There , there , never mind your kissing nonsense . I 'd sooner see you doing strictly as you 're told . As for cooking , I mean to begin giving you lessons in that some of these days . But you 're so featherbrained , Anne , I 've been waiting to see if you 'd sober down a little and learn to be steady before I begin . You 've got to keep your wits about you in cooking and not stop in the middle of things to let your thoughts rove all over creation . Now , get out your patchwork and have your square done before teatime . "
36625	36634	36636	36636	Anne	124	" I do _ not _ like patchwork , "
36659	37402	36507	36507	she	124	" I think some kinds of sewing would be nice ; but there 's no scope for imagination in patchwork . It 's just one little seam after another and you never seem to be getting anywhere . But of course I 'd rather be Anne of Green Gables sewing patchwork than Anne of any other place with nothing to do but play . I wish time went as quick sewing patches as it does when I 'm playing with Diana , though . Oh , we do have such elegant times , Marilla . I have to furnish most of the imagination , but I 'm well able to do that . Diana is simply perfect in every other way . You know that little piece of land across the brook that runs up between our farm and Mr. Barry 's . It belongs to Mr. William Bell , and right in the corner there is a little ring of white birch trees -- the most romantic spot , Marilla . Diana and I have our playhouse there . We call it Idlewild . Is n't that a poetical name ? I assure you it took me some time to think it out . I stayed awake nearly a whole night before I invented it . Then , just as I was dropping off to sleep , it came like an inspiration . Diana was _ enraptured _ when she heard it . We have got our house fixed up elegantly . You must come and see it , Marilla -- won't you ? We have great big stones , all covered with moss , for seats , and boards from tree to tree for shelves . And we have all our dishes on them . Of course , they 're all broken but it 's the easiest thing in the world to imagine that they are whole . There 's a piece of a plate with a spray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful . We keep it in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there , too . The fairy glass is as lovely as a dream . Diana found it out in the woods behind their chicken house . It 's all full of rainbows -- just little young rainbows that have n't grown big yet -- and Diana 's mother told her it was broken off a hanging lamp they once had . But it 's nice to imagine the fairies lost it one night when they had a ball , so we call it the fairy glass . Matthew is going to make us a table . Oh , we have named that little round pool over in Mr. Barry 's field Willowmere . I got that name out of the book Diana lent me . That was a thrilling book , Marilla . The heroine had five lovers . I 'd be satisfied with one , would n't you ? She was very handsome and she went through great tribulations . She could faint as easy as anything . I 'd love to be able to faint , would n't you , Marilla ? It 's so romantic . But I 'm really very healthy for all I 'm so thin . I believe I 'm getting fatter , though . Do n't you think I am ? I look at my elbows every morning when I get up to see if any dimples are coming . Diana is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves . She is going to wear it to the picnic . Oh , I do hope it will be fine next Wednesday . I do n't feel that I could endure the disappointment if anything happened to prevent me from getting to the picnic . I suppose I 'd live through it , but I 'm certain it would be a lifelong sorrow . It would n't matter if I got to a hundred picnics in after years ; they would n't make up for missing this one . They 're going to have boats on the Lake of Shining Waters -- and ice cream , as I told you . I have never tasted ice cream . Diana tried to explain what it was like , but I guess ice cream is one of those things that are beyond imagination . "
37403	37418	37420	37420	Marilla	113	" Anne , you have talked even on for ten minutes by the clock , "
37422	37445	37420	37420	Marilla	113	" Now , just for curiosity 's sake , see if you can hold your tongue for the same length of time . "
37541	37604	37532	37533	the minister	2502	" Such a thrill as went up and down my back , Marilla ! I do n't think I 'd ever really believed until then that there was honestly going to be a picnic . I could n't help fearing I 'd only imagined it . But when a minister says a thing in the pulpit you just have to believe it . "
37605	37617	37619	37619	Marilla	113	" You set your heart too much on things , Anne , "
37625	37643	37619	37619	Marilla	113	" I 'm afraid there 'll be a great many disappointments in store for you through life . "
37644	37660	37662	37662	Anne	124	" Oh , Marilla , looking forward to things is half the pleasure of them , "
37664	37722	37662	37662	Anne	124	" You may n't get the things themselves ; but nothing can prevent you from having the fun of looking forward to them . Mrs. Lynde says , ? Blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not be disappointed . ' But I think it would be worse to expect nothing than to be disappointed . "
37885	38041	37871	37871	Anne	124	" Oh , Marilla , it 's a perfectly elegant brooch . I do n't know how you can pay attention to the sermon or the prayers when you have it on . I could n't , I know . I think amethysts are just sweet . They are what I used to think diamonds were like . Long ago , before I had ever seen a diamond , I read about them and I tried to imagine what they would be like . I thought they would be lovely glimmering purple stones . When I saw a real diamond in a lady 's ring one day I was so disappointed I cried . Of course , it was very lovely but it was n't my idea of a diamond . Will you let me hold the brooch for one minute , Marilla ? Do you think amethysts can be the souls of good violets ? "
38066	38069	38070	38070	she	113	" Anne , "
38088	38094	38070	38070	she	113	" Nelly of the Hazel Dell "
38108	38143	38070	38070	she	113	" did you see anything of my amethyst brooch ? I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when I came home from church yesterday evening , but I ca n't find it anywhere . "
38144	38161	38163	38163	Anne	124	" I -- I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid Society , "
38169	38192	38163	38163	Anne	124	" I was passing your door when I saw it on the cushion , so I went in to look at it . "
38193	38199	38201	38201	Marilla	113	" Did you touch it ? "
38204	38213	38215	38215	Anne	124	" Y - e - e - s , "
38217	38237	38215	38215	Anne	124	" I took it up and I pinned it on my breast just to see how it would look . "
38238	38297	38070	38070	she	113	" You had no business to do anything of the sort . It 's very wrong in a little girl to meddle . You should n't have gone into my room in the first place and you should n't have touched a brooch that did n't belong to you in the second . Where did you put it ? "
38298	38377	38215	38215	Anne	124	" Oh , I put it back on the bureau . I had n't it on a minute . Truly , I did n't mean to meddle , Marilla . I did n't think about its being wrong to go in and try on the brooch ; but I see now that it was and I 'll never do it again . That 's one good thing about me . I never do the same naughty thing twice . "
38378	38386	38388	38388	Marilla	113	" You did n't put it back , "
38390	38410	38388	38388	Marilla	113	" That brooch is n't anywhere on the bureau . You 've taken it out or something , Anne . "
38411	38418	38420	38420	Anne	124	" I did put it back , "
38428	38459	38425	38425	Marilla	113	" I do n't just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in the china tray . But I 'm perfectly certain I put it back . "
38460	38469	38471	38471	Marilla	113	" I 'll go and have another look , "
38478	38505	38471	38471	Marilla	113	" If you put that brooch back it 's there still . If it is n't I 'll know you did n't , that 's all ! "
38548	38594	38527	38527	she	113	" Anne , the brooch is gone . By your own admission you were the last person to handle it . Now , what have you done with it ? Tell me the truth at once . Did you take it out and lose it ? "
38595	38602	38604	38604	Anne	124	" No , I did n't , "
38614	38658	38604	38604	Anne	124	" I never took the brooch out of your room and that is the truth , if I was to be led to the block for it -- although I 'm not very certain what a block is . So there , Marilla . "
38661	38664	38670	38670	her	124	" so there "
38683	38695	38696	38696	she	113	" I believe you are telling me a falsehood , Anne , "
38700	38738	38696	38696	she	113	" I know you are . There now , do n't say anything more unless you are prepared to tell the whole truth . Go to your room and stay there until you are ready to confess . "
38739	38748	38750	38750	Anne	124	" Will I take the peas with me ? "
38753	38769	38696	38696	she	113	" No , I 'll finish shelling them myself . Do as I bid you . "
38831	38845	38847	38847	Marilla	113	" I do n't know what I would n't sooner have had happen , "
38856	39037	38850	38850	she	113	" Of course , I do n't suppose she meant to steal it or anything like that . She 's just taken it to play with or help along that imagination of hers . She must have taken it , that 's clear , for there has n't been a soul in that room since she was in it , by her own story , until I went up tonight . And the brooch is gone , there 's nothing surer . I suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for fear she 'll be punished . It 's a dreadful thing to think she tells falsehoods . It 's a far worse thing than her fit of temper . It 's a fearful responsibility to have a child in your house you ca n't trust . Slyness and untruthfulness -- that 's what she has displayed . I declare I feel worse about that than about the brooch . If she 'd only have told the truth about it I would n't mind so much . "
39128	39141	39146	39146	he	107	" You 're sure it has n't fell down behind the bureau ? "
39150	39172	39174	39174	Marilla	113	" I 've moved the bureau and I 've taken out the drawers and I 've looked in every crack and cranny "
39179	39217	39174	39174	Marilla	113	" The brooch is gone and that child has taken it and lied about it . That 's the plain , ugly truth , Matthew Cuthbert , and we might as well look it in the face . "
39218	39231	39232	39232	Matthew	107	" Well now , what are you going to do about it ? "
39263	39274	39276	39276	Marilla	113	" She 'll stay in her room until she confesses , "
39290	39329	39276	39276	Marilla	113	" Then we 'll see . Perhaps we 'll be able to find the brooch if she 'll only tell where she took it ; but in any case she 'll have to be severely punished , Matthew . "
39330	39341	39343	39343	Matthew	107	" Well now , you 'll have to punish her , "
39350	39367	39343	39343	Matthew	107	" I 've nothing to do with it , remember . You warned me off yourself . "
39453	39457	39445	39445	she	113	" beat out . "
39458	39480	39481	39481	she	113	" You 'll stay in this room until you confess , Anne . You can make up your mind to that , "
39485	39494	39496	39496	Anne	124	" But the picnic is tomorrow , Marilla , "
39498	39551	39496	39496	Anne	124	" You wo n't keep me from going to that , will you ? You 'll just let me out for the afternoon , wo n't you ? Then I 'll stay here as long as you like _ afterwards _ cheerfully . But I _ must _ go to the picnic . "
39552	39569	39445	39445	she	113	" You 'll not go to picnics nor anywhere else until you 've confessed , Anne . "
39570	39575	39577	39577	Anne	124	" Oh , Marilla , "
39707	39716	39686	39687	the child	460	" Marilla , I 'm ready to confess . "
39717	39720	39721	39721	Marilla	113	" Ah ! "
39743	39756	39686	39687	the child	460	" Let me hear what you have to say then , Anne . "
39757	39764	39766	39766	Anne	124	" I took the amethyst brooch , "
39777	40006	39766	39766	Anne	124	" I took it just as you said . I did n't mean to take it when I went in . But it did look so beautiful , Marilla , when I pinned it on my breast that I was overcome by an irresistible temptation . I imagined how perfectly thrilling it would be to take it to Idlewild and play I was the Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald . It would be so much easier to imagine I was the Lady Cordelia if I had a real amethyst brooch on . Diana and I make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts ? So I took the brooch . I thought I could put it back before you came home . I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the time . When I was going over the bridge across the Lake of Shining Waters I took the brooch off to have another look at it . Oh , how it did shine in the sunlight ! And then , when I was leaning over the bridge , it just slipped through my fingers -- so -- and went down -- down -- down , all purply - sparkling , and sank forevermore beneath the Lake of Shining Waters . And that 's the best I can do at confessing , Marilla . "
40045	40052	40053	40053	she	113	" Anne , this is terrible , "
40061	40073	40053	40053	she	113	" You are the very wickedest girl I ever heard of . "
40074	40082	40084	40084	Anne	124	" Yes , I suppose I am , "
40087	40133	40084	40084	Anne	124	" And I know I 'll have to be punished . It 'll be your duty to punish me , Marilla . Wo n't you please get it over right off because I 'd like to go to the picnic with nothing on my mind . "
40134	40170	40053	40053	she	113	" Picnic , indeed ! You 'll go to no picnic today , Anne Shirley . That shall be your punishment . And it is n't half severe enough either for what you 've done ! "
40171	40178	40179	40179	Anne	124	" Not go to the picnic ! "
40190	40263	40179	40179	Anne	124	" But you _ promised _ me I might ! Oh , Marilla , I must go to the picnic . That was why I confessed . Punish me any way you like but that . Oh , Marilla , please , please , let me go to the picnic . Think of the ice cream ! For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice cream again . "
40272	40298	40179	40179	Anne	124	" You need n't plead , Anne . You are not going to the picnic and that 's final . No , not a word . "
40342	40349	40351	40351	Marilla	113	" For the land 's sake ! "
40358	40415	40351	40351	Marilla	113	" I believe the child is crazy . No child in her senses would behave as she does . If she is n't she 's utterly bad . Oh dear , I 'm afraid Rachel was right from the first . But I 've put my hand to the plow and I wo n't look back . "
40491	40500	40469	40469	she	113	" Come down to your dinner , Anne . "
40501	40511	40513	40513	Anne	124	" I do n't want any dinner , Marilla , "
40517	40590	40513	40513	Anne	124	" I could n't eat anything . My heart is broken . You 'll feel remorse of conscience someday , I expect , for breaking it , Marilla , but I forgive you . Remember when the time comes that I forgive you . But please do n't ask me to eat anything , especially boiled pork and greens . Boiled pork and greens are so unromantic when one is in affliction . "
40627	40647	40648	40648	he	107	" Well now , she should n't have taken the brooch , Marilla , or told stories about it , "
40677	40716	40648	40648	he	107	" but she 's such a little thing -- such an interesting little thing . Do n't you think it 's pretty rough not to let her go to the picnic when she 's so set on it ? "
40717	40801	40648	40648	he	107	" Matthew Cuthbert , I 'm amazed at you . I think I 've let her off entirely too easy . And she does n't appear to realize how wicked she 's been at all -- that 's what worries me most . If she 'd really felt sorry it would n't be so bad . And you do n't seem to realize it , neither ; you 're making excuses for her all the time to yourself -- I can see that . "
40802	40813	40816	40816	Matthew	107	" Well now , she 's such a little thing , "
40818	40838	40816	40816	Matthew	107	" And there should be allowances made , Marilla . You know she 's never had any bringing up . "
40839	40847	40849	40849	Marilla	113	" Well , she 's having it now "
41021	41027	41029	41029	Marilla	113	" Dear life and heart , "
41032	41114	41029	41029	Marilla	113	" what does this mean ? Here 's my brooch safe and sound that I thought was at the bottom of Barry 's pond . Whatever did that girl mean by saying she took it and lost it ? I declare I believe Green Gables is bewitched . I remember now that when I took off my shawl Monday afternoon I laid it on the bureau for a minute . I suppose the brooch got caught in it somehow . Well ! "
41140	41144	41146	41146	Marilla	113	" Anne Shirley , "
41149	41178	41146	41146	Marilla	113	" I 've just found my brooch hanging to my black lace shawl . Now I want to know what that rigmarole you told me this morning meant . "
41179	41193	41195	41195	Anne	124	" Why , you said you 'd keep me here until I confessed , "
41198	41271	41195	41195	Anne	124	" and so I decided to confess because I was bound to get to the picnic . I thought out a confession last night after I went to bed and made it as interesting as I could . And I said it over and over so that I would n't forget it . But you would n't let me go to the picnic after all , so all my trouble was wasted . "
41287	41386	41146	41146	Marilla	113	" Anne , you do beat all ! But I was wrong -- I see that now . I should n't have doubted your word when I 'd never known you to tell a story . Of course , it was n't right for you to confess to a thing you had n't done -- it was very wrong to do so . But I drove you to it . So if you 'll forgive me , Anne , I 'll forgive you and we 'll start square again . And now get yourself ready for the picnic . "
41394	41405	41146	41146	Marilla	113	" Oh , Marilla , is n't it too late ? "
41406	41485	41146	41146	Marilla	113	" No , it 's only two o'clock . They wo n't be more than well gathered yet and it 'll be an hour before they have tea . Wash your face and comb your hair and put on your gingham . I 'll fill a basket for you . There 's plenty of stuff baked in the house . And I 'll get Jerry to hitch up the sorrel and drive you down to the picnic ground . "
41486	41491	41493	41493	Anne	124	" Oh , Marilla , "
41500	41527	41493	41493	Anne	124	" Five minutes ago I was so miserable I was wishing I 'd never been born and now I would n't change places with an angel ! "
41552	41719	41146	41146	Marilla	113	" Oh , Marilla , I 've had a perfectly scrumptious time . Scrumptious is a new word I learned today . I heard Mary Alice Bell use it . Is n't it very expressive ? Everything was lovely . We had a splendid tea and then Mr. Harmon Andrews took us all for a row on the Lake of Shining Waters -- six of us at a time . And Jane Andrews nearly fell overboard . She was leaning out to pick water lilies and if Mr. Andrews had n't caught her by her sash just in the nick of time she 'd fallen in and prob'ly been drowned . I wish it had been me . It would have been such a romantic experience to have been nearly drowned . It would be such a thrilling tale to tell . And we had the ice cream . Words fail me to describe that ice cream . Marilla , I assure you it was sublime . "
41734	41747	41748	41748	she	113	" I 'm willing to own up that I made a mistake , "
41752	41850	41748	41748	she	113	" but I 've learned a lesson . I have to laugh when I think of Anne 's ? confession , ' although I suppose I should n't for it really was a falsehood . But it does n't seem as bad as the other would have been , somehow , and anyhow I 'm responsible for it . That child is hard to understand in some respects . But I believe she 'll turn out all right yet . And there 's one thing certain , no house will ever be dull that she 's in . "
41860	41866	41868	41868	Anne	124	" WHAT a splendid day ! "
41875	41941	41868	41868	Anne	124	" Is n't it good just to be alive on a day like this ? I pity the people who are n't born yet for missing it . They may have good days , of course , but they can never have this one . And it 's splendider still to have such a lovely way to go to school by , is n't it ? "
41942	41962	41964	41964	Diana	120	" It 's a lot nicer than going round by the road ; that is so dusty and hot , "
42036	42039	42040	42044	the girl who did it	838	" awful mean "
42200	42209	42210	42210	she	124	" Not that lovers ever really walk there , "
42215	42290	42210	42210	she	124	" but Diana and I are reading a perfectly magnificent book and there 's a Lover 's Lane in it . So we want to have one , too . And it 's a very pretty name , do n't you think ? So romantic ! We ca n't imagine the lovers into it , you know . I like that lane because you can think out loud there without people calling you crazy . "
42331	42337	42339	42339	Anne	124	maples--"maples are such sociable trees , "
42341	42349	42350	42350	they	791	" they 're always rustling and whispering to you"--until
42395	42405	42406	42406	Anne	124	" Of course there are no violets there now , "
42410	42535	42406	42406	Anne	124	" but Diana says there are millions of them in spring . Oh , Marilla , ca n't you just imagine you see them ? It actually takes away my breath . I named it Violet Vale . Diana says she never saw the beat of me for hitting on fancy names for places . It 's nice to be clever at something , is n't it ? But Diana named the Birch Path . She wanted to , so I let her ; but I 'm sure I could have found something more poetical than plain Birch Path . Anybody can think of a name like that . But the Birch Path is one of the prettiest places in the world , Marilla . "
42882	42893	42894	42894	she	124	" I think I 'm going to like school here , "
42897	43056	42894	42894	she	124	" I do n't think much of the master , through . He 's all the time curling his mustache and making eyes at Prissy Andrews . Prissy is grown up , you know . She 's sixteen and she 's studying for the entrance examination into Queen 's Academy at Charlottetown next year . Tillie Boulter says the master is _ dead gone _ on her . She 's got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair and she does it up so elegantly . She sits in the long seat at the back and he sits there , too , most of the time -- to explain her lessons , he says . But Ruby Gillis says she saw him writing something on her slate and when Prissy read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled ; and Ruby Gillis says she does n't believe it had anything to do with the lesson . "
43057	43076	43078	43078	Marilla	113	" Anne Shirley , do n't let me hear you talking about your teacher in that way again , "
43081	43147	43078	43078	Marilla	113	" You do n't go to school to criticize the master . I guess he can teach _ you _ something , and it 's your business to learn . And I want you to understand right off that you are not to come home telling tales about him . That is something I wo n't encourage . I hope you were a good girl . "
43148	43153	43155	43155	Anne	124	" Indeed I was , "
43158	43500	43155	43155	Anne	124	" It was n't so hard as you might imagine , either . I sit with Diana . Our seat is right by the window and we can look down to the Lake of Shining Waters . There are a lot of nice girls in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime . It 's so nice to have a lot of little girls to play with . But of course I like Diana best and always will . I _ adore _ Diana . I 'm dreadfully far behind the others . They 're all in the fifth book and I 'm only in the fourth . I feel that it 's kind of a disgrace . But there 's not one of them has such an imagination as I have and I soon found that out . We had reading and geography and Canadian history and dictation today . Mr. Phillips said my spelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could see it , all marked over . I felt so mortified , Marilla ; he might have been politer to a stranger , I think . Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and Sophia Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with ? May I see you home ? ' on it . I 'm to give it back to her tomorrow . And Tillie Boulter let me wear her bead ring all the afternoon . Can I have some of those pearl beads off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring ? And oh , Marilla , Jane Andrews told me that Minnie MacPherson told her that she heard Prissy Andrews tell Sara Gillis that I had a very pretty nose . Marilla , that is the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you ca n't imagine what a strange feeling it gave me . Marilla , have I really a pretty nose ? I know you 'll tell me the truth . "
43501	43508	43510	43510	Marilla	113	" Your nose is well enough , "
43576	43587	43589	43589	Diana	120	" I guess Gilbert Blythe will be in school today , "
43591	43636	43589	43589	Diana	120	" He 's been visiting his cousins over in New Brunswick all summer and he only came home Saturday night . He 's _ aw'fly _ handsome , Anne . And he teases the girls something terrible . He just torments our lives out . "
43653	43657	43659	43659	Anne	124	" Gilbert Blythe ? "
43661	43688	43659	43659	Anne	124	" Is n't his name that 's written up on the porch wall with Julia Bell 's and a big ? Take Notice ' over them ? "
43689	43692	43694	43694	Diana	120	" Yes , "
43700	43729	43694	43694	Diana	120	" but I 'm sure he does n't like Julia Bell so very much . I 've heard him say he studied the multiplication table by her freckles . "
43730	43741	43743	43743	Anne	124	" Oh , do n't speak about freckles to me , "
43745	43803	43804	43804	she	124	" It is n't delicate when I 've got so many . But I do think that writing take - notices up on the wall about the boys and girls is the silliest ever . I should just like to see anybody dare to write my name up with a boy 's . Not , of course , "
43809	43814	43804	43804	she	124	" that anybody would . "
43843	43846	43848	43848	Diana	120	" Nonsense , "
43882	43947	43867	43867	her	120	" It 's only meant as a joke . And do n't you be too sure your name wo n't ever be written up . Charlie Sloane is _ dead gone _ on you . He told his mother -- his _ mother _ , mind you -- that you were the smartest girl in school . That 's better than being good looking . "
43948	43955	43957	43957	Anne	124	" No , it is n't , "
43964	44022	43957	43957	Anne	124	" I 'd rather be pretty than clever . And I hate Charlie Sloane , I ca n't bear a boy with goggle eyes . If anyone wrote my name up with his I 'd never _ get _ over it , Diana Barry . But it _ is _ nice to keep head of your class . "
44023	44034	44036	44036	Diana	120	" You 'll have Gilbert in your class after this , "
44038	44125	44036	44036	Diana	120	" and he 's used to being head of his class , I can tell you . He 's only in the fourth book although he 's nearly fourteen . Four years ago his father was sick and had to go out to Alberta for his health and Gilbert went with him . They were there three years and Gil did n't go to school hardly any until they came back . You wo n't find it so easy to keep head after this , Anne . "
44126	44131	44133	44133	Anne	124	" I 'm glad , "
44136	44223	44133	44133	Anne	124	" I could n't really feel proud of keeping head of little boys and girls of just nine or ten . I got up yesterday spelling ? ebullition . ' Josie Pye was head and , mind you , she peeped in her book . Mr. Phillips did n't see her -- he was looking at Prissy Andrews -- but I did . I just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all . "
44224	44233	44235	44235	Diana	120	" Those Pye girls are cheats all round , "
44248	44278	44235	44235	Diana	120	" Gertie Pye actually went and put her milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday . Did you ever ? I do n't speak to her now . "
44300	44330	44295	44295	Diana	120	" That 's Gilbert Blythe sitting right across the aisle from you , Anne . Just look at him and see if you do n't think he 's handsome . "
44487	44498	44500	44500	Anne	124	" I think your Gilbert Blythe _ is _ handsome , "
44504	44525	44500	44500	Anne	124	" but I think he 's very bold . It is n't good manners to wink at a strange girl . "
44769	44774	44779	44779	him	140	" Carrots ! Carrots ! "
44824	44831	44832	44832	she	124	" You mean , hateful boy ! "
44836	44841	44832	44832	she	124	" How dare you ! "
44884	44886	44882	44882	Everybody	2130	" Oh "
44944	44953	44954	44954	he	169	" Anne Shirley , what does this mean ? "
44986	44989	44990	44990	Gilbert	903	" carrots . "
44998	45010	44990	44990	Gilbert	903	" It was my fault Mr. Phillips . I teased her . "
45019	45039	45040	45040	he	169	" I am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such a vindictive spirit , "
45073	45094	45040	45040	he	169	" Anne , go and stand on the platform in front of the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon . "
45140	45158	45125	45126	Mr. Phillips	169	" Ann Shirley has a very bad temper . Ann Shirley must learn to control her temper , "
45310	45324	45325	45325	he	140	" I 'm awfully sorry I made fun of your hair , Anne , "
45329	45343	45325	45325	he	140	" Honest I am . Do n't be mad for keeps , now . "
45356	45364	45366	45366	Diana	120	" Oh how could you , Anne ? "
45393	45401	45403	45403	Anne	124	" I shall never forgive Gilbert Blythe , "
45406	45429	45403	45403	Anne	124	" And Mr. Phillips spelled my name without an e , too . The iron has entered into my soul , Diana . "
45447	45459	45460	45460	she	120	" You must n't mind Gilbert making fun of your hair , "
45464	45507	45460	45460	she	120	" Why , he makes fun of all the girls . He laughs at mine because it 's so black . He 's called me a crow a dozen times ; and I never heard him apologize for anything before , either . "
45508	45526	45528	45528	Anne	124	" There 's a great deal of difference between being called a crow and being called carrots , "
45532	45545	45528	45528	Anne	124	" Gilbert Blythe has hurt my feelings _ excruciatingly _ , Diana . "
45738	45743	45718	45719	the girls	2852	" pick a chew . "
45792	45797	45781	45782	Jimmy Glover	181	" Master 's coming . "
46022	46048	46049	46049	he	169	" Anne Shirley , since you seem to be so fond of the boys ' company we shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon , "
46053	46067	46049	46049	he	169	" Take those flowers out of your hair and sit with Gilbert Blythe . "
46103	46113	46115	46116	Mr. Phillips	169	" Did you hear what I said , Anne ? "
46119	46124	46126	46126	Anne	124	" Yes , sir , "
46128	46139	46151	46153	all the children	874	" but I did n't suppose you really meant it . "
46140	46145	46151	46153	all the children	874	" I assure you I did"--still
46167	46173	46151	46153	all the children	874	" Obey me at once . "
46247	46268	46245	46245	she	168	" acksually never seen anything like it -- it was so white , with awful little red spots in it . "
46439	46442	46430	46431	Mr. Phillips	169	" To Priscilla "
46485	46490	46468	46468	Gilbert	140	" You are sweet , "
46583	46596	46597	46597	Diana	120	" What are you taking all those things home for , Anne ? "
46622	46633	46635	46635	Anne	124	" I am not coming back to school any more , "
46650	46658	46659	46659	she	120	" Will Marilla let you stay home ? "
46662	46668	46670	46670	Anne	124	" She 'll have to , "
46672	46686	46670	46670	Anne	124	" I 'll _ never _ go to school to that man again . "
46687	46692	46693	46693	Diana	120	" Oh , Anne ! "
46703	46744	46693	46693	Diana	120	" I do think you 're mean . What shall I do ? Mr. Phillips will make me sit with that horrid Gertie Pye -- I know he will because she is sitting alone . Do come back , Anne . "
46745	46759	46761	46761	Anne	124	" I 'd do almost anything in the world for you , Diana , "
46764	46803	46761	46761	Anne	124	" I 'd let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good . But I ca n't do this , so please do n't ask it . You harrow up my very soul . "
46804	46815	46817	46817	Diana	120	" Just think of all the fun you will miss , "
46819	46920	46817	46817	Diana	120	" We are going to build the loveliest new house down by the brook ; and we 'll be playing ball next week and you 've never played ball , Anne . It 's tremendously exciting . And we 're going to learn a new song -- Jane Andrews is practicing it up now ; and Alice Andrews is going to bring a new Pansy book next week and we 're all going to read it out loud , chapter about , down by the brook . And you know you are so fond of reading out loud , Anne . "
46954	46957	46959	46959	Marilla	113	" Nonsense , "
46961	46969	46971	46971	Anne	124	" It is n't nonsense at all , "
46982	46995	46971	46971	Anne	124	" Do n't you understand , Marilla ? I 've been insulted . "
46996	47009	46950	46950	she	124	" Insulted fiddlesticks ! You 'll go to school tomorrow as usual . "
47010	47015	47016	47016	Anne	124	" Oh , no . "
47022	47075	47016	47016	Anne	124	" I 'm not going back , Marilla . I 'll learn my lessons at home and I 'll be as good as I can be and hold my tongue all the time if it 's possible at all . But I will not go back to school , I assure you . "
47115	47128	47129	47129	she	113	" I 'll run down and see Rachel about it this evening , "
47132	47235	47129	47129	she	113	" There 's no use reasoning with Anne now . She 's too worked up and I 've an idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion . Far as I can make out from her story , Mr. Phillips has been carrying matters with a rather high hand . But it would never do to say so to her . I 'll just talk it over with Rachel . She 's sent ten children to school and she ought to know something about it . She 'll have heard the whole story , too , by this time . "
47249	47260	47261	47261	she	113	" I suppose you know what I 've come about , "
47272	47283	47284	47284	she	105	" About Anne 's fuss in school , I reckon , "
47287	47304	47284	47284	she	105	" Tillie Boulter was in on her way home from school and told me about it . "
47305	47316	47318	47318	Marilla	113	" I do n't know what to do with her , "
47320	47375	47318	47318	Marilla	113	" She declares she wo n't go back to school . I never saw a child so worked up . I 've been expecting trouble ever since she started to school . I knew things were going too smooth to last . She 's so high strung . What would you advise , Rachel ? "
47376	47388	47390	47391	Mrs. Lynde	105	" Well , since you 've asked my advice , Marilla , "
47402	47549	47394	47395	Mrs. Lynde	105	advice--"I'd just humor her a little at first , that 's what I 'd do . It 's my belief that Mr. Phillips was in the wrong . Of course , it does n't do to say so to the children , you know . And of course he did right to punish her yesterday for giving way to temper . But today it was different . The others who were late should have been punished as well as Anne , that 's what . And I do n't believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment . It is n't modest . Tillie Boulter was real indignant . She took Anne 's part right through and said all the scholars did too . Anne seems real popular among them , somehow . I never thought she 'd take with them so well . "
47550	47563	47565	47565	Marilla	113	" Then you really think I 'd better let her stay home , "
47569	47778	47394	47395	Mrs. Lynde	105	" Yes . That is I would n't say school to her again until she said it herself . Depend upon it , Marilla , she 'll cool off in a week or so and be ready enough to go back of her own accord , that 's what , while , if you were to make her go back right off , dear knows what freak or tantrum she 'd take next and make more trouble than ever . The less fuss made the better , in my opinion . She wo n't miss much by not going to school , as far as _ that _ goes . Mr. Phillips is n't any good at all as a teacher . The order he keeps is scandalous , that 's what , and he neglects the young fry and puts all his time on those big scholars he 's getting ready for Queen 's . He 'd never have got the school for another year if his uncle had n't been a trustee--_the _ trustee , for he just leads the other two around by the nose , that 's what . I declare , I do n't know what education in this Island is coming to . "
47980	47989	47990	47990	she	113	" Whatever 's the matter now , Anne ? "
47993	47999	48001	48001	Anne	124	" It 's about Diana , "
48004	48128	48130	48130	Anne	124	" I love Diana so , Marilla . I can not ever live without her . But I know very well when we grow up that Diana will get married and go away and leave me . And oh , what shall I do ? I hate her husband -- I just hate him furiously . I 've been imagining it all out -- the wedding and everything -- Diana dressed in snowy garments , with a veil , and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen ; and me the bridesmaid , with a lovely dress too , and puffed sleeves , but with a breaking heart hid beneath my smiling face . And then bidding Diana goodbye - e - e-- "
48195	48201	48203	48203	Marilla	113	" Well , Anne Shirley , "
48211	48238	48203	48203	Marilla	113	" if you must borrow trouble , for pity 's sake borrow it handier home . I should think you had an imagination , sure enough . "
48317	48322	48323	48323	she	124	" Oh , Marilla , "
48340	48399	48323	48323	she	124	" I 'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers . It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November , would n't it ? Look at these maple branches . Do n't they give you a thrill -- several thrills ? I 'm going to decorate my room with them . "
48400	48404	48406	48406	Marilla	113	" Messy things , "
48416	48442	48406	48406	Marilla	113	" You clutter up your room entirely too much with out - of - doors stuff , Anne . Bedrooms were made to sleep in . "
48443	48490	48323	48323	she	124	" Oh , and dream in too , Marilla . And you know one can dream so much better in a room where there are pretty things . I 'm going to put these boughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table . "
48491	48567	48406	48406	Marilla	113	" Mind you do n't drop leaves all over the stairs then . I 'm going on a meeting of the Aid Society at Carmody this afternoon , Anne , and I wo n't likely be home before dark . You 'll have to get Matthew and Jerry their supper , so mind you do n't forget to put the tea to draw until you sit down at the table as you did last time . "
48568	48577	48579	48579	Anne	124	" It was dreadful of me to forget , "
48582	48696	48579	48579	Anne	124	" but that was the afternoon I was trying to think of a name for Violet Vale and it crowded other things out . Matthew was so good . He never scolded a bit . He put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as not . And I told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting , so he did n't find the time long at all . It was a beautiful fairy story , Marilla . I forgot the end of it , so I made up an end for it myself and Matthew said he could n't tell where the join came in . "
48697	48776	48406	48406	Marilla	113	" Matthew would think it all right , Anne , if you took a notion to get up and have dinner in the middle of the night . But you keep your wits about you this time . And -- I do n't really know if I 'm doing right -- it may make you more addlepated than ever -- but you can ask Diana to come over and spend the afternoon with you and have tea here . "
48777	48782	48783	48783	Anne	124	" Oh , Marilla ! "
48788	48858	48783	48783	Anne	124	" How perfectly lovely ! You _ are _ able to imagine things after all or else you 'd never have understood how I 've longed for that very thing . It will seem so nice and grown - uppish . No fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when I have company . Oh , Marilla , can I use the rosebud spray tea set ? "
48859	48943	48406	48406	Marilla	113	" No , indeed ! The rosebud tea set ! Well , what next ? You know I never use that except for the minister or the Aids . You 'll put down the old brown tea set . But you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves . It 's time it was being used anyhow -- I believe it 's beginning to work . And you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and snaps . "
48944	48964	48966	48966	Anne	124	" I can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and pouring out the tea , "
48973	49059	48966	48966	Anne	124	" And asking Diana if she takes sugar ! I know she does n't but of course I 'll ask her just as if I did n't know . And then pressing her to take another piece of fruit cake and another helping of preserves . Oh , Marilla , it 's a wonderful sensation just to think of it . Can I take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes ? And then into the parlor to sit ? "
49060	49152	48406	48406	Marilla	113	" No . The sitting room will do for you and your company . But there 's a bottle half full of raspberry cordial that was left over from the church social the other night . It 's on the second shelf of the sitting - room closet and you and Diana can have it if you like , and a cooky to eat with it along in the afternoon , for I daresay Matthew ? ll be late coming in to tea since he 's hauling potatoes to the vessel . "
49310	49316	49318	49318	Anne	124	" How is your mother ? "
49340	49368	49370	49370	Diana	120	" She is very well , thank you . I suppose Mr. Cuthbert is hauling potatoes to the _ lily sands _ this afternoon , is he ? "
49388	49410	49324	49324	she	124	" Yes . Our potato crop is very good this year . I hope your father 's crop is good too . "
49411	49429	49324	49324	she	124	" It is fairly good , thank you . Have you picked many of your apples yet ? "
49430	49437	49439	49439	Anne	124	" Oh , ever so many , "
49449	49571	49439	49439	Anne	124	" Let 's go out to the orchard and get some of the Red Sweetings , Diana . Marilla says we can have all that are left on the tree . Marilla is a very generous woman . She said we could have fruit cake and cherry preserves for tea . But it is n't good manners to tell your company what you are going to give them to eat , so I wo n't tell you what she said we could have to drink . Only it begins with an R and a C and it 's bright red color . I love bright red drinks , do n't you ? They taste twice as good as any other color . "
49766	49768	49769	49770	Mr. Phillips	169	" sassed "
49951	49960	49961	49961	she	124	" Now , please help yourself , Diana , "
49965	49991	49961	49961	she	124	" I do n't believe I 'll have any just now . I do n't feel as if I wanted any after all those apples . "
50014	50024	50025	50025	she	120	" That 's awfully nice raspberry cordial , Anne , "
50028	50039	50025	50025	she	120	" I did n't know raspberry cordial was so nice . "
50040	50088	49994	49994	herself	120	" I 'm real glad you like it . Take as much as you want . I 'm going to run out and stir the fire up . There are so many responsibilities on a person 's mind when they 're keeping house , is n't there ? "
50139	50146	50148	50148	Diana	120	" The nicest I ever drank , "
50150	50179	50148	50148	Diana	120	" It 's ever so much nicer than Mrs. Lynde 's , although she brags of hers so much . It does n't taste a bit like hers . "
50180	50198	50200	50200	Anne	124	" I should think Marilla 's raspberry cordial would prob'ly be much nicer than Mrs. Lynde 's , "
50203	50961	50200	50200	Anne	124	" Marilla is a famous cook . She is trying to teach me to cook but I assure you , Diana , it is uphill work . There 's so little scope for imagination in cookery . You just have to go by rules . The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in . I was thinking the loveliest story about you and me , Diana . I thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you , but I went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life ; and then I took the smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears ; and you never , never forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed her life for you . Oh , it was such a pathetic tale , Diana . The tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake . But I forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure . Flour is so essential to cakes , you know . Marilla was very cross and I do n't wonder . I 'm a great trial to her . She was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week . We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over . Marilla said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it . I meant to cover it just as much as could be , Diana , but when I carried it in I was imagining I was a nun -- of course I 'm a Protestant but I imagined I was a Catholic -- taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion ; and I forgot all about covering the pudding sauce . I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry . Diana , fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce ! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters . Marilla was out milking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if I 'd give the sauce to the pigs ; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow , whichever they wanted to be , so I never thought about the pudding sauce again and Marilla sent me out to pick apples . Well , Mr. and Mrs. Chester Ross from Spencervale came here that morning . You know they are very stylish people , especially Mrs. Chester Ross . When Marilla called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table . I tried to be as polite and dignified as I could be , for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to think I was a ladylike little girl even if I was n't pretty . Everything went right until I saw Marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce _ warmed up _ , in the other . Diana , that was a terrible moment . I remembered everything and I just stood up in my place and shrieked out ? Marilla , you must n't use that pudding sauce . There was a mouse drowned in it . I forgot to tell you before . ' Oh , Diana , I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred . Mrs. Chester Ross just _ looked _ at me and I thought I would sink through the floor with mortification . She is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she must have thought of us . Marilla turned red as fire but she never said a word -- then . She just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves . She even offered me some , but I could n't swallow a mouthful . It was like heaping coals of fire on my head . After Mrs. Chester Ross went away , Marilla gave me a dreadful scolding . Why , Diana , what is the matter ? "
50982	50989	50990	50990	she	120	" I'm -- I'm awful sick , "
50997	51007	50990	50990	she	120	" I -- I -- must go right home . "
51008	51022	51024	51024	Anne	124	" Oh , you must n't dream of going home without your tea , "
51028	51047	51024	51024	Anne	124	" I 'll get it right off -- I'll go and put the tea down this very minute . "
51048	51054	51056	51056	Diana	120	" I must go home , "
51062	51071	51073	51073	Anne	124	" Let me get you a lunch anyhow , "
51075	51113	51073	51073	Anne	124	" Let me give you a bit of fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves . Lie down on the sofa for a little while and you 'll be better . Where do you feel bad ? "
51114	51120	51122	51122	Diana	120	" I must go home , "
51137	51148	51149	51149	she	124	" I never heard of company going home without tea , "
51152	51210	51149	51149	she	124	" Oh , Diana , do you suppose that it 's possible you 're really taking the smallpox ? If you are I 'll go and nurse you , you can depend on that . I 'll never forsake you . But I do wish you 'd stay till after tea . Where do you feel bad ? "
51211	51217	51219	51219	Diana	120	" I 'm awful dizzy , "
51377	51386	51388	51388	Marilla	113	" Whatever has gone wrong now , Anne ? "
51394	51410	51388	51388	Marilla	113	" I do hope you have n't gone and been saucy to Mrs. Lynde again . "
51422	51453	51388	51388	Marilla	113	" Anne Shirley , when I ask you a question I want to be answered . Sit right up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about . "
51461	51480	51481	51481	she	124	" Mrs. Lynde was up to see Mrs. Barry today and Mrs. Barry was in an awful state , "
51484	51543	51481	51481	she	124	" She says that I set Diana _ drunk _ Saturday and sent her home in a disgraceful condition . And she says I must be a thoroughly bad , wicked little girl and she 's never , never going to let Diana play with me again . Oh , Marilla , I 'm just overcome with woe . "
51550	51555	51556	51556	she	113	" Set Diana drunk ! "
51564	51581	51556	51556	she	113	" Anne are you or Mrs. Barry crazy ? What on earth did you give her ? "
51582	51590	51592	51592	Anne	124	" Not a thing but raspberry cordial , "
51594	51643	51592	51592	Anne	124	" I never thought raspberry cordial would set people drunk , Marilla -- not even if they drank three big tumblerfuls as Diana did . Oh , it sounds so -- so -- like Mrs. Thomas 's husband ! But I did n't mean to set her drunk . "
51644	51648	51650	51650	Marilla	113	" Drunk fiddlesticks ! "
51764	51797	51718	51718	she	113	" Anne , you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble . You went and gave Diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial . Did n't you know the difference yourself ? "
51798	51804	51806	51806	Anne	124	" I never tasted it , "
51808	51909	51806	51806	Anne	124	" I thought it was the cordial . I meant to be so -- so -- hospitable . Diana got awfully sick and had to go home . Mrs. Barry told Mrs. Lynde she was simply dead drunk . She just laughed silly - like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to sleep and slept for hours . Her mother smelled her breath and knew she was drunk . She had a fearful headache all day yesterday . Mrs. Barry is so indignant . She will never believe but what I did it on purpose . "
51910	51931	51933	51933	Marilla	113	" I should think she would better punish Diana for being so greedy as to drink three glassfuls of anything , "
51936	52036	51933	51933	Marilla	113	" Why , three of those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been cordial . Well , this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are so down on me for making currant wine , although I have n't made any for three years ever since I found out that the minister did n't approve . I just kept that bottle for sickness . There , there , child , do n't cry . I ca n't see as you were to blame although I 'm sorry it happened so . "
52037	52042	52044	52044	Anne	124	" I must cry , "
52046	52088	52044	52044	Anne	124	" My heart is broken . The stars in their courses fight against me , Marilla . Diana and I are parted forever . Oh , Marilla , I little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of friendship . "
52089	52145	51933	51933	Marilla	113	" Do n't be foolish , Anne . Mrs. Barry will think better of it when she finds you 're not to blame . I suppose she thinks you 've done it for a silly joke or something of that sort . You 'd best go up this evening and tell her how it was . "
52146	52161	52163	52163	Anne	124	" My courage fails me at the thought of facing Diana 's injured mother , "
52165	52195	52163	52163	Anne	124	" I wish you 'd go , Marilla . You 're so much more dignified than I am . Likely she 'd listen to you quicker than to me . "
52196	52202	52204	52204	Marilla	113	" Well , I will , "
52216	52231	52204	52204	Marilla	113	" Do n't cry any more , Anne . It will be all right . "
52268	52285	52286	52286	she	124	" Oh , Marilla , I know by your face that it 's been no use , "
52290	52298	52286	52286	she	124	" Mrs. Barry wo n't forgive me ? "
52299	52304	52306	52306	Marilla	113	" Mrs. Barry indeed ! "
52308	52415	52306	52306	Marilla	113	" Of all the unreasonable women I ever saw she 's the worst . I told her it was all a mistake and you were n't to blame , but she just simply did n't believe me . And she rubbed it well in about my currant wine and how I 'd always said it could n't have the least effect on anybody . I just told her plainly that currant wine was n't meant to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a time and that if a child I had to do with was so greedy I 'd sober her up with a right good spanking . "
52586	52592	52593	52593	she	118	" What do you want ? "
52602	52714	52593	52593	she	118	" Oh , Mrs. Barry , please forgive me . I did not mean to -- to -- intoxicate Diana . How could I ? Just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all the world . Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose ? I thought it was only raspberry cordial . I was firmly convinced it was raspberry cordial . Oh , please do n't say that you wo n't let Diana play with me any more . If you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe . "
52773	52799	52766	52766	she	118	" I do n't think you are a fit little girl for Diana to associate with . You 'd better go home and behave yourself . "
52805	52819	52820	52820	she	118	" Wo n't you let me see Diana just once to say farewell ? "
52823	52834	52836	52837	Mrs. Barry	118	" Diana has gone over to Carmody with her father , "
52856	52863	52864	52864	she	124	" My last hope is gone , "
52868	52945	52864	52864	she	124	" I went up and saw Mrs. Barry myself and she treated me very insultingly . Marilla , I do _ not _ think she is a well - bred woman . There is nothing more to do except to pray and I have n't much hope that that 'll do much good because , Marilla , I do not believe that God Himself can do very much with such an obstinate person as Mrs. Barry . "
52946	52955	52957	52957	Marilla	113	" Anne , you should n't say such things "
53029	53034	53035	53035	she	113	" Poor little soul , "
53141	53148	53149	53149	she	124	" Your mother has n't relented ? "
53158	53238	53154	53154	her	120	" No ; and oh , Anne , she says I 'm never to play with you again . I 've cried and cried and I told her it was n't your fault , but it was n't any use . I had ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good - bye to you . She said I was only to stay ten minutes and she 's timing me by the clock . "
53239	53253	53255	53255	Anne	124	" Ten minutes is n't very long to say an eternal farewell in , "
53258	53287	53255	53255	Anne	124	" Oh , Diana , will you promise faithfully never to forget me , the friend of your youth , no matter what dearer friends may caress thee ? "
53288	53293	53295	53295	Diana	120	" Indeed I will , "
53297	53324	53295	53295	Diana	120	" and I 'll never have another bosom friend -- I do n't want to have . I could n't love anybody as I love you . "
53325	53330	53332	53332	Anne	124	" Oh , Diana , "
53338	53346	53332	53332	Anne	124	" do you _ love _ me ? "
53347	53361	53295	53295	Diana	120	" Why , of course I do . Did n't you know that ? "
53362	53365	53366	53366	Anne	124	" No . "
53372	53451	53366	53366	Anne	124	" I thought you _ liked _ me of course but I never hoped you _ loved _ me . Why , Diana , I did n't think anybody could love me . Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember . Oh , this is wonderful ! It 's a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness of a path severed from thee , Diana . Oh , just say it once again . "
53452	53460	53462	53462	Diana	120	" I love you devotedly , Anne , "
53465	53478	53462	53462	Diana	120	" and I always will , you may be sure of that . "
53479	53489	53491	53491	Anne	124	" And I will always love thee , Diana , "
53498	53545	53491	53491	Anne	124	" In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my lonely life , as that last story we read together says . Diana , wilt thou give me a lock of thy jet - black tresses in parting to treasure forevermore ? "
53546	53556	53558	53558	Diana	120	" Have you got anything to cut it with ? "
53580	53595	53597	53597	Anne	124	" Yes . I 've got my patchwork scissors in my apron pocket fortunately , "
53608	53639	53599	53599	She	124	" Fare thee well , my beloved friend . Henceforth we must be as strangers though living side by side . But my heart will ever be faithful to thee . "
53683	53689	53690	53690	she	124	" It is all over , "
53694	53885	53690	53690	she	124	" I shall never have another friend . I 'm really worse off than ever before , for I have n't Katie Maurice and Violetta now . And even if I had it would n't be the same . Somehow , little dream girls are not satisfying after a real friend . Diana and I had such an affecting farewell down by the spring . It will be sacred in my memory forever . I used the most pathetic language I could think of and said ? thou ' and ? thee . ' ? Thou ' and ? thee ' seem so much more romantic than ? you . ' Diana gave me a lock of her hair and I 'm going to sew it up in a little bag and wear it around my neck all my life . Please see that it is buried with me , for I do n't believe I 'll live very long . Perhaps when she sees me lying cold and dead before her Mrs. Barry may feel remorse for what she has done and will let Diana come to my funeral . "
53886	53909	53911	53911	Marilla	113	" I do n't think there is much fear of your dying of grief as long as you can talk , Anne , "
53947	53955	53956	53956	she	124	" I 'm going back to school , "
53959	53995	53956	53956	she	124	" That is all there is left in life for me , now that my friend has been ruthlessly torn from me . In school I can look at her and muse over days departed . "
53996	54007	54009	54009	Marilla	113	" You 'd better muse over your lessons and sums , "
54021	54059	54009	54009	Marilla	113	" If you 're going back to school I hope we 'll hear no more of breaking slates over people 's heads and such carryings on . Behave yourself and do just what your teacher tells you . "
54060	54070	54072	54072	Anne	124	" I 'll try to be a model pupil , "
54075	54170	54072	54072	Anne	124	" There wo n't be much fun in it , I expect . Mr. Phillips said Minnie Andrews was a model pupil and there is n't a spark of imagination or life in her . She is just dull and poky and never seems to have a good time . But I feel so depressed that perhaps it will come easy to me now . I 'm going round by the road . I could n't bear to go by the Birch Path all alone . I should weep bitter tears if I did . "
54329	54338	54340	54340	Anne	124	" It 's so nice to be appreciated , "
54355	54357	54340	54340	Anne	124	" appreciated "
54393	54397	54385	54385	she	124	" strawberry apple . "
54632	54645	54646	54646	she	124	" Diana might just have smiled at me once , I think , "
54941	54943	54951	54951	she	124	" model "
55313	55315	55333	55333	Waterloo	202	" the branches"--by
55335	55344	55345	55345	she	124	" It 's perfectly awful stuff , Marilla , "
55348	55412	55345	55345	she	124	" I 'm sure I 'll never be able to make head or tail of it . There is no scope for imagination in it at all . Mr. Phillips says I 'm the worst dunce he ever saw at it . And Gil -- I mean some of the others are so smart at it . It is extremely mortifying , Marilla . "
55413	55484	55333	55333	Waterloo	202	" Even Diana gets along better than I do . But I do n't mind being beaten by Diana . Even although we meet as strangers now I still love her with an _ inextinguishable _ love . It makes me very sad at times to think about her . But really , Marilla , one ca n't stay sad very long in such an interesting world , can one ? "
55895	55909	55880	55880	her	124	" Matthew , did you ever study geometry when you went to school ? "
55910	55920	55922	55922	Matthew	107	" Well now , no , I did n't , "
55933	55939	55941	55941	Anne	124	" I wish you had , "
55943	55987	55941	55941	Anne	124	" because then you 'd be able to sympathize with me . You ca n't sympathize properly if you 've never studied it . It is casting a cloud over my whole life . I 'm such a dunce at it , Matthew . "
55988	55995	55997	55997	Matthew	107	" Well now , I dunno , "
56000	56071	55997	55997	Matthew	107	" I guess you 're all right at anything . Mr. Phillips told me last week in Blair 's store at Carmody that you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid progress . ? Rapid progress ' was his very words . There 's them as runs down Teddy Phillips and says he ai n't much of a teacher , but I guess he 's all right . "
56081	56085	56072	56072	Matthew	107	" all right . "
56086	56106	56108	56108	Anne	124	" I 'm sure I 'd get on better with geometry if only he would n't change the letters , "
56110	56246	56108	56108	Anne	124	" I learn the proposition off by heart and then he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what are in the book and I get all mixed up . I do n't think a teacher should take such a mean advantage , do you ? We 're studying agriculture now and I 've found out at last what makes the roads red . It 's a great comfort . I wonder how Marilla and Mrs. Lynde are enjoying themselves . Mrs. Lynde says Canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run at Ottawa and that it 's an awful warning to the electors . She says if women were allowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change . What way do you vote , Matthew ? "
56247	56250	56252	56252	Matthew	107	" Conservative , "
56265	56272	56274	56274	Anne	124	" Then I 'm Conservative too , "
56277	56344	56274	56274	Anne	124	" I 'm glad because Gil -- because some of the boys in school are Grits . I guess Mr. Phillips is a Grit too because Prissy Andrews 's father is one , and Ruby Gillis says that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girl 's mother in religion and her father in politics . Is that true , Matthew ? "
56345	56352	56354	56354	Matthew	107	" Well now , I dunno , "
56356	56365	56274	56274	Anne	124	" Did you ever go courting , Matthew ? "
56366	56379	56381	56381	Matthew	107	" Well now , no , I dunno 's I ever did , "
56406	56583	56274	56274	Anne	124	" It must be rather interesting , do n't you think , Matthew ? Ruby Gillis says when she grows up she 's going to have ever so many beaus on the string and have them all crazy about her ; but I think that would be too exciting . I 'd rather have just one in his right mind . But Ruby Gillis knows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big sisters , and Mrs. Lynde says the Gillis girls have gone off like hot cakes . Mr. Phillips goes up to see Prissy Andrews nearly every evening . He says it is to help her with her lessons but Miranda Sloane is studying for Queen 's too , and I should think she needed help a lot more than Prissy because she 's ever so much stupider , but he never goes to help her in the evenings at all . There are a great many things in this world that I ca n't understand very well , Matthew . "
56584	56597	56599	56599	Matthew	107	" Well now , I dunno as I comprehend them all myself , "
56601	56780	56274	56274	Anne	124	" Well , I suppose I must finish up my lessons . I wo n't allow myself to open that new book Jane lent me until I 'm through . But it 's a terrible temptation , Matthew . Even when I turn my back on it I can see it there just as plain . Jane said she cried herself sick over it . I love a book that makes me cry . But I think I 'll carry that book into the sitting room and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key . And you must _ not _ give it to me , Matthew , until my lessons are done , not even if I implore you on my bended knees . It 's all very well to say resist temptation , but it 's ever so much easier to resist it if you ca n't get the key . And then shall I run down the cellar and get some russets , Matthew ? Would n't you like some russets ? "
56781	56792	56794	56794	Matthew	107	" Well now , I dunno but what I would , "
56923	56931	56933	56933	Anne	124	" Whatever is the matter , Diana ? "
56935	56943	56933	56933	Anne	124	" Has your mother relented at last ? "
56944	56953	56955	56955	Diana	120	" Oh , Anne , do come quick , "
56958	57019	56955	56955	Diana	120	" Minnie May is awful sick -- she 's got croup . Young Mary Joe says -- and Father and Mother are away to town and there 's nobody to go for the doctor . Minnie May is awful bad and Young Mary Joe does n't know what to do -- and oh , Anne , I 'm so scared ! "
57045	57062	57064	57064	Anne	124	" He 's gone to harness the sorrel mare to go to Carmody for the doctor , "
57074	57104	57064	57064	Anne	124	" I know it as well as if he 'd said so . Matthew and I are such kindred spirits I can read his thoughts without words at all . "
57105	57118	57120	57120	Diana	120	" I do n't believe he 'll find the doctor at Carmody , "
57122	57158	57120	57120	Diana	120	" I know that Dr. Blair went to town and I guess Dr. Spencer would go too . Young Mary Joe never saw anybody with croup and Mrs. Lynde is away . Oh , Anne ! "
57159	57166	57168	57168	Anne	124	" Do n't cry , Di , "
57171	57235	57168	57168	Anne	124	" I know exactly what to do for croup . You forget that Mrs. Hammond had twins three times . When you look after three pairs of twins you naturally get a lot of experience . They all had croup regularly . Just wait till I get the ipecac bottle -- you may n't have any at your house . Come on now . "
57474	57605	57465	57465	Anne	124	" Minnie May has croup all right ; she 's pretty bad , but I 've seen them worse . First we must have lots of hot water . I declare , Diana , there is n't more than a cupful in the kettle ! There , I 've filled it up , and , Mary Joe , you may put some wood in the stove . I do n't want to hurt your feelings but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if you 'd any imagination . Now , I 'll undress Minnie May and put her to bed and you try to find some soft flannel cloths , Diana . I 'm going to give her a dose of ipecac first of all . "
57738	57748	57750	57750	Anne	124	" I was awfully near giving up in despair , "
57752	57908	57750	57750	Anne	124	" She got worse and worse until she was sicker than ever the Hammond twins were , even the last pair . I actually thought she was going to choke to death . I gave her every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose went down I said to myself -- not to Diana or Young Mary Joe , because I did n't want to worry them any more than they were worried , but I had to say it to myself just to relieve my feelings--?This is the last lingering hope and I fear , tis a vain one . ' But in about three minutes she coughed up the phlegm and began to get better right away . You must just imagine my relief , doctor , because I ca n't express it in words . You know there are some things that can not be expressed in words . "
57909	57915	57917	57918	the doctor	2016	" Yes , I know , "
57955	58036	57946	57946	he	2016	" That little redheaded girl they have over at Cuthbert 's is as smart as they make ? em . I tell you she saved that baby 's life , for it would have been too late by the time I got there . She seems to have a skill and presence of mind perfectly wonderful in a child of her age . I never saw anything like the eyes of her when she was explaining the case to me . "
58085	58283	57946	57946	he	2016	" Oh , Matthew , is n't it a wonderful morning ? The world looks like something God had just imagined for His own pleasure , does n't it ? Those trees look as if I could blow them away with a breath -- pouf ! I 'm so glad I live in a world where there are white frosts , are n't you ? And I 'm so glad Mrs. Hammond had three pairs of twins after all . If she had n't I might n't have known what to do for Minnie May. I 'm real sorry I was ever cross with Mrs. Hammond for having twins . But , oh , Matthew , I 'm so sleepy . I ca n't go to school . I just know I could n't keep my eyes open and I 'd be so stupid . But I hate to stay home , for Gil -- some of the others will get head of the class , and it 's so hard to get up again -- although of course the harder it is the more satisfaction you have when you do get up , have n't you ? "
58284	58296	58298	58298	Matthew	107	" Well now , I guess you 'll manage all right , "
58315	58335	58298	58298	Matthew	107	" You just go right to bed and have a good sleep . I 'll do all the chores . "
58382	58391	58393	58393	Anne	124	" Oh , did you see the Premier ? "
58397	58405	58393	58393	Anne	124	" What did he look like Marilla ? "
58406	58421	58423	58423	Marilla	113	" Well , he never got to be Premier on account of his looks , "
58425	58566	58423	58423	Marilla	113	" Such a nose as that man had ! But he can speak . I was proud of being a Conservative . Rachel Lynde , of course , being a Liberal , had no use for him . Your dinner is in the oven , Anne , and you can get yourself some blue plum preserve out of the pantry . I guess you 're hungry . Matthew has been telling me about last night . I must say it was fortunate you knew what to do . I would n't have had any idea myself , for I never saw a case of croup . There now , never mind talking till you 've had your dinner . I can tell by the look of you that you 're just full up with speeches , but they 'll keep . "
58623	58749	58620	58620	Marilla	113	" Mrs. Barry was here this afternoon , Anne . She wanted to see you , but I would n't wake you up . She says you saved Minnie May 's life , and she is very sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine . She says she knows now you did n't mean to set Diana drunk , and she hopes you 'll forgive her and be good friends with Diana again . You 're to go over this evening if you like for Diana ca n't stir outside the door on account of a bad cold she caught last night . Now , Anne Shirley , for pity 's sake do n't fly up into the air . "
58783	58826	58767	58767	she	124	" Oh , Marilla , can I go right now -- without washing my dishes ? I 'll wash them when I come back , but I can not tie myself down to anything so unromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment . "
58827	58835	58837	58837	Marilla	113	" Yes , yes , run along , "
58840	58903	58837	58837	Marilla	113	" Anne Shirley -- are you crazy ? Come back this instant and put something on you . I might as well call to the wind . She 's gone without a cap or wrap . Look at her tearing through the orchard with her hair streaming . It 'll be a mercy if she does n't catch her death of cold . "
58991	59003	59004	59004	she	124	" You see before you a perfectly happy person , Marilla , "
59007	59123	59004	59004	she	124	" I 'm perfectly happy -- yes , in spite of my red hair . Just at present I have a soul above red hair . Mrs. Barry kissed me and cried and said she was so sorry and she could never repay me . I felt fearfully embarrassed , Marilla , but I just said as politely as I could , ? I have no hard feelings for you , Mrs. Barry . I assure you once for all that I did not mean to intoxicate Diana and henceforth I shall cover the past with the mantle of oblivion . ' That was a pretty dignified way of speaking was n't it , Marilla ? "
59124	59208	58974	58974	their	1112	" I felt that I was heaping coals of fire on Mrs. Barry 's head . And Diana and I had a lovely afternoon . Diana showed me a new fancy crochet stitch her aunt over at Carmody taught her . Not a soul in Avonlea knows it but us , and we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else . Diana gave me a beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of poetry : "
59209	59226	59004	59004	she	124	" If you love me as I love you Nothing but death can part us two . "
59227	59376	58974	58974	their	1112	" And that is true , Marilla . We 're going to ask Mr. Phillips to let us sit together in school again , and Gertie Pye can go with Minnie Andrews . We had an elegant tea . Mrs. Barry had the very best china set out , Marilla , just as if I was real company . I ca n't tell you what a thrill it gave me . Nobody ever used their very best china on my account before . And we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of preserves , Marilla . And Mrs. Barry asked me if I took tea and said ? Pa , why do n't you pass the biscuits to Anne ? ' It must be lovely to be grown up , Marilla , when just being treated as if you were is so nice . "
59377	59385	59387	59387	Marilla	113	" I do n't know about that , "
59394	59405	59407	59407	Anne	124	" Well , anyway , when I am grown up , "
59410	59599	59407	59407	Anne	124	" I 'm always going to talk to little girls as if they were too , and I 'll never laugh when they use big words . I know from sorrowful experience how that hurts one 's feelings . After tea Diana and I made taffy . The taffy was n't very good , I suppose because neither Diana nor I had ever made any before . Diana left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and I forgot and let it burn ; and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat walked over one plate and that had to be thrown away . But the making of it was splendid fun . Then when I came home Mrs. Barry asked me to come over as often as I could and Diana stood at the window and threw kisses to me all the way down to Lover 's Lane . I assure you , Marilla , that I feel like praying tonight and I 'm going to think out a special brand - new prayer in honor of the occasion . "
59610	59625	59627	59627	Anne	124	" MARILLA , can I go over to see Diana just for a minute ? "
59640	59656	59658	59658	Marilla	113	" I do n't see what you want to be traipsing about after dark for , "
59661	59711	59658	59658	Marilla	113	" You and Diana walked home from school together and then stood down there in the snow for half an hour more , your tongues going the whole blessed time , clickety - clack . So I do n't think you 're very badly off to see her again . "
59712	59720	59722	59722	Anne	124	" But she wants to see me , "
59724	59734	59722	59722	Anne	124	" She has something very important to tell me . "
59735	59743	59658	59658	Marilla	113	" How do you know she has ? "
59744	59802	59722	59722	Anne	124	" Because she just signaled to me from her window . We have arranged a way to signal with our candles and cardboard . We set the candle on the window sill and make flashes by passing the cardboard back and forth . So many flashes mean a certain thing . It was my idea , Marilla . "
59803	59811	59813	59813	Marilla	113	" I 'll warrant you it was , "
59816	59834	59813	59813	Marilla	113	" And the next thing you 'll be setting fire to the curtains with your signaling nonsense . "
59835	59910	59990	59990	she	124	" Oh , we 're very careful , Marilla . And it 's so interesting . Two flashes mean , ? Are you there ? ' Three mean ? yes ' and four ? no . ' Five mean , ? Come over as soon as possible , because I have something important to reveal . ' Diana has just signaled five flashes , and I 'm really suffering to know what it is . "
59911	59921	59923	59923	Marilla	113	" Well , you need n't suffer any longer , "
59926	59946	59923	59923	Marilla	113	" You can go , but you 're to be back here in just ten minutes , remember that . "
59998	60105	59990	59990	she	124	" Oh , Marilla , what do you think ? You know tomorrow is Diana 's birthday . Well , her mother told her she could ask me to go home with her from school and stay all night with her . And her cousins are coming over from Newbridge in a big pung sleigh to go to the Debating Club concert at the hall tomorrow night . And they are going to take Diana and me to the concert -- if you 'll let me go , that is . You will , wo n't you , Marilla ? Oh , I feel so excited . "
60106	60157	59990	59990	she	124	" You can calm down then , because you 're not going . You 're better at home in your own bed , and as for that club concert , it 's all nonsense , and little girls should not be allowed to go out to such places at all . "
60158	60171	60173	60173	Anne	124	" I 'm sure the Debating Club is a most respectable affair , "
60175	60220	59990	59990	she	124	" I 'm not saying it is n't . But you 're not going to begin gadding about to concerts and staying out all hours of the night . Pretty doings for children . I 'm surprised at Mrs. Barry 's letting Diana go . "
60221	60231	60233	60233	Anne	124	" But it 's such a very special occasion , "
60241	60370	60233	60233	Anne	124	" Diana has only one birthday in a year . It is n't as if birthdays were common things , Marilla . Prissy Andrews is going to recite ? Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight . ' That is such a good moral piece , Marilla , I 'm sure it would do me lots of good to hear it . And the choir are going to sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns . And oh , Marilla , the minister is going to take part ; yes , indeed , he is ; he 's going to give an address . That will be just about the same thing as a sermon . Please , may n't I go , Marilla ? "
60371	60399	59990	59990	she	124	" You heard what I said , Anne , did n't you ? Take off your boots now and go to bed . It 's past eight . "
60400	60410	60412	60412	Anne	124	" There 's just one more thing , Marilla , "
60426	60459	60412	60412	Anne	124	" Mrs. Barry told Diana that we might sleep in the spare - room bed . Think of the honor of your little Anne being put in the spare - room bed . "
60460	60491	59990	59990	she	124	" It 's an honor you 'll have to get along without . Go to bed , Anne , and do n't let me hear another word out of you . "
60530	60545	60524	60524	his	107	" Well now , Marilla , I think you ought to let Anne go . "
60546	60552	60554	60554	Marilla	113	" I do n't then , "
60556	60570	60554	60554	Marilla	113	" Who 's bringing this child up , Matthew , you or me ? "
60571	60577	60579	60579	Matthew	107	" Well now , you , "
60581	60587	60524	60524	his	107	" Do n't interfere then . "
60588	60619	60524	60524	his	107	" Well now , I ai n't interfering . It ai n't interfering to have your own opinion . And my opinion is that you ought to let Anne go . "
60620	60643	60645	60645	Marilla	113	" You 'd think I ought to let Anne go to the moon if she took the notion , I 've no doubt "
60650	60725	60645	60645	Marilla	113	" I might have let her spend the night with Diana , if that was all . But I do n't approve of this concert plan . She 'd go there and catch cold like as not , and have her head filled up with nonsense and excitement . It would unsettle her for a week . I understand that child 's disposition and what 's good for it better than you , Matthew . "
60726	60736	60738	60738	Matthew	107	" I think you ought to let Anne go , "
60799	60811	60784	60784	Matthew	107	" I think you ought to let Anne go , Marilla . "
60834	60850	60825	60825	she	113	" Very well , she can go , since nothing else ? ll please you . "
60863	60876	60784	60784	Matthew	107	" Oh , Marilla , Marilla , say those blessed words again . "
60877	60952	60784	60784	Matthew	107	" I guess once is enough to say them . This is Matthew 's doings and I wash my hands of it . If you catch pneumonia sleeping in a strange bed or coming out of that hot hall in the middle of the night , do n't blame me , blame Matthew . Anne Shirley , you 're dripping greasy water all over the floor . I never saw such a careless child . "
60953	60968	60970	60970	Anne	124	" Oh , I know I 'm a great trial to you , Marilla , "
60973	61087	60970	60970	Anne	124	" I make so many mistakes . But then just think of all the mistakes I do n't make , although I might . I 'll get some sand and scrub up the spots before I go to school . Oh , Marilla , my heart was just set on going to that concert . I never was to a concert in my life , and when the other girls talk about them in school I feel so out of it . You did n't know just how I felt about it , but you see Matthew did . Matthew understands me , and it 's so nice to be understood , Marilla . "
61356	61361	61353	61353	They	1123	" perfectly elegant tea ; "
61600	61605	61607	61607	Anne	124	" Oh , Diana , "
61619	61654	61607	61607	Anne	124	" is n't it all like a beautiful dream ? Do I really look the same as usual ? I feel so different that it seems to me it must show in my looks . "
61655	61661	61663	61663	Diana	120	" You look awfully nice , "
61686	61694	61679	61679	she	120	" You 've got the loveliest color . "
61703	61705	61679	61679	she	120	" thrills "
61775	61787	61788	61788	Anne	124	her--"climbed the slimy ladder , dark without one ray of light , "
61798	61804	61805	61805	Anne	124	" Far Above the Gentle Daisies "
61826	61832	61833	61833	Anne	124	" How Sockery Set a Hen "
61932	61937	61929	61930	Gilbert Blythe	140	" Bingen on the Rhine "
62045	62051	62053	62053	Diana	120	" Let 's undress here , "
62055	62063	62053	62053	Diana	120	" It 's so nice and warm . "
62064	62073	62075	62075	Anne	124	" Has n't it been a delightful time ? "
62078	62104	62075	62075	Anne	124	" It must be splendid to get up and recite there . Do you suppose we will ever be asked to do it , Diana ? "
62105	62157	62172	62172	he	1161	" Yes , of course , someday . They 're always wanting the big scholars to recite . Gilbert Blythe does often and he 's only two years older than us . Oh , Anne , how could you pretend not to listen to him ? When he came to the line ,
62179	62179	62172	62172	he	1161	"
62180	62183	62185	62185	Anne	124	" Diana , "
62189	62232	62185	62185	Anne	124	" you are my bosom friend , but I can not allow even you to speak to me of that person . Are you ready for bed ? Let 's run a race and see who 'll get to the bed first . "
62293	62297	62287	62287	somebody	436	" Merciful goodness ! "
62334	62344	62346	62346	Anne	124	" Oh , who was it--_what _ was it ? "
62356	62362	62364	62364	Diana	120	" It was Aunt Josephine , "
62370	62417	62364	62364	Diana	120	" Oh , Anne , it was Aunt Josephine , however she came to be there . Oh , and I know she will be furious . It 's dreadful -- it 's really dreadful -- but did you ever know anything so funny , Anne ? "
62418	62425	62348	62348	her	124	" Who is your Aunt Josephine ? "
62426	62511	62364	62364	Diana	120	" She 's father 's aunt and she lives in Charlottetown . She 's awfully old -- seventy anyhow -- and I do n't believe she was _ ever _ a little girl . We were expecting her out for a visit , but not so soon . She 's awfully prim and proper and she 'll scold dreadfully about this , I know . Well , we 'll have to sleep with Minnie May -- and you ca n't think how she kicks . "
62536	62597	62526	62527	Mrs. Barry	118	" Did you have a good time last night ? I tried to stay awake until you came home , for I wanted to tell you Aunt Josephine had come and that you would have to go upstairs after all , but I was so tired I fell asleep . I hope you did n't disturb your aunt , Diana . "
62658	62674	62676	62677	Mrs. Lynde	105	" So you and Diana nearly frightened poor old Miss Barry to death last night ? "
62688	62750	62676	62677	Mrs. Lynde	105	" Mrs. Barry was here a few minutes ago on her way to Carmody . She 's feeling real worried over it . Old Miss Barry was in a terrible temper when she got up this morning -- and Josephine Barry 's temper is no joke , I can tell you that . She would n't speak to Diana at all . "
62751	62759	62761	62761	Anne	124	" It was n't Diana 's fault , "
62764	62781	62761	62761	Anne	124	" It was mine . I suggested racing to see who would get into bed first . "
62782	62787	62789	62790	Mrs. Lynde	105	" I knew it ! "
62800	62971	62789	62790	Mrs. Lynde	105	" I knew that idea came out of your head . Well , it 's made a nice lot of trouble , that 's what . Old Miss Barry came out to stay for a month , but she declares she wo n't stay another day and is going right back to town tomorrow , Sunday and all as it is . She 'd have gone today if they could have taken her . She had promised to pay for a quarter 's music lessons for Diana , but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a tomboy . Oh , I guess they had a lively time of it there this morning . The Barrys must feel cut up . Old Miss Barry is rich and they 'd like to keep on the good side of her . Of course , Mrs. Barry did n't say just that to me , but I 'm a pretty good judge of human nature , that 's what . "
62972	62980	62982	62982	Anne	124	" I 'm such an unlucky girl , "
62984	63024	62982	62982	Anne	124	" I 'm always getting into scrapes myself and getting my best friends -- people I 'd shed my heart 's blood for -- into them too . Can you tell me why it is so , Mrs. Lynde ? "
63025	63068	62789	62790	Mrs. Lynde	105	" It 's because you 're too heedless and impulsive , child , that 's what . You never stop to think -- whatever comes into your head to say or do you say or do it without a moment 's reflection . "
63069	63080	63082	63082	Anne	124	" Oh , but that 's the best of it , "
63084	63125	63082	63082	Anne	124	" Something just flashes into your mind , so exciting , and you must out with it . If you stop to think it over you spoil it all . Have n't you never felt that yourself , Mrs. Lynde ? "
63139	63173	63133	63133	She	105	" You must learn to think a little , Anne , that 's what . The proverb you need to go by is ? Look before you leap'--especially into spare - room beds . "
63232	63246	63248	63248	Anne	124	" Your Aunt Josephine was very cross about it , was n't she ? "
63250	63253	63255	63255	Diana	120	" Yes , "
63275	63341	63265	63265	her	120	" She was fairly dancing with rage , Anne . Oh , how she scolded . She said I was the worst - behaved girl she ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed of the way they had brought me up . She says she wo n't stay and I 'm sure I do n't care . But Father and Mother do . "
63342	63354	63356	63356	Anne	124	" Why did n't you tell them it was my fault ? "
63358	63373	63375	63375	Diana	120	" It 's likely I 'd do such a thing , is n't it ? "
63380	63401	63375	63375	Diana	120	" I 'm no telltale , Anne Shirley , and anyhow I was just as much to blame as you . "
63402	63414	63416	63416	Anne	124	" Well , I 'm going in to tell her myself , "
63422	63437	63419	63419	Diana	120	" Anne Shirley , you 'd never ! why -- she'll eat you alive ! "
63438	63450	63452	63452	Anne	124	" Do n't frighten me any more than I am frightened , "
63454	63496	63452	63452	Anne	124	" I 'd rather walk up to a cannon 's mouth . But I 've got to do it , Diana . It was my fault and I 've got to confess . I 've had practice in confessing , fortunately . "
63497	63506	63508	63508	Diana	120	" Well , she 's in the room , "
63510	63538	63508	63508	Diana	120	" You can go in if you want to . I would n't dare . And I do n't believe you 'll do a bit of good . "
63570	63573	63508	63508	Diana	120	" Come in "
63644	63649	63651	63653	Miss Josephine Barry	217	" Who are you ? "
63658	63666	63668	63670	the small visitor	1174	" I 'm Anne of Green Gables , "
63681	63693	63668	63670	the small visitor	1174	" and I 've come to confess , if you please . "
63694	63698	63623	63642	a white - faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up with a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror	1173	" Confess what ? "
63699	63755	63668	63670	the small visitor	1174	" That it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night . I suggested it . Diana would never have thought of such a thing , I am sure . Diana is a very ladylike girl , Miss Barry . So you must see how unjust it is to blame her . "
63756	63785	63623	63642	a white - faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up with a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror	1173	" Oh , I must , hey ? I rather think Diana did her share of the jumping at least . Such carryings on in a respectable house ! "
63786	63794	63796	63796	Anne	124	" But we were only in fun , "
63798	63902	63796	63796	Anne	124	" I think you ought to forgive us , Miss Barry , now that we 've apologized . And anyhow , please forgive Diana and let her have her music lessons . Diana 's heart is set on her music lessons , Miss Barry , and I know too well what it is to set your heart on a thing and not get it . If you must be cross with anyone , be cross with me . I 've been so used in my early days to having people cross at me that I can endure it much better than Diana can . "
63935	64000	63930	63930	she	1175	" I do n't think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun . Little girls never indulged in that kind of fun when I was young . You do n't know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep , after a long and arduous journey , by two great girls coming bounce down on you . "
64001	64016	64018	64018	Anne	124	" I do n't _ know _ , but I can _ imagine _ , "
64021	64137	64018	64018	Anne	124	" I 'm sure it must have been very disturbing . But then , there is our side of it too . Have you any imagination , Miss Barry ? If you have , just put yourself in our place . We did n't know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly scared us to death . It was simply awful the way we felt . And then we could n't sleep in the spare room after being promised . I suppose you are used to sleeping in spare rooms . But just imagine what you would feel like if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor . "
64175	64195	64196	64196	she	217	" I 'm afraid my imagination is a little rusty -- it 's so long since I used it , "
64199	64234	64196	64196	she	217	" I dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as mine . It all depends on the way we look at it . Sit down here and tell me about yourself . "
64235	64244	64246	64246	Anne	124	" I am very sorry I ca n't , "
64249	64364	64246	64246	Anne	124	" I would like to , because you seem like an interesting lady , and you might even be a kindred spirit although you do n't look very much like it . But it is my duty to go home to Miss Marilla Cuthbert . Miss Marilla Cuthbert is a very kind lady who has taken me to bring up properly . She is doing her best , but it is very discouraging work . You must not blame her because I jumped on the bed . But before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive Diana and stay just as long as you meant to in Avonlea . "
64365	64382	64384	64385	Miss Barry	217	" I think perhaps I will if you will come over and talk to me occasionally , "
64412	64435	64436	64436	she	217	" I 've made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better acquainted with that Anne - girl , "
64440	64458	64436	64436	she	217	" She amuses me , and at my time of life an amusing person is a rarity . "
64470	64476	64436	64436	she	217	" I told you so . "
64523	64557	64520	64520	she	217	" Remember , you Anne - girl , when you come to town you 're to visit me and I 'll put you in my very sparest spare - room bed to sleep . "
64558	64569	64570	64570	Anne	124	" Miss Barry was a kindred spirit , after all , "
64575	64644	64570	64570	Anne	124	" You would n't think so to look at her , but she is . You do n't find it right out at first , as in Matthew 's case , but after a while you come to see it . Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think . It 's splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world . "
64777	64794	64796	64796	Anne	124	" I 'm so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no Mayflowers , "
64798	65140	64796	64796	Anne	124	" Diana says perhaps they have something better , but there could n't be anything better than Mayflowers , could there , Marilla ? And Diana says if they do n't know what they are like they do n't miss them . But I think that is the saddest thing of all . I think it would be _ tragic _ , Marilla , not to know what Mayflowers are like and _ not _ to miss them . Do you know what I think Mayflowers are , Marilla ? I think they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this is their heaven . But we had a splendid time today , Marilla . We had our lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well -- such a _ romantic _ spot . Charlie Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it , and Arty did because he would n't take a dare . Nobody would in school . It is very _ fashionable _ to dare . Mr. Phillips gave all the Mayflowers he found to Prissy Andrews and I heard him to say ? sweets to the sweet . ' He got that out of a book , I know ; but it shows he has some imagination . I was offered some Mayflowers too , but I rejected them with scorn . I ca n't tell you the person 's name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips . We made wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats ; and when the time came to go home we marched in procession down the road , two by two , with our bouquets and wreaths , singing ? My Home on the Hill . ' Oh , it was so thrilling , Marilla . All Mr. Silas Sloane 's folks rushed out to see us and everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us . We made a real sensation . "
65141	65150	65152	65152	Marilla	113	" Not much wonder ! Such silly doings ! "
65195	65198	65199	65199	she	124	" Somehow , "
65203	65298	65199	65199	she	124	" when I 'm going through here I do n't really care whether Gil -- whether anybody gets ahead of me in class or not . But when I 'm up in school it 's all different and I care as much as ever . There 's such a lot of different Annes in me . I sometimes think that is why I 'm such a troublesome person . If I was just the one Anne it would be ever so much more comfortable , but then it would n't be half so interesting . "
65574	65578	65580	65580	she	124	" tuckered out , "
65594	65621	65584	65584	Anne	124	" I do truly wish I could have had the headache in your place , Marilla . I would have endured it joyfully for your sake . "
65622	65639	65641	65641	Marilla	113	" I guess you did your part in attending to the work and letting me rest , "
65643	65720	65641	65641	Marilla	113	" You seem to have got on fairly well and made fewer mistakes than usual . Of course it was n't exactly necessary to starch Matthew 's handkerchiefs ! And most people when they put a pie in the oven to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of leaving it to be burned to a crisp . But that does n't seem to be your way evidently . "
65728	65736	65738	65738	Anne	124	" Oh , I 'm so sorry , "
65741	65989	65738	65738	Anne	124	" I never thought about that pie from the moment I put it in the oven till now , although I felt _ instinctively _ that there was something missing on the dinner table . I was firmly resolved , when you left me in charge this morning , not to imagine anything , but keep my thoughts on facts . I did pretty well until I put the pie in , and then an irresistible temptation came to me to imagine I was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a handsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal - black steed . So that is how I came to forget the pie . I did n't know I starched the handkerchiefs . All the time I was ironing I was trying to think of a name for a new island Diana and I have discovered up the brook . It 's the most ravishing spot , Marilla . There are two maple trees on it and the brook flows right around it . At last it struck me that it would be splendid to call it Victoria Island because we found it on the Queen 's birthday . Both Diana and I are very loyal . But I 'm sorry about that pie and the handkerchiefs . I wanted to be extra good today because it 's an anniversary . Do you remember what happened this day last year , Marilla ? "
65990	66001	66102	66102	she	113	" No , I ca n't think of anything special . "
66002	66082	65738	65738	Anne	124	" Oh , Marilla , it was the day I came to Green Gables . I shall never forget it . It was the turning point in my life . Of course it would n't seem so important to you . I 've been here for a year and I 've been so happy . Of course , I 've had my troubles , but one can live down troubles . Are you sorry you kept me , Marilla ? "
66083	66094	66096	66096	Marilla	113	" No , I ca n't say I 'm sorry , "
66113	66149	65738	65738	Anne	124	" no , not exactly sorry . If you 've finished your lessons , Anne , I want you to run over and ask Mrs. Barry if she 'll lend me Diana 's apron pattern . "
66150	66160	66162	66162	Anne	124	" Oh -- it's -- it 's too dark , "
66164	66187	65738	65738	Anne	124	" Too dark ? Why , it 's only twilight . And goodness knows you 've gone over often enough after dark . "
66188	66198	66200	66200	Anne	124	" I 'll go over early in the morning , "
66203	66216	66200	66200	Anne	124	" I 'll get up at sunrise and go over , Marilla . "
66217	66250	65738	65738	Anne	124	" What has got into your head now , Anne Shirley ? I want that pattern to cut out your new apron this evening . Go at once and be smart too . "
66251	66264	66266	66266	Anne	124	" I 'll have to go around by the road , then , "
66274	66292	65738	65738	Anne	124	" Go by the road and waste half an hour ! I 'd like to catch you ! "
66293	66305	66307	66307	Anne	124	" I ca n't go through the Haunted Wood , Marilla , "
66313	66331	65738	65738	Anne	124	" The Haunted Wood ! Are you crazy ? What under the canopy is the Haunted Wood ? "
66332	66340	66342	66342	Anne	124	" The spruce wood over the brook , "
66347	66369	65738	65738	Anne	124	" Fiddlesticks ! There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere . Who has been telling you such stuff ? "
66370	66373	66375	66375	Anne	124	" Nobody , "
66377	66586	66375	66375	Anne	124	" Diana and I just imagined the wood was haunted . All the places around here are so -- so--_commonplace _ . We just got this up for our own amusement . We began it in April . A haunted wood is so very romantic , Marilla . We chose the spruce grove because it 's so gloomy . Oh , we have imagined the most harrowing things . There 's a white lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings her hands and utters wailing cries . She appears when there is to be a death in the family . And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the corner up by Idlewild ; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers on your hand -- so . Oh , Marilla , it gives me a shudder to think of it . And there 's a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower at you between the boughs . Oh , Marilla , I would n't go through the Haunted Wood after dark now for anything . I 'd be sure that white things would reach out from behind the trees and grab me . "
66587	66595	66597	66597	Marilla	113	" Did ever anyone hear the like ! "
66606	66627	66597	66597	Marilla	113	" Anne Shirley , do you mean to tell me you believe all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination ? "
66628	66635	66637	66637	Anne	124	" Not believe _ exactly _ , "
66639	66667	66637	66637	Anne	124	" At least , I do n't believe it in daylight . But after dark , Marilla , it 's different . That is when ghosts walk . "
66668	66679	66597	66597	Marilla	113	" There are no such things as ghosts , Anne . "
66680	66689	66691	66691	Anne	124	" Oh , but there are , Marilla , "
66694	66828	66691	66691	Anne	124	" I know people who have seen them . And they are respectable people . Charlie Sloane says that his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night after he 'd been buried for a year . You know Charlie Sloane 's grandmother would n't tell a story for anything . She 's a very religious woman . And Mrs. Thomas 's father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with its head cut off hanging by a strip of skin . He said he knew it was the spirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine days . He did n't , but he died two years after , so you see it was really true . And Ruby Gillis says-- "
66829	66833	66835	66835	Marilla	113	" Anne Shirley , "
66838	66928	66835	66835	Marilla	113	" I never want to hear you talking in this fashion again . I 've had my doubts about that imagination of yours right along , and if this is going to be the outcome of it , I wo n't countenance any such doings . You 'll go right over to Barry 's , and you 'll go through that spruce grove , just for a lesson and a warning to you . And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods again . "
67005	67017	67019	67019	Anne	124	" Oh , Marilla , how can you be so cruel ? "
67021	67040	67019	67019	Anne	124	" What would you feel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off ? "
67041	67047	67049	67049	Marilla	113	" I 'll risk it , "
67052	67076	67049	67049	Marilla	113	" You know I always mean what I say . I 'll cure you of imagining ghosts into places . March , now . "
67327	67335	67337	67337	Marilla	113	" Well , so nothing caught you ? "
67340	67347	67349	67349	Anne	124	" Oh , Mar -- Marilla , "
67351	67372	67349	67349	Anne	124	" I 'll b - b - be contt - tented with c - c - commonplace places after this . "
67381	67401	67403	67403	Anne	124	" DEAR ME , there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world , as Mrs. Lynde says , "
67433	67461	67424	67424	her	124	" Was n't it fortunate , Marilla , that I took an extra handkerchief to school today ? I had a presentiment that it would be needed . "
67462	67490	67492	67492	Marilla	113	" I never thought you were so fond of Mr. Phillips that you 'd require two handkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he was going away , "
67494	67512	67514	67514	Anne	124	" I do n't think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him , "
67516	68121	67514	67514	Anne	124	" I just cried because all the others did . It was Ruby Gillis started it . Ruby Gillis has always declared she hated Mr. Phillips , but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she burst into tears . Then all the girls began to cry , one after the other . I tried to hold out , Marilla . I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips made me sit with Gil -- with a boy ; and the time he spelled my name without an ? e ' on the blackboard ; and how he said I was the worst dunce he ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling ; and all the times he had been so horrid and sarcastic ; but somehow I could n't , Marilla , and I just had to cry too . Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how glad she 'd be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she 'd never shed a tear . Well , she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a handkerchief from her brother -- of course the boys did n't cry -- because she had n't brought one of her own , not expecting to need it . Oh , Marilla , it was heartrending . Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful farewell speech beginning , ? The time has come for us to part . ' It was very affecting . And he had tears in his eyes too , Marilla . Oh , I felt dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I 'd talked in school and drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy . I can tell you I wished I 'd been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews . She had n't anything on her conscience . The girls cried all the way home from school . Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes , ? The time has come for us to part , ' and that would start us off again whenever we were in any danger of cheering up . I do feel dreadfully sad , Marilla . But one ca n't feel quite in the depths of despair with two months ' vacation before them , can they , Marilla ? And besides , we met the new minister and his wife coming from the station . For all I was feeling so bad about Mr. Phillips going away I could n't help taking a little interest in a new minister , could I ? His wife is very pretty . Not exactly regally lovely , of course -- it would n't do , I suppose , for a minister to have a regally lovely wife , because it might set a bad example . Mrs. Lynde says the minister 's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she dresses so fashionably . Our new minister 's wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses . Jane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for a minister 's wife , but I did n't make any such uncharitable remark , Marilla , because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves . Besides , she 's only been a minister 's wife for a little while , so one should make allowances , should n't they ? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde until the manse is ready . "
68352	68354	68346	68363	the many and various candidates and " supplies " who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on trial	1230	" supplies "
68429	68441	68443	68443	Anne	124	" I do n't think Mr. Smith would have done , Matthew "
68449	68769	68443	68443	Anne	124	" Mrs. Lynde says his delivery was so poor , but I think his worst fault was just like Mr. Bentley's -- he had no imagination . And Mr. Terry had too much ; he let it run away with him just as I did mine in the matter of the Haunted Wood . Besides , Mrs. Lynde says his theology was n't sound . Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man , but he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church ; he was undignified , and you must have some dignity about a minister , must n't you , Matthew ? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive ; but Mrs. Lynde says he is n't married , or even engaged , because she made special inquiries about him , and she says it would never do to have a young unmarried minister in Avonlea , because he might marry in the congregation and that would make trouble . Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing woman , is n't she , Matthew ? I 'm very glad they 've called Mr. Allan . I liked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he meant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it . Mrs. Lynde says he is n't perfect , but she says she supposes we could n't expect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year , and anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly on all the points of doctrine . And she knows his wife 's people and they are most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers . Mrs. Lynde says that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman make an ideal combination for a minister 's family . "
68863	68870	68871	68871	she	232	" Mrs. Allan is perfectly lovely , "
68877	68951	68871	68871	she	232	" She 's taken our class and she 's a splendid teacher . She said right away she did n't think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions , and you know , Marilla , that is exactly what I 've always thought . She said we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many . I 'm good at asking questions , Marilla . "
68952	68956	68958	68958	Marilla	113	" I believe you "
68963	69173	68871	68871	she	232	" Nobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis , and she asked if there was to be a Sunday - school picnic this summer . I did n't think that was a very proper question to ask because it had n't any connection with the lesson -- the lesson was about Daniel in the lions ' den -- but Mrs. Allan just smiled and said she thought there would be . Mrs. Allan has a lovely smile ; she has such _ exquisite _ dimples in her cheeks . I wish I had dimples in my cheeks , Marilla . I 'm not half so skinny as I was when I came here , but I have no dimples yet . If I had perhaps I could influence people for good . Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence other people for good . She talked so nice about everything . I never knew before that religion was such a cheerful thing . I always thought it was kind of melancholy , but Mrs. Allan 's is n't , and I 'd like to be a Christian if I could be one like her . I would n't want to be one like Mr. Superintendent Bell . "
69174	69188	69190	69190	Marilla	113	" It 's very naughty of you to speak so about Mr. Bell , "
69193	69202	69190	69190	Marilla	113	" Mr. Bell is a real good man . "
69203	69212	69214	69214	Anne	232	" Oh , of course he 's good , "
69216	69302	69214	69214	Anne	232	" but he does n't seem to get any comfort out of it . If I could be good I 'd dance and sing all day because I was glad of it . I suppose Mrs. Allan is too old to dance and sing and of course it would n't be dignified in a minister 's wife . But I can just feel she 's glad she 's a Christian and that she 'd be one even if she could get to heaven without it . "
69303	69319	69321	69321	Marilla	113	" I suppose we must have Mr. and Mrs. Allan up to tea someday soon , "
69324	69419	69321	69321	Marilla	113	" They 've been most everywhere but here . Let me see . Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them . But do n't say a word to Matthew about it , for if he knew they were coming he 'd find some excuse to be away that day . He 'd got so used to Mr. Bentley he did n't mind him , but he 's going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new minister , and a new minister 's wife will frighten him to death . "
69420	69430	69432	69432	Anne	232	" I 'll be as secret as the dead , "
69434	69475	69432	69432	Anne	232	" But oh , Marilla , will you let me make a cake for the occasion ? I 'd love to do something for Mrs. Allan , and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time . "
69476	69484	69486	69486	Marilla	113	" You can make a layer cake , "
69577	69833	69849	69854	a very comfortable sort of friend	1251	" Everything is ready , Diana , except my cake which I 'm to make in the morning , and the baking - powder biscuits which Marilla will make just before teatime . I assure you , Diana , that Marilla and I have had a busy two days of it . It 's such a responsibility having a minister 's family to tea . I never went through such an experience before . You should just see our pantry . It 's a sight to behold . We 're going to have jellied chicken and cold tongue . We 're to have two kinds of jelly , red and yellow , and whipped cream and lemon pie , and cherry pie , and three kinds of cookies , and fruit cake , and Marilla 's famous yellow plum preserves that she keeps especially for ministers , and pound cake and layer cake , and biscuits as aforesaid ; and new bread and old both , in case the minister is dyspeptic and ca n't eat new . Mrs. Lynde says ministers are dyspeptic , but I do n't think Mr. Allan has been a minister long enough for it to have had a bad effect on him . I just grow cold when I think of my layer cake . Oh , Diana , what if it should n't be good ! I dreamed last night that I was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a head . "
69834	69843	69845	69845	Diana	120	" It 'll be good , all right , "
69856	69881	69845	69845	Diana	120	" I 'm sure that piece of the one you made that we had for lunch in Idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant . "
69882	69906	69908	69908	Anne	232	" Yes ; but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just when you especially want them to be good , "
69919	69971	69908	69908	Anne	232	" However , I suppose I shall just have to trust to Providence and be careful to put in the flour . Oh , look , Diana , what a lovely rainbow ! Do you suppose the dryad will come out after we go away and take it for a scarf ? "
69972	69984	69986	69986	Diana	120	" You know there is no such thing as a dryad , "
70036	70047	70049	70049	Anne	232	" But it 's so easy to imagine there is , "
70051	70113	70049	70049	Anne	232	" Every night before I go to bed , I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really sitting here , combing her locks with the spring for a mirror . Sometimes I look for her footprints in the dew in the morning . Oh , Diana , do n't give up your faith in the dryad ! "
70194	70295	70188	70188	she	232	" I 'm sure I have n't forgotten anything this time , Marilla . But do you think it will rise ? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder is n't good ? I used it out of the new can . And Mrs. Lynde says you can never be sure of getting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated . Mrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up , but she says we 'll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it . Marilla , what if that cake does n't rise ? "
70296	70303	70305	70305	Marilla	113	" We 'll have plenty without it "
70367	70382	70383	70383	she	232	" You 'll be using the best tea set , of course , Marilla , "
70386	70398	70383	70383	she	232	" Can I fix the table with ferns and wild roses ? "
70399	70407	70409	70409	Marilla	113	" I think that 's all nonsense , "
70411	70426	70409	70409	Marilla	113	" In my opinion it 's the eatables that matter and not flummery decorations . "
70427	70437	70439	70439	Anne	232	" Mrs. Barry had _ her _ table decorated , "
70453	70478	70439	70439	Anne	232	" and the minister paid her an elegant compliment . He said it was a feast for the eye as well as the palate . "
70479	70487	70489	70489	Marilla	113	" Well , do as you like , "
70506	70520	70489	70489	Marilla	113	" Only mind you leave enough room for the dishes and the food . "
70586	70593	70595	70595	Marilla	113	" It 's Anne 's doings , "
70747	70769	70734	70734	Marilla	113	" Oh , you must take a piece of this , Mrs. Allan . Anne made it on purpose for you . "
70770	70779	70781	70782	Mrs. Allan	232	" In that case I must sample it , "
70842	70846	70847	70847	she	113	" Anne Shirley ! "
70850	70861	70847	70847	she	113	" what on earth did you put into that cake ? "
70862	70872	70874	70874	Anne	124	" Nothing but what the recipe said , Marilla , "
70881	70890	70874	70874	Anne	124	" Oh , is n't it all right ? "
70891	70922	70847	70847	she	113	" All right ! It 's simply horrible . Mr. Allan , do n't try to eat it . Anne , taste it yourself . What flavoring did you use ? "
70923	70926	70928	70928	Anne	124	" Vanilla , "
70940	70963	70928	70928	Anne	124	" Only vanilla . Oh , Marilla , it must have been the baking powder . I had my suspicions of that bak-- "
70964	70980	70847	70847	she	113	" Baking powder fiddlesticks ! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you used . "
71002	71006	70981	70981	Anne	124	" Best Vanilla . "
71017	71081	70981	70981	Anne	124	" Mercy on us , Anne , you 've flavored that cake with _ Anodyne Liniment _ . I broke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an old empty vanilla bottle . I suppose it 's partly my fault -- I should have warned you -- but for pity 's sake why could n't you have smelled it ? "
71091	71101	71105	71105	she	124	" I couldn't -- I had such a cold ! "
71144	71149	71151	71151	Anne	124	" Oh , Marilla , "
71157	71345	71151	71151	Anne	124	" I 'm disgraced forever . I shall never be able to live this down . It will get out -- things always do get out in Avonlea . Diana will ask me how my cake turned out and I shall have to tell her the truth . I shall always be pointed at as the girl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment . Gil -- the boys in school will never get over laughing at it . Oh , Marilla , if you have a spark of Christian pity do n't tell me that I must go down and wash the dishes after this . I 'll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone , but I can not ever look Mrs. Allan in the face again . Perhaps she 'll think I tried to poison her . Mrs. Lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried to poison her benefactor . But the liniment is n't poisonous . It 's meant to be taken internally -- although not in cakes . Wo n't you tell Mrs. Allan so , Marilla ? "
71346	71357	71541	71541	herself	232	" Suppose you jump up and tell her so yourself , "
71382	71395	71396	71396	she	232	" My dear little girl , you must n't cry like this , "
71407	71422	71396	71396	she	232	" Why , it 's all just a funny mistake that anybody might make . "
71423	71437	71439	71439	Anne	232	" Oh , no , it takes me to make such a mistake , "
71442	71458	71439	71439	Anne	232	" And I wanted to have that cake so nice for you , Mrs. Allan . "
71459	71538	71396	71396	she	232	" Yes , I know , dear . And I assure you I appreciate your kindness and thoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right . Now , you must n't cry any more , but come down with me and show me your flower garden . Miss Cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own . I want to see it , for I 'm very much interested in flowers . "
71604	71626	71574	71575	the guests	1267	" Marilla , is n't it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet ? "
71627	71638	71640	71640	Marilla	113	" I 'll warrant you 'll make plenty in it , "
71642	71654	71640	71640	Marilla	113	" I never saw your beat for making mistakes , Anne . "
71655	71664	71666	71666	Anne	232	" Yes , and well I know it , "
71669	71691	71666	71666	Anne	232	" But have you ever noticed one encouraging thing about me , Marilla ? I never make the same mistake twice . "
71692	71710	71574	71575	the guests	1267	" I do n't know as that 's much benefit when you 're always making new ones . "
71711	71759	71666	71666	Anne	232	" Oh , do n't you see , Marilla ? There must be a limit to the mistakes one person can make , and when I get to the end of them , then I 'll be through with them . That 's a very comforting thought . "
71760	71775	71777	71777	Marilla	113	" Well , you 'd better go and give that cake to the pigs , "
71779	71795	71777	71777	Marilla	113	" It is n't fit for any human to eat , not even Jerry Boute . "
71805	71820	71822	71822	Marilla	113	" AND what are your eyes popping out of your head about . Now ? "
71838	71846	71850	71850	Anne	232	" Have you discovered another kindred spirit ? "
71892	71974	71850	71850	Anne	232	" No , Marilla , but oh , what do you think ? I am invited to tea at the manse tomorrow afternoon ! Mrs. Allan left the letter for me at the post office . Just look at it , Marilla . ? Miss Anne Shirley , Green Gables . ' That is the first time I was ever called ? Miss. ' Such a thrill as it gave me ! I shall cherish it forever among my choicest treasures . "
71975	71998	72000	72000	Marilla	113	" Mrs. Allan told me she meant to have all the members of her Sunday - school class to tea in turn , "
72009	72030	72000	72000	Marilla	113	" You need n't get in such a fever over it . Do learn to take things calmly , child . "
72046	72053	72055	72055	she	232	" spirit and fire and dew , "
72173	72178	72156	72156	she	113	" deeps of affliction . "
72382	72402	72403	72403	she	232	" Oh , Marilla , there is something in me today that makes me just love everybody I see , "
72412	72562	72403	72403	she	232	" You do n't know how good I feel ! Would n't it be nice if it could last ? I believe I could be a model child if I were just invited out to tea every day . But oh , Marilla , it 's a solemn occasion too . I feel so anxious . What if I should n't behave properly ? You know I never had tea at a manse before , and I 'm not sure that I know all the rules of etiquette , although I 've been studying the rules given in the Etiquette Department of the Family Herald ever since I came here . I 'm so afraid I 'll do something silly or forget to do something I should do . Would it be good manners to take a second helping of anything if you wanted to _ very _ much ? "
72563	72599	72601	72601	Marilla	113	" The trouble with you , Anne , is that you 're thinking too much about yourself . You should just think of Mrs. Allan and what would be nicest and most agreeable to her , "
72624	72642	72403	72403	she	232	" You are right , Marilla . I 'll try not to think about myself at all . "
72654	72657	72403	72403	she	232	" etiquette , "
72800	73540	72775	72775	them	1283	" Oh , Marilla , I 've had a most _ fascinating _ time . I feel that I have not lived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never be invited to tea at a manse again . When I got there Mrs. Allan met me at the door . She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale - pink organdy , with dozens of frills and elbow sleeves , and she looked just like a seraph . I really think I 'd like to be a minister 's wife when I grow up , Marilla . A minister might n't mind my red hair because he would n't be thinking of such worldly things . But then of course one would have to be naturally good and I 'll never be that , so I suppose there 's no use in thinking about it . Some people are naturally good , you know , and others are not . I 'm one of the others . Mrs. Lynde says I 'm full of original sin . No matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success of it as those who are naturally good . It 's a good deal like geometry , I expect . But do n't you think the trying so hard ought to count for something ? Mrs. Allan is one of the naturally good people . I love her passionately . You know there are some people , like Matthew and Mrs. Allan that you can love right off without any trouble . And there are others , like Mrs. Lynde , that you have to try very hard to love . You know you _ ought _ to love them because they know so much and are such active workers in the church , but you have to keep reminding yourself of it all the time or else you forget . There was another little girl at the manse to tea , from the White Sands Sunday school . Her name was Laurette Bradley , and she was a very nice little girl . Not exactly a kindred spirit , you know , but still very nice . We had an elegant tea , and I think I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well . After tea Mrs. Allan played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing too . Mrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the Sunday - school choir after this . You ca n't think how I was thrilled at the mere thought . I 've longed so to sing in the Sunday - school choir , as Diana does , but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to . Lauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the White Sands Hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it . Lauretta says that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in aid of the Charlottetown hospital , and they ask lots of the White Sands people to recite . Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself someday . I just gazed at her in awe . After she had gone Mrs. Allan and I had a heart - to - heart talk . I told her everything -- about Mrs. Thomas and the twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and my troubles over geometry . And would you believe it , Marilla ? Mrs. Allan told me she was a dunce at geometry too . You do n't know how that encouraged me . Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left , and what do you think , Marilla ? The trustees have hired a new teacher and it 's a lady . Her name is Miss Muriel Stacy . Is n't that a romantic name ? Mrs. Lynde says they 've never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she thinks it is a dangerous innovation . But I think it will be splendid to have a lady teacher , and I really do n't see how I 'm going to live through the two weeks before school begins . I 'm so impatient to see her . "

74110	74126	74107	74107	she	175	" I knew a girl in Marysville who could walk the ridgepole of a roof . "
74127	74134	74136	74136	Josie	175	" I do n't believe it , "
74139	74158	74136	74136	Josie	175	" I do n't believe anybody could walk a ridgepole . _ You _ could n't , anyhow . "
74159	74164	74166	74166	Anne	124	" Could n't I ? "
74169	74178	74180	74180	Josie	175	" Then I dare you to do it , "
74183	74202	74180	74180	Josie	175	" I dare you to climb up there and walk the ridgepole of Mr. Barry 's kitchen roof . "
74242	74245	74234	74239	All the fifth - class girls	1301	" Oh ! "
74254	74263	74265	74265	Diana	120	" Do n't you do it , Anne , "
74267	74294	74265	74265	Diana	120	" You 'll fall off and be killed . Never mind Josie Pye . It is n't fair to dare anybody to do anything so dangerous . "
74295	74307	74309	74309	Anne	124	" I must do it . My honor is at stake , "
74312	74340	74309	74309	Anne	124	" I shall walk that ridgepole , Diana , or perish in the attempt . If I am killed you are to have my pearl bead ring . "
74570	74577	74579	74579	Diana	120	" Anne , are you killed ? "
74590	74612	74579	74579	Diana	120	" Oh , Anne , dear Anne , speak just one word to me and tell me if you 're killed . "
74671	74689	74663	74663	Anne	124	" No , Diana , I am not killed , but I think I am rendered unconscious . "
74690	74693	74695	74696	Carrie Sloane	211	" Where ? "
74698	74705	74707	74707	Anne	124	" Oh , where , Anne ? "
74741	74753	74755	74756	Mrs. Barry	118	" What 's the matter ? Where have you hurt yourself ? "
74758	74762	74764	74764	Anne	124	" My ankle , "
74766	74814	74764	74764	Anne	124	" Oh , Diana , please find your father and ask him to take me home . I know I can never walk there . And I 'm sure I could n't hop so far on one foot when Jane could n't even hop around the garden . "
74945	74955	74956	74956	she	113	" Mr. Barry , what has happened to her ? "
74985	75033	74978	74978	herself	124	" Do n't be very frightened , Marilla . I was walking the ridgepole and I fell off . I expect I have sprained my ankle . But , Marilla , I might have broken my neck . Let us look on the bright side of things . "
75034	75057	75059	75059	Marilla	113	" I might have known you 'd go and do something of the sort when I let you go to that party , "
75069	75095	75059	75059	Marilla	113	" Bring her in here , Mr. Barry , and lay her on the sofa . Mercy me , the child has gone and fainted ! "
75197	75208	75180	75184	a white - faced girl	1325	" Are n't you very sorry for me , Marilla ? "
75209	75216	75218	75218	Marilla	113	" It was your own fault , "
75229	75242	75244	75244	Anne	124	" And that is just why you should be sorry for me , "
75246	75297	75244	75244	Anne	124	" because the thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard . If I could blame it on anybody I would feel so much better . But what would you have done , Marilla , if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole ? "
75298	75316	75318	75318	Marilla	113	" I 'd have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away . Such absurdity ! "
75323	75488	75244	75244	Anne	124	" But you have such strength of mind , Marilla . I have n't . I just felt that I could n't bear Josie Pye 's scorn . She would have crowed over me all my life . And I think I have been punished so much that you need n't be very cross with me , Marilla . It 's not a bit nice to faint , after all . And the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle . I wo n't be able to go around for six or seven weeks and I 'll miss the new lady teacher . She wo n't be new any more by the time I 'm able to go to school . And Gil -- everybody will get ahead of me in class . Oh , I am an afflicted mortal . But I 'll try to bear it all bravely if only you wo n't be cross with me , Marilla . "
75489	75499	75501	75501	Marilla	113	" There , there , I 'm not cross , "
75503	75539	75501	75501	Marilla	113	" You 're an unlucky child , there 's no doubt about that ; but as you say , you 'll have the suffering of it . Here now , try and eat some supper . "
75540	75552	75554	75554	Anne	124	" Is n't it fortunate I 've got such an imagination ? "
75556	75588	75554	75554	Anne	124	" It will help me through splendidly , I expect . What do people who have n't any imagination do when they break their bones , do you suppose , Marilla ? "
75656	75667	75669	75669	Anne	124	" Everybody has been so good and kind , Marilla , "
75684	76316	75669	75669	Anne	124	" It is n't very pleasant to be laid up ; but there is a bright side to it , Marilla . You find out how many friends you have . Why , even Superintendent Bell came to see me , and he 's really a very fine man . Not a kindred spirit , of course ; but still I like him and I 'm awfully sorry I ever criticized his prayers . I believe now he really does mean them , only he has got into the habit of saying them as if he did n't . He could get over that if he 'd take a little trouble . I gave him a good broad hint . I told him how hard I tried to make my own little private prayers interesting . He told me all about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy . It does seem so strange to think of Superintendent Bell ever being a boy . Even my imagination has its limits , for I ca n't imagine _ that _ . When I try to imagine him as a boy I see him with gray whiskers and spectacles , just as he looks in Sunday school , only small . Now , it 's so easy to imagine Mrs. Allan as a little girl . Mrs. Allan has been to see me fourteen times . Is n't that something to be proud of , Marilla ? When a minister 's wife has so many claims on her time ! She is such a cheerful person to have visit you , too . She never tells you it 's your own fault and she hopes you 'll be a better girl on account of it . Mrs. Lynde always told me that when she came to see me ; and she said it in a kind of way that made me feel she might hope I 'd be a better girl but did n't really believe I would . Even Josie Pye came to see me . I received her as politely as I could , because I think she was sorry she dared me to walk a ridgepole . If I had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden of remorse all her life . Diana has been a faithful friend . She 's been over every day to cheer my lonely pillow . But oh , I shall be so glad when I can go to school for I 've heard such exciting things about the new teacher . The girls all think she is perfectly sweet . Diana says she has the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes . She dresses beautifully , and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else 's in Avonlea . Every other Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody has to say a piece or take part in a dialogue . Oh , it 's just glorious to think of it . Josie Pye says she hates it but that is just because Josie has so little imagination . Diana and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are preparing a dialogue , called ? A Morning Visit , ' for next Friday . And the Friday afternoons they do n't have recitations Miss Stacy takes them all to the woods for a ? field ' day and they study ferns and flowers and birds . And they have physical culture exercises every morning and evening . Mrs. Lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all comes of having a lady teacher . But I think it must be splendid and I believe I shall find that Miss Stacy is a kindred spirit . "
76317	76329	76331	76331	Marilla	113	" There 's one thing plain to be seen , Anne , "
76333	76352	76331	76331	Marilla	113	" and that is that your fall off the Barry roof has n't injured your tongue at all . "
76543	76545	76582	76584	the new teacher	3450	" chew "
76655	76773	76623	76623	them	1330	" I love Miss Stacy with my whole heart , Marilla . She is so ladylike and she has such a sweet voice . When she pronounces my name I feel _ instinctively _ that she 's spelling it with an E. We had recitations this afternoon . I just wish you could have been there to hear me recite ? Mary , Queen of Scots . ' I just put my whole soul into it . Ruby Gillis told me coming home that the way I said the line , ? Now for my father 's arm , ' she said , ? my woman 's heart farewell , ' just made her blood run cold . "
76774	76794	76796	76796	Matthew	107	" Well now , you might recite it for me some of these days , out in the barn , "
76798	76804	76806	76806	Anne	232	" Of course I will , "
76809	76862	76806	76806	Anne	232	" but I wo n't be able to do it so well , I know . It wo n't be so exciting as it is when you have a whole schoolful before you hanging breathlessly on your words . I know I wo n't be able to make your blood run cold . "
76863	76899	76901	76901	Marilla	113	" Mrs. Lynde says it made _ her _ blood run cold to see the boys climbing to the very tops of those big trees on Bell 's hill after crows ' nests last Friday , "
76903	76913	76901	76901	Marilla	113	" I wonder at Miss Stacy for encouraging it . "
76914	76926	76928	76928	Anne	232	" But we wanted a crow 's nest for nature study , "
76930	76969	76928	76928	Anne	232	" That was on our field afternoon . Field afternoons are splendid , Marilla . And Miss Stacy explains everything so beautifully . We have to write compositions on our field afternoons and I write the best ones . "
76970	76991	76806	76806	Anne	232	" It 's very vain of you to say so then . You 'd better let your teacher say it . "
76992	77227	76928	76928	Anne	232	" But she _ did _ say it , Marilla . And indeed I 'm not vain about it . How can I be , when I 'm such a dunce at geometry ? Although I 'm really beginning to see through it a little , too . Miss Stacy makes it so clear . Still , I 'll never be good at it and I assure you it is a humbling reflection . But I love writing compositions . Mostly Miss Stacy lets us choose our own subjects ; but next week we are to write a composition on some remarkable person . It 's hard to choose among so many remarkable people who have lived . Must n't it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after you 're dead ? Oh , I would dearly love to be remarkable . I think when I grow up I 'll be a trained nurse and go with the Red Crosses to the field of battle as a messenger of mercy . That is , if I do n't go out as a foreign missionary . That would be very romantic , but one would have to be very good to be a missionary , and that would be a stumbling block . We have physical culture exercises every day , too . They make you graceful and promote digestion . "
77228	77232	77234	77234	Marilla	113	" Promote fiddlesticks ! "
77367	77389	77390	77390	she	113	" It 's just filling your heads up with nonsense and taking time that ought to be put on your lessons , "
77393	77421	77390	77390	she	113	" I do n't approve of children 's getting up concerts and racing about to practices . It makes them vain and forward and fond of gadding . "
77422	77430	77432	77432	Anne	124	" But think of the worthy object , "
77434	77446	77432	77432	Anne	124	" A flag will cultivate a spirit of patriotism , Marilla . "
77447	77471	77343	77343	herself	124	" Fudge ! There 's precious little patriotism in the thoughts of any of you . All you want is a good time . "
77472	77909	77432	77432	Anne	124	" Well , when you can combine patriotism and fun , is n't it all right ? Of course it 's real nice to be getting up a concert . We 're going to have six choruses and Diana is to sing a solo . I 'm in two dialogues--?The Society for the Suppression of Gossip ' and ? The Fairy Queen . ' The boys are going to have a dialogue too . And I 'm to have two recitations , Marilla . I just tremble when I think of it , but it 's a nice thrilly kind of tremble . And we 're to have a tableau at the last--?Faith , Hope and Charity . ' Diana and Ruby and I are to be in it , all draped in white with flowing hair . I 'm to be Hope , with my hands clasped -- so -- and my eyes uplifted . I 'm going to practice my recitations in the garret . Do n't be alarmed if you hear me groaning . I have to groan heartrendingly in one of them , and it 's really hard to get up a good artistic groan , Marilla . Josie Pye is sulky because she did n't get the part she wanted in the dialogue . She wanted to be the fairy queen . That would have been ridiculous , for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as Josie ? Fairy queens must be slender . Jane Andrews is to be the queen and I am to be one of her maids of honor . Josie says she thinks a red - haired fairy is just as ridiculous as a fat one , but I do not let myself mind what Josie says . I 'm to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis is going to lend me her slippers because I have n't any of my own . It 's necessary for fairies to have slippers , you know . You could n't imagine a fairy wearing boots , could you ? Especially with copper toes ? We are going to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with pink tissue - paper roses in them . And we are all to march in two by two after the audience is seated , while Emma White plays a march on the organ . Oh , Marilla , I know you are not so enthusiastic about it as I am , but do n't you hope your little Anne will distinguish herself ? "
77910	77977	77343	77343	herself	124	" All I hope is that you 'll behave yourself . I 'll be heartily glad when all this fuss is over and you 'll be able to settle down . You are simply good for nothing just now with your head stuffed full of dialogues and groans and tableaus . As for your tongue , it 's a marvel it 's not clean worn out . "
78043	78069	78070	78070	he	107	" Well now , I reckon it 's going to be a pretty good concert . And I expect you 'll do your part fine , "
78152	78154	78147	78147	he	107	" spoil Anne"--Marilla

79171	79184	79185	79187	Miss Lucilla Harris	247	" What can I do for you this evening , Mr. Cuthbert ? "
79201	79218	79220	79220	Matthew	107	" Have you any -- any -- any -- well now , say any garden rakes ? "
79247	79258	79259	79259	she	247	" I believe we have one or two left over , "
79262	79278	79259	79259	she	247	" but they 're upstairs in the lumber room . I 'll go and see . "
79302	79310	79292	79293	Miss Harris	247	" Anything else tonight , Mr. Cuthbert ? "
79321	79349	79311	79311	Matthew	107	" Well now , since you suggest it , I might as well -- take -- that is -- look at -- buy some -- some hayseed . "
79368	79377	79378	79378	she	247	" We only keep hayseed in the spring , "
79382	79391	79378	79378	she	247	" We 've none on hand just now . "
79392	79404	79406	79407	unhappy Matthew	107	" Oh , certainly -- certainly -- just as you say , "
79454	79485	79444	79444	he	107	" Well now -- if it is n't too much trouble -- I might as well -- that is -- I'd like to look at -- at -- some sugar . "
79486	79491	79493	79494	Miss Harris	247	" White or brown ? "
79497	79505	79507	79507	Matthew	107	" Oh -- well now -- brown , "
79510	79520	79522	79523	Miss Harris	247	" There 's a barrel of it over there , "
79531	79540	79522	79523	Miss Harris	247	" It 's the only kind we have . "
79541	79551	79553	79553	Matthew	107	" I'll -- I'll take twenty pounds of it , "
79626	79630	79632	79632	Marilla	113	" Brown sugar ! "
79634	79697	79632	79632	Marilla	113	" Whatever possessed you to get so much ? You know I never use it except for the hired man 's porridge or black fruit cake . Jerry 's gone and I 've made my cake long ago . It 's not good sugar , either -- it 's coarse and dark -- William Blair does n't usually keep sugar like that . "
79698	79710	79712	79712	Matthew	107	" I -- I thought it might come in handy sometime , "
79804	79965	79789	79791	that good lady	666	" Pick out a dress for you to give Anne ? To be sure I will . I 'm going to Carmody tomorrow and I 'll attend to it . Have you something particular in mind ? No ? Well , I 'll just go by my own judgment then . I believe a nice rich brown would just suit Anne , and William Blair has some new gloria in that 's real pretty . Perhaps you 'd like me to make it up for her , too , seeing that if Marilla was to make it Anne would probably get wind of it before the time and spoil the surprise ? Well , I 'll do it . No , it is n't a mite of trouble . I like sewing . I 'll make it to fit my niece , Jenny Gillis , for she and Anne are as like as two peas as far as figure goes . "
79966	79975	79977	79977	Matthew	107	" Well now , I 'm much obliged , "
79979	80026	79977	79977	Matthew	107	" and -- and -- I dunno -- but I 'd like -- I think they make the sleeves different nowadays to what they used to be . If it would n't be asking too much I -- I'd like them made in the new way . "
80027	80056	80058	80059	Mrs. Lynde	105	" Puffs ? Of course . You need n't worry a speck more about it , Matthew . I 'll make it up in the very latest fashion , "
80070	80312	80063	80063	she	105	" It 'll be a real satisfaction to see that poor child wearing something decent for once . The way Marilla dresses her is positively ridiculous , that 's what , and I 've ached to tell her so plainly a dozen times . I 've held my tongue though , for I can see Marilla does n't want advice and she thinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all she 's an old maid . But that 's always the way . Folks that has brought up children know that there 's no hard and fast method in the world that 'll suit every child . But them as never have think it 's all as plain and easy as Rule of Three -- just set your three terms down so fashion , and the sum ? ll work out correct . But flesh and blood do n't come under the head of arithmetic and that 's where Marilla Cuthbert makes her mistake . I suppose she 's trying to cultivate a spirit of humility in Anne by dressing her as she does ; but it 's more likely to cultivate envy and discontent . I 'm sure the child must feel the difference between her clothes and the other girls ' . But to think of Matthew taking notice of it ! That man is waking up after being asleep for over sixty years . "
80392	80416	80417	80417	she	113	" So this is what Matthew has been looking so mysterious over and grinning about to himself for two weeks , is it ? "
80425	80581	80417	80417	she	113	" I knew he was up to some foolishness . Well , I must say I do n't think Anne needed any more dresses . I made her three good , warm , serviceable ones this fall , and anything more is sheer extravagance . There 's enough material in those sleeves alone to make a waist , I declare there is . You 'll just pamper Anne 's vanity , Matthew , and she 's as vain as a peacock now . Well , I hope she 'll be satisfied at last , for I know she 's been hankering after those silly sleeves ever since they came in , although she never said a word after the first . The puffs have been getting bigger and more ridiculous right along ; they 're as big as balloons now . Next year anybody who wears them will have to go through a door sideways . "
80690	80771	80820	80820	Anne	124	" Merry Christmas , Marilla ! Merry Christmas , Matthew ! Is n't it a lovely Christmas ? I 'm so glad it 's white . Any other kind of Christmas does n't seem real , does it ? I do n't like green Christmases . They 're not green -- they're just nasty faded browns and grays . What makes people call them green ? Why -- why -- Matthew , is that for me ? Oh , Matthew ! "
80913	80924	80926	80926	Matthew	107	" That 's a Christmas present for you , Anne , "
80929	80948	80926	80926	Matthew	107	" Why -- why -- Anne , do n't you like it ? Well now -- well now . "
80959	80967	80968	80968	Anne	124	" Like it ! Oh , Matthew ! "
80980	81015	80977	80977	her	124	" Matthew , it 's perfectly exquisite . Oh , I can never thank you enough . Look at those sleeves ! Oh , it seems to me this must be a happy dream . "
81016	81026	81028	81028	Marilla	113	" Well , well , let us have breakfast , "
81030	81090	81028	81028	Marilla	113	" I must say , Anne , I do n't think you needed the dress ; but since Matthew has got it for you , see that you take good care of it . There 's a hair ribbon Mrs. Lynde left for you . It 's brown , to match the dress . Come now , sit in . "
81091	81104	81106	81106	Anne	124	" I do n't see how I 'm going to eat breakfast , "
81109	81257	81106	81106	Anne	124	" Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment . I 'd rather feast my eyes on that dress . I 'm so glad that puffed sleeves are still fashionable . It did seem to me that I 'd never get over it if they went out before I had a dress with them . I 'd never have felt quite satisfied , you see . It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too . I feel that I ought to be a very good girl indeed . It 's at times like this I 'm sorry I 'm not a model little girl ; and I always resolve that I will be in future . But somehow it 's hard to carry out your resolutions when irresistible temptations come . Still , I really will make an extra effort after this . "
81294	81339	81285	81285	Anne	124	" Merry Christmas , Diana ! And oh , it 's a wonderful Christmas . I 've something splendid to show you . Matthew has given me the loveliest dress , with _ such _ sleeves . I could n't even imagine any nicer . "
81340	81349	81351	81351	Diana	120	" I 've got something more for you , "
81354	81416	81351	81351	Diana	120	" Here -- this box . Aunt Josephine sent us out a big box with ever so many things in it -- and this is for you . I 'd have brought it over last night , but it did n't come until after dark , and I never feel very comfortable coming through the Haunted Wood in the dark now . "
81429	81439	81285	81285	Anne	124	" For the Anne - girl and Merry Christmas , "
81466	81469	81471	81471	Anne	124	" Oh , "
81473	81486	81471	81471	Anne	124	" Diana , this is too much . I must be dreaming . "
81487	81493	81495	81495	Diana	120	" I call it providential , "
81497	81568	81495	81495	Diana	120	" You wo n't have to borrow Ruby 's slippers now , and that 's a blessing , for they 're two sizes too big for you , and it would be awful to hear a fairy shuffling . Josie Pye would be delighted . Mind you , Rob Wright went home with Gertie Pye from the practice night before last . Did you ever hear anything equal to that ? "
81648	81659	81661	81661	Anne	124	" Oh , has n't it been a brilliant evening ? "
81683	81690	81692	81692	Diana	120	" Everything went off very well , "
81695	81726	81692	81692	Diana	120	" I guess we must have made as much as ten dollars . Mind you , Mr. Allan is going to send an account of it to the Charlottetown papers . "
81727	81788	81625	81631	the bright particular star of the occasion	1403	" Oh , Diana , will we really see our names in print ? It makes me thrill to think of it . Your solo was perfectly elegant , Diana . I felt prouder than you did when it was encored . I just said to myself , ? It is my dear bosom friend who is so honored . ' "
81789	81809	81692	81692	Diana	120	" Well , your recitations just brought down the house , Anne . That sad one was simply splendid . "
81810	81953	81625	81631	the bright particular star of the occasion	1403	" Oh , I was so nervous , Diana . When Mr. Allan called out my name I really can not tell how I ever got up on that platform . I felt as if a million eyes were looking at me and through me , and for one dreadful moment I was sure I could n't begin at all . Then I thought of my lovely puffed sleeves and took courage . I knew that I must live up to those sleeves , Diana . So I started in , and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so far away . I just felt like a parrot . It 's providential that I practiced those recitations so often up in the garret , or I 'd never have been able to get through . Did I groan all right ? "
81954	81963	81965	81965	Diana	120	" Yes , indeed , you groaned lovely , "
81967	82019	81625	81631	the bright particular star of the occasion	1403	" I saw old Mrs. Sloane wiping away tears when I sat down . It was splendid to think I had touched somebody 's heart . It 's so romantic to take part in a concert , is n't it ? Oh , it 's been a very memorable occasion indeed . "
82020	82029	82031	82031	Diana	120	" Was n't the boys ' dialogue fine ? "
82033	82114	82031	82031	Diana	120	" Gilbert Blythe was just splendid . Anne , I do think it 's awful mean the way you treat Gil . Wait till I tell you . When you ran off the platform after the fairy dialogue one of your roses fell out of your hair . I saw Gil pick it up and put it in his breast pocket . There now . You 're so romantic that I 'm sure you ought to be pleased at that . "
82115	82126	82128	82128	Anne	124	" It 's nothing to me what that person does , "
82131	82143	82128	82128	Anne	124	" I simply never waste a thought on him , Diana . "
82180	82196	82198	82198	Matthew	107	" Well now , I guess our Anne did as well as any of them , "
82201	82207	82209	82209	Marilla	113	" Yes , she did , "
82211	82270	82209	82209	Marilla	113	" She 's a bright child , Matthew . And she looked real nice too . I 've been kind of opposed to this concert scheme , but I suppose there 's no real harm in it after all . Anyhow , I was proud of Anne tonight , although I 'm not going to tell her so . "
82271	82292	82294	82294	Matthew	107	" Well now , I was proud of her and I did tell her so ? fore she went upstairs , "
82296	82327	82294	82294	Matthew	107	" We must see what we can do for her some of these days , Marilla . I guess she 'll need something more than Avonlea school by and by . "
82328	82338	82340	82340	Marilla	113	" There 's time enough to think of that , "
82342	82423	82340	82340	Marilla	113	" She 's only thirteen in March . Though tonight it struck me she was growing quite a big girl . Mrs. Lynde made that dress a mite too long , and it makes Anne look so tall . She 's quick to learn and I guess the best thing we can do for her will be to send her to Queen 's after a spell . But nothing need be said about that for a year or two yet . "
82424	82442	82444	82444	Matthew	107	" Well now , it 'll do no harm to be thinking it over off and on , "
82446	82460	82444	82444	Matthew	107	" Things like that are all the better for lots of thinking over . "
82540	82565	82566	82566	she	124	" I 'm positively certain , Diana , that life can never be quite the same again as it was in those olden days , "
82583	82744	82566	82566	she	124	" Perhaps after a while I 'll get used to it , but I 'm afraid concerts spoil people for everyday life . I suppose that is why Marilla disapproves of them . Marilla is such a sensible woman . It must be a great deal better to be sensible ; but still , I do n't believe I 'd really want to be a sensible person , because they are so unromantic . Mrs. Lynde says there is no danger of my ever being one , but you can never tell . I feel just now that I may grow up to be sensible yet . But perhaps that is only because I 'm tired . I simply could n't sleep last night for ever so long . I just lay awake and imagined the concert over and over again . That 's one splendid thing about such affairs -- it 's so lovely to look back to them . "

83095	83190	83089	83089	Anne	124	" I can scarcely realize that I 'm in my teens . When I woke this morning it seemed to me that everything must be different . You 've been thirteen for a month , so I suppose it does n't seem such a novelty to you as it does to me . It makes life seem so much more interesting . In two more years I 'll be really grown up . It 's a great comfort to think that I 'll be able to use big words then without being laughed at . "
83191	83208	83210	83210	Diana	120	" Ruby Gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as she 's fifteen , "
83212	83221	83223	83223	Anne	124	" Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but beaus , "
83226	83465	83223	83223	Anne	124	" She 's actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a take - notice for all she pretends to be so mad . But I 'm afraid that is an uncharitable speech . Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable speeches ; but they do slip out so often before you think , do n't they ? I simply ca n't talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech , so I never mention her at all . You may have noticed that . I 'm trying to be as much like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can , for I think she 's perfect . Mr. Allan thinks so too . Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she treads on and she does n't really think it right for a minister to set his affections so much on a mortal being . But then , Diana , even ministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody else . I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting sins last Sunday afternoon . There are just a few things it 's proper to talk about on Sundays and that is one of them . My besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my duties . I 'm striving very hard to overcome it and now that I 'm really thirteen perhaps I 'll get on better . "
83466	83481	83483	83483	Diana	120	" In four more years we 'll be able to put our hair up , "
83485	83513	83483	83483	Diana	120	" Alice Bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up , but I think that 's ridiculous . I shall wait until I 'm seventeen . "
83514	83524	83526	83526	Anne	232	" If I had Alice Bell 's crooked nose , "
83529	83649	83526	83526	Anne	232	" I wouldn't -- but there ! I wo n't say what I was going to because it was extremely uncharitable . Besides , I was comparing it with my own nose and that 's vanity . I 'm afraid I think too much about my nose ever since I heard that compliment about it long ago . It really is a great comfort to me . Oh , Diana , look , there 's a rabbit . That 's something to remember for our woods composition . I really think the woods are just as lovely in winter as in summer . They 're so white and still , as if they were asleep and dreaming pretty dreams . "
83650	83663	83665	83665	Diana	120	" I wo n't mind writing that composition when its time comes , "
83667	83706	83665	83665	Diana	120	" I can manage to write about the woods , but the one we 're to hand in Monday is terrible . The idea of Miss Stacy telling us to write a story out of our own heads ! "
83707	83717	83719	83719	Anne	232	" Why , it 's as easy as wink , "
83721	83733	83735	83735	Diana	120	" It 's easy for you because you have an imagination , "
83737	83760	83735	83735	Diana	120	" but what would you do if you had been born without one ? I suppose you have your composition all done ? "
83775	83911	83665	83665	Diana	120	" I wrote it last Monday evening . It 's called ? The Jealous Rival ; or In Death Not Divided . ' I read it to Marilla and she said it was stuff and nonsense . Then I read it to Matthew and he said it was fine . That is the kind of critic I like . It 's a sad , sweet story . I just cried like a child while I was writing it . It 's about two beautiful maidens called Cordelia Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour who lived in the same village and were devotedly attached to each other . Cordelia was a regal brunette with a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes . Geraldine was a queenly blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes . "
83912	83921	83923	83923	Diana	120	" I never saw anybody with purple eyes , "
83926	83984	83665	83665	Diana	120	" Neither did I. I just imagined them . I wanted something out of the common . Geraldine had an alabaster brow too . I 've found out what an alabaster brow is . That is one of the advantages of being thirteen . You know so much more than you did when you were only twelve . "
83985	83995	83997	83997	Diana	120	" Well , what became of Cordelia and Geraldine ? "
84010	84576	84593	84593	critics	1415	" They grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen . Then Bertram DeVere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair Geraldine . He saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a carriage , and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three miles ; because , you understand , the carriage was all smashed up . I found it rather hard to imagine the proposal because I had no experience to go by . I asked Ruby Gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed because I thought she 'd likely be an authority on the subject , having so many sisters married . Ruby told me she was hid in the hall pantry when Malcolm Andres proposed to her sister Susan . She said Malcolm told Susan that his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said , ? What do you say , darling pet , if we get hitched this fall ? ' And Susan said , ? Yes -- no -- I do n't know -- let me see'--and there they were , engaged as quick as that . But I did n't think that sort of a proposal was a very romantic one , so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could . I made it very flowery and poetical and Bertram went on his knees , although Ruby Gillis says it is n't done nowadays . Geraldine accepted him in a speech a page long . I can tell you I took a lot of trouble with that speech . I rewrote it five times and I look upon it as my masterpiece . Bertram gave her a diamond ring and a ruby necklace and told her they would go to Europe for a wedding tour , for he was immensely wealthy . But then , alas , shadows began to darken over their path . Cordelia was secretly in love with Bertram herself and when Geraldine told her about the engagement she was simply furious , especially when she saw the necklace and the diamond ring . All her affection for Geraldine turned to bitter hate and she vowed that she should never marry Bertram . But she pretended to be Geraldine 's friend the same as ever . One evening they were standing on the bridge over a rushing turbulent stream and Cordelia , thinking they were alone , pushed Geraldine over the brink with a wild , mocking , ? Ha , ha , ha . ' But Bertram saw it all and he at once plunged into the current , exclaiming , ? I will save thee , my peerless Geraldine . ' But alas , he had forgotten he could n't swim , and they were both drowned , clasped in each other 's arms . Their bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards . They were buried in the one grave and their funeral was most imposing , Diana . It 's so much more romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding . As for Cordelia , she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic asylum . I thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime . "
84577	84582	84584	84584	Diana	120	" How perfectly lovely ! "
84595	84626	84584	84584	Diana	120	" I do n't see how you can make up such thrilling things out of your own head , Anne . I wish my imagination was as good as yours . "
84627	84638	84640	84640	Anne	232	" It would be if you 'd only cultivate it , "
84643	84728	84640	84640	Anne	232	" I 've just thought of a plan , Diana . Let you and me have a story club all our own and write stories for practice . I 'll help you along until you can do them by yourself . You ought to cultivate your imagination , you know . Miss Stacy says so . Only we must take the right way . I told her about the Haunted Wood , but she said we went the wrong way about it in that . "
84805	84811	84812	84812	Anne	232	" It 's extremely interesting , "
84816	84987	84812	84812	Anne	232	" Each girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over . We are going to keep them all sacredly and have them to read to our descendants . We each write under a nom - de - plume . Mine is Rosamond Montmorency . All the girls do pretty well . Ruby Gillis is rather sentimental . She puts too much lovemaking into her stories and you know too much is worse than too little . Jane never puts any because she says it makes her feel so silly when she had to read it out loud . Jane 's stories are extremely sensible . Then Diana puts too many murders into hers . She says most of the time she does n't know what to do with the people so she kills them off to get rid of them . I mostly always have to tell them what to write about , but that is n't hard for I 've millions of ideas . "
84988	85001	85003	85003	Marilla	113	" I think this story - writing business is the foolishest yet , "
85005	85038	85003	85003	Marilla	113	" You 'll get a pack of nonsense into your heads and waste time that should be put on your lessons . Reading stories is bad enough but writing them is worse . "
85039	85055	85057	85057	Anne	232	" But we 're so careful to put a moral into them all , Marilla , "
85059	85305	85057	85057	Anne	232	" I insist upon that . All the good people are rewarded and all the bad ones are suitably punished . I 'm sure that must have a wholesome effect . The moral is the great thing . Mr. Allan says so . I read one of my stories to him and Mrs. Allan and they both agreed that the moral was excellent . Only they laughed in the wrong places . I like it better when people cry . Jane and Ruby almost always cry when I come to the pathetic parts . Diana wrote her Aunt Josephine about our club and her Aunt Josephine wrote back that we were to send her some of our stories . So we copied out four of our very best and sent them . Miss Josephine Barry wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life . That kind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost everybody died . But I 'm glad Miss Barry liked them . It shows our club is doing some good in the world . Mrs. Allan says that ought to be our object in everything . I do really try to make it my object but I forget so often when I 'm having fun . I hope I shall be a little like Mrs. Allan when I grow up . Do you think there is any prospect of it , Marilla ? "
85306	85316	85318	85318	Marilla	113	" I should n't say there was a great deal "
85323	85342	85318	85318	Marilla	113	" I 'm sure Mrs. Allan was never such a silly , forgetful little girl as you are . "
85343	85359	85361	85361	Anne	232	" No ; but she was n't always so good as she is now either , "
85364	85568	85361	85361	Anne	232	" She told me so herself -- that is , she said she was a dreadful mischief when she was a girl and was always getting into scrapes . I felt so encouraged when I heard that . Is it very wicked of me , Marilla , to feel encouraged when I hear that other people have been bad and mischievous ? Mrs. Lynde says it is . Mrs. Lynde says she always feels shocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty , no matter how small they were . Mrs. Lynde says she once heard a minister confess that when he was a boy he stole a strawberry tart out of his aunt 's pantry and she never had any respect for that minister again . Now , I would n't have felt that way . I 'd have thought that it was real noble of him to confess it , and I 'd have thought what an encouraging thing it would be for small boys nowadays who do naughty things and are sorry for them to know that perhaps they may grow up to be ministers in spite of it . That 's how I 'd feel , Marilla . "
85569	85579	85581	85581	Marilla	113	" The way I feel at present , Anne , "
85583	85619	85581	85581	Marilla	113	" is that it 's high time you had those dishes washed . You 've taken half an hour longer than you should with all your chattering . Learn to work first and talk afterwards . "
85962	85973	85975	85975	Marilla	113	" I 'll settle Miss Anne when she comes home , "
86011	86283	85996	85996	Matthew	107	" She 's gadding off somewhere with Diana , writing stories or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery , and never thinking once about the time or her duties . She 's just got to be pulled up short and sudden on this sort of thing . I do n't care if Mrs. Allan does say she 's the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew . She may be bright and sweet enough , but her head is full of nonsense and there 's never any knowing what shape it 'll break out in next . Just as soon as she grows out of one freak she takes up with another . But there ! Here I am saying the very thing I was so riled with Rachel Lynde for saying at the Aid today . I was real glad when Mrs. Allan spoke up for Anne , for if she had n't I know I 'd have said something too sharp to Rachel before everybody . Anne 's got plenty of faults , goodness knows , and far be it from me to deny it . But I 'm bringing her up and not Rachel Lynde , who 'd pick faults in the Angel Gabriel himself if he lived in Avonlea . Just the same , Anne has no business to leave the house like this when I told her she was to stay home this afternoon and look after things . I must say , with all her faults , I never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and I 'm real sorry to find her so now . "
86284	86291	86293	86293	Matthew	107	" Well now , I dunno , "
86344	86384	86326	86326	she	113	" Perhaps you 're judging her too hasty , Marilla . Do n't call her untrustworthy until you 're sure she has disobeyed you . Mebbe it can all be explained -- Anne 's a great hand at explaining . "
86385	86397	86399	86399	Marilla	113	" She 's not here when I told her to stay , "
86401	86440	86399	86399	Marilla	113	" I reckon she 'll find it hard to explain _ that _ to my satisfaction . Of course I knew you 'd take her part , Matthew . But I 'm bringing her up , not you . "
86539	86544	86547	86547	Marilla	113	" Mercy on us , "
86549	86557	86547	86547	Marilla	113	" have you been asleep , Anne ? "
86558	86561	86595	86595	herself	232	" No , "
86567	86573	86575	86575	Marilla	113	" Are you sick then ? "
86601	86693	86547	86547	Marilla	113	" No . But please , Marilla , go away and do n't look at me . I 'm in the depths of despair and I do n't care who gets head in class or writes the best composition or sings in the Sunday - school choir any more . Little things like that are of no importance now because I do n't suppose I 'll ever be able to go anywhere again . My career is closed . Please , Marilla , go away and do n't look at me . "
86694	86702	86705	86705	Marilla	113	" Did anyone ever hear the like ? "
86710	86748	86705	86705	Marilla	113	" Anne Shirley , whatever is the matter with you ? What have you done ? Get right up this minute and tell me . This minute , I say . There now , what is it ? "
86759	86767	86768	86768	she	124	" Look at my hair , Marilla , "
86801	86821	86768	86768	she	124	" Anne Shirley , what have you done to your hair ? Why , it 's _ green ! _ "
86877	86884	86886	86886	Anne	124	" Yes , it 's green , "
86888	86927	86886	86886	Anne	124	" I thought nothing could be as bad as red hair . But now I know it 's ten times worse to have green hair . Oh , Marilla , you little know how utterly wretched I am . "
86928	86946	86948	86948	Marilla	113	" I little know how you got into this fix , but I mean to find out , "
86950	87017	86948	86948	Marilla	113	" Come right down to the kitchen -- it 's too cold up here -- and tell me just what you 've done . I 've been expecting something queer for some time . You have n't got into any scrape for over two months , and I was sure another one was due . Now , then , what did you do to your hair ? "
87018	87023	86886	86886	Anne	124	" I dyed it . "
87024	87047	86948	86948	Marilla	113	" Dyed it ! Dyed your hair ! Anne Shirley , did n't you know it was a wicked thing to do ? "
87048	87059	87061	87061	Anne	124	" Yes , I knew it was a little wicked , "
87063	87107	87061	87061	Anne	124	" But I thought it was worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair . I counted the cost , Marilla . Besides , I meant to be extra good in other ways to make up for it . "
87108	87111	87113	87113	Marilla	113	" Well , "
87116	87148	87113	87113	Marilla	113	" if I 'd decided it was worth while to dye my hair I 'd have dyed it a decent color at least . I would n't have dyed it green . "
87149	87162	87164	87164	Anne	124	" But I did n't mean to dye it green , Marilla , "
87167	87275	87164	87164	Anne	124	" If I was wicked I meant to be wicked to some purpose . He said it would turn my hair a beautiful raven black -- he positively assured me that it would . How could I doubt his word , Marilla ? I know what it feels like to have your word doubted . And Mrs. Allan says we should never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they 're not . I have proof now -- green hair is proof enough for anybody . But I had n't then and I believed every word he said _ implicitly _ . "
87276	87286	87113	87113	Marilla	113	" Who said ? Who are you talking about ? "
87287	87303	87164	87164	Anne	124	" The peddler that was here this afternoon . I bought the dye from him . "
87304	87338	87113	87113	Marilla	113	" Anne Shirley , how often have I told you never to let one of those Italians in the house ! I do n't believe in encouraging them to come around at all . "
87339	87629	87164	87164	Anne	124	" Oh , I did n't let him in the house . I remembered what you told me , and I went out , carefully shut the door , and looked at his things on the step . Besides , he was n't an Italian -- he was a German Jew . He had a big box full of very interesting things and he told me he was working hard to make enough money to bring his wife and children out from Germany . He spoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart . I wanted to buy something from him to help him in such a worthy object . Then all at once I saw the bottle of hair dye . The peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a beautiful raven black and would n't wash off . In a trice I saw myself with beautiful raven - black hair and the temptation was irresistible . But the price of the bottle was seventy - five cents and I had only fifty cents left out of my chicken money . I think the peddler had a very kind heart , for he said that , seeing it was me , he 'd sell it for fifty cents and that was just giving it away . So I bought it , and as soon as he had gone I came up here and applied it with an old hairbrush as the directions said . I used up the whole bottle , and oh , Marilla , when I saw the dreadful color it turned my hair I repented of being wicked , I can tell you . And I 've been repenting ever since . "
87630	87642	87644	87644	Marilla	113	" Well , I hope you 'll repent to good purpose , "
87647	87696	87644	87644	Marilla	113	" and that you 've got your eyes opened to where your vanity has led you , Anne . Goodness knows what 's to be done . I suppose the first thing is to give your hair a good washing and see if that will do any good . "
87758	87768	87770	87770	Anne	124	" Oh , Marilla , what shall I do ? "
87774	87880	87770	87770	Anne	124	" I can never live this down . People have pretty well forgotten my other mistakes -- the liniment cake and setting Diana drunk and flying into a temper with Mrs. Lynde . But they 'll never forget this . They will think I am not respectable . Oh , Marilla , ? what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive . ' That is poetry , but it is true . And oh , how Josie Pye will laugh ! Marilla , I _ can not _ face Josie Pye . I am the unhappiest girl in Prince Edward Island . "
87943	87985	87939	87939	Marilla	113	" It 's no use , Anne . That is fast dye if ever there was any . Your hair must be cut off ; there is no other way . You ca n't go out with it looking like that . "
88012	88133	87939	87939	Marilla	113	" Please cut it off at once , Marilla , and have it over . Oh , I feel that my heart is broken . This is such an unromantic affliction . The girls in books lose their hair in fevers or sell it to get money for some good deed , and I 'm sure I would n't mind losing my hair in some such fashion half so much . But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you 've dyed it a dreadful color , is there ? I 'm going to weep all the time you 're cutting it off , if it wo n't interfere . It seems such a tragic thing . "
88203	88218	88219	88219	she	124	" I 'll never , never look at myself again until my hair grows , "
88230	88327	88224	88224	she	124	" Yes , I will , too . I 'd do penance for being wicked that way . I 'll look at myself every time I come to my room and see how ugly I am . And I wo n't try to imagine it away , either . I never thought I was vain about my hair , of all things , but now I know I was , in spite of its being red , because it was so long and thick and curly . I expect something will happen to my nose next . "
88377	88390	88391	88391	Anne	124	" I did n't say anything when Josie said that to me , "
88410	88622	88396	88396	Marilla	113	" because I thought it was part of my punishment and I ought to bear it patiently . It 's hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and I wanted to say something back . But I did n't . I just swept her one scornful look and then I forgave her . It makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people , does n't it ? I mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and I shall never try to be beautiful again . Of course it 's better to be good . I know it is , but it 's sometimes so hard to believe a thing even when you know it . I do really want to be good , Marilla , like you and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy , and grow up to be a credit to you . Diana says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side . She says she thinks it will be very becoming . I will call it a snood -- that sounds so romantic . But am I talking too much , Marilla ? Does it hurt your head ? "
88623	88680	88689	88689	she	113	" My head is better now . It was terrible bad this afternoon , though . These headaches of mine are getting worse and worse . I 'll have to see a doctor about them . As for your chatter , I do n't know that I mind it -- I've got so used to it . "
88702	88712	88714	88714	Diana	120	" OF course you must be Elaine , Anne , "
88716	88728	88714	88714	Diana	120	" I could never have the courage to float down there . "
88729	88733	88735	88736	Ruby Gillis	168	" Nor I , "
88742	88793	88735	88736	Ruby Gillis	168	" I do n't mind floating down when there 's two or three of us in the flat and we can sit up . It 's fun then . But to lie down and pretend I was dead -- I just could n't . I 'd die really of fright . "
88794	88802	88804	88805	Jane Andrews	121	" Of course it would be romantic , "
88807	88853	88804	88805	Jane Andrews	121	" but I know I could n't keep still . I 'd be popping up every minute or so to see where I was and if I was n't drifting too far out . And you know , Anne , that would spoil the effect . "
88854	88866	88868	88868	Anne	232	" But it 's so ridiculous to have a redheaded Elaine , "
88870	88947	88868	88868	Anne	232	" I 'm not afraid to float down and I 'd love to be Elaine . But it 's ridiculous just the same . Ruby ought to be Elaine because she is so fair and has such lovely long golden hair -- Elaine had ? all her bright hair streaming down , ' you know . And Elaine was the lily maid . Now , a red - haired person can not be a lily maid . "
88948	88959	88961	88961	Diana	120	" Your complexion is just as fair as Ruby 's , "
88964	88983	88961	88961	Diana	120	" and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it . "
88984	88993	88995	88995	Anne	232	" Oh , do you really think so ? "
89002	89040	88995	88995	Anne	232	" I 've sometimes thought it was myself -- but I never dared to ask anyone for fear she would tell me it was n't . Do you think it could be called auburn now , Diana ? "
89041	89052	89054	89054	Diana	120	" Yes , and I think it is real pretty , "
89492	89500	89502	89502	Anne	232	" Well , I 'll be Elaine , "
89540	89622	89502	89502	Anne	232	" Ruby , you must be King Arthur and Jane will be Guinevere and Diana must be Lancelot . But first you must be the brothers and the father . We ca n't have the old dumb servitor because there is n't room for two in the flat when one is lying down . We must pall the barge all its length in blackest samite . That old black shawl of your mother 's will be just the thing , Diana . "
89654	89663	89665	89666	Ruby Gillis	168	" Oh , she does look really dead , "
89684	89717	89665	89666	Ruby Gillis	168	" It makes me feel frightened , girls . Do you suppose it 's really right to act like this ? Mrs. Lynde says that all play - acting is abominably wicked . "
89718	89729	89731	89731	Anne	232	" Ruby , you should n't talk about Mrs. Lynde , "
89734	89770	89731	89731	Anne	232	" It spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before Mrs. Lynde was born . Jane , you arrange this . It 's silly for Elaine to be talking when she 's dead . "
89832	89840	89842	89842	Jane	121	" Now , she 's all ready , "
89844	89918	89842	89842	Jane	121	" We must kiss her quiet brows and , Diana , you say , ? Sister , farewell forever , ' and Ruby , you say , ? Farewell , sweet sister , ' both of you as sorrowfully as you possibly can . Anne , for goodness sake smile a little . You know Elaine ? lay as though she smiled . ' That 's better . Now push the flat off . "
90187	90193	90194	90194	she	232	" I was horribly frightened , "
90202	90497	90194	90194	she	232	" and it seemed like years while the flat was drifting down to the bridge and the water rising in it every moment . I prayed , Mrs. Allan , most earnestly , but I did n't shut my eyes to pray , for I knew the only way God could save me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge piles for me to climb up on it . You know the piles are just old tree trunks and there are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them . It was proper to pray , but I had to do my part by watching out and right well I knew it . I just said , ? Dear God , please take the flat close to a pile and I 'll do the rest , ' over and over again . Under such circumstances you do n't think much about making a flowery prayer . But mine was answered , for the flat bumped right into a pile for a minute and I flung the scarf and the shawl over my shoulder and scrambled up on a big providential stub . And there I was , Mrs. Allan , clinging to that slippery old pile with no way of getting up or down . It was a very unromantic position , but I did n't think about that at the time . You do n't think much about romance when you have just escaped from a watery grave . I said a grateful prayer at once and then I gave all my attention to holding on tight , for I knew I should probably have to depend on human aid to get back to dry land . "
90788	90800	90801	90801	he	140	" Anne Shirley ! How on earth did you get there ? "
90876	90883	90885	90885	Gilbert	140	" What has happened , Anne ? "
90892	90897	90899	90899	Anne	124	" We were playing Elaine "
90909	90958	90899	90899	Anne	124	" and I had to drift down to Camelot in the barge -- I mean the flat . The flat began to leak and I climbed out on the pile . The girls went for help . Will you be kind enough to row me to the landing ? "
90976	90985	90986	90986	she	124	" I 'm very much obliged to you , "
91012	91015	91016	91016	he	140	" Anne , "
91020	91086	91016	91016	he	140	" look here . Ca n't we be good friends ? I 'm awfully sorry I made fun of your hair that time . I did n't mean to vex you and I only meant it for a joke . Besides , it 's so long ago . I think your hair is awfully pretty now -- honest I do . Let 's be friends . "
91179	91181	91175	91175	Gilbert	140	" carrots "
91232	91235	91236	91236	she	124	" No , "
91240	91260	91236	91236	she	124	" I shall never be friends with you , Gilbert Blythe ; and I do n't want to be ! "
91261	91265	91266	91266	Gilbert	140	" All right ! "
91279	91300	91266	91266	Gilbert	140	" I 'll never ask you to be friends again , Anne Shirley . And I do n't care either ! "
91500	91505	91507	91507	Diana	120	" Oh , Anne , "
91523	91567	91507	91507	Diana	120	" oh , Anne -- we thought -- you were -- drowned -- and we felt like murderers -- because we had made -- you be -- Elaine . And Ruby is in hysterics -- oh , Anne , how did you escape ? "
91568	91578	91580	91580	Anne	124	" I climbed up on one of the piles , "
91583	91600	91580	91580	Anne	124	" and Gilbert Blythe came along in Mr. Andrews 's dory and brought me to land . "
91601	91618	91620	91620	Jane	121	" Oh , Anne , how splendid of him ! Why , it 's so romantic ! "
91630	91641	91620	91620	Jane	121	" Of course you 'll speak to him after this . "
91642	91649	91651	91651	Anne	124	" Of course I wo n't , "
91662	91753	91651	91651	Anne	124	" And I do n't want ever to hear the word ? romantic ' again , Jane Andrews . I 'm awfully sorry you were so frightened , girls . It is all my fault . I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star . Everything I do gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape . We 've gone and lost your father 's flat , Diana , and I have a presentiment that we 'll not be allowed to row on the pond any more . "
91786	91796	91798	91798	Marilla	113	" Will you ever have any sense , Anne ? "
91800	91812	91814	91814	Anne	124	" Oh , yes , I think I will , Marilla , "
91843	91857	91837	91837	her	124	" I think my prospects of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever . "
91858	91865	91867	91867	Marilla	113	" I do n't see how , "
91869	91872	91874	91874	Anne	124	" Well , "
91876	92054	91874	91874	Anne	124	" I 've learned a new and valuable lesson today . Ever since I came to Green Gables I 've been making mistakes , and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming . The affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that did n't belong to me . The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with me . The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in cooking . Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity . I never think about my hair and nose now -- at least , very seldom . And today 's mistake is going to cure me of being too romantic . I have come to the conclusion that it is no use trying to be romantic in Avonlea . It was probably easy enough in towered Camelot hundreds of years ago , but romance is not appreciated now . I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect , Marilla . "
92055	92063	92065	92065	Marilla	113	" I 'm sure I hope so , "
92093	92104	92105	92105	he	107	" Do n't give up all your romance , Anne , "
92109	92141	92105	92105	he	107	" a little of it is a good thing -- not too much , of course -- but keep a little of it , Anne , keep a little of it . "
92402	92446	92361	92361	them	1528	" Is n't this evening just like a purple dream , Diana ? It makes me so glad to be alive . In the mornings I always think the mornings are best ; but when evening comes I think it 's lovelier still . "
92447	92455	92457	92457	Diana	120	" It 's a very fine evening , "
92459	92478	92457	92457	Diana	120	" but oh , I have such news , Anne . Guess . You can have three guesses . "
92479	92501	92503	92503	Anne	232	" Charlotte Gillis is going to be married in the church after all and Mrs. Allan wants us to decorate it , "
92505	92555	92361	92361	them	1528	" No . Charlotte 's beau wo n't agree to that , because nobody ever has been married in the church yet , and he thinks it would seem too much like a funeral . It 's too mean , because it would be such fun . Guess again . "
92556	92570	92573	92573	her	120	" Jane 's mother is going to let her have a birthday party ? "
92583	92593	92595	92595	Anne	232	" I ca n't think what it can be , "
92599	92619	92595	92595	Anne	232	" unless it 's that Moody Spurgeon MacPherson saw you home from prayer meeting last night . Did he ? "
92620	92626	92628	92628	Diana	120	" I should think not , "
92631	92689	92628	92628	Diana	120	" I would n't be likely to boast of it if he did , the horrid creature ! I knew you could n't guess it . Mother had a letter from Aunt Josephine today , and Aunt Josephine wants you and me to go to town next Tuesday and stop with her for the Exhibition . There ! "
92690	92695	92697	92697	Anne	232	" Oh , Diana , "
92712	92836	92697	92697	Anne	232	" do you really mean it ? But I 'm afraid Marilla wo n't let me go . She will say that she ca n't encourage gadding about . That was what she said last week when Jane invited me to go with them in their double - seated buggy to the American concert at the White Sands Hotel . I wanted to go , but Marilla said I 'd be better at home learning my lessons and so would Jane . I was bitterly disappointed , Diana . I felt so heartbroken that I would n't say my prayers when I went to bed . But I repented of that and got up in the middle of the night and said them . "
92837	92843	92845	92845	Diana	120	" I 'll tell you , "
92847	92920	92845	92845	Diana	120	" we 'll get Mother to ask Marilla . She 'll be more likely to let you go then ; and if she does we 'll have the time of our lives , Anne . I 've never been to an Exhibition , and it 's so aggravating to hear the other girls talking about their trips . Jane and Ruby have been twice , and they 're going this year again . "
92921	92942	92944	92944	Anne	232	" I 'm not going to think about it at all until I know whether I can go or not , "
92947	93301	92944	92944	Anne	232	" If I did and then was disappointed , it would be more than I could bear . But in case I do go I 'm very glad my new coat will be ready by that time . Marilla did n't think I needed a new coat . She said my old one would do very well for another winter and that I ought to be satisfied with having a new dress . The dress is very pretty , Diana -- navy blue and made so fashionably . Marilla always makes my dresses fashionably now , because she says she does n't intend to have Matthew going to Mrs. Lynde to make them . I 'm so glad . It is ever so much easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable . At least , it is easier for me . I suppose it does n't make such a difference to naturally good people . But Matthew said I must have a new coat , so Marilla bought a lovely piece of blue broadcloth , and it 's being made by a real dressmaker over at Carmody . It 's to be done Saturday night , and I 'm trying not to imagine myself walking up the church aisle on Sunday in my new suit and cap , because I 'm afraid it is n't right to imagine such things . But it just slips into my mind in spite of me . My cap is so pretty . Matthew bought it for me the day we were over at Carmody . It is one of those little blue velvet ones that are all the rage , with gold cord and tassels . Your new hat is elegant , Diana , and so becoming . When I saw you come into church last Sunday my heart swelled with pride to think you were my dearest friend . Do you suppose it 's wrong for us to think so much about our clothes ? Marilla says it is very sinful . But it is such an interesting subject , is n't it ? "
93672	93675	93710	93710	her	217	" Beechwood . "
93715	93731	93732	93732	she	217	" So you 've come to see me at last , you Anne - girl , "
93735	93782	93732	93732	she	217	" Mercy , child , how you have grown ! You 're taller than I am , I declare . And you 're ever so much better looking than you used to be , too . But I dare say you know that without being told . "
93783	93789	93791	93791	Anne	232	" Indeed I did n't , "
93794	93843	93791	93791	Anne	232	" I know I 'm not so freckled as I used to be , so I 've much to be thankful for , but I really had n't dared to hope there was any other improvement . I 'm so glad you think there is , Miss Barry . "
93851	93855	93844	93845	Miss Barry	217	" great magnificence , "
93889	93898	93900	93900	Diana	120	" Is n't it just like a palace ? "
93902	93943	93900	93900	Diana	120	" I never was in Aunt Josephine 's house before , and I 'd no idea it was so grand . I just wish Julia Bell could see this -- she puts on such airs about her mother 's parlor . "
93944	93948	93950	93950	Anne	232	" Velvet carpet , "
93953	94024	93950	93950	Anne	232	" and silk curtains ! I 've dreamed of such things , Diana . But do you know I do n't believe I feel very comfortable with them after all . There are so many things in this room and all so splendid that there is no scope for imagination . That is one consolation when you are poor -- there are so many more things you can imagine about . "
94067	94072	94073	94073	Anne	232	" It was splendid , "
94080	94763	94073	94073	Anne	232	" I never imagined anything so interesting . I do n't really know which department was the most interesting . I think I liked the horses and the flowers and the fancywork best . Josie Pye took first prize for knitted lace . I was real glad she did . And I was glad that I felt glad , for it shows I 'm improving , do n't you think , Marilla , when I can rejoice in Josie 's success ? Mr. Harmon Andrews took second prize for Gravenstein apples and Mr. Bell took first prize for a pig . Diana said she thought it was ridiculous for a Sunday - school superintendent to take a prize in pigs , but I do n't see why . Do you ? She said she would always think of it after this when he was praying so solemnly . Clara Louise MacPherson took a prize for painting , and Mrs. Lynde got first prize for homemade butter and cheese . So Avonlea was pretty well represented , was n't it ? Mrs. Lynde was there that day , and I never knew how much I really liked her until I saw her familiar face among all those strangers . There were thousands of people there , Marilla . It made me feel dreadfully insignificant . And Miss Barry took us up to the grandstand to see the horse races . Mrs. Lynde would n't go ; she said horse racing was an abomination and , she being a church member , thought it her bounden duty to set a good example by staying away . But there were so many there I do n't believe Mrs. Lynde 's absence would ever be noticed . I do n't think , though , that I ought to go very often to horse races , because they _ are _ awfully fascinating . Diana got so excited that she offered to bet me ten cents that the red horse would win . I did n't believe he would , but I refused to bet , because I wanted to tell Mrs. Allan all about everything , and I felt sure it would n't do to tell her that . It 's always wrong to do anything you ca n't tell the minister 's wife . It 's as good as an extra conscience to have a minister 's wife for your friend . And I was very glad I did n't bet , because the red horse _ did _ win , and I would have lost ten cents . So you see that virtue was its own reward . We saw a man go up in a balloon . I 'd love to go up in a balloon , Marilla ; it would be simply thrilling ; and we saw a man selling fortunes . You paid him ten cents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you . Miss Barry gave Diana and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told . Mine was that I would marry a dark - complected man who was very wealthy , and I would go across water to live . I looked carefully at all the dark men I saw after that , but I did n't care much for any of them , and anyhow I suppose it 's too early to be looking out for him yet . Oh , it was a never - to - be - forgotten day , Marilla . I was so tired I could n't sleep at night . Miss Barry put us in the spare room , according to promise . It was an elegant room , Marilla , but somehow sleeping in a spare room is n't what I used to think it was . That 's the worst of growing up , and I 'm beginning to realize it . The things you wanted so much when you were a child do n't seem half so wonderful to you when you get them . "
94811	95243	94801	94801	Anne	232	" Oh , Marilla , it was beyond description . I was so excited I could n't even talk , so you may know what it was like . I just sat in enraptured silence . Madame Selitsky was perfectly beautiful , and wore white satin and diamonds . But when she began to sing I never thought about anything else . Oh , I ca n't tell you how I felt . But it seemed to me that it could never be hard to be good any more . I felt like I do when I look up to the stars . Tears came into my eyes , but , oh , they were such happy tears . I was so sorry when it was all over , and I told Miss Barry I did n't see how I was ever to return to common life again . She said she thought if we went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream it might help me . That sounded so prosaic ; but to my surprise I found it true . The ice cream was delicious , Marilla , and it was so lovely and dissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven o'clock at night . Diana said she believed she was born for city life . Miss Barry asked me what my opinion was , but I said I would have to think it over very seriously before I could tell her what I really thought . So I thought it over after I went to bed . That is the best time to think things out . And I came to the conclusion , Marilla , that I was n't born for city life and that I was glad of it . It 's nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant restaurants at eleven o'clock at night once in a while ; but as a regular thing I 'd rather be in the east gable at eleven , sound asleep , but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook . I told Miss Barry so at breakfast the next morning and she laughed . Miss Barry generally laughed at anything I said , even when I said the most solemn things . I do n't think I liked it , Marilla , because I was n't trying to be funny . But she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally . "
95260	95270	95272	95273	Miss Barry	217	" Well , I hope you 've enjoyed yourselves , "
95283	95288	95290	95290	Diana	120	" Indeed we have , "
95292	95300	95320	95322	the old woman	1562	" And you , Anne - girl ? "
95301	95311	95313	95313	Anne	232	" I 've enjoyed every minute of the time , "
95487	95510	95511	95511	she	217	" I thought Marilla Cuthbert was an old fool when I heard she 'd adopted a girl out of an orphan asylum , "
95516	95553	95511	95511	she	217	" but I guess she did n't make much of a mistake after all . If I 'd a child like Anne in the house all the time I 'd be a better and happier woman . "
95677	95693	95695	95695	Anne	232	" Oh , but it 's good to be alive and to be going home , "
95762	95769	95771	95771	Marilla	113	" So you 've got back ? "
95778	95792	95794	95794	Anne	232	" Yes , and oh , it 's so good to be back , "
95797	95826	95794	95794	Anne	232	" I could kiss everything , even to the clock . Marilla , a broiled chicken ! You do n't mean to say you cooked that for me ! "
95827	95833	95835	95835	Marilla	113	" Yes , I did , "
95837	95903	95835	95835	Marilla	113	" I thought you 'd be hungry after such a drive and need something real appetizing . Hurry and take off your things , and we 'll have supper as soon as Matthew comes in . I 'm glad you 've got back , I must say . It 's been fearful lonesome here without you , and I never put in four longer days . "
95926	95934	95935	95935	she	232	" I 've had a splendid time , "
95939	95963	95935	95935	she	232	" and I feel that it marks an epoch in my life . But the best of it all was the coming home . "
96354	96357	96359	96359	Marilla	113	" Anne , "
96362	96376	96359	96359	Marilla	113	" Miss Stacy was here this afternoon when you were out with Diana . "
96391	96905	96349	96349	she	113	" Was she ? Oh , I 'm so sorry I was n't in . Why did n't you call me , Marilla ? Diana and I were only over in the Haunted Wood . It 's lovely in the woods now . All the little wood things -- the ferns and the satin leaves and the crackerberries -- have gone to sleep , just as if somebody had tucked them away until spring under a blanket of leaves . I think it was a little gray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last moonlight night and did it . Diana would n't say much about that , though . Diana has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about imagining ghosts into the Haunted Wood . It had a very bad effect on Diana 's imagination . It blighted it . Mrs. Lynde says Myrtle Bell is a blighted being . I asked Ruby Gillis why Myrtle was blighted , and Ruby said she guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her . Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but young men , and the older she gets the worse she is . Young men are all very well in their place , but it does n't do to drag them into everything , does it ? Diana and I are thinking seriously of promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids and live together forever . Diana has n't quite made up her mind though , because she thinks perhaps it would be nobler to marry some wild , dashing , wicked young man and reform him . Diana and I talk a great deal about serious subjects now , you know . We feel that we are so much older than we used to be that it is n't becoming to talk of childish matters . It 's such a solemn thing to be almost fourteen , Marilla . Miss Stacy took all us girls who are in our teens down to the brook last Wednesday , and talked to us about it . She said we could n't be too careful what habits we formed and what ideals we acquired in our teens , because by the time we were twenty our characters would be developed and the foundation laid for our whole future life . And she said if the foundation was shaky we could never build anything really worth while on it . Diana and I talked the matter over coming home from school . We felt extremely solemn , Marilla . And we decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and form respectable habits and learn all we could and be as sensible as possible , so that by the time we were twenty our characters would be properly developed . It 's perfectly appalling to think of being twenty , Marilla . It sounds so fearfully old and grown up . But why was Miss Stacy here this afternoon ? "
96906	96939	96381	96381	her	232	" That is what I want to tell you , Anne , if you 'll ever give me a chance to get a word in edgewise . She was talking about you . "
96940	96944	96945	96945	Anne	232	" About me ? "
96956	97358	96349	96349	she	113	" Oh , I know what she was saying . I meant to tell you , Marilla , honestly I did , but I forgot . Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school yesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian history . Jane Andrews lent it to me . I was reading it at dinner hour , and I had just got to the chariot race when school went in . I was simply wild to know how it turned out -- although I felt sure Ben Hur must win , because it would n't be poetical justice if he didn't -- so I spread the history open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and my knee . I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history , you know , while all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur . I was so interested in it that I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at once I just looked up and there she was looking down at me , so reproachful - like . I ca n't tell you how ashamed I felt , Marilla , especially when I heard Josie Pye giggling . Miss Stacy took Ben Hur away , but she never said a word then . She kept me in at recess and talked to me . She said I had done very wrong in two respects . First , I was wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies ; and secondly , I was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a history when it was a storybook instead . I had never realized until that moment , Marilla , that what I was doing was deceitful . I was shocked . I cried bitterly , and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I 'd never do such a thing again ; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking at Ben Hur for a whole week , not even to see how the chariot race turned out . But Miss Stacy said she would n't require that , and she forgave me freely . So I think it was n't very kind of her to come up here to you about it after all . "
97359	97421	96349	96349	she	113	" Miss Stacy never mentioned such a thing to me , Anne , and its only your guilty conscience that 's the matter with you . You have no business to be taking storybooks to school . You read too many novels anyhow . When I was a girl I was n't so much as allowed to look at a novel . "
97422	97442	97444	97444	Anne	232	" Oh , how can you call Ben Hur a novel when it 's really such a religious book ? "
97446	97654	97444	97444	Anne	232	" Of course it 's a little too exciting to be proper reading for Sunday , and I only read it on weekdays . And I never read _ any _ book now unless either Miss Stacy or Mrs. Allan thinks it is a proper book for a girl thirteen and three - quarters to read . Miss Stacy made me promise that . She found me reading a book one day called , The Lurid Mystery of the Haunted Hall . It was one Ruby Gillis had lent me , and , oh , Marilla , it was so fascinating and creepy . It just curdled the blood in my veins . But Miss Stacy said it was a very silly , unwholesome book , and she asked me not to read any more of it or any like it . I did n't mind promising not to read any more like it , but it was _ agonizing _ to give back that book without knowing how it turned out . But my love for Miss Stacy stood the test and I did . It 's really wonderful , Marilla , what you can do when you 're truly anxious to please a certain person . "
97655	97670	97672	97672	Marilla	113	" Well , I guess I 'll light the lamp and get to work , "
97674	97708	97672	97672	Marilla	113	" I see plainly that you do n't want to hear what Miss Stacy had to say . You 're more interested in the sound of your own tongue than in anything else . "
97709	97723	97725	97725	Anne	232	" Oh , indeed , Marilla , I do want to hear it , "
97728	97794	97725	97725	Anne	232	" I wo n't say another word -- not one . I know I talk too much , but I am really trying to overcome it , and although I say far too much , yet if you only knew how many things I want to say and do n't , you 'd give me some credit for it . Please tell me , Marilla . "
97795	97876	97444	97444	Anne	232	" Well , Miss Stacy wants to organize a class among her advanced students who mean to study for the entrance examination into Queen 's . She intends to give them extra lessons for an hour after school . And she came to ask Matthew and me if we would like to have you join it . What do you think about it yourself , Anne ? Would you like to go to Queen 's and pass for a teacher ? "
97877	97882	97883	97883	Anne	232	" Oh , Marilla ! "
97893	97985	97883	97883	Anne	232	" It 's been the dream of my life -- that is , for the last six months , ever since Ruby and Jane began to talk of studying for the Entrance . But I did n't say anything about it , because I supposed it would be perfectly useless . I 'd love to be a teacher . But wo n't it be dreadfully expensive ? Mr. Andrews says it cost him one hundred and fifty dollars to put Prissy through , and Prissy was n't a dunce in geometry . "
97986	98101	97883	97883	Anne	232	" I guess you need n't worry about that part of it . When Matthew and I took you to bring up we resolved we would do the best we could for you and give you a good education . I believe in a girl being fitted to earn her own living whether she ever has to or not . You 'll always have a home at Green Gables as long as Matthew and I are here , but nobody knows what is going to happen in this uncertain world , and it 's just as well to be prepared . So you can join the Queen 's class if you like , Anne . "
98102	98110	98111	98111	Anne	232	" Oh , Marilla , thank you . "
98127	98184	98111	98111	Anne	232	" I 'm extremely grateful to you and Matthew . And I 'll study as hard as I can and do my very best to be a credit to you . I warn you not to expect much in geometry , but I think I can hold my own in anything else if I work hard . "
98185	98205	98221	98221	her	113	" I dare say you 'll get along well enough . Miss Stacy says you are bright and diligent . "
98231	98285	98111	98111	Anne	232	" You need n't rush to any extreme of killing yourself over your books . There is no hurry . You wo n't be ready to try the Entrance for a year and a half yet . But it 's well to begin in time and be thoroughly grounded , Miss Stacy says . "
98286	98299	98301	98301	Anne	232	" I shall take more interest than ever in my studies now , "
98304	98375	98301	98301	Anne	232	" because I have a purpose in life . Mr. Allan says everybody should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully . Only he says we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose . I would call it a worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like Miss Stacy , would n't you , Marilla ? I think it 's a very noble profession . "
98564	98601	98602	98602	she	120	" But , oh , Marilla , I really felt that I had tasted the bitterness of death , as Mr. Allan said in his sermon last Sunday , when I saw Diana go out alone , "
98608	98991	98602	98602	she	120	" I thought how splendid it would have been if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance , too . But we ca n't have things perfect in this imperfect world , as Mrs. Lynde says . Mrs. Lynde is n't exactly a comforting person sometimes , but there 's no doubt she says a great many very true things . And I think the Queen 's class is going to be extremely interesting . Jane and Ruby are just going to study to be teachers . That is the height of their ambition . Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets through , and then she intends to be married . Jane says she will devote her whole life to teaching , and never , never marry , because you are paid a salary for teaching , but a husband wo n't pay you anything , and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money . I expect Jane speaks from mournful experience , for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a perfect old crank , and meaner than second skimmings . Josie Pye says she is just going to college for education 's sake , because she wo n't have to earn her own living ; she says of course it is different with orphans who are living on charity--_they _ have to hustle . Moody Spurgeon is going to be a minister . Mrs. Lynde says he could n't be anything else with a name like that to live up to . I hope it is n't wicked of me , Marilla , but really the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh . He 's such a funny - looking boy with that big fat face , and his little blue eyes , and his ears sticking out like flaps . But perhaps he will be more intellectual looking when he grows up . Charlie Sloane says he 's going to go into politics and be a member of Parliament , but Mrs. Lynde says he 'll never succeed at that , because the Sloanes are all honest people , and it 's only rascals that get on in politics nowadays . "
98992	99001	99003	99003	Marilla	113	" What is Gilbert Blythe going to be ? "
99013	99034	99036	99036	Anne	124	" I do n't happen to know what Gilbert Blythe 's ambition in life is -- if he has any , "
99392	99400	99410	99410	she	124	" shroud her feelings in deepest oblivion , "
99658	99669	99670	99671	Miss Stacy	240	" But you 've done good work this past year , "
99679	99740	99670	99671	Miss Stacy	240	" and you deserve a good , jolly vacation . Have the best time you can in the out - of - door world and lay in a good stock of health and vitality and ambition to carry you through next year . It will be the tug of war , you know -- the last year before the Entrance . "
99741	99754	99756	99757	Josie Pye	175	" Are you going to be back next year , Miss Stacy ? "
99857	99865	99867	99868	Miss Stacy	240	" Yes , I think I will , "
99870	99920	99867	99868	Miss Stacy	240	" I thought of taking another school , but I have decided to come back to Avonlea . To tell the truth , I 've grown so interested in my pupils here that I found I could n't leave them . So I 'll stay and see you through . "
99921	99924	99926	99927	Moody Spurgeon	254	" Hurrah ! "
99956	99964	99966	99966	Anne	232	" Oh , I 'm so glad , "
99972	100011	99966	99966	Anne	232	" Dear Stacy , it would be perfectly dreadful if you did n't come back . I do n't believe I could have the heart to go on with my studies at all if another teacher came here . "
100044	100058	100059	100059	she	232	" I 'm not even going to look at a schoolbook in vacation , "
100063	100389	100059	100059	she	232	" I 've studied as hard all the term as I possibly could and I 've pored over that geometry until I know every proposition in the first book off by heart , even when the letters _ are _ changed . I just feel tired of everything sensible and I 'm going to let my imagination run riot for the summer . Oh , you need n't be alarmed , Marilla . I 'll only let it run riot within reasonable limits . But I want to have a real good jolly time this summer , for maybe it 's the last summer I 'll be a little girl . Mrs. Lynde says that if I keep stretching out next year as I 've done this I 'll have to put on longer skirts . She says I 'm all running to legs and eyes . And when I put on longer skirts I shall feel that I have to live up to them and be very dignified . It wo n't even do to believe in fairies then , I 'm afraid ; so I 'm going to believe in them with all my whole heart this summer . I think we 're going to have a very gay vacation . Ruby Gillis is going to have a birthday party soon and there 's the Sunday school picnic and the missionary concert next month . And Mr. Barry says that some evening he 'll take Diana and me over to the White Sands Hotel and have dinner there . They have dinner there in the evening , you know . Jane Andrews was over once last summer and she says it was a dazzling sight to see the electric lights and the flowers and all the lady guests in such beautiful dresses . Jane says it was her first glimpse into high life and she 'll never forget it to her dying day . "
100429	100440	100441	100441	Marilla	113	" Matthew had a bad spell with his heart Thursday , "
100444	100555	100441	100441	Marilla	113	" and I did n't feel like leaving him . Oh , yes , he 's all right again now , but he takes them spells oftener than he used to and I 'm anxious about him . The doctor says he must be careful to avoid excitement . That 's easy enough , for Matthew does n't go about looking for excitement by any means and never did , but he 's not to do any very heavy work either and you might as well tell Matthew not to breathe as not to work . Come and lay off your things , Rachel . You 'll stay to tea ? "
100556	100572	100574	100575	Mrs. Rachel	105	" Well , seeing you 're so pressing , perhaps I might as well , stay "
100620	100633	100635	100636	Mrs. Rachel	105	" I must say Anne has turned out a real smart girl , "
100651	100661	100639	100639	Marilla	113	" She must be a great help to you . "
100662	100666	100668	100668	Marilla	113	" She is , "
100670	100710	100668	100668	Marilla	113	" and she 's real steady and reliable now . I used to be afraid she 'd never get over her featherbrained ways , but she has and I would n't be afraid to trust her in anything now . "
100711	100734	100736	100737	Mrs. Rachel	105	" I never would have thought she 'd have turned out so well that first day I was here three years ago , "
100739	101016	100736	100737	Mrs. Rachel	105	" Lawful heart , shall I ever forget that tantrum of hers ! When I went home that night I says to Thomas , says I , ? Mark my words , Thomas , Marilla Cuthbert ? ll live to rue the step she 's took . ' But I was mistaken and I 'm real glad of it . I ai n't one of those kind of people , Marilla , as can never be brought to own up that they 've made a mistake . No , that never was my way , thank goodness . I did make a mistake in judging Anne , but it were n't no wonder , for an odder , unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in this world , that 's what . There was no ciphering her out by the rules that worked with other children . It 's nothing short of wonderful how she 's improved these three years , but especially in looks . She 's a real pretty girl got to be , though I ca n't say I 'm overly partial to that pale , big - eyed style myself . I like more snap and color , like Diana Barry has or Ruby Gillis . Ruby Gillis 's looks are real showy . But somehow -- I do n't know how it is but when Anne and them are together , though she ai n't half as handsome , she makes them look kind of common and overdone -- something like them white June lilies she calls narcissus alongside of the big , red peonies , that 's what . "
101029	101031	101028	101028	her	1634	" good "
101130	101159	101113	101113	his	1635	" Keep that redheaded girl of yours in the open air all summer and do n't let her read books until she gets more spring into her step . "
101250	101261	101262	101262	she	232	" I feel just like studying with might and main , "
101274	101591	101262	101262	she	232	" Oh , you good old friends , I 'm glad to see your honest faces once more -- yes , even you , geometry . I 've had a perfectly beautiful summer , Marilla , and now I 'm rejoicing as a strong man to run a race , as Mr. Allan said last Sunday . Does n't Mr. Allan preach magnificent sermons ? Mrs. Lynde says he is improving every day and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up and then we 'll be left and have to turn to and break in another green preacher . But I do n't see the use of meeting trouble halfway , do you , Marilla ? I think it would be better just to enjoy Mr. Allan while we have him . If I were a man I think I 'd be a minister . They can have such an influence for good , if their theology is sound ; and it must be thrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers ' hearts . Why ca n't women be ministers , Marilla ? I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she was shocked and said it would be a scandalous thing . She said there might be female ministers in the States and she believed there was , but thank goodness we had n't got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we never would . But I do n't see why . I think women would make splendid ministers . When there is a social to be got up or a church tea or anything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work . I 'm sure Mrs. Lynde can pray every bit as well as Superintendent Bell and I 've no doubt she could preach too with a little practice . "
101592	101600	101602	101602	Marilla	113	" Yes , I believe she could , "
101605	101633	101602	101602	Marilla	113	" She does plenty of unofficial preaching as it is . Nobody has much of a chance to go wrong in Avonlea with Rachel to oversee them . "
101634	101637	101639	101639	Anne	232	" Marilla , "
101646	101794	101639	101639	Anne	232	" I want to tell you something and ask you what you think about it . It has worried me terribly -- on Sunday afternoons , that is , when I think specially about such matters . I do really want to be good ; and when I 'm with you or Mrs. Allan or Miss Stacy I want it more than ever and I want to do just what would please you and what you would approve of . But mostly when I 'm with Mrs. Lynde I feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the very thing she tells me I ought n't to do . I feel irresistibly tempted to do it . Now , what do you think is the reason I feel like that ? Do you think it 's because I 'm really bad and unregenerate ? "
101806	101904	101262	101262	she	232	" If you are I guess I am too , Anne , for Rachel often has that very effect on me . I sometimes think she 'd have more of an influence for good , as you say yourself , if she did n't keep nagging people to do right . There should have been a special commandment against nagging . But there , I should n't talk so . Rachel is a good Christian woman and she means well . There is n't a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks her share of work . "
101905	101915	101917	101917	Anne	232	" I 'm very glad you feel the same , "
101920	102205	101917	101917	Anne	232	" It 's so encouraging . I sha n't worry so much over that after this . But I dare say there 'll be other things to worry me . They keep coming up new all the time -- things to perplex you , you know . You settle one question and there 's another right after . There are so many things to be thought over and decided when you 're beginning to grow up . It keeps me busy all the time thinking them over and deciding what is right . It 's a serious thing to grow up , is n't it , Marilla ? But when I have such good friends as you and Matthew and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy I ought to grow up successfully , and I 'm sure it will be my own fault if I do n't . I feel it 's a great responsibility because I have only the one chance . If I do n't grow up right I ca n't go back and begin over again . I 've grown two inches this summer , Marilla . Mr. Gillis measured me at Ruby 's party . I 'm so glad you made my new dresses longer . That dark - green one is so pretty and it was sweet of you to put on the flounce . Of course I know it was n't really necessary , but flounces are so stylish this fall and Josie Pye has flounces on all her dresses . I know I 'll be able to study better because of mine . I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my mind about that flounce . "
102206	102215	102217	102217	Marilla	113	" It 's worth something to have that , "
102273	102277	102283	102285	one and all	1646	" the Entrance , "
102425	102436	102483	102485	the school trustees	1649	" Hills peeped o'er hill and Alps on Alps arose . "
102587	102597	102598	102598	she	113	" Why , Anne , how you 've grown ! "
102742	102749	102750	102750	she	113	" I was thinking about Anne , "
102753	102781	102750	102750	she	113	" She 's got to be such a big girl -- and she 'll probably be away from us next winter . I 'll miss her terrible . "
102782	102792	102794	102794	Matthew	107	" She 'll be able to come home often , "
102826	102839	102794	102794	Matthew	107	" The branch railroad will be built to Carmody by that time . "
102840	102856	102858	102858	Marilla	113	" It wo n't be the same thing as having her here all the time , "
102870	102881	102858	102858	Marilla	113	" But there -- men ca n't understand these things ! "
102932	102961	103019	103019	she	232	" You do n't chatter half as much as you used to , Anne , nor use half as many big words . What has come over you ? "
103003	103018	103019	103019	she	232	" I do n't know -- I do n't want to talk as much , "
103030	103223	103019	103019	she	232	" It 's nicer to think dear , pretty thoughts and keep them in one 's heart , like treasures . I do n't like to have them laughed at or wondered over . And somehow I do n't want to use big words any more . It 's almost a pity , is n't it , now that I 'm really growing big enough to say them if I did want to . It 's fun to be almost grown up in some ways , but it 's not the kind of fun I expected , Marilla . There 's so much to learn and do and think that there is n't time for big words . Besides , Miss Stacy says the short ones are much stronger and better . She makes us write all our essays as simply as possible . It was hard at first . I was so used to crowding in all the fine big words I could think of -- and I thought of any number of them . But I 've got used to it now and I see it 's so much better . "
103224	103246	103019	103019	she	232	" What has become of your story club ? I have n't heard you speak of it for a long time . "
103247	103395	103019	103019	she	232	" The story club is n't in existence any longer . We had n't time for it -- and anyhow I think we had got tired of it . It was silly to be writing about love and murder and elopements and mysteries . Miss Stacy sometimes has us write a story for training in composition , but she wo n't let us write anything but what might happen in Avonlea in our own lives , and she criticizes it very sharply and makes us criticize our own too . I never thought my compositions had so many faults until I began to look for them myself . I felt so ashamed I wanted to give up altogether , but Miss Stacy said I could learn to write well if I only trained myself to be my own severest critic . And so I am trying to . "
103396	103407	103409	103409	Marilla	113	" You 've only two more months before the Entrance , "
103411	103423	103409	103409	Marilla	113	" Do you think you 'll be able to get through ? "
103427	103590	103019	103019	she	232	" I do n't know . Sometimes I think I 'll be all right -- and then I get horribly afraid . We 've studied hard and Miss Stacy has drilled us thoroughly , but we may n't get through for all that . We 've each got a stumbling block . Mine is geometry of course , and Jane 's is Latin , and Ruby and Charlie 's is algebra , and Josie 's is arithmetic . Moody Spurgeon says he feels it in his bones that he is going to fail in English history . Miss Stacy is going to give us examinations in June just as hard as we 'll have at the Entrance and mark us just as strictly , so we 'll have some idea . I wish it was all over , Marilla . It haunts me . Sometimes I wake up in the night and wonder what I 'll do if I do n't pass . "
103591	103603	103605	103605	Marilla	113	" Why , go to school next year and try again , "
103608	103673	103019	103019	she	232	" Oh , I do n't believe I 'd have the heart for it . It would be such a disgrace to fail , especially if Gil -- if the others passed . And I get so nervous in an examination that I 'm likely to make a mess of it . I wish I had nerves like Jane Andrews . Nothing rattles her . "
103839	103856	103857	103857	she	120	" It does seem as if it was the end of everything , does n't it ? "
103861	103874	103876	103876	Anne	232	" You ought n't to feel half as badly as I do , "
103888	103918	103876	103876	Anne	232	" You 'll be back again next winter , but I suppose I 've left the dear old school forever -- if I have good luck , that is . "
103919	103988	103857	103857	she	120	" It wo n't be a bit the same . Miss Stacy wo n't be there , nor you nor Jane nor Ruby probably . I shall have to sit all alone , for I could n't bear to have another deskmate after you . Oh , we have had jolly times , have n't we , Anne ? It 's dreadful to think they 're all over . "
103999	104008	104010	104010	Anne	232	" If you would stop crying I could , "
104013	104092	104010	104010	Anne	232	" Just as soon as I put away my hanky I see you brimming up and that starts me off again . As Mrs. Lynde says , ? If you ca n't be cheerful , be as cheerful as you can . ' After all , I dare say I 'll be back next year . This is one of the times I _ know _ I 'm not going to pass . They 're getting alarmingly frequent . "
104093	104107	103876	103876	Anne	232	" Why , you came out splendidly in the exams Miss Stacy gave . "
104108	104181	104010	104010	Anne	232	" Yes , but those exams did n't make me nervous . When I think of the real thing you ca n't imagine what a horrid cold fluttery feeling comes round my heart . And then my number is thirteen and Josie Pye says it 's so unlucky . I am _ not _ superstitious and I know it can make no difference . But still I wish it was n't thirteen . "
104182	104193	104195	104195	Diana	120	" I do wish I was going in with you , "
104197	104219	104195	104195	Diana	120	" Would n't we have a perfectly elegant time ? But I suppose you 'll have to cram in the evenings . "
104220	104353	104424	104424	her	120	" No ; Miss Stacy has made us promise not to open a book at all . She says it would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not think about the exams at all and go to bed early . It 's good advice , but I expect it will be hard to follow ; good advice is apt to be , I think . Prissy Andrews told me that she sat up half the night every night of her Entrance week and crammed for dear life ; and I had determined to sit up _ at least _ as long as she did . It was so kind of your Aunt Josephine to ask me to stay at Beechwood while I 'm in town . "
104354	104369	104195	104195	Diana	120	" You 'll write to me while you 're in , wo n't you ? "
104370	104385	104387	104387	Anne	232	" I 'll write Tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes , "
104389	104399	104401	104401	Diana	120	" I 'll be haunting the post office Wednesday , "
104427	104430	104433	104433	Anne	232	" Dearest Diana "
104436	104516	104424	104424	her	120	" Here it is Tuesday night and I 'm writing this in the library at Beechwood . Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and wished so much you were with me . I could n't ? cram ' because I 'd promised Miss Stacy not to , but it was as hard to keep from opening my history as it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were learned . "
104517	104621	104424	104424	her	120	" This morning Miss Stacy came for me and we went to the Academy , calling for Jane and Ruby and Josie on our way . Ruby asked me to feel her hands and they were as cold as ice . Josie said I looked as if I had n't slept a wink and she did n't believe I was strong enough to stand the grind of the teacher 's course even if I did get through . There are times and seasons even yet when I do n't feel that I 've made any great headway in learning to like Josie Pye ! "
104622	104724	104424	104424	her	120	" When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from all over the Island . The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting on the steps and muttering away to himself . Jane asked him what on earth he was doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over and over to steady his nerves and for pity 's sake not to interrupt him , because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot everything he ever knew , but the multiplication table kept all his facts firmly in their proper place ! "
104725	104885	104424	104424	her	120	" When we were assigned to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us . Jane and I sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her . No need of the multiplication table for good , steady , sensible Jane ! I wondered if I looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear across the room . Then a man came in and began distributing the English examination sheets . My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled around as I picked it up . Just one awful moment -- Diana , I felt exactly as I did four years ago when I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green Gables -- and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began beating again -- I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!--for I knew I could do something with _ that _ paper anyhow . "
104886	104983	104424	104424	her	120	" At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in the afternoon . The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully mixed up in the dates . Still , I think I did fairly well today . But oh , Diana , tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it it takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my Euclid . If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would recite it from now till tomorrow morning . "
104984	105106	104424	104424	her	120	" I went down to see the other girls this evening . On my way I met Moody Spurgeon wandering distractedly around . He said he knew he had failed in history and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he was going home on the morning train ; and it would be easier to be a carpenter than a minister , anyhow . I cheered him up and persuaded him to stay to the end because it would be unfair to Miss Stacy if he did n't . Sometimes I have wished I was born a boy , but when I see Moody Spurgeon I 'm always glad I 'm a girl and not his sister . "
105107	105154	104424	104424	her	120	" Ruby was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse ; she had just discovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper . When she recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream . How we wished you had been with us . "
105155	105215	104424	104424	her	120	" Oh , Diana , if only the geometry examination were over ! But there , as Mrs. Lynde would say , the sun will go on rising and setting whether I fail in geometry or not . That is true but not especially comforting . I think I 'd rather it did n't go on if I failed ! "
105216	105220	104424	104424	her	120	" Yours devotedly , "
105221	105223	104424	104424	her	120	" Anne "
105277	105313	105499	105499	she	120	" You old darling , it 's perfectly splendid to see you back again . It seems like an age since you went to town and oh , Anne , how did you get along ? "
105314	105373	105254	105254	her	232	" Pretty well , I think , in everything but the geometry . I do n't know whether I passed in it or not and I have a creepy , crawly presentiment that I did n't . Oh , how good it is to be back ! Green Gables is the dearest , loveliest spot in the world . "
105374	105381	105499	105499	she	120	" How did the others do ? "
105382	105483	105254	105254	her	232	" The girls say they know they did n't pass , but I think they did pretty well . Josie says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it ! Moody Spurgeon still thinks he failed in history and Charlie says he failed in algebra . But we do n't really know anything about it and wo n't until the pass list is out . That wo n't be for a fortnight . Fancy living a fortnight in such suspense ! I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up until it is over . "
105503	105516	105499	105499	she	120	" Oh , you 'll pass all right . Do n't worry . "
105517	105536	105538	105538	Anne	232	" I 'd rather not pass at all than not come out pretty well up on the list , "
105724	105727	105744	105744	his	107	" pass high "
105748	105755	105747	105747	she	232	" would beat the whole Island . "
105843	105845	105811	105811	she	232	" haunting "
105902	105921	105922	105922	he	254	" I have n't got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood , "
105926	105947	105922	105922	he	254	" I 'm just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me suddenly whether I 've passed or not . "
106236	106243	106244	106244	she	120	" Anne , you 've passed , "
106247	106273	106244	106244	she	120	" passed the _ very first_--you and Gilbert both -- you're ties -- but your name is first . Oh , I 'm so proud ! "
106356	106364	106366	106366	Diana	120	" You did just splendidly , Anne , "
106390	106570	106377	106382	Anne , starry eyed and rapt	232	" Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes ago -- it came out on the afternoon train , you know , and wo n't be here till tomorrow by mail -- and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over like a wild thing . You 've all passed , every one of you , Moody Spurgeon and all , although he 's conditioned in history . Jane and Ruby did pretty well -- they're halfway up -- and so did Charlie . Josie just scraped through with three marks to spare , but you 'll see she 'll put on as many airs as if she 'd led . Wo n't Miss Stacy be delighted ? Oh , Anne , what does it feel like to see your name at the head of a pass list like that ? If it were me I know I 'd go crazy with joy . I am pretty near crazy as it is , but you 're as calm and cool as a spring evening . "
106571	106578	106580	106580	Anne	232	" I 'm just dazzled inside , "
106582	106690	106580	106580	Anne	232	" I want to say a hundred things , and I ca n't find words to say them in . I never dreamed of this -- yes , I did too , just once ! I let myself think _ once _ , ? What if I should come out first ? ' quakingly , you know , for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to think I could lead the Island . Excuse me a minute , Diana . I must run right out to the field to tell Matthew . Then we 'll go up the road and tell the good news to the others . "
106724	106729	106731	106731	Anne	232	" Oh , Matthew , "
106733	106758	106731	106731	Anne	232	" I 've passed and I 'm first -- or one of the first ! I 'm not vain , but I 'm thankful . "
106759	106768	106770	106770	Matthew	107	" Well now , I always said it , "
106779	106789	106770	106770	Matthew	107	" I knew you could beat them all easy . "
106790	106803	106805	106805	Marilla	113	" You 've done pretty well , I must say , Anne , "
106829	106873	106823	106825	that good soul	1693	" I just guess she has done well , and far be it from me to be backward in saying it . You 're a credit to your friends , Anne , that 's what , and we 're all proud of you . "
106967	106980	106982	106982	Diana	120	" PUT on your white organdy , by all means , Anne , "
107295	107299	107249	107250	Miss Stacy	240	" mahogany furniture , "
107470	107477	107460	107460	Anne	124	" an epoch in her life , "
107609	107620	107622	107622	Anne	124	" Do you really think the organdy will be best ? "
107625	107649	107622	107622	Anne	124	" I do n't think it 's as pretty as my blue - flowered muslin -- and it certainly is n't so fashionable . "
107650	107660	107662	107662	Diana	120	" But it suits you ever so much better , "
107664	107698	107662	107662	Diana	120	" It 's so soft and frilly and clinging . The muslin is stiff , and makes you look too dressed up . But the organdy seems as if it grew on you . "
107809	107932	107786	107786	she	120	" Pull out that frill a little more -- so ; here , let me tie your sash ; now for your slippers . I 'm going to braid your hair in two thick braids , and tie them halfway up with big white bows -- no , do n't pull out a single curl over your forehead -- just have the soft part . There is no way you do your hair suits you so well , Anne , and Mrs. Allan says you look like a Madonna when you part it so . I shall fasten this little white house rose just behind your ear . There was just one on my bush , and I saved it for you . "
107933	107942	107944	107944	Anne	232	" Shall I put my pearl beads on ? "
107946	107969	107944	107944	Anne	232	" Matthew brought me a string from town last week , and I know he 'd like to see them on me . "
108007	108018	108020	108020	Diana	120	" There 's something so stylish about you , Anne , "
108026	108079	108020	108020	Diana	120	" You hold your head with such an air . I suppose it 's your figure . I am just a dumpling . I 've always been afraid of it , and now I know it is so . Well , I suppose I shall just have to resign myself to it . "
108080	108087	108089	108089	Anne	232	" But you have such dimples , "
108104	108151	108089	108089	Anne	232	" Lovely dimples , like little dents in cream . I have given up all hope of dimples . My dimple - dream will never come true ; but so many of my dreams have that I must n't complain . Am I all ready now ? "
108152	108156	108158	108158	Diana	120	" All ready , "
108188	108206	108089	108089	Anne	232	" Come right in and look at our elocutionist , Marilla . Does n't she look lovely ? "
108218	108370	108089	108089	Anne	232	" She looks neat and proper . I like that way of fixing her hair . But I expect she 'll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew with it , and it looks most too thin for these damp nights . Organdy 's the most unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow , and I told Matthew so when he got it . But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays . Time was when he would take my advice , but now he just buys things for Anne regardless , and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything off on him . Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable , and Matthew plunks his money down for it . Mind you keep your skirt clear of the wheel , Anne , and put your warm jacket on . "
108385	108394	108089	108089	Anne	232	" One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown "
108412	108426	108428	108428	Anne	232	" I wonder if it _ is _ too damp for my dress , "
108431	108438	108440	108440	Diana	120	" Not a bit of it , "
108448	108468	108440	108440	Diana	120	" It 's a perfect night , and there wo n't be any dew . Look at the moonlight . "
108469	108483	108485	108485	Anne	232	" I 'm so glad my window looks east into the sun rising , "
108492	108569	108485	108485	Anne	232	" It 's so splendid to see the morning coming up over those long hills and glowing through those sharp fir tops . It 's new every morning , and I feel as if I washed my very soul in that bath of earliest sunshine . Oh , Diana , I love this little room so dearly . I do n't know how I 'll get along without it when I go to town next month . "
108570	108580	108582	108582	Diana	120	" Do n't speak of your going away tonight , "
108584	108626	108582	108582	Diana	120	" I do n't want to think of it , it makes me so miserable , and I do want to have a good time this evening . What are you going to recite , Anne ? And are you nervous ? "
108627	108684	108485	108485	Anne	232	" Not a bit . I 've recited so often in public I do n't mind at all now . I 've decided to give ? The Maiden 's Vow . ' It 's so pathetic . Laura Spencer is going to give a comic recitation , but I 'd rather make people cry than laugh . "
108685	108695	108582	108582	Diana	120	" What will you recite if they encore you ? "
108696	108705	108707	108707	Anne	232	" They wo n't dream of encoring me , "
108738	108754	108724	108724	herself	232	" There are Billy and Jane now -- I hear the wheels . Come on . "

110021	110029	110031	110031	Anne	232	" Oh , I ca n't go , "
110034	110054	110031	110031	Anne	232	" But yet -- I must , or Matthew will be disappointed . He said they would encore me . "
110055	110062	110064	110066	the pink lady	1772	" Then do n't disappoint Matthew , "

110340	110350	110352	110352	Jane	121	" Has n't it been a perfectly splendid time ? "
110359	110440	110352	110352	Jane	121	" I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at a hotel and wear jewels and low - necked dresses and have ice cream and chicken salad every blessed day . I 'm sure it would be ever so much more fun than teaching school . Anne , your recitation was simply great , although I thought at first you were never going to begin . I think it was better than Mrs. Evans 's . "
110441	110455	110457	110457	Anne	232	" Oh , no , do n't say things like that , Jane , "
110460	110512	110457	110457	Anne	232	" because it sounds silly . It could n't be better than Mrs. Evans 's , you know , for she is a professional , and I 'm only a schoolgirl , with a little knack of reciting . I 'm quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty well . "
110513	110523	110525	110525	Diana	120	" I 've a compliment for you , Anne , "
110527	110654	110525	110525	Diana	120	" At least I think it must be a compliment because of the tone he said it in . Part of it was anyhow . There was an American sitting behind Jane and me -- such a romantic - looking man , with coal - black hair and eyes . Josie Pye says he is a distinguished artist , and that her mother 's cousin in Boston is married to a man that used to go to school with him . Well , we heard him say -- didn't we , Jane?--?Who is that girl on the platform with the splendid Titian hair ? She has a face I should like to paint . ' There now , Anne . But what does Titian hair mean ? "
110655	110666	110668	110668	Anne	232	" Being interpreted it means plain red , I guess , "
110670	110686	110668	110668	Anne	232	" Titian was a very famous artist who liked to paint red - haired women . "
110687	110700	110702	110702	Jane	121	" _ Did _ you see all the diamonds those ladies wore ? "
110704	110721	110702	110702	Jane	121	" They were simply dazzling . Would n't you just love to be rich , girls ? "
110722	110729	110731	110731	Anne	232	" We _ are _ rich , "
110734	110910	110731	110731	Anne	232	" Why , we have sixteen years to our credit , and we 're happy as queens , and we 've all got imaginations , more or less . Look at that sea , girls -- all silver and shadow and vision of things not seen . We could n't enjoy its loveliness any more if we had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds . You would n't change into any of those women if you could . Would you want to be that white - lace girl and wear a sour look all your life , as if you 'd been born turning up your nose at the world ? Or the pink lady , kind and nice as she is , so stout and short that you 'd really no figure at all ? Or even Mrs. Evans , with that sad , sad look in her eyes ? She must have been dreadfully unhappy sometime to have such a look . You _ know _ you would n't , Jane Andrews ! "
110911	110921	110923	110923	Jane	121	" I _ do n't _ know -- exactly , "
110926	110939	110923	110923	Jane	121	" I think diamonds would comfort a person for a good deal . "
110940	110964	110966	110966	Anne	232	" Well , I do n't want to be anyone but myself , even if I go uncomforted by diamonds all my life , "
110968	111008	110966	110966	Anne	232	" I 'm quite content to be Anne of Green Gables , with my string of pearl beads . I know Matthew gave me as much love with them as ever went with Madame the Pink Lady 's jewels . "
111108	111241	111090	111090	she	113	" Anne , here 's something for a nice light dress for you . I do n't suppose you really need it ; you 've plenty of pretty waists ; but I thought maybe you 'd like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere of an evening in town , to a party or anything like that . I hear that Jane and Ruby and Josie have got ? evening dresses , ' as they call them , and I do n't mean you shall be behind them . I got Mrs. Allan to help me pick it in town last week , and we 'll get Emily Gillis to make it for you . Emily has got taste , and her fits are n't to be equaled . "
111242	111252	111254	111254	Anne	232	" Oh , Marilla , it 's just lovely , "
111256	111288	111254	111254	Anne	232	" Thank you so much . I do n't believe you ought to be so kind to me -- it 's making it harder every day for me to go away . "
111325	111330	111332	111332	them	1789	" The Maiden 's Vow "
111404	111417	111419	111419	Anne	232	" I declare , my recitation has made you cry , Marilla , "
111437	111447	111419	111419	Anne	232	" Now , I call that a positive triumph . "
111448	111459	111461	111461	Marilla	113	" No , I was n't crying over your piece , "
111478	111565	111461	111461	Marilla	113	" I just could n't help thinking of the little girl you used to be , Anne . And I was wishing you could have stayed a little girl , even with all your queer ways . You 've grown up now and you 're going away ; and you look so tall and stylish and so -- so -- different altogether in that dress -- as if you did n't belong in Avonlea at all -- and I just got lonesome thinking it all over . "
111566	111569	111570	111570	Anne	232	" Marilla ! "
111598	111677	111585	111585	her	232	" I 'm not a bit changed -- not really . I 'm only just pruned down and branched out . The real _ me_--back here -- is just the same . It wo n't make a bit of difference where I go or how much I change outwardly ; at heart I shall always be your little Anne , who will love you and Matthew and dear Green Gables more and better every day of her life . "
111799	111812	111813	111813	he	107	" Well now , I guess she ai n't been much spoiled , "
111818	111906	111813	111813	he	107	" I guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all . She 's smart and pretty , and loving , too , which is better than all the rest . She 's been a blessing to us , and there never was a luckier mistake than what Mrs. Spencer made -- if it _ was _ luck . I do n't believe it was any such thing . It was Providence , because the Almighty saw we needed her , I reckon . "
112340	112349	112350	112350	she	232	" I would n't feel comfortable without it , "
112353	112604	112350	112350	she	232	" Gilbert looks awfully determined . I suppose he 's making up his mind , here and now , to win the medal . What a splendid chin he has ! I never noticed it before . I do wish Jane and Ruby had gone in for First Class , too . I suppose I wo n't feel so much like a cat in a strange garret when I get acquainted , though . I wonder which of the girls here are going to be my friends . It 's really an interesting speculation . Of course I promised Diana that no Queen 's girl , no matter how much I liked her , should ever be as dear to me as she is ; but I 've lots of second - best affections to bestow . I like the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist . She looks vivid and red - rosy ; there 's that pale , fair one gazing out of the window . She has lovely hair , and looks as if she knew a thing or two about dreams . I 'd like to know them both -- know them well -- well enough to walk with my arm about their waists , and call them nicknames . But just now I do n't know them and they do n't know me , and probably do n't want to know me particularly . Oh , it 's lonesome ! "
112694	112705	112707	112708	Miss Barry	217	" The lady who keeps it is a reduced gentlewoman , "
112710	112760	112707	112708	Miss Barry	217	" Her husband was a British officer , and she is very careful what sort of boarders she takes . Anne will not meet with any objectionable persons under her roof . The table is good , and the house is near the Academy , in a quiet neighborhood . "
112970	113118	112959	112959	she	232	" I _ wo n't _ cry . It 's silly -- and weak -- there 's the third tear splashing down by my nose . There are more coming ! I must think of something funny to stop them . But there 's nothing funny except what is connected with Avonlea , and that only makes things worse -- four -- five -- I'm going home next Friday , but that seems a hundred years away . Oh , Matthew is nearly home by now -- and Marilla is at the gate , looking down the lane for him -- six -- seven -- eight -- oh , there 's no use in counting them ! They 're coming in a flood presently . I ca n't cheer up -- I do n't _ want _ to cheer up . It 's nicer to be miserable ! "
113174	113183	113184	113184	Anne	232	" I 'm so glad you came up , "
113188	113194	113196	113196	Josie	175	" You 've been crying , "
113202	113421	113196	113196	Josie	175	" I suppose you 're homesick -- some people have so little self - control in that respect . I 've no intention of being homesick , I can tell you . Town 's too jolly after that poky old Avonlea . I wonder how I ever existed there so long . You should n't cry , Anne ; it is n't becoming , for your nose and eyes get red , and then you seem _ all _ red . I 'd a perfectly scrumptious time in the Academy today . Our French professor is simply a duck . His moustache would give you kerwollowps of the heart . Have you anything eatable around , Anne ? I 'm literally starving . Ah , I guessed likely Marilla ? d load you up with cake . That 's why I called round . Otherwise I 'd have gone to the park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley . He boards same place as I do , and he 's a sport . He noticed you in class today , and asked me who the red - headed girl was . I told him you were an orphan that the Cuthberts had adopted , and nobody knew very much about what you 'd been before that . "

113487	113490	113492	113492	Jane	121	" Well , "
113497	113626	113492	113492	Jane	121	" I feel as if I 'd lived many moons since the morning . I ought to be home studying my Virgil -- that horrid old professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow . But I simply could n't settle down to study tonight . Anne , methinks I see the traces of tears . If you 've been crying _ do _ own up . It will restore my self - respect , for I was shedding tears freely before Ruby came along . I do n't mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey , too . Cake ? You 'll give me a teeny piece , wo n't you ? Thank you . It has the real Avonlea flavor . "
113662	113669	113671	113671	Josie	175	" Oh , that reminds me , "
113673	113719	113671	113671	Josie	175	" Queen 's is to get one of the Avery scholarships after all . The word came today . Frank Stockley told me -- his uncle is one of the board of governors , you know . It will be announced in the Academy tomorrow . "
113957	113970	113971	113971	she	232	" I 'll win that scholarship if hard work can do it , "
113974	114050	113971	113971	she	232	" Would n't Matthew be proud if I got to be a B.A. ? Oh , it 's delightful to have ambitions . I 'm so glad I have such a lot . And there never seems to be any end to them -- that 's the best of it . Just as soon as you attain to one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still . It does make life so interesting . "
114268	114284	114286	114286	Jane	121	" But I should n't think she was the sort of girl Gilbert would like , "

115206	115289	115203	115203	she	124	" I get tired of other girls -- there is such a provoking and eternal sameness about them . Anne has as many shades as a rainbow and every shade is the prettiest while it lasts . I do n't know that she is as amusing as she was when she was a child , but she makes me love her and I like people who make me love them . It saves me so much trouble in making myself love them . "

115368	115447	115366	115366	Anne	124	" Why , last fall it seemed so long to look forward to -- a whole winter of studies and classes . And here we are , with the exams looming up next week . Girls , sometimes I feel as if those exams meant everything , but when I look at the big buds swelling on those chestnut trees and the misty blue air at the end of the streets they do n't seem half so important . "
115536	115548	115550	115550	Jane	121	" I 've lost seven pounds in the last two weeks , "
115552	115611	115550	115550	Jane	121	" It 's no use to say do n't worry . I _ will _ worry . Worrying helps you some -- it seems as if you were doing something when you 're worrying . It would be dreadful if I failed to get my license after going to Queen 's all winter and spending so much money . "
115612	115620	115622	115623	Josie Pye	175	" _ I _ do n't care , "
115625	115675	115622	115623	Josie Pye	175	" If I do n't pass this year I 'm coming back next . My father can afford to send me . Anne , Frank Stockley says that Professor Tremaine said Gilbert Blythe was sure to get the medal and that Emily Clay would likely win the Avery scholarship . "
115676	115687	115689	115689	Anne	124	" That may make me feel badly tomorrow , Josie , "
115691	115824	115689	115689	Anne	124	" but just now I honestly feel that as long as I know the violets are coming out all purple down in the hollow below Green Gables and that little ferns are poking their heads up in Lovers ' Lane , it 's not a great deal of difference whether I win the Avery or not . I 've done my best and I begin to understand what is meant by the ? joy of the strife . ' Next to trying and winning , the best thing is trying and failing . Girls , do n't talk about exams ! Look at that arch of pale green sky over those houses and picture to yourself what it must look like over the purply - dark beech - woods back of Avonlea . "
115825	115837	115839	115839	Ruby	168	" What are you going to wear for commencement , Jane ? "
116124	116135	116137	116137	Jane	121	" Of course you 'll win one of them anyhow , "
116156	116165	116167	116167	Anne	124	" I have not hope of the Avery , "
116169	116281	116167	116167	Anne	124	" Everybody says Emily Clay will win it . And I 'm not going to march up to that bulletin board and look at it before everybody . I have n't the moral courage . I 'm going straight to the girls ' dressing room . You must read the announcements and then come and tell me , Jane . And I implore you in the name of our old friendship to do it as quickly as possible . If I have failed just say so , without trying to break it gently ; and whatever you do _ do n't _ sympathize with me . Promise me this , Jane . "
116336	116343	116333	116333	their	1899	" Hurrah for Blythe , Medalist ! "
116389	116401	116385	116385	Somebody	436	" Three cheers for Miss Shirley , winner of the Avery ! "

116486	116506	116479	116479	she	124	" Oh , wo n't Matthew and Marilla be pleased ! I must write the news home right away . "

116632	116644	116646	116646	Marilla	113	" It 's not the first time I 've been glad , "
116648	116660	116646	116646	Marilla	113	" You do like to rub things in , Matthew Cuthbert . "
116682	116696	116697	116697	she	217	" Are n't you proud of that Anne - girl ? I am , "
116783	116866	116771	116771	Anne	124	" Oh , Diana , it 's so good to be back again . It 's so good to see those pointed firs coming out against the pink sky -- and that white orchard and the old Snow Queen . Is n't the breath of the mint delicious ? And that tea rose -- why , it 's a song and a hope and a prayer all in one . And it 's _ good _ to see you again , Diana ! "
116867	116879	116881	116881	Diana	120	" I thought you liked that Stella Maynard better than me , "
116884	116902	116881	116881	Diana	120	" Josie Pye told me you did . Josie said you were _ infatuated _ with her . "
116911	116914	116771	116771	Anne	124	" June lilies "
116919	116939	116940	116940	she	124	" Stella Maynard is the dearest girl in the world except one and you are that one , Diana , "
116943	117015	116940	116940	she	124	" I love you more than ever -- and I 've so many things to tell you . But just now I feel as if it were joy enough to sit here and look at you . I 'm tired , I think -- tired of being studious and ambitious . I mean to spend at least two hours tomorrow lying out in the orchard grass , thinking of absolutely nothing . "
117016	117039	116771	116771	Anne	124	" You 've done splendidly , Anne . I suppose you wo n't be teaching now that you 've won the Avery ? "
117040	117106	116940	116940	she	124	" No . I 'm going to Redmond in September . Does n't it seem wonderful ? I 'll have a brand new stock of ambition laid in by that time after three glorious , golden months of vacation . Jane and Ruby are going to teach . Is n't it splendid to think we all got through even to Moody Spurgeon and Josie Pye ? "
117107	117118	117120	117120	Diana	120	" The Newbridge trustees have offered Jane their school already , "
117122	117177	117120	117120	Diana	120	" Gilbert Blythe is going to teach , too . He has to . His father ca n't afford to send him to college next year , after all , so he means to earn his own way through . I expect he 'll get the school here if Miss Ames decides to leave . "
117269	117272	117273	117273	she	124	" Marilla , "
117282	117288	117273	117273	she	124	" is Matthew quite well ? "
117289	117296	117298	117298	Marilla	113	" No , he is n't , "
117304	117378	117298	117298	Marilla	113	" He 's had some real bad spells with his heart this spring and he wo n't spare himself a mite . I 've been real worried about him , but he 's some better this while back and we 've got a good hired man , so I 'm hoping he 'll kind of rest and pick up . Maybe he will now you 're home . You always cheer him up . "
117393	117477	117273	117273	she	124	" You are not looking as well yourself as I 'd like to see you , Marilla . You look tired . I 'm afraid you 've been working too hard . You must take a rest , now that I 'm home . I 'm just going to take this one day off to visit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams , and then it will be your turn to be lazy while I do the work . "
117485	117661	117273	117273	she	124	" It 's not the work -- it 's my head . I 've got a pain so often now -- behind my eyes . Doctor Spencer 's been fussing with glasses , but they do n't do me any good . There is a distinguished oculist coming to the Island the last of June and the doctor says I must see him . I guess I 'll have to . I ca n't read or sew with any comfort now . Well , Anne , you 've done real well at Queen 's I must say . To take First Class License in one year and win the Avery scholarship -- well , well , Mrs. Lynde says pride goes before a fall and she does n't believe in the higher education of women at all ; she says it unfits them for woman 's true sphere . I do n't believe a word of it . Speaking of Rachel reminds me -- did you hear anything about the Abbey Bank lately , Anne ? "
117662	117669	117671	117671	Anne	124	" I heard it was shaky , "
117673	117676	117671	117671	Anne	124	" Why ? "
117677	117769	117273	117273	she	124	" That is what Rachel said . She was up here one day last week and said there was some talk about it . Matthew felt real worried . All we have saved is in that bank -- every penny . I wanted Matthew to put it in the Savings Bank in the first place , but old Mr. Abbey was a great friend of father 's and he 'd always banked with him . Matthew said any bank with him at the head of it was good enough for anybody . "
117770	117784	117786	117786	Anne	124	" I think he has only been its nominal head for many years , "
117788	117807	117786	117786	Anne	124	" He is a very old man ; his nephews are really at the head of the institution . "
117808	117848	117898	117898	she	124	" Well , when Rachel told us that , I wanted Matthew to draw our money right out and he said he 'd think of it . But Mr. Russell told him yesterday that the bank was all right . "
117991	118002	118003	118003	she	232	" You 've been working too hard today , Matthew , "
118007	118016	118003	118003	she	232	" Why wo n't you take things easier ? "
118017	118027	118029	118029	Matthew	107	" Well now , I ca n't seem to , "
118043	118078	118032	118032	he	107	" It 's only that I 'm getting old , Anne , and keep forgetting it . Well , well , I 've always worked pretty hard and I 'd rather drop in harness . "
118079	118090	118092	118092	Anne	232	" If I had been the boy you sent for , "
118095	118131	118092	118092	Anne	232	" I 'd be able to help you so much now and spare you in a hundred ways . I could find it in my heart to wish I had been , just for that . "
118132	118148	118150	118150	Matthew	107	" Well now , I 'd rather have you than a dozen boys , Anne , "
118155	118202	118150	118150	Matthew	107	" Just mind you that -- rather than a dozen boys . Well now , I guess it was n't a boy that took the Avery scholarship , was it ? It was a girl -- my girl -- my girl that I 'm proud of . "
118333	118349	118352	118352	Marilla	113	" MATTHEW -- Matthew -- what is the matter ? Matthew , are you sick ? "
118453	118458	118460	118460	Marilla	113	" He 's fainted , "
118462	118479	118460	118460	Marilla	113	" Anne , run for Martin -- quick , quick ! He 's at the barn . "
118579	118584	118585	118585	she	105	" Oh , Marilla , "
118589	118602	118585	118585	she	105	" I do n't think -- we can do anything for him . "
118603	118620	118621	118621	Anne	232	" Mrs. Lynde , you do n't think -- you ca n't think Matthew is -- is-- "
118635	118669	118690	118690	he	2016	" Child , yes , I 'm afraid of it . Look at his face . When you 've seen that look as often as I have you 'll know what it means . "
118964	118979	118945	118945	Diana	120	" Anne dear , would you like to have me sleep with you tonight ? "
118980	118986	118987	118987	Anne	232	" Thank you , Diana . "
118996	119097	118987	118987	Anne	232	" I think you wo n't misunderstand me when I say I want to be alone . I 'm not afraid . I have n't been alone one minute since it happened -- and I want to be . I want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it . I ca n't realize it . Half the time it seems to me that Matthew ca n't be dead ; and the other half it seems as if he must have been dead for a long time and I 've had this horrible dull ache ever since . "
119339	119351	119335	119335	his	107	" My girl -- my girl that I 'm proud of . "
119373	119432	119335	119335	his	107	" There -- there -- don't cry so , dearie . It ca n't bring him back . It -- it -- isn't right to cry so . I knew that today , but I could n't help it then . He 'd always been such a good , kind brother to me -- but God knows best . "
119433	119443	119445	119445	Anne	232	" Oh , just let me cry , Marilla , "
119447	119537	119445	119445	Anne	232	" The tears do n't hurt me like that ache did . Stay here for a little while with me and keep your arm round me -- so . I could n't have Diana stay , she 's good and kind and sweet -- but it 's not her sorrow -- she 's outside of it and she could n't come close enough to my heart to help me . It 's our sorrow -- yours and mine . Oh , Marilla , what will we do without him ? "
119538	119669	119673	119673	they	1963	" We 've got each other , Anne . I do n't know what I 'd do if you were n't here -- if you 'd never come . Oh , Anne , I know I 've been kind of strict and harsh with you maybe -- but you must n't think I did n't love you as well as Matthew did , for all that . I want to tell you now when I can . It 's never been easy for me to say things out of my heart , but at times like this it 's easier . I love you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood and you 've been my joy and comfort ever since you came to Green Gables . "
119741	119748	119749	119749	Anne	232	" loss in all familiar things . "
119879	119901	119902	119902	she	232	" It seems like disloyalty to Matthew , somehow , to find pleasure in these things now that he has gone , "
119919	119983	119902	119902	she	232	" I miss him so much -- all the time -- and yet , Mrs. Allan , the world and life seem very beautiful and interesting to me for all . Today Diana said something funny and I found myself laughing . I thought when it happened I could never laugh again . And it somehow seems as if I ought n't to . "
119984	120011	120013	120014	Mrs. Allan	232	" When Matthew was here he liked to hear you laugh and he liked to know that you found pleasure in the pleasant things around you , "
120017	120115	120013	120014	Mrs. Allan	232	" He is just away now ; and he likes to know it just the same . I am sure we should not shut our hearts against the healing influences that nature offers us . But I can understand your feeling . I think we all experience the same thing . We resent the thought that anything can please us when someone we love is no longer here to share the pleasure with us , and we almost feel as if we were unfaithful to our sorrow when we find our interest in life returning to us . "
120116	120134	120136	120136	Anne	232	" I was down to the graveyard to plant a rosebush on Matthew 's grave this afternoon , "
120139	120261	120136	120136	Anne	232	" I took a slip of the little white Scotch rosebush his mother brought out from Scotland long ago ; Matthew always liked those roses the best -- they were so small and sweet on their thorny stems . It made me feel glad that I could plant it by his grave -- as if I were doing something that must please him in taking it there to be near him . I hope he has roses like them in heaven . Perhaps the souls of all those little white roses that he has loved so many summers were all there to meet him . I must go home now . Marilla is all alone and she gets lonely at twilight . "
120262	120280	120282	120283	Mrs. Allan	232	" She will be lonelier still , I fear , when you go away again to college , "
120380	120390	120391	120391	Marilla	113	" Doctor Spencer was here while you were away , "
120394	120483	120391	120391	Marilla	113	" He says that the specialist will be in town tomorrow and he insists that I must go in and have my eyes examined . I suppose I 'd better go and have it over . I 'll be more than thankful if the man can give me the right kind of glasses to suit my eyes . You wo n't mind staying here alone while I 'm away , will you ? Martin will have to drive me in and there 's ironing and baking to do . "
120484	120527	120377	120377	she	232	" I shall be all right . Diana will come over for company for me . I shall attend to the ironing and baking beautifully -- you need n't fear that I 'll starch the handkerchiefs or flavor the cake with liniment . "
120531	120572	120377	120377	she	232	" What a girl you were for making mistakes in them days , Anne . You were always getting into scrapes . I did use to think you were possessed . Do you mind the time you dyed your hair ? "
120573	120584	120586	120586	Anne	232	" Yes , indeed . I shall never forget it , "
120602	120760	120586	120586	Anne	232	" I laugh a little now sometimes when I think what a worry my hair used to be to me -- but I do n't laugh _ much _ , because it was a very real trouble then . I did suffer terribly over my hair and my freckles . My freckles are really gone ; and people are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn now -- all but Josie Pye . She informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder than ever , or at least my black dress made it look redder , and she asked me if people who had red hair ever got used to having it . Marilla , I 've almost decided to give up trying to like Josie Pye . I 've made what I would once have called a heroic effort to like her , but Josie Pye wo n't _ be _ liked . "
120761	120767	120769	120769	Marilla	113	" Josie is a Pye , "
120772	120821	120769	120769	Marilla	113	" so she ca n't help being disagreeable . I suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in society , but I must say I do n't know what it is any more than I know the use of thistles . Is Josie going to teach ? "
120822	120868	120586	120586	Anne	232	" No , she is going back to Queen 's next year . So are Moody Spurgeon and Charlie Sloane . Jane and Ruby are going to teach and they have both got schools -- Jane at Newbridge and Ruby at some place up west . "
120869	120882	120769	120769	Marilla	113	" Gilbert Blythe is going to teach too , is n't he ? "
120883	120884	120586	120586	Anne	232	" Yes"--briefly
120886	120896	120898	120898	Marilla	113	" What a nice - looking fellow he is , "
120901	120954	120898	120898	Marilla	113	" I saw him in church last Sunday and he seemed so tall and manly . He looks a lot like his father did at the same age . John Blythe was a nice boy . We used to be real good friends , he and I. People called him my beau . "
120962	120973	120955	120955	Anne	232	" Oh , Marilla -- and what happened?--why did n't you-- "
120974	121048	120586	120586	Anne	232	" We had a quarrel . I would n't forgive him when he asked me to . I meant to , after awhile -- but I was sulky and angry and I wanted to punish him first . He never came back -- the Blythes were all mighty independent . But I always felt -- rather sorry . I 've always kind of wished I 'd forgiven him when I had the chance . "
121049	121064	121066	121066	Anne	232	" So you 've had a bit of romance in your life , too , "
121069	121131	121181	121181	her	113	" Yes , I suppose you might call it that . You would n't think so to look at me , would you ? But you never can tell about people from their outsides . Everybody has forgot about me and John . I 'd forgotten myself . But it all came back to me when I saw Gilbert last Sunday . "
121208	121216	121186	121186	her	113	" Are you very tired , Marilla ? "
121217	121227	121229	121229	Marilla	113	" Yes -- no -- I do n't know , "
121235	121254	121229	121229	Marilla	113	" I suppose I am tired but I have n't thought about it . It 's not that . "
121255	121267	121269	121269	Anne	232	" Did you see the oculist ? What did he say ? "
121272	121368	121229	121229	Marilla	113	" Yes , I saw him . He examined my eyes . He says that if I give up all reading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes , and if I 'm careful not to cry , and if I wear the glasses he 's given me he thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured . But if I do n't he says I 'll certainly be stone - blind in six months . Blind ! Anne , just think of it ! "
121410	121455	121398	121398	she	232	" Marilla , _ do n't _ think of it . You know he has given you hope . If you are careful you wo n't lose your sight altogether ; and if his glasses cure your headaches it will be a great thing . "
121456	121465	121467	121467	Marilla	113	" I do n't call it much hope , "
121470	121580	121467	121467	Marilla	113	" What am I to live for if I ca n't read or sew or do anything like that ? I might as well be blind -- or dead . And as for crying , I ca n't help that when I get lonesome . But there , it 's no good talking about it . If you 'll get me a cup of tea I 'll be thankful . I 'm about done out . Do n't say anything about this to any one for a spell yet , anyway . I ca n't bear that folks should come here to question and sympathize and talk about it . "
121763	121772	121749	121749	he	1979	" What did Mr. Sadler want , Marilla ? "
121805	121823	121798	121798	her	113	" He heard that I was going to sell Green Gables and he wants to buy it . "
121824	121832	121833	121833	Anne	232	" Buy it ! Buy Green Gables ? "
121841	121855	121833	121833	Anne	232	" Oh , Marilla , you do n't mean to sell Green Gables ! "
121856	122078	121802	121802	she	113	" Anne , I do n't know what else is to be done . I 've thought it all over . If my eyes were strong I could stay here and make out to look after things and manage , with a good hired man . But as it is I ca n't . I may lose my sight altogether ; and anyway I 'll not be fit to run things . Oh , I never thought I 'd live to see the day when I 'd have to sell my home . But things would only go behind worse and worse all the time , till nobody would want to buy it . Every cent of our money went in that bank ; and there 's some notes Matthew gave last fall to pay . Mrs. Lynde advises me to sell the farm and board somewhere -- with her I suppose . It wo n't bring much -- it 's small and the buildings are old . But it 'll be enough for me to live on I reckon . I 'm thankful you 're provided for with that scholarship , Anne . I 'm sorry you wo n't have a home to come to in your vacations , that 's all , but I suppose you 'll manage somehow . "
122086	122094	122096	122096	Anne	232	" You must n't sell Green Gables , "
122099	122146	121833	121833	Anne	232	" Oh , Anne , I wish I did n't have to . But you can see for yourself . I ca n't stay here alone . I 'd go crazy with trouble and loneliness . And my sight would go -- I know it would . "
122147	122172	122079	122079	Marilla	113	" You wo n't have to stay here alone , Marilla . I 'll be with you . I 'm not going to Redmond . "
122173	122179	122180	122180	Marilla	113	" Not going to Redmond ! "
122193	122201	122180	122180	Marilla	113	" Why , what do you mean ? "
122202	122444	122449	122453	a woman in a dream	1980	" Just what I say . I 'm not going to take the scholarship . I decided so the night after you came home from town . You surely do n't think I could leave you alone in your trouble , Marilla , after all you 've done for me . I 've been thinking and planning . Let me tell you my plans . Mr. Barry wants to rent the farm for next year . So you wo n't have any bother over that . And I 'm going to teach . I 've applied for the school here -- but I do n't expect to get it for I understand the trustees have promised it to Gilbert Blythe . But I can have the Carmody school -- Mr. Blair told me so last night at the store . Of course that wo n't be quite as nice or convenient as if I had the Avonlea school . But I can board home and drive myself over to Carmody and back , in the warm weather at least . And even in winter I can come home Fridays . We 'll keep a horse for that . Oh , I have it all planned out , Marilla . And I 'll read to you and keep you cheered up . You sha'n't be dull or lonesome . And we 'll be real cozy and happy here together , you and I. "
122455	122491	122449	122453	a woman in a dream	1980	" Oh , Anne , I could get on real well if you were here , I know . But I ca n't let you sacrifice yourself so for me . It would be terrible . "
122492	122495	122496	122496	Anne	232	" Nonsense ! "
122500	122569	122496	122496	Anne	232	" There is no sacrifice . Nothing could be worse than giving up Green Gables -- nothing could hurt me more . We must keep the dear old place . My mind is quite made up , Marilla . I 'm _ not _ going to Redmond ; and I _ am _ going to stay here and teach . Do n't you worry about me a bit . "
122570	122576	122449	122453	a woman in a dream	1980	" But your ambitions -- and-- "
122577	122787	122496	122496	Anne	232	" I 'm just as ambitious as ever . Only , I 've changed the object of my ambitions . I 'm going to be a good teacher -- and I 'm going to save your eyesight . Besides , I mean to study at home here and take a little college course all by myself . Oh , I 've dozens of plans , Marilla . I 've been thinking them out for a week . I shall give life here my best , and I believe it will give its best to me in return . When I left Queen 's my future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road . I thought I could see along it for many a milestone . Now there is a bend in it . I do n't know what lies around the bend , but I 'm going to believe that the best does . It has a fascination of its own , that bend , Marilla . I wonder how the road beyond it goes -- what there is of green glory and soft , checkered light and shadows -- what new landscapes -- what new beauties -- what curves and hills and valleys further on . "
122788	122804	122806	122806	Marilla	113	" I do n't feel as if I ought to let you give it up , "
122813	122842	122844	122844	Anne	232	" But you ca n't prevent me . I 'm sixteen and a half , ? obstinate as a mule , ' as Mrs. Lynde once told me , "
122846	122905	122844	122844	Anne	232	" Oh , Marilla , do n't you go pitying me . I do n't like to be pitied , and there is no need for it . I 'm heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear Green Gables . Nobody could love it as you and I do -- so we must keep it . "
122906	122911	122913	122913	Marilla	113	" You blessed girl ! "
122917	122969	122913	122913	Marilla	113	" I feel as if you 'd given me new life . I guess I ought to stick out and make you go to college -- but I know I ca n't , so I ai n't going to try . I 'll make it up to you though , Anne . "
123141	123260	123108	123110	her substantial person	1987	" I declare I 'm getting glad to sit down . I 've been on my feet all day , and two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round . It 's a great blessing not to be fat , Marilla . I hope you appreciate it . Well , Anne , I hear you 've given up your notion of going to college . I was real glad to hear it . You 've got as much education now as a woman can be comfortable with . I do n't believe in girls going to college with the men and cramming their heads full of Latin and Greek and all that nonsense . "
123261	123278	123280	123280	Anne	232	" But I 'm going to study Latin and Greek just the same , Mrs. Lynde , "
123283	123307	123280	123280	Anne	232	" I 'm going to take my Arts course right here at Green Gables , and study everything that I would at college . "
123317	123326	123108	123110	her substantial person	1987	" Anne Shirley , you 'll kill yourself . "
123327	123402	123108	123110	her substantial person	1987	" Not a bit of it . I shall thrive on it . Oh , I 'm not going to overdo things . As ? Josiah Allen 's wife , ' says , I shall be ? mejum ' . But I 'll have lots of spare time in the long winter evenings , and I 've no vocation for fancy work . I 'm going to teach over at Carmody , you know . "
123403	123432	123108	123110	her substantial person	1987	" I do n't know it . I guess you 're going to teach right here in Avonlea . The trustees have decided to give you the school . "
123433	123437	123439	123439	Anne	124	" Mrs. Lynde ! "
123449	123462	123439	123439	Anne	124	" Why , I thought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe ! "
123463	123612	123108	123110	her substantial person	1987	" So they did . But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it he went to them -- they had a business meeting at the school last night , you know -- and told them that he withdrew his application , and suggested that they accept yours . He said he was going to teach at White Sands . Of course he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla , and I must say I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him , that 's what . Real self - sacrificing , too , for he 'll have his board to pay at White Sands , and everybody knows he 's got to earn his own way through college . So the trustees decided to take you . I was tickled to death when Thomas came home and told me . "
123613	123625	123627	123627	Anne	124	" I do n't feel that I ought to take it , "
123629	123651	123627	123627	Anne	124	" I mean -- I do n't think I ought to let Gilbert make such a sacrifice for -- for me . "
123652	123782	123108	123110	her substantial person	1987	" I guess you ca n't prevent him now . He 's signed papers with the White Sands trustees . So it would n't do him any good now if you were to refuse . Of course you 'll take the school . You 'll get along all right , now that there are no Pyes going . Josie was the last of them , and a good thing she was , that 's what . There 's been some Pye or other going to Avonlea school for the last twenty years , and I guess their mission in life was to keep school teachers reminded that earth is n't their home . Bless my heart ! What does all that winking and blinking at the Barry gable mean ? "
123783	123793	123795	123795	Anne	124	" Diana is signaling for me to go over , "
123797	123819	123795	123795	Anne	124	" You know we keep up the old custom . Excuse me while I run over and see what she wants . "
123848	123864	123820	123820	Anne	124	" There 's a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways . "
123865	123880	123882	123882	Marilla	113	" There 's a good deal more of the woman about her in others , "
123912	123925	123904	123905	Mrs. Lynde	105	" Marilla Cuthbert has got _ mellow _ . That 's what . "
124021	124027	124017	124017	her	124	afterlight--"a haunt of ancient peace . "
124121	124126	124127	124127	she	124	" Dear old world , "
124130	124146	124127	124127	she	124	" you are very lovely , and I am glad to be alive in you . "
124207	124210	124211	124211	she	124	" Gilbert , "
124218	124250	124211	124211	she	124	" I want to thank you for giving up the school for me . It was very good of you -- and I want you to know that I appreciate it . "
124258	124302	124251	124251	Gilbert	140	" It was n't particularly good of me at all , Anne . I was pleased to be able to do you some small service . Are we going to be friends after this ? Have you really forgiven me my old fault ? "
124313	124358	124251	124251	Gilbert	140	" I forgave you that day by the pond landing , although I did n't know it . What a stubborn little goose I was . I 've been -- I may as well make a complete confession -- I've been sorry ever since . "
124359	124370	124372	124372	Gilbert	140	" We are going to be the best of friends , "
124376	124431	124372	124372	Gilbert	140	" We were born to be good friends , Anne . You 've thwarted destiny enough . I know we can help each other in many ways . You are going to keep up your studies , are n't you ? So am I. Come , I 'm going to walk home with you . "
124444	124457	124251	124251	Gilbert	140	" Who was that came up the lane with you , Anne ? "
124458	124462	124464	124464	Anne	124	" Gilbert Blythe , "
124472	124481	124469	124469	herself	124	" I met him on Barry 's hill . "
124482	124510	124512	124512	Marilla	113	" I did n't think you and Gilbert Blythe were such good friends that you 'd stand for half an hour at the gate talking to him , "
124518	124582	124469	124469	herself	124	" We have n't been -- we've been good enemies . But we have decided that it will be much more sensible to be good friends in the future . Were we really there half an hour ? It seemed just a few minutes . But , you see , we have five years ' lost conversations to catch up with , Marilla . "
124721	124737	124739	124739	Anne	124	" ? God 's in his heaven , all 's right with the world , ' "
