7569	7649	7564	7564	She	596	" If I 'd done it at the right time , yes : but now that there 's been a delay I think you must explain that I 'd asked you to tell her at the Opera , before our speaking about it to everybody here . Otherwise she might think I had forgotten her . You see , she 's one of the family , and she 's been away so long that she 's rather -- sensitive . "
7656	7669	7650	7650	Archer	215	" Dear and great angel ! Of course I 'll tell her . "
7682	7695	7670	7670	He	788	" But I have n't seen her yet . Has she come ? "
7696	7708	7650	7650	Archer	215	" No ; at the last minute she decided not to . "

7732	7742	7743	7745	the young girl	790	" Yes . She 's awfully fond of dancing , "
7749	7785	7743	7745	the young girl	790	" But suddenly she made up her mind that her dress was n't smart enough for a ball , though we thought it so lovely ; and so my aunt had to take her home . "
7786	7790	7792	7792	Archer	215	" Oh , well-- "

8976	9012	9014	9014	she	841	" very liberal . In my time a cameo set in pearls was thought sufficient . But it 's the hand that sets off the ring , is n't it , my dear Mr. Archer ? "
9038	9094	9095	9095	she	841	" Mine was modelled in Rome by the great Ferrigiani . You should have May 's done : no doubt he 'll have it done , my child . Her hand is large -- it 's these modern sports that spread the joints -- but the skin is white.--And when 's the wedding to be ? "

9182	9243	9178	9179	the ancestress	841	" Know each other ? Fiddlesticks ! Everybody in New York has always known everybody . Let the young man have his way , my dear ; do n't wait till the bubble 's off the wine . Marry them before Lent ; I may catch pneumonia any winter now , and I want to give the wedding - breakfast . "
9320	9331	9309	9310	Mrs. Mingott	217	" Ha ! Beaufort , this is a rare favour ! "
9347	9357	9359	9360	the visitor	849	" Thanks . I wish it might happen oftener , "
9367	9398	9359	9360	the visitor	849	" I 'm generally so tied down ; but I met the Countess Ellen in Madison Square , and she was good enough to let me walk home with her . "
9399	9416	9418	9419	Mrs. Mingott	217	" Ah -- I hope the house will be gayer , now that Ellen 's here ! "
9425	9478	9418	9419	Mrs. Mingott	217	" Sit down -- sit down , Beaufort : push up the yellow armchair ; now I 've got you I want a good gossip . I hear your ball was magnificent ; and I understand you invited Mrs. Lemuel Struthers ? Well -- I've a curiosity to see the woman myself . "
9590	9625	9626	9629	the carnivorous old lady	855	" Of course if you and Regina invite her the thing is settled . Well , we need new blood and new money -- and I hear she 's still very good - looking , "
9662	9674	9675	9675	he	256	" Of course you know already -- about May and me , "
9686	9723	9675	9675	he	256	" She scolded me for not giving you the news last night at the Opera : I had her orders to tell you that we were engaged -- but I could n't , in that crowd . "
9751	9777	9778	9779	The ladies	735	" Of course I know ; yes . And I 'm so glad . But one does n't tell such things first in a crowd . "
9791	9803	9804	9804	she	235	" Good - bye ; come and see me some day , "
9859	9888	9854	9855	Mrs. Welland	219	" It 's a mistake for Ellen to be seen , the very day after her arrival , parading up Fifth Avenue at the crowded hour with Julius Beaufort-- "
9897	9939	9890	9892	the young man	511	" And she ought to know that a man who 's just engaged does n't spend his time calling on married women . But I daresay in the set she 's lived in they do -- they never do anything else . "

11059	11072	11054	11055	Mrs. Archer	215	" But then Regina always does what he tells her ; and BEAUFORT-- "
11073	11079	11081	11082	Mr. Jackson	225	" Certain nuances escape Beaufort , "
11134	11145	11147	11148	Mrs. Archer	215	" Oh , necessarily ; Beaufort is a vulgar man , "
11150	11205	11206	11206	She	215	" My grandfather Newland always used to say to my mother : ' Whatever you do , do n't let that fellow Beaufort be introduced to the girls . ' But at least he 's had the advantage of associating with gentlemen ; in England too , they say . It 's all very mysterious-- "
11242	11248	11249	11250	Mrs. Archer	215	" But this Mrs. Struthers , "
11253	11263	11249	11250	Mrs. Archer	215	" what did you say SHE was , Sillerton ? "
11264	11305	11306	11307	Mr. Jackson	225	" Out of a mine : or rather out of the saloon at the head of the pit . Then with Living Wax - Works , touring New England . After the police broke THAT up , they say she lived-- "
11338	11341	11342	11343	Mr. Jackson	225	" Then , "
11369	11414	11342	11343	Mr. Jackson	225	" then Lemuel Struthers came along . They say his advertiser used the girl 's head for the shoe - polish posters ; her hair 's intensely black , you know -- the Egyptian style . Anyhow , he -- eventually -- married her . "
11424	11426	11342	11343	Mr. Jackson	225	" eventually "
11438	11457	11459	11460	Mrs. Archer	215	" Oh , well -- at the pass we 've come to nowadays , it does n't matter , "

11576	11586	11588	11588	she	215	" Especially after that silly business with Mrs. Rushworth , "
11759	11798	11799	11800	Mrs. Archer	215	" It 's not that I do n't approve of the Mingotts ' esprit de corps ; but why Newland 's engagement should be mixed up with that Olenska woman 's comings and goings I do n't see , "
11883	11894	11873	11873	she	215	" I 'm thankful that Augusta Welland received us alone . "
11950	11981	11946	11946	he	264	" Oh , well , there 's always a phase of family parties to be gone through when one gets engaged , and the sooner it 's over the better . "

12255	12265	12249	12250	Mr. Jackson	225	" No , she was NOT at the ball . "

12320	12350	12304	12305	Mr. Jackson	225	" Mrs. Beaufort may not -- but Beaufort certainly does , for she was seen walking up Fifth Avenue this afternoon with him by the whole of New York . "

12376	12392	12393	12393	Janey	264	" I wonder if she wears a round hat or a bonnet in the afternoon , "
12396	12420	12393	12393	Janey	264	" At the Opera I know she had on dark blue velvet , perfectly plain and flat -- like a night - gown . "
12421	12424	12426	12427	her mother	587	" Janey ! "
12439	12457	12458	12459	Mrs. Archer	215	" It was , at any rate , in better taste not to go to the ball , "
12472	12506	12467	12468	her son	648	" I do n't think it was a question of taste with her . May said she meant to go , and then decided that the dress in question was n't smart enough . "
12517	12521	12522	12522	she	215	" Poor Ellen , "
12529	12568	12522	12522	she	215	" We must always bear in mind what an eccentric bringing - up Medora Manson gave her . What can you expect of a girl who was allowed to wear black satin at her coming - out ball ? "
12569	12579	12581	12582	Mr. Jackson	225	" Ah -- don't I remember her in it ! "
12586	12590	12581	12582	Mr. Jackson	225	" Poor girl ! "
12614	12619	12620	12620	Janey	264	" It 's odd , "
12623	12644	12620	12620	Janey	264	" that she should have kept such an ugly name as Ellen . I should have changed it to Elaine . "
12661	12665	12657	12658	Her brother	956	" Why Elaine ? "
12666	12679	12681	12681	Janey	264	" I do n't know ; it sounds more -- more Polish , "
12685	12700	12702	12703	Mrs. Archer	215	" It sounds more conspicuous ; and that can hardly be what she wishes , "

12908	12959	12904	12904	he	511	" that the secretary helped her to get away from her brute of a husband , who kept her practically a prisoner ? Well , what if he did ? I hope there is n't a man among us who would n't have done the same in such a case . "
12973	12985	12960	12961	Mr. Jackson	225	" Perhaps ... that sauce ... just a little , after all-- "
12996	13013	12993	12993	he	225	" I 'm told she 's looking for a house . She means to live here . "

13315	13362	13312	13312	Newland	215	" Living together ? Well , why not ? Who had the right to make her life over if she had n't ? I 'm sick of the hypocrisy that would bury alive a woman of her age if her husband prefers to live with harlots . "

If there is one , neither the Mingotts nor the Mansons belong to it ; no , nor the Newlands or the Chiverses either . Our grandfathers and great - grandfathers were just respectable English or Dutch merchants , who came to the colonies to make their fortune , and stayed here because they did so well . One of your great - grandfathers signed the Declaration , and another was a general on Washington 's staff , and received General Burgoyne 's sword after the battle of Saratoga . These are things to be proud of , but they have nothing to do with rank or class . New York has always been a commercial community , and there are not more than three families in it who can claim an aristocratic origin in the real sense of the word . "

17673	17691	17692	17692	he	302	" You really think this is due to some -- some intentional interference of Lawrence Lefferts 's ? "
17699	17833	17663	17666	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" I 'm certain of it , sir . Larry has been going it rather harder than usual lately -- if cousin Louisa wo n't mind my mentioning it -- having rather a stiff affair with the postmaster 's wife in their village , or some one of that sort ; and whenever poor Gertrude Lefferts begins to suspect anything , and he 's afraid of trouble , he gets up a fuss of this kind , to show how awfully moral he is , and talks at the top of his voice about the impertinence of inviting his wife to meet people he does n't wish her to know . He 's simply using Madame Olenska as a lightning - rod ; I 've seen him try the same thing often before . "
17834	17837	17839	17842	Mrs. van der Luyden	296	" The LEFFERTSES!-- "
17844	17847	17849	17850	Mrs. Archer	215	" The LEFFERTSES!-- "
17852	17878	17849	17850	Mrs. Archer	215	" What would uncle Egmont have said of Lawrence Lefferts 's pronouncing on anybody 's social position ? It shows what Society has come to . "
17879	17891	17893	17896	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" We 'll hope it has not quite come to that , "
17899	17911	17913	17914	Mrs. Archer	215	" Ah , if only you and Louisa went out more ! "
18022	18057	18013	18014	Newland Archer	215	" Everybody in New York knows what you and cousin Louisa represent . That 's why Mrs. Mingott felt she ought not to allow this slight on Countess Olenska to pass without consulting you . "
18073	18082	18084	18087	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" It is the principle that I dislike , "
18089	18114	18084	18087	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" As long as a member of a well - known family is backed up by that family it should be considered -- final . "
18115	18122	18124	18125	his wife	553	" It seems so to me , "
18136	18142	18143	18146	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" I had no idea , "
18149	18159	18143	18146	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" that things had come to such a pass . "
18170	18208	18209	18209	He	645	" It occurs to me , my dear , that the Countess Olenska is already a sort of relation -- through Medora Manson 's first husband . At any rate , she will be when Newland marries . "
18216	18227	18209	18209	He	645	" Have you read this morning 's Times , Newland ? "
18228	18235	18237	18237	Archer	215	" Why , yes , sir , "
18301	18344	18345	18345	He	302	" If Louisa 's health allowed her to dine out -- I wish you would say to Mrs. Lovell Mingott -- she and I would have been happy to -- er -- fill the places of the Lawrence Leffertses at her dinner . "
18356	18365	18366	18367	Mrs. Archer	215	" As you know , this is impossible . "
18373	18440	18366	18367	Mrs. Archer	215	" But Newland tells me he has read this morning 's Times ; therefore he has probably seen that Louisa 's relative , the Duke of St. Austrey , arrives next week on the Russia . He is coming to enter his new sloop , the Guinevere , in next summer 's International Cup Race ; and also to have a little canvasback shooting at Trevenna . "
18454	18505	18441	18444	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" Before taking him down to Maryland we are inviting a few friends to meet him here -- only a little dinner -- with a reception afterward . I am sure Louisa will be as glad as I am if Countess Olenska will let us include her among our guests . "
18525	18560	18511	18511	his	302	" I think I have Louisa 's authority for saying that she will herself leave the invitation to dine when she drives out presently : with our cards -- of course with our cards . "
18619	18657	18658	18658	he	645	" There is nothing to thank me for , dear Adeline ; nothing whatever . This kind of thing must not happen in New York ; it shall not , as long as I can help it , "
18813	18824	18825	18825	VIII	313	" No one but Patti ought to attempt the Sonnambula . "

20658	20691	20692	20692	She	1255	" Oh , yes -- we used to see him every winter at Nice . He 's very fond of gambling -- he used to come to the house a great deal . "

20901	20913	20880	20880	She	1255	" Do you think , then , there is a limit ? "
20914	20930	20795	20795	her	1255	" To being in love ? If there is , I have n't found it ! "
20936	20947	20931	20931	She	1255	" Ah -- it 's really and truly a romance ? "
20948	20955	20880	20880	She	1255	" The most romantic of romances ! "
20956	20979	20931	20931	She	1255	" How delightful ! And you found it all out for yourselves -- it was not in the least arranged for you ? "
20986	20991	20992	20992	he	319	" Have you forgotten , "
20998	21015	20992	20992	he	319	" that in our country we do n't allow our marriages to be arranged for us ? "
21031	21034	21035	21035	she	1255	" Yes , "
21038	21076	21077	21077	She	1255	" I 'd forgotten . You must forgive me if I sometimes make these mistakes . I do n't always remember that everything here is good that was -- that was bad where I 've come from . "
21096	21102	21103	21103	he	319	" I 'm so sorry , "
21107	21118	21103	21103	he	319	" but you ARE among friends here , you know . "
21119	21193	21194	21194	she	1269	" Yes -- I know . Wherever I go I have that feeling . That 's why I came home . I want to forget everything else , to become a complete American again , like the Mingotts and Wellands , and you and your delightful mother , and all the other good people here tonight . Ah , here 's May arriving , and you will want to hurry away to her , "
21279	21282	21284	21284	Archer	215	" Oh , "
21286	21307	21284	21284	Archer	215	" I have so many rivals ; you see she 's already surrounded . There 's the Duke being introduced . "
21308	21317	21318	21319	Madame Olenska	241	" Then stay with me a little longer , "

24102	24136	24137	24137	She	1361	" Why -- have you waited long ? Mr. Beaufort took me to see a number of houses -- since it seems I 'm not to be allowed to stay in this one . "
24153	24192	24137	24137	She	1361	" I 've never been in a city where there seems to be such a feeling against living in des quartiers excentriques . What does it matter where one lives ? I 'm told this street is respectable . "
24193	24199	24257	24257	he	511	" It 's not fashionable . "
24200	24251	24137	24137	She	1361	" Fashionable ! Do you all think so much of that ? Why not make one 's own fashions ? But I suppose I 've lived too independently ; at any rate , I want to do what you all do -- I want to feel cared for and safe . "
24272	24291	24292	24292	he	511	" That 's what your friends want you to feel . New York 's an awfully safe place , "

24319	24347	24312	24312	she	1361	" Being here is like -- like -- being taken on a holiday when one has been a good little girl and done all one 's lessons . "
24493	24497	24498	24498	he	511	" Last night , "
24501	24519	24498	24498	he	511	" New York laid itself out for you . The van der Luydens do nothing by halves . "
24520	24546	24553	24553	she	1361	" No : how kind they are ! It was such a nice party . Every one seems to have such an esteem for them . "
24573	24579	24581	24581	Archer	215	" The van der Luydens , "
24590	24613	24581	24581	Archer	215	" are the most powerful influence in New York society . Unfortunately -- owing to her health -- they receive very seldom . "
24629	24637	24581	24581	Archer	215	" Is n't that perhaps the reason ? "
24638	24642	24581	24581	Archer	215	" The reason-- ? "
24643	24656	24581	24581	Archer	215	" For their great influence ; that they make themselves so rare . "
24718	24737	24738	24739	Madame Olenska	241	" But you 'll explain these things to me -- you'll tell me all I ought to know , "
24750	24778	24738	24739	Madame Olenska	241	" It 's you who are telling me ; opening my eyes to things I 'd looked at so long that I 'd ceased to see them . "
24815	24843	24738	24739	Madame Olenska	241	" Ah , then we can both help each other . But I want help so much more . You must tell me just what to do . "
24855	24866	24850	24850	his	511	" Do n't be seen driving about the streets with Beaufort-- "
25044	25057	25058	25058	Archer	215	" There are plenty of people to tell you what to do , "
25066	25079	25080	25080	She	1361	" Oh -- all my aunts ? And my dear old Granny ? "
25086	25119	25120	25120	He	1375	" They 're all a little vexed with me for setting up for myself -- poor Granny especially . She wanted to keep me with her ; but I had to be free-- "
25164	25173	25174	25174	he	1375	" I think I understand how you feel , "
25177	25194	25174	25174	he	1375	" Still , your family can advise you ; explain differences ; show you the way . "
25202	25231	25195	25195	She	241	" Is New York such a labyrinth ? I thought it so straight up and down -- like Fifth Avenue . And with all the cross streets numbered ! "
25255	25284	25251	25251	her	241	" If you knew how I like it for just THAT -- the straight - up - and - downness , and the big honest labels on everything ! "
25290	25301	25285	25285	He	1375	" Everything may be labelled -- but everybody is not . "
25302	25320	25321	25321	She	241	" Perhaps . I may simplify too much -- but you 'll warn me if I do . "
25331	25361	25321	25321	She	241	" There are only two people here who make me feel as if they understood what I mean and could explain things to me : you and Mr. Beaufort . "
25443	25492	25439	25439	He	1375	" I understand . But just at first do n't let go of your old friends ' hands : I mean the older women , your Granny Mingott , Mrs. Welland , Mrs. van der Luyden . They like and admire you -- they want to help you . "
25500	25562	25493	25493	She	241	" Oh , I know -- I know ! But on condition that they do n't hear anything unpleasant . Aunt Welland put it in those very words when I tried .... Does no one want to know the truth here , Mr. Archer ? The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend ! "
25582	25591	25592	25592	he	1377	" Madame Olenska!--Oh , do n't , Ellen , "
25641	25661	25662	25662	she	241	" Does no one cry here , either ? I suppose there 's no need to , in heaven , "
25692	25693	25694	25694	her	241	" Ellen"--called
25758	25761	25739	25740	Madame Olenska	241	" Gia -- gia"--and
25782	25819	25739	25740	Madame Olenska	241	" My dear Countess , I 've brought an old friend of mine to see you -- Mrs. Struthers . She was n't asked to the party last night , and she wants to know you . "
25885	25897	25899	25900	Mrs. Struthers	260	" Of course I want to know you , my dear , "
25916	26029	25899	25900	Mrs. Struthers	260	" I want to know everybody who 's young and interesting and charming . And the Duke tells me you like music -- didn't you , Duke ? You 're a pianist yourself , I believe ? Well , do you want to hear Sarasate play tomorrow evening at my house ? You know I 've something going on every Sunday evening -- it 's the day when New York does n't know what to do with itself , and so I say to it : ' Come and be amused . ' And the Duke thought you 'd be tempted by Sarasate . You 'll find a number of your friends . "
26039	26053	26030	26031	Madame Olenska	241	" How kind ! How good of the Duke to think of me ! "
26072	26083	26065	26066	Mrs. Struthers	260	" Of course I shall be too happy to come . "
26084	26101	26102	26103	Mrs. Struthers	260	" That 's all right , my dear . And bring your young gentleman with you . "
26113	26172	26102	26103	Mrs. Struthers	260	" I ca n't put a name to you -- but I 'm sure I 've met you -- I've met everybody , here , or in Paris or London . Are n't you in diplomacy ? All the diplomatists come to me . You like music too ? Duke , you must be sure to bring him . "
26176	26178	26173	26174	The Duke	339	" Rather "
26457	26464	26465	26465	he	256	" They 'll go at once ? "
26633	26656	26657	26657	she	226	" It 's so delicious -- waking every morning to smell lilies - of - the - valley in one 's room ! "
26660	26673	26601	26601	she	226	" Yesterday they came late . I had n't time in the morning-- "
26674	26733	26626	26626	possessorship	1400	" But your remembering each day to send them makes me love them so much more than if you 'd given a standing order , and they came every morning on the minute , like one 's music - teacher -- as I know Gertrude Lefferts 's did , for instance , when she and Lawrence were engaged . "
26734	26740	26742	26742	Archer	256	" Ah -- they would ! "
26767	26794	26749	26749	He	256	" When I sent your lilies yesterday afternoon I saw some rather gorgeous yellow roses and packed them off to Madame Olenska . Was that right ? "
26795	26873	26753	26753	her	226	" How dear of you ! Anything of that kind delights her . It 's odd she did n't mention it : she lunched with us today , and spoke of Mr. Beaufort 's having sent her wonderful orchids , and cousin Henry van der Luyden a whole hamper of carnations from Skuytercliff . She seems so surprised to receive flowers . Do n't people send them in Europe ? She thinks it such a pretty custom . "
26874	26888	26890	26890	Archer	256	" Oh , well , no wonder mine were overshadowed by Beaufort 's , "
26921	26929	26916	26916	He	256	" I called on your cousin yesterday , "
26993	27032	27054	27054	she	219	" If you call it long ! Isabel Chivers and Reggie were engaged for two years : Grace and Thorley for nearly a year and a half . Why are n't we very well off as we are ? "
27079	27081	27064	27064	she	219	" nice "
27089	27102	27103	27103	he	256	" Never , if we wo n't let them , I suppose , "
27116	27126	27103	27103	he	256	" Women ought to be as free as we are-- "
27239	27257	27273	27273	she	1403	" We might be much better off . We might be altogether together -- we might travel . "
27263	27269	27270	27270	she	1403	" That would be lovely , "
27293	27307	27308	27309	the wooer	1410	" As if the mere ' differently ' did n't account for it ! "
27312	27320	27321	27321	she	1403	" Newland ! You 're so original ! "
27375	27417	27352	27352	she	1403	" Original ! We 're all as like each other as those dolls cut out of the same folded paper . We 're like patterns stencilled on a wall . Ca n't you and I strike out for ourselves , May ? "
27443	27450	27451	27451	she	1403	" Mercy -- shall we elope ? "
27454	27458	27432	27432	her	1403	" If you would-- "
27459	27472	27432	27432	her	1403	" You DO love me , Newland ! I 'm so happy . "
27473	27482	27432	27432	her	1403	" But then -- why not be happier ? "
27483	27498	27432	27432	her	1403	" We ca n't behave like people in novels , though , can we ? "
27499	27509	27432	27432	her	1403	" Why not -- why not -- why not ? "
27539	27564	27565	27565	she	1403	" I 'm not clever enough to argue with you . But that kind of thing is rather -- vulgar , is n't it ? "
27583	27596	27565	27565	she	1403	" Are you so much afraid , then , of being vulgar ? "
27604	27616	27617	27617	she	1403	" Of course I should hate it -- so would you , "
27660	27712	27653	27653	she	1403	" Oh , did I tell you that I showed Ellen my ring ? She thinks it the most beautiful setting she ever saw . There 's nothing like it in the rue de la Paix , she said . I do love you , Newland , for being so artistic ! "
27806	27811	27812	27812	he	256	" Sameness -- sameness ! "
27936	27938	27941	27941	they	1420	" women "
28013	28025	28026	28026	people	619	" What if it had happened to Mrs. van der Luyden ? "
28074	28075	28072	28072	Swinburne	346	" Chastelard"--just
28102	28106	28086	28086	She	345	" Contes Drolatiques , "
28119	28126	28086	28086	She	345	" What learned things you read ! "
28127	28130	28131	28131	he	264	" Well-- ? "
28143	28149	28086	28086	She	345	" Mother 's very angry . "
28150	28159	28086	28086	She	345	" Angry ? With whom ? About what ? "
28160	28213	28086	28086	She	345	" Miss Sophy Jackson has just been here . She brought word that her brother would come in after dinner : she could n't say very much , because he forbade her to : he wishes to give all the details himself . He 's with cousin Louisa van der Luyden now . "
28214	28243	28086	28086	She	345	" For heaven 's sake , my dear girl , try a fresh start . It would take an omniscient Deity to know what you 're talking about . "
28244	28267	28086	28086	She	345	" It 's not a time to be profane , Newland .... Mother feels badly enough about your not going to church ... "
28278	28308	28086	28086	She	345	" NEWLAND ! Do listen . Your friend Madame Olenska was at Mrs. Lemuel Struthers 's party last night : she went there with the Duke and Mr. Beaufort . "
28332	28345	28329	28329	he	1435	" Well , what of it ? I knew she meant to . "
28355	28375	28346	28346	Janey	264	" You knew she meant to -- and you did n't try to stop her ? To warn her ? "
28376	28383	28384	28384	He	1435	" Stop her ? Warn her ? "
28388	28401	28384	28384	He	1435	" I 'm not engaged to be married to the Countess Olenska ! "
28413	28421	28346	28346	Janey	264	" You 're marrying into her family . "
28422	28429	28430	28430	he	1435	" Oh , family -- family ! "
28433	28442	28346	28346	Janey	264	" Newland -- don't you care about Family ? "
28443	28449	28346	28346	Janey	264	" Not a brass farthing . "
28450	28462	28346	28346	Janey	264	" Nor about what cousin Louisa van der Luyden will think ? "
28463	28479	28346	28346	Janey	264	" Not the half of one -- if she thinks such old maid 's rubbish . "
28480	28488	28490	28492	his virgin sister	1438	" Mother is not an old maid , "
28503	28540	28497	28497	He	1435	" Yes , she is , and so are the van der Luydens , and so we all are , when it comes to being so much as brushed by the wing - tip of Reality . "
28563	28581	28544	28544	her	1438	" Hang Countess Olenska ! Do n't be a goose , Janey -- I'm not her keeper . "
28582	28627	28544	28544	her	1438	" No ; but you DID ask the Wellands to announce your engagement sooner so that we might all back her up ; and if it had n't been for that cousin Louisa would never have invited her to the dinner for the Duke . "
28628	28666	28544	28544	her	1438	" Well -- what harm was there in inviting her ? She was the best - looking woman in the room ; she made the dinner a little less funereal than the usual van der Luyden banquet . "
28667	28719	28544	28544	her	1438	" You know cousin Henry asked her to please you : he persuaded cousin Louisa . And now they 're so upset that they 're going back to Skuytercliff tomorrow . I think , Newland , you 'd better come down . You do n't seem to understand how mother feels . "
28741	28747	28730	28730	She	512	" Has Janey told you ? "
28748	28751	28752	28752	He	1440	" Yes . "
28764	28774	28756	28756	his	1440	" But I ca n't take it very seriously . "
28775	28788	28730	28730	She	512	" Not the fact of having offended cousin Louisa and cousin Henry ? "
28789	28816	28756	28756	his	1440	" The fact that they can be offended by such a trifle as Countess Olenska 's going to the house of a woman they consider common . "
28817	28820	28730	28730	She	512	" Consider-- ! "
28821	28851	28756	28756	his	1440	" Well , who is ; but who has good music , and amuses people on Sunday evenings , when the whole of New York is dying of inanition . "
28852	28892	28730	28730	She	512	" Good music ? All I know is , there was a woman who got up on a table and sang the things they sing at the places you go to in Paris . There was smoking and champagne . "
28893	28912	28756	28756	his	1440	" Well -- that kind of thing happens in other places , and the world still goes on . "
28913	28929	28730	28730	She	512	" I do n't suppose , dear , you 're really defending the French Sunday ? "
28930	28952	28756	28756	his	1440	" I 've heard you often enough , mother , grumble at the English Sunday when we 've been in London . "
28953	28962	28730	28730	She	512	" New York is neither Paris nor London . "
28963	28972	28756	28756	his	1440	" Oh , no , it 's not ! "
28977	29037	29081	29081	she	512	" You mean , I suppose , that society here is not as brilliant ? You 're right , I daresay ; but we belong here , and people should respect our ways when they come among us . Ellen Olenska especially : she came back to get away from the kind of life people lead in brilliant societies . "
29051	29076	29077	29077	He	648	" I was going to put on my bonnet and ask you to take me to see cousin Louisa for a moment before dinner . "
29084	29135	29136	29136	she	512	" I thought you might explain to her what you 've just said : that society abroad is different ... that people are not as particular , and that Madame Olenska may not have realised how we feel about such things . It would be , you know , dear , "
29143	29153	29136	29136	she	512	" in Madame Olenska 's interest if you did . "
29154	29218	29081	29081	she	512	" Dearest mother , I really do n't see how we 're concerned in the matter . The Duke took Madame Olenska to Mrs. Struthers's -- in fact he brought Mrs. Struthers to call on her . I was there when they came . If the van der Luydens want to quarrel with anybody , the real culprit is under their own roof . "
29219	29273	29136	29136	she	512	" Quarrel ? Newland , did you ever know of cousin Henry 's quarrelling ? Besides , the Duke 's his guest ; and a stranger too . Strangers do n't discriminate : how should they ? Countess Olenska is a New Yorker , and should have respected the feelings of New York . "
29274	29297	29081	29081	she	512	" Well , then , if they must have a victim , you have my leave to throw Madame Olenska to them , "
29304	29323	29081	29081	she	512	" I do n't see myself -- or you either -- offering ourselves up to expiate her crimes . "
29324	29336	29337	29338	his mother	512	" Oh , of course you see only the Mingott side , "
29366	29373	29353	29355	The sad butler	960	" Mr. Henry van der Luyden . "
29389	29393	29394	29394	she	215	" Another lamp , "
29433	29443	29444	29444	he	648	" We were just talking about you , sir , "
29489	29495	29486	29486	Archer	264	" And the Countess Olenska . "
29500	29515	29517	29520	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" Ah -- a charming woman . I have just been to see her , "
29555	29659	29528	29528	He	302	" She has a real gift for arranging flowers . I had sent her a few carnations from Skuytercliff , and I was astonished . Instead of massing them in big bunches as our head - gardener does , she had scattered them about loosely , here and there ... I ca n't say how . The Duke had told me : he said : ' Go and see how cleverly she 's arranged her drawing - room . ' And she has . I should really like to take Louisa to see her , if the neighbourhood were not so -- unpleasant . "
29729	29734	29735	29738	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" The fact is , "
29761	29823	29735	29738	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" the fact is , I dropped in to thank her for the very pretty note she wrote me about my flowers ; and also -- but this is between ourselves , of course -- to give her a friendly warning about allowing the Duke to carry her off to parties with him . I do n't know if you 've heard-- "
29831	29842	29824	29825	Mrs. Archer	215	" Has the Duke been carrying her off to parties ? "
29843	29898	29899	29902	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" You know what these English grandees are . They 're all alike . Louisa and I are very fond of our cousin -- but it 's hopeless to expect people who are accustomed to the European courts to trouble themselves about our little republican distinctions . The Duke goes where he 's amused . "
29910	30015	29899	29902	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" Yes -- it seems he took her with him last night to Mrs. Lemuel Struthers 's . Sillerton Jackson has just been to us with the foolish story , and Louisa was rather troubled . So I thought the shortest way was to go straight to Countess Olenska and explain -- by the merest hint , you know -- how we feel in New York about certain things . I felt I might , without indelicacy , because the evening she dined with us she rather suggested ... rather let me see that she would be grateful for guidance . And she WAS . "
30057	30086	30115	30118	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" How kind you both are , dear Henry -- always ! Newland will particularly appreciate what you have done because of dear May and his new relations . "
30099	30114	30087	30087	She	215	" Immensely , sir . But I was sure you 'd like Madame Olenska . "
30126	30138	30139	30139	he	302	" I never ask to my house , my dear Newland , "
30142	30160	30139	30139	he	302	" any one whom I do not like . And so I have just told Sillerton Jackson . "
30172	30192	30167	30167	he	302	" But Louisa will be waiting . We are dining early , to take the Duke to the Opera . "
30210	30216	30194	30195	the portieres	1456	" Gracious -- how romantic ! "
30256	30266	30267	30267	she	215	" Provided it all turns out for the best , "
30283	30310	30267	30267	she	215	" Newland , you must stay and see Sillerton Jackson when he comes this evening : I really sha n't know what to say to him . "
30311	30320	30321	30322	her son	648	" Poor mother ! But he wo n't come-- "

30487	30549	30448	30448	he	353	" The gentlemen he spoke of were the other senior partners of the firm ; for , as was always the case with legal associations of old standing in New York , all the partners named on the office letter - head were long since dead ; and Mr. Letterblair , for example , was , professionally speaking , his own grandson .
30561	30565	30566	30566	he	353	" For family reasons-- "
30573	30578	30580	30581	Mr. Letterblair	353	" The Mingott family , "
30589	30622	30580	30581	Mr. Letterblair	353	" Mrs. Manson Mingott sent for me yesterday . Her grand - daughter the Countess Olenska wishes to sue her husband for divorce . Certain papers have been placed in my hands . "
30631	30661	30623	30623	He	353	" In view of your prospective alliance with the family I should like to consult you -- to consider the case with you -- before taking any farther steps . "
30838	30848	30827	30828	Mr. Letterblair	353	" If you will run your eye over these papers-- "
30852	30879	30849	30849	Archer	264	" I beg your pardon , sir ; but just because of the prospective relationship , I should prefer your consulting Mr. Skipworth or Mr. Redwood . "
30903	30960	30900	30900	He	353	" I respect your scruple , sir ; but in this case I believe true delicacy requires you to do as I ask . Indeed , the suggestion is not mine but Mrs. Manson Mingott 's and her son 's . I have seen Lovell Mingott ; and also Mr. Welland . They all named you . "
31039	31048	31049	31049	he	264	" Her uncles ought to deal with this , "
31052	31087	31088	31090	The young man	511	" They have . The matter has been gone into by the family . They are opposed to the Countess 's idea ; but she is firm , and insists on a legal opinion . "
31104	31112	31088	31090	The young man	511	" Does she want to marry again ? "
31113	31125	31088	31090	The young man	511	" I believe it is suggested ; but she denies it . "
31126	31128	31088	31090	The young man	511	" Then-- "
31129	31162	31088	31090	The young man	511	" Will you oblige me , Mr. Archer , by first looking through these papers ? Afterward , when we have talked the case over , I will give you my opinion . "
31400	31428	31429	31429	he	256	" You know , when it comes to the point , your parents have always let you have your way ever since you were a little girl , "
31442	31470	31433	31433	she	226	" Yes ; and that 's what makes it so hard to refuse the very last thing they 'll ever ask of me as a little girl . "
31614	31632	31633	31633	he	256	" Here are the letters , sir . If you wish , I 'll see Madame Olenska , "
31640	31681	31633	31633	he	256	" Thank you -- thank you , Mr. Archer . Come and dine with me tonight if you 're free , and we 'll go into the matter afterward : in case you wish to call on our client tomorrow . "

32689	32701	32677	32677	Archer	215	" But why , sir ? If there ever was a case-- "
32702	32777	32778	32780	The young man	511	" Well -- what 's the use ? SHE 'S here -- he 's there ; the Atlantic 's between them . She 'll never get back a dollar more of her money than what he 's voluntarily returned to her : their damned heathen marriage settlements take precious good care of that . As things go over there , Olenski 's acted generously : he might have turned her out without a penny . "
32787	32793	32794	32795	Mr. Letterblair	353	" I understand , though , "
32798	32822	32794	32795	Mr. Letterblair	353	" that she attaches no importance to the money . Therefore , as the family say , why not let well enough alone ? "
32875	32885	32846	32856	this selfish , well - fed and supremely indifferent old man	1528	" I think that 's for her to decide . "
32886	32900	32846	32856	this selfish , well - fed and supremely indifferent old man	1528	" H'm -- have you considered the consequences if she decides for divorce ? "
32901	32931	32846	32856	this selfish , well - fed and supremely indifferent old man	1528	" You mean the threat in her husband 's letter ? What weight would that carry ? It 's no more than the vague charge of an angry blackguard . "
32932	32949	32846	32856	this selfish , well - fed and supremely indifferent old man	1528	" Yes ; but it might make some unpleasant talk if he really defends the suit . "
32950	32953	32955	32955	Archer	215	" Unpleasant-- ! "
32994	33000	32990	32991	his senior	1530	" Divorce is always unpleasant . "
33001	33007	33008	33009	Mr. Letterblair	353	" You agree with me ? "

33024	33050	32990	32991	his senior	1530	" Well , then , I may count on you ; the Mingotts may count on you ; to use your influence against the idea ? "

33074	33102	33129	33131	his young partner	1531	" Mr. Archer , I do n't understand you . Do you want to marry into a family with a scandalous divorce - suit hanging over it ? "
33103	33117	33129	33131	his young partner	1531	" I do n't think that has anything to do with the case . "
33205	33249	33268	33270	the young man	511	" You may be sure , sir , that I sha n't commit myself till I 've reported to you ; what I meant was that I 'd rather not give an opinion till I 've heard what Madame Olenska has to say . "

35157	35186	35075	35077	the young man	511	" Ah -- that does tempt me ! Except the other evening at Mrs. Struthers 's I 've not met a single artist since I 've been here . "
35187	35217	35219	35219	Archer	215	" What kind of artists ? I know one or two painters , very good fellows , that I could bring to see you if you 'd allow me , "
35222	35232	35234	35234	Beaufort	231	" Painters ? Are there painters in New York ? "
35265	35296	35254	35255	Madame Olenska	241	" That would be charming . But I was really thinking of dramatic artists , singers , actors , musicians . My husband 's house was always full of them . "

35987	36009	35963	35963	He	256	" That 's the reason I 've come . He asked me to -- you see I 'm in the firm . "
36021	36050	36010	36010	She	231	" You mean you can manage it for me ? I can talk to you instead of Mr. Letterblair ? Oh , that will be so much easier ! "

36325	36358	36318	36318	He	256	" Well -- then -- what more is there ? In this country are such things tolerated ? I 'm a Protestant -- our church does not forbid divorce in such cases . "
36359	36363	36301	36301	She	231	" Certainly not . "
36435	36448	36449	36449	he	256	" I 've looked through the papers you gave to Mr. Letterblair , "

36493	36508	36490	36490	Archer	256	" that if your husband chooses to fight the case -- as he threatens to-- "
36509	36512	36476	36476	her	1622	" Yes-- ? "
36513	36547	36490	36490	Archer	256	" He can say things -- things that might be unpl -- might be disagreeable to you : say them publicly , so that they would get about , and harm you even if-- "
36548	36551	36476	36476	her	1622	" If-- ? "
36552	36563	36490	36490	Archer	256	" I mean : no matter how unfounded they were . "
36635	36653	36605	36605	her	1622	" What harm could such accusations , even if he made them publicly , do me here ? "
36662	36674	36677	36677	he	256	" My poor child -- far more harm than anywhere else ! "
36693	36735	36677	36677	he	256	" New York society is a very small world compared with the one you 've lived in . And it 's ruled , in spite of appearances , by a few people with -- well , rather old - fashioned ideas . "
36744	36768	36741	36741	he	256	" Our ideas about marriage and divorce are particularly old - fashioned . Our legislation favours divorce -- our social customs do n't . "
36769	36772	36741	36741	he	256	" Never ? "
36773	36808	36741	36741	he	256	" Well -- not if the woman , however injured , however irreproachable , has appearances in the least degree against her , has exposed herself by any unconventional action to -- to offensive insinuations-- "
36880	36883	36884	36884	she	1622	" Yes , "
36889	36898	36884	36884	she	1622	" that 's what my family tell me . "
36904	36909	36899	36899	He	256	" It 's not unnatural-- "

36923	36932	36933	36933	she	1622	" For you 'll be my cousin soon , "
36937	36942	36899	36899	He	256	" I hope so . "
36943	36950	36899	36899	He	256	" And you take their view ? "
36990	37011	36987	36987	he	256	" Yes , if what your husband hints is true , or if you 've no way of disproving it ? "
37012	37014	37015	37015	she	1622	" Sincerely-- "
37032	37058	37025	37025	He	256	" Sincerely , then -- what should you gain that would compensate for the possibility -- the certainty -- of a lot of beastly talk ? "
37059	37068	37099	37099	he	256	" But my freedom -- is that nothing ? "
37143	37156	37157	37157	he	256	" But are n't you as free as air as it is ? "

37177	37182	37183	37183	she	1622	" Oh , yes , "
37187	37231	37157	37157	he	256	" Well , then : is it worth while to risk what may be infinitely disagreeable and painful ? Think of the newspapers -- their vileness ! It 's all stupid and narrow and unjust -- but one ca n't make over society . "
37232	37235	37236	37236	she	1622	" No , "
37259	37301	37302	37302	he	256	" The individual , in such cases , is nearly always sacrificed to what is supposed to be the collective interest : people cling to any convention that keeps the family together -- protects the children , if there are any , "
37396	37405	37406	37406	he	256	" It 's my business , you know , "

I do n't think Granny understands her , or uncle Lovell Mingott either ; they really think she 's much worldlier and fonder of society than she is . And I can quite see that New York must seem dull to her , though the family wo n't admit it . I think she 's been used to lots of things we have n't got ; wonderful music , and picture shows , and celebrities -- artists and authors and all the clever people you admire . Granny ca n't understand her wanting anything but lots of dinners and clothes -- but I can see that you 're almost the only person in New York who can talk to her about what she really cares for . "

She rushed in bareheaded , carrying him in her arms , with his knee all beautifully bandaged , and was so sympathetic and beautiful that my wife was too dazzled to ask her name . "

48315	48399	48433	48435	the young man	511	" I 'm afraid Ellen 's ideas are not at all like ours . She was barely eighteen when Medora Manson took her back to Europe -- you remember the excitement when she appeared in black at her coming - out ball ? Another of Medora 's fads -- really this time it was almost prophetic ! That must have been at least twelve years ago ; and since then Ellen has never been to America . No wonder she is completely Europeanised . "
48400	48426	48433	48435	the young man	511	" But European society is not given to divorce : Countess Olenska thought she would be conforming to American ideas in asking for her freedom . "
48461	48522	48456	48457	Mrs. Welland	219	" That is just like the extraordinary things that foreigners invent about us . They think we dine at two o'clock and countenance divorce ! That is why it seems to me so foolish to entertain them when they come to New York . They accept our hospitality , and then they go home and repeat the same stupid stories . "
48535	48615	48531	48532	Mrs. Welland	219	" But we do most thoroughly appreciate your persuading Ellen to give up the idea . Her grandmother and her uncle Lovell could do nothing with her ; both of them have written that her changing her mind was entirely due to your influence -- in fact she said so to her grandmother . She has an unbounded admiration for you . Poor Ellen -- she was always a wayward child . I wonder what her fate will be ? "

48632	48662	48627	48627	he	1959	" If you 'd all of you rather she should be Beaufort 's mistress than some decent fellow 's wife you 've certainly gone the right way about it . "
48777	48782	48783	48784	Mrs. Welland	219	" I verily believe , "
48787	48918	48783	48784	Mrs. Welland	219	" that if the horrible business had come out in the newspapers it would have been my husband 's death - blow . I do n't know any of the details ; I only ask not to , as I told poor Ellen when she tried to talk to me about it . Having an invalid to care for , I have to keep my mind bright and happy . But Mr. Welland was terribly upset ; he had a slight temperature every morning while we were waiting to hear what had been decided . It was the horror of his girl 's learning that such things were possible -- but of course , dear Newland , you felt that too . We all knew that you were thinking of May. "
48919	48927	48928	48930	the young man	511	" I 'm always thinking of May , "
49074	49091	49092	49092	he	511	" We might be seeing it all this spring -- even the Easter ceremonies at Seville , "
49106	49119	49120	49120	she	226	" Easter in Seville ? And it will be Lent next week ! "
49123	49133	49134	49134	he	511	" Why should n't we be married in Lent ? "
49148	49185	49202	49202	her	226	" Of course I did n't mean that , dearest ; but soon after Easter -- so that we could sail at the end of April . I know I could arrange it at the office . "
49228	49243	49202	49202	her	226	" Oh , do go on , Newland ; I do love your descriptions . "
49244	49261	49202	49202	her	226	" But why should they be only descriptions ? Why should n't we make them real ? "
49262	49274	49275	49275	Her	226	" We shall , dearest , of course ; next year . "
49281	49302	49202	49202	her	226	" Do n't you want them to be real sooner ? Ca n't I persuade you to break away now ? "
49318	49345	49305	49305	her	226	" Why should we dream away another year ? Look at me , dear ! Do n't you understand how I want you for my wife ? "
49383	49393	49394	49394	she	226	" I 'm not sure if I DO understand , "
49397	49415	49394	49394	she	226	" Is it -- is it because you 're not certain of continuing to care for me ? "
49423	49434	49435	49435	he	511	" My God -- perhaps -- I do n't know , "
49486	49498	49479	49479	she	226	" If that is it -- is there some one else ? "
49499	49509	49512	49512	her	226	" Some one else -- between you and me ? "
49554	49579	49546	49546	she	226	" Let us talk frankly , Newland . Sometimes I 've felt a difference in you ; especially since our engagement has been announced . "
49580	49586	49587	49587	he	394	" Dear -- what madness ! "
49602	49617	49593	49593	She	226	" If it is , it wo n't hurt us to talk about it . "
49634	49659	49625	49625	her	226	" Or even if it 's true : why should n't we speak of it ? You might so easily have made a mistake . "
49680	49714	49660	49660	He	394	" Mistakes are always easy to make ; but if I had made one of the kind you suggest , is it likely that I should be imploring you to hasten our marriage ? "
49735	49738	49739	49739	she	226	" Yes , "
49744	49763	49739	49739	she	226	" You might want -- once for all -- to settle the question : it 's one way . "
49806	49809	49810	49810	he	394	" Well-- ? "
49844	49959	49834	49834	She	226	" You must n't think that a girl knows as little as her parents imagine . One hears and one notices -- one has one 's feelings and ideas . And of course , long before you told me that you cared for me , I 'd known that there was some one else you were interested in ; every one was talking about it two years ago at Newport . And once I saw you sitting together on the verandah at a dance -- and when she came back into the house her face was sad , and I felt sorry for her ; I remembered it afterward , when we were engaged . "
50004	50020	49984	49986	The young man	511	" My dear child -- was THAT it ? If you only knew the truth ! "
50027	50038	50023	50023	her	1969	" Then there is a truth I do n't know ? "
50046	50060	50041	50041	his	511	" I meant , the truth about the old story you speak of . "
50061	50124	50160	50160	she	1969	" But that 's what I want to know , Newland -- what I ought to know . I could n't have my happiness made out of a wrong -- an unfairness -- to somebody else . And I want to believe that it would be the same with you . What sort of a life could we build on such foundations ? "
50147	50159	50160	50160	she	1969	" I 've wanted to say this for a long time , "
50164	50256	50160	50160	she	1969	" I 've wanted to tell you that , when two people really love each other , I understand that there may be situations which make it right that they should -- should go against public opinion . And if you feel yourself in any way pledged ... pledged to the person we 've spoken of ... and if there is any way ... any way in which you can fulfill your pledge ... even by her getting a divorce ... Newland , do n't give her up because of me ! "
50381	50461	50378	50378	he	511	" There is no pledge -- no obligation whatever -- of the kind you think . Such cases do n't always -- present themselves quite as simply as ... But that 's no matter ... I love your generosity , because I feel as you do about those things ... I feel that each case must be judged individually , on its own merits ... irrespective of stupid conventionalities ... I mean , each woman 's right to her liberty-- "
50487	50546	50462	50462	He	511	" Since you understand so many things , dearest , ca n't you go a little farther , and understand the uselessness of our submitting to another form of the same foolish conventionalities ? If there 's no one and nothing between us , is n't that an argument for marrying quickly , rather than for more delay ? "
50727	50740	50741	50742	Janey Archer	264	" Your cousin the Countess called on mother while you were away , "
50822	50849	50850	50850	Janey	264	" She had on a black velvet polonaise with jet buttons , and a tiny green monkey muff ; I never saw her so stylishly dressed , "
50853	50900	50850	50850	Janey	264	" She came alone , early on Sunday afternoon ; luckily the fire was lit in the drawing - room . She had one of those new card - cases . She said she wanted to know us because you 'd been so good to her . "
50904	50927	50901	50901	Newland	215	" Madame Olenska always takes that tone about her friends . She 's very happy at being among her own people again . "
50928	50936	50938	50939	Mrs. Archer	215	" Yes , so she told us , "
50941	50952	50938	50939	Mrs. Archer	215	" I must say she seems thankful to be here . "
50953	50962	50901	50901	Newland	215	" I hope you liked her , mother . "
50970	50989	50963	50964	Mrs. Archer	215	" She certainly lays herself out to please , even when she is calling on an old lady . "
50990	50998	50999	50999	Janey	264	" Mother does n't think her simple , "
51011	51027	51029	51030	Mrs. Archer	215	" It 's just my old - fashioned feeling ; dear May is my ideal , "
51032	51035	51037	51038	her son	648	" Ah , "
51040	51046	51037	51038	her son	648	" they 're not alike . "
51148	51198	51132	51132	she	215	" Ah , ah -- so you kicked over the traces , did you ? And I suppose Augusta and Welland pulled long faces , and behaved as if the end of the world had come ? But little May -- she knew better , I 'll be bound ? "
51199	51222	51132	51132	she	215	" I hoped she did ; but after all she would n't agree to what I 'd gone down to ask for . "
51223	51234	51132	51132	she	215	" Would n't she indeed ? And what was that ? "
51235	51261	51132	51132	she	215	" I wanted to get her to promise that we should be married in April . What 's the use of our wasting another year ? "
51284	51422	51423	51423	She	1995	" ' Ask Mamma , ' I suppose -- the usual story . Ah , these Mingotts -- all alike ! Born in a rut , and you ca n't root 'em out of it . When I built this house you 'd have thought I was moving to California ! Nobody ever HAD built above Fortieth Street -- no , says I , nor above the Battery either , before Christopher Columbus discovered America . No , no ; not one of them wants to be different ; they 're as scared of it as the small - pox . Ah , my dear Mr. Archer , I thank my stars I 'm nothing but a vulgar Spicer ; but there 's not one of my own children that takes after me but my little Ellen . "
51443	51458	51423	51423	She	1995	" Now , why in the world did n't you marry my little Ellen ? "
51462	51475	51459	51459	Archer	256	" For one thing , she was n't there to be married . "
51476	51500	51501	51501	She	1995	" No -- to be sure ; more 's the pity . And now it 's too late ; her life is finished . "
51534	51559	51530	51530	he	511	" Ca n't I persuade you to use your influence with the Wellands , Mrs. Mingott ? I was n't made for long engagements . "
51567	51599	51560	51561	Old Catherine	406	" No ; I can see that . You 've got a quick eye . When you were a little boy I 've no doubt you liked to be helped first . "
51617	51626	51627	51627	she	1995	" Ah , here 's my Ellen now ! "
51670	51694	51653	51653	she	241	" I was just saying to him , my dear : ' Now , why did n't you marry my little Ellen ? ' "
51704	51711	51695	51696	Madame Olenska	241	" And what did he answer ? "
51712	51737	51653	51653	she	241	" Oh , my darling , I leave you to find that out ! He 's been down to Florida to see his sweetheart . "
51738	51744	51745	51745	She	241	" Yes , I know . "
51751	51783	51745	51745	She	241	" I went to see your mother , to ask where you 'd gone . I sent a note that you never answered , and I was afraid you were ill . "
51807	51822	51823	51823	She	241	" And of course once you were there you never thought of me again ! "
51842	51859	51860	51860	he	256	" If she still needs me , she 's determined not to let me see it , "
51897	52009	52011	52013	the old lady	3973	" Look at him -- in such hot haste to get married that he took French leave and rushed down to implore the silly girl on his knees ! That 's something like a lover -- that 's the way handsome Bob Spicer carried off my poor mother ; and then got tired of her before I was weaned -- though they only had to wait eight months for me ! But there -- you're not a Spicer , young man ; luckily for you and for May. It 's only my poor Ellen that has kept any of their wicked blood ; the rest of them are all model Mingotts , "
52054	52071	52048	52048	she	241	" Surely , Granny , we can persuade them between us to do as he wishes . "
52102	52109	52110	52110	he	256	" When can I see you ? "
52125	52151	52088	52088	she	241	" Whenever you like ; but it must be soon if you want to see the little house again . I am moving next week . "
52185	52189	52216	52216	she	241	" Tomorrow evening ? "
52193	52206	52190	52190	She	241	" Tomorrow ; yes ; but early . I 'm going out . "
52218	52221	52216	52216	she	241	" going out "
52313	52320	52321	52321	he	256	" Very well ; tomorrow evening , "
52554	52560	52547	52547	One	503	" reach - me - down "
52582	52585	52578	52579	the French	407	" Macfarlane . "
52663	52666	52668	52668	she	336	" Gia ! "
52858	52861	52874	52874	his	256	" Macfarlane , "
52937	52958	52959	52960	the lady	663	" What they must have cost at this season -- though of course it 's the sentiment one cares about ! "
52992	53002	53003	53003	she	663	" Dear Mr. Archer -- almost my cousin Newland ! "
53006	53013	53003	53003	she	663	" I am the Marchioness Manson . "
53021	53100	53018	53018	she	663	" My Ellen has taken me in for a few days . I came from Cuba , where I have been spending the winter with Spanish friends -- such delightful distinguished people : the highest nobility of old Castile -- how I wish you could know them ! But I was called away by our dear great friend here , Dr. Carver . You do n't know Dr. Agathon Carver , founder of the Valley of Love Community ? "
53113	53142	53109	53110	the Marchioness	2030	" Ah , New York -- New York -- how little the life of the spirit has reached it ! But I see you do know Mr. Winsett . "
53143	53161	53162	53162	Winsett	411	" Oh , yes -- I reached him some time ago ; but not by that route , "
53176	53192	53169	53170	The Marchioness	316	" How do you know , Mr. Winsett ? The spirit bloweth where it listeth . "
53193	53200	53202	53203	Dr. Carver	410	" List -- oh , list ! "
53209	53266	53169	53170	The Marchioness	316	" But do sit down , Mr. Archer . We four have been having a delightful little dinner together , and my child has gone up to dress . She expects you ; she will be down in a moment . We were just admiring these marvellous flowers , which will surprise her when she reappears . "
53273	53305	53270	53270	his	411	" I 'm afraid I must be off . Please tell Madame Olenska that we shall all feel lost when she abandons our street . This house has been an oasis . "
53306	53336	53169	53170	The Marchioness	316	" Ah , but she wo n't abandon YOU . Poetry and art are the breath of life to her . It IS poetry you write , Mr. Winsett ? "
53337	53348	53350	53350	Winsett	411	" Well , no ; but I sometimes read it , "
53366	53388	53169	53170	The Marchioness	316	" A caustic spirit -- un peu sauvage . But so witty ; Dr. Carver , you DO think him witty ? "
53389	53396	53398	53399	Dr. Carver	410	" I never think of wit , "
53402	53510	53169	53170	The Marchioness	316	" Ah -- ah -- you never think of wit ! How merciless he is to us weak mortals , Mr. Archer ! But he lives only in the life of the spirit ; and tonight he is mentally preparing the lecture he is to deliver presently at Mrs. Blenker 's . Dr. Carver , would there be time , before you start for the Blenkers ' to explain to Mr. Archer your illuminating discovery of the Direct Contact ? But no ; I see it is nearly nine o'clock , and we have no right to detain you while so many are waiting for your message . "
53549	53559	53560	53560	he	410	" I shall see you later , dear friend ? "
53572	53595	53560	53560	he	410	" As soon as Ellen 's carriage comes I will join you ; I do hope the lecture wo n't have begun . "
53603	53627	53596	53597	Dr. Carver	410	" Perhaps , if this young gentleman is interested in my experiences , Mrs. Blenker might allow you to bring him with you ? "
53628	53659	53596	53597	Dr. Carver	410	" Oh , dear friend , if it were possible -- I am sure she would be too happy . But I fear my Ellen counts on Mr. Archer herself . "
53660	53663	53665	53666	Dr. Carver	410	" That , "
53668	53678	53679	53679	He	410	" is unfortunate -- but here is my card . "
53744	53769	53717	53717	himself	410	" Ellen will be down in a moment ; and before she comes , I am so glad of this quiet moment with you . "
53789	53826	53779	53780	the Marchioness	2030	" I know everything , dear Mr. Archer -- my child has told me all you have done for her . Your wise advice : your courageous firmness -- thank heaven it was not too late ! "
53857	53876	53784	53784	her	2030	" Madame Olenska exaggerates ; I simply gave her a legal opinion , as she asked me to . "
53877	53908	53910	53911	the lady	663	" Ah , but in doing it -- in doing it you were the unconscious instrument of -- of -- what word have we moderns for Providence , Mr. Archer ? "
53925	53955	53914	53914	her	663	" Little did you know that at that very moment I was being appealed to : being approached , in fact -- from the other side of the Atlantic ! "
53991	54017	53984	53984	her	663	" By the Count himself -- my poor , mad , foolish Olenski ; who asks only to take her back on her own terms . "
54018	54022	54023	54023	Archer	256	" Good God ! "
54029	54076	54077	54077	She	2038	" You are horrified ? Yes , of course ; I understand . I do n't defend poor Stanislas , though he has always called me his best friend . He does not defend himself -- he casts himself at her feet : in my person . "
54083	54090	54077	54077	She	2038	" I have his letter here . "
54091	54099	54100	54100	Archer	256	" A letter?--Has Madame Olenska seen it ? "
54121	54149	54113	54115	The Marchioness Manson	316	" Time -- time ; I must have time . I know my Ellen -- haughty , intractable ; shall I say , just a shade unforgiving ? "
54150	54168	54077	54077	She	2038	" But , good heavens , to forgive is one thing ; to go back into that hell-- "
54169	54174	54175	54176	the Marchioness	2030	" Ah , yes , "
54179	54378	54175	54176	the Marchioness	2030	" So she describes it -- my sensitive child ! But on the material side , Mr. Archer , if one may stoop to consider such things ; do you know what she is giving up ? Those roses there on the sofa -- acres like them , under glass and in the open , in his matchless terraced gardens at Nice ! Jewels -- historic pearls : the Sobieski emeralds -- sables,--but she cares nothing for all these ! Art and beauty , those she does care for , she lives for , as I always have ; and those also surrounded her . Pictures , priceless furniture , music , brilliant conversation -- ah , that , my dear young man , if you 'll excuse me , is what you 've no conception of here ! And she had it all ; and the homage of the greatest . She tells me she is not thought handsome in New York -- good heavens ! Her portrait has been painted nine times ; the greatest artists in Europe have begged for the privilege . Are these things nothing ? And the remorse of an adoring husband ? "
54471	54481	54482	54482	he	256	" She knows nothing yet -- of all this ? "
54496	54560	54486	54487	Mrs. Manson	217	" Nothing directly -- but does she suspect ? Who can tell ? The truth is , Mr. Archer , I have been waiting to see you . From the moment I heard of the firm stand you had taken , and of your influence over her , I hoped it might be possible to count on your support -- to convince you ... "
54561	54576	54578	54580	the young man	511	" That she ought to go back ? I would rather see her dead ! "
54583	54586	54587	54588	the Marchioness	2030	" Ah , "
54627	54632	54633	54633	she	2030	" Here she comes , "
54651	54679	54633	54633	she	2030	" Am I to understand that you prefer THAT , Mr. Archer ? After all , marriage is marriage ... and my niece is still a wife ... "
54682	54693	54694	54695	Madame Olenska	241	" What are you two plotting together , aunt Medora ? "
54751	54769	54770	54771	Mrs. Manson	217	" We were saying , my dear , that here was something beautiful to surprise you with , "
54816	54819	54820	54820	she	241	" Ah , "
54835	54882	54820	54820	she	241	" who is ridiculous enough to send me a bouquet ? Why a bouquet ? And why tonight of all nights ? I am not going to a ball ; I am not a girl engaged to be married . But some people are always ridiculous . "
54897	54900	54883	54883	She	241	" Nastasia ! "
54933	54942	54918	54918	she	241	" Here -- throw this into the dustbin ! "
54951	55053	54947	54947	Nastasia	336	" But no -- it 's not the fault of the poor flowers . Tell the boy to carry them to the house three doors away , the house of Mr. Winsett , the dark gentleman who dined here . His wife is ill -- they may give her pleasure ... The boy is out , you say ? Then , my dear one , run yourself ; here , put my cloak over you and fly . I want the thing out of the house immediately ! And , as you live , do n't say they come from me ! "
55119	55129	55101	55101	she	2048	" And you two -- have you made friends ! "
55130	55150	55094	55094	she	2048	" It 's for Mr. Archer to say , darling ; he has waited patiently while you were dressing . "
55151	55166	55167	55168	Madame Olenska	241	" Yes -- I gave you time enough : my hair would n't go , "
55184	55219	55167	55168	Madame Olenska	241	" But that reminds me : I see Dr. Carver is gone , and you 'll be late at the Blenkers ' . Mr. Archer , will you put my aunt in the carriage ? "
55248	55262	55264	55264	she	241	" Mind , the carriage is to be back for me at ten ! "
55314	55319	55305	55306	a lady	680	" my dear one , "
55402	55410	55387	55387	she	241	" There 's time for a cigarette . "
55442	55453	55432	55432	she	241	" What do you think of me in a temper ? "
55466	55480	55460	55460	he	256	" It makes me understand what your aunt has been saying about you . "
55481	55493	55432	55432	she	241	" I knew she 'd been talking about me . Well ? "
55494	55522	55460	55460	he	256	" She said you were used to all kinds of things -- splendours and amusements and excitements -- that we could never hope to give you here . "
55536	55553	55561	55561	his	256	" Medora is incorrigibly romantic . It has made up to her for so many things ! "
55564	55575	55554	55554	Archer	256	" Is your aunt 's romanticism always consistent with accuracy ? "
55576	55586	55587	55587	Her	241	" You mean : does she speak the truth ? "
55591	55626	55587	55588	Her niece	2058	" Well , I 'll tell you : in almost everything she says , there 's something true and something untrue . But why do you ask ? What has she been telling you ? "
55672	55693	55638	55638	her	241	" She says -- she pretends that Count Olenski has asked her to persuade you to go back to him . "
55737	55743	55744	55744	he	256	" You knew , then ? "
55769	55783	55762	55762	She	241	" She has hinted about a letter : poor darling ! Medora 's hints-- "
55784	55799	55744	55744	he	256	" Is it at your husband 's request that she has arrived here suddenly ? "
55809	55897	55800	55801	Madame Olenska	241	" There again : one ca n't tell . She told me she had had a ' spiritual summons , ' whatever that is , from Dr. Carver . I 'm afraid she 's going to marry Dr. Carver ... poor Medora , there 's always some one she wants to marry . But perhaps the people in Cuba just got tired of her ! I think she was with them as a sort of paid companion . Really , I do n't know why she came . "
55898	55911	55744	55744	he	256	" But you do believe she has a letter from your husband ? "
55922	55932	55913	55914	Madame Olenska	241	" After all , it was to be expected . "
55981	55993	56006	56006	her	241	" You know that your aunt believes you will go back ? "
56031	56041	56042	56042	she	241	" Many cruel things have been believed of me , "
56045	56061	56006	56006	her	241	" Oh , Ellen -- forgive me ; I 'm a fool and a brute ! "
56067	56121	56062	56062	She	241	" You are horribly nervous ; you have your own troubles . I know you think the Wellands are unreasonable about your marriage , and of course I agree with you . In Europe people do n't understand our long American engagements ; I suppose they are not as calm as we are . "
56125	56127	56062	56062	She	241	" we "
56219	56222	56223	56223	he	256	" Yes , "
56227	56252	56223	56223	he	256	" I went south to ask May to marry me after Easter . There 's no reason why we should n't be married then . "
56253	56281	56188	56188	her	241	" And May adores you -- and yet you could n't convince her ? I thought her too intelligent to be the slave of such absurd superstitions . "
56282	56294	56223	56223	he	256	" She IS too intelligent -- she 's not their slave . "
56301	56311	56295	56296	Madame Olenska	241	" Well , then -- I do n't understand . "
56322	56341	56312	56312	Archer	256	" We had a frank talk -- almost the first . She thinks my impatience a bad sign . "
56342	56350	56188	56188	her	241	" Merciful heavens -- a bad sign ? "
56351	56395	56312	56312	Archer	256	" She thinks it means that I ca n't trust myself to go on caring for her . She thinks , in short , I want to marry her at once to get away from some one that I -- care for more . "
56402	56418	56396	56397	Madame Olenska	241	" But if she thinks that -- why is n't she in a hurry too ? "
56419	56447	56312	56312	Archer	256	" Because she 's not like that : she 's so much nobler . She insists all the more on the long engagement , to give me time-- "
56448	56459	56396	56397	Madame Olenska	241	" Time to give her up for the other woman ? "
56460	56466	56312	56312	Archer	256	" If I want to . "
56494	56499	56500	56500	she	241	" That IS noble , "
56511	56519	56563	56563	him	256	" Yes . But it 's ridiculous . "
56520	56533	56563	56563	him	256	" Ridiculous ? Because you do n't care for any one else ? "
56534	56546	56563	56563	him	256	" Because I do n't mean to marry any one else . "
56547	56550	56563	56563	him	256	" Ah . "
56567	56577	56559	56559	she	241	" This other woman -- does she love you ? "
56578	56601	56559	56559	she	241	" Oh , there 's no other woman ; I mean , the person that May was thinking of is -- was never-- "
56602	56616	56559	56559	she	241	" Then , why , after all , are you in such haste ? "
56617	56623	56625	56625	Archer	256	" There 's your carriage , "
56656	56666	56559	56559	she	241	" Yes ; I suppose I must be going . "
56667	56676	56715	56715	he	256	" You 're going to Mrs. Struthers 's ? "
56677	56680	56681	56681	She	241	" Yes . "
56686	56708	56681	56681	She	241	" I must go where I am invited , or I should be too lonely . Why not come with me ? "
56778	56784	56785	56785	he	256	" May guessed the truth , "
56788	56801	56785	56785	he	256	" There is another woman -- but not the one she thinks . "
56864	56881	56882	56882	she	241	" Ah , do n't make love to me ! Too many people have done that , "
56907	56916	56917	56917	he	256	" I have never made love to you , "
56920	56945	56917	56917	he	256	" and I never shall . But you are the woman I would have married if it had been possible for either of us . "
56946	56953	56954	56954	She	241	" Possible for either of us ? "
56962	56978	56954	56954	She	241	" And you say that -- when it 's you who 've made it impossible ? "
57000	57006	56917	56917	he	256	" I'VE made it impossible-- ? "
57007	57014	57015	57015	she	241	" You , you , YOU ! "
57031	57122	57123	57123	she	2069	" Is n't it you who made me give up divorcing -- give it up because you showed me how selfish and wicked it was , how one must sacrifice one 's self to preserve the dignity of marriage ... and to spare one 's family the publicity , the scandal ? And because my family was going to be your family -- for May 's sake and for yours -- I did what you told me , what you proved to me that I ought to do . Ah , "
57131	57144	57123	57123	she	2069	" I 've made no secret of having done it for you ! "
57183	57187	57188	57188	he	511	" Good God , "
57191	57195	57188	57188	he	511	" When I thought-- "
57196	57200	57167	57169	the young man	511	" You thought ? "
57201	57212	57188	57188	he	511	" Ah , do n't ask me what I thought ! "
57243	57249	57216	57216	her	2069	" I do ask you . "
57250	57266	57216	57216	her	2069	" Well , then : there were things in that letter you asked me to read-- "
57267	57273	57216	57216	her	2069	" My husband 's letter ? "
57274	57277	57216	57216	her	2069	" Yes . "
57278	57309	57216	57216	her	2069	" I had nothing to fear from that letter : absolutely nothing ! All I feared was to bring notoriety , scandal , on the family -- on you and May. "
57310	57314	57315	57315	he	511	" Good God , "
57402	57408	57409	57409	he	511	" At least I loved you-- "
57454	57486	57487	57487	He	511	" Ellen ! What madness ! Why are you crying ? Nothing 's done that ca n't be undone . I 'm still free , and you 're going to be . "
57580	57604	57605	57605	she	2072	" Ah , my poor Newland -- I suppose this had to be . But it does n't in the least alter things , "
57619	57629	57605	57605	she	2072	" It alters the whole of life for me . "
57630	57655	57605	57605	she	2072	" No , no -- it must n't , it ca n't . You 're engaged to May Welland ; and I 'm married . "
57665	57709	57656	57656	He	511	" Nonsense ! It 's too late for that sort of thing . We 've no right to lie to other people or to ourselves . We wo n't talk of your marriage ; but do you see me marrying May after this ? "
57754	57761	57762	57762	she	2072	" I do n't see you , "
57767	57776	57762	57762	she	2072	" putting that question to May. Do you ? "
57783	57793	57777	57777	He	511	" It 's too late to do anything else . "
57794	57833	57747	57747	she	2072	" You say that because it 's the easiest thing to say at this moment -- not because it 's true . In reality it 's too late to do anything but what we 'd both decided on . "
57834	57843	57777	57777	He	511	" Ah , I do n't understand you ! "
57858	57892	57844	57844	She	2072	" You do n't understand because you have n't yet guessed how you 've changed things for me : oh , from the first -- long before I knew all you 'd done . "
57893	57899	57777	57777	He	511	" All I 'd done ? "
57900	57991	57844	57844	She	2072	" Yes . I was perfectly unconscious at first that people here were shy of me -- that they thought I was a dreadful sort of person . It seems they had even refused to meet me at dinner . I found that out afterward ; and how you 'd made your mother go with you to the van der Luydens ' ; and how you 'd insisted on announcing your engagement at the Beaufort ball , so that I might have two families to stand by me instead of one-- "
58000	58004	58005	58005	she	2077	" Just imagine , "
58008	58078	58079	58079	she	2077	" how stupid and unobservant I was ! I knew nothing of all this till Granny blurted it out one day . New York simply meant peace and freedom to me : it was coming home . And I was so happy at being among my own people that every one I met seemed kind and good , and glad to see me . But from the very beginning , "
58082	58195	58079	58079	she	2077	" I felt there was no one as kind as you ; no one who gave me reasons that I understood for doing what at first seemed so hard and -- unnecessary . The very good people did n't convince me ; I felt they 'd never been tempted . But you knew ; you understood ; you had felt the world outside tugging at one with all its golden hands -- and yet you hated the things it asks of one ; you hated happiness bought by disloyalty and cruelty and indifference . That was what I 'd never known before -- and it 's better than anything I 've known . "
58295	58308	58309	58309	she	2077	" Ah , do n't let us undo what you 've done ! "
58312	58337	58309	58309	she	2077	" I ca n't go back now to that other way of thinking . I ca n't love you unless I give you up . "
58376	58386	58363	58363	her	2077	" And Beaufort ? Is he to replace me ? "
58449	58469	58470	58470	Archer	256	" He 's waiting for you now at Mrs. Struthers 's ; why do n't you go to him ? "
58480	58500	58501	58501	she	241	" I shall not go out this evening ; tell the carriage to go and fetch the Signora Marchesa , "
58524	58548	58514	58514	Archer	256	" Why this sacrifice ? Since you tell me that you 're lonely I 've no right to keep you from your friends . "
58558	58608	58549	58549	She	241	" I sha n't be lonely now . I WAS lonely ; I WAS afraid . But the emptiness and the darkness are gone ; when I turn back into myself now I 'm like a child going at night into a room where there 's always a light . "
58628	58635	58623	58623	Archer	256	" I do n't understand you ! "
58636	58642	58549	58549	She	241	" Yet you understand May ! "
58656	58665	58651	58651	his	256	" May is ready to give me up . "
58666	58684	58623	58623	Archer	256	" What ! Three days after you 've entreated her on your knees to hasten your marriage ? "
58685	58695	58651	58651	his	256	" She 's refused ; that gives me the right-- "
58696	58710	58711	58711	she	241	" Ah , you 've taught me what an ugly word that is , "
58824	58840	58818	58818	he	256	" If we do this now it will be worse afterward -- worse for every one-- "
58841	58848	58849	58849	she	241	" No -- no -- no ! "
58927	58937	58938	58938	Nastasia	336	" The lady was very happy at the flowers , "
58945	58970	58938	58938	Nastasia	336	" She thought it was her signor marito who had sent them , and she cried a little and said it was a folly . "
59026	59057	59023	59023	he	256	" Granny 's telegram successful . Papa and Mamma agree marriage after Easter . Am telegraphing Newland . Am too happy for words and love you dearly . Your grateful May. "

59252	59273	59238	59238	her	869	" Newland ! I hope there 's no bad news in that telegram ? I waited on purpose , in case-- "
59294	59305	59286	59286	He	256	" Look here -- what day is Easter this year ? "
59314	59332	59306	59306	She	869	" Easter ? Newland ! Why , of course , the first week in April . Why ? "
59333	59338	59339	59339	He	256	" The first week ? "
59355	59364	59339	59339	He	256	" The first week , did you say ? "
59375	59385	59339	59339	He	256	" For mercy 's sake what 's the matter ? "
59386	59404	59339	59339	He	256	" Nothing 's the matter , except that I 'm going to be married in a month . "
59419	59451	59405	59405	Janey	264	" Oh Newland , how wonderful ! I 'm so glad ! But , dearest , why do you keep on laughing ? Do hush , or you 'll wake Mamma . "
59901	59908	59910	59934	young van der Luyden Newland , who was inexperienced in the duties of a best man , and awed by the weight of his responsibility	417	" Got the ring all right ? "
60075	60085	60086	60086	he	256	" How like a first night at the Opera ! "
60216	60227	60228	60229	the bridegroom	2102	" Too bad the breakfast is at old Catherine 's , "
60236	60268	60270	60270	he	256	" But I 'm told that Lovell Mingott insisted on its being cooked by his own chef , so it ought to be good if one can only get at it . "
60279	60304	60273	60274	Sillerton Jackson	225	" My dear fellow , have n't you heard ? It 's to be served at small tables , in the new English fashion . "
60353	60357	60358	60358	he	256	" Poor Janey ! "
60366	60394	60358	60358	he	256	" even by screwing her head around she can see only the people in the few front pews ; and they 're mostly dowdy Newlands and Dagonets . "

62178	62232	62170	62170	his	238	" Yes , of course I thought I 'd lost the ring ; no wedding would be complete if the poor devil of a bridegroom did n't go through that . But you DID keep me waiting , you know ! I had time to think of every horror that might possibly happen . "

63143	63171	63172	63172	he	2250	" Are n't you tired ? It will be good to have some tea when we arrive -- I'm sure the aunts have got everything beautifully ready , "

63289	63297	63299	63300	this emissary	2258	" I 'm extremely sorry , sir , "
63302	63398	63299	63300	this emissary	2258	" that a little accident has occurred at the Miss du Lacs ' : a leak in the water - tank . It happened yesterday , and Mr. van der Luyden , who heard of it this morning , sent a housemaid up by the early train to get the Patroon 's house ready . It will be quite comfortable , I think you 'll find , sir ; and the Miss du Lacs have sent their cook over , so that it will be exactly the same as if you 'd been at Rhinebeck . "
63415	63429	63407	63407	he	2259	" It 'll be exactly the same , sir , I do assure you-- "
63443	63486	63431	63431	May	226	" The same as Rhinebeck ? The Patroon 's house ? But it will be a hundred thousand times better -- won't it , Newland ? It 's too dear and kind of Mr. van der Luyden to have thought of it . "
63516	63584	63511	63511	she	2049	" Only fancy , I 've never been inside it -- have you ? The van der Luydens show it to so few people . But they opened it for Ellen , it seems , and she told me what a darling little place it was : she says it 's the only house she 's seen in America that she could imagine being perfectly happy in . "
63585	63601	63603	63604	her husband	645	" Well -- that 's what we 're going to be , is n't it ? "

64492	64511	64512	64512	She	553	" Yes , of course . I meant to say that I sha n't know WHICH to wear . "

64586	64626	64536	64536	He	2306	" Well , perhaps they wear new ball - dresses at home ; but at any rate Mrs. Carfry and Miss Harle wo n't . They 'll wear caps like my mother's -- and shawls ; very soft shawls . "
64627	64639	64442	64442	her	553	" Yes ; but how will the other women be dressed ? "

It was because of that that I abandoned journalism , and took to so much duller work : tutoring and private secretaryship . There is a good deal of drudgery , of course ; but one preserves one 's moral freedom , what we call in French one 's quant a soi . And when one hears good talk one can join in it without compromising any opinions but one 's own ; or one can listen , and answer it inwardly . Ah , good conversation -- there 's nothing like it , is there ? The air of ideas is the only air worth breathing . And so I have never regretted giving up either diplomacy or journalism -- two different forms of the same self - abdication . "
67059	67171	67046	67046	He	2402	" Voyez - vous , Monsieur , to be able to look life in the face : that 's worth living in a garret for , is n't it ? But , after all , one must earn enough to pay for the garret ; and I confess that to grow old as a private tutor -- or a ' private ' anything -- is almost as chilling to the imagination as a second secretaryship at Bucharest . Sometimes I feel I must make a plunge : an immense plunge . Do you suppose , for instance , there would be any opening for me in America -- in New York ? "
67236	67251	67252	67252	he	2402	" New York -- New York -- but must it be especially New York ? "
67293	67311	67312	67312	he	2402	" I -- I thought it your metropolis : is not the intellectual life more active there ? "
67337	67361	67332	67332	he	2402	" One throws out random suggestions -- more to one 's self than to others . In reality , I see no immediate prospect-- "
67376	67391	67367	67367	he	2402	" But Mrs. Carfry will think that I ought to be taking you upstairs . "
67450	67472	67473	67473	he	2402	" That young tutor is an interesting fellow : we had some awfully good talk after dinner about books and things , "
67511	67522	67523	67523	she	2409	" The little Frenchman ? Was n't he dreadfully common ? "
67624	67630	67631	67631	he	2402	" Common -- common WHERE ? "
67641	67666	67667	67667	she	2409	" Why , I should say anywhere but in his school - room . Those people are always awkward in society . But then , "
67671	67684	67667	67667	she	2409	" I suppose I should n't have known if he was clever . "
67692	67694	67667	67667	she	2409	" clever "
67704	67706	67667	67667	she	2409	" common "

67796	67808	67809	67809	he	2402	" Ah -- then I wo n't ask him to dine ! "
67821	67830	67816	67816	May	2420	" Goodness -- ask the Carfrys ' tutor ? "
67831	67870	67875	67875	her	2420	" Well , not on the same day with the Carfrys , if you prefer I should n't . But I did rather want another talk with him . He 's looking for a job in New York . "
67889	67892	67882	67882	she	2420	" foreignness . "
67893	67920	67938	67938	she	2420	" A job in New York ? What sort of a job ? People do n't have French tutors : what does he want to do ? "
67921	67931	67932	67933	her husband	645	" Chiefly to enjoy good conversation , I understand , "
67945	67958	67938	67938	she	2420	" Oh , Newland , how funny ! Is n't that FRENCH ? "
68088	68106	68107	68107	he	2402	" After that I suppose we shall have pretty nearly finished rubbing off each other 's angles , "

69451	69509	69510	69510	She	2470	" My dear Newland , I had no idea that you and May had arrived ! You yourself came only yesterday , you say ? Ah , business -- business -- professional duties ... I understand . Many husbands , I know , find it impossible to join their wives here except for the week - end . "
69527	69543	69512	69512	her	2470	" But marriage is one long sacrifice , as I used often to remind my Ellen-- "
69602	69690	69691	69691	She	230	" No , I am not staying here , but with the Blenkers , in their delicious solitude at Portsmouth . Beaufort was kind enough to send his famous trotters for me this morning , so that I might have at least a glimpse of one of Regina 's garden - parties ; but this evening I go back to rural life . The Blenkers , dear original beings , have hired a primitive old farm - house at Portsmouth where they gather about them representative people ... "
69706	69883	69691	69691	She	230	" This week Dr. Agathon Carver is holding a series of Inner Thought meetings there . A contrast indeed to this gay scene of worldly pleasure -- but then I have always lived on contrasts ! To me the only death is monotony . I always say to Ellen : Beware of monotony ; it 's the mother of all the deadly sins . But my poor child is going through a phase of exaltation , of abhorrence of the world . You know , I suppose , that she has declined all invitations to stay at Newport , even with her grandmother Mingott ? I could hardly persuade her to come with me to the Blenkers ' , if you will believe it ! The life she leads is morbid , unnatural . Ah , if she had only listened to me when it was still possible ... When the door was still open ... But shall we go down and watch this absorbing match ? I hear your May is one of the competitors . "
70219	70253	70254	70254	He	2485	" Hullo , Medora ! Did the trotters do their business ? Forty minutes , eh ? ... Well , that 's not so bad , considering your nerves had to be spared . "
70308	70314	70295	70296	The Marchioness	316	" Que voulez - vous ? "
70339	70352	70332	70332	he	2485	" You know May 's going to carry off the first prize . "
70353	70363	70364	70364	Medora	230	" Ah , then it remains in the family , "
70659	70662	70665	70666	Lawrence Lefferts	224	" Gad , "
70669	70681	70665	70666	Lawrence Lefferts	224	" not one of the lot holds the bow as she does "
70687	70703	70684	70684	Beaufort	231	" Yes ; but that 's the only kind of target she 'll ever hit . "

71002	71025	70998	70998	May	2530	" I should like to tell her myself that I 've won the prize . There 's lots of time before dinner . "
71419	71430	71431	71433	the old lady	3973	" Quite an heirloom , in fact , my dear , "
71436	71448	71431	71433	the old lady	3973	" You must leave it in fee to your eldest girl . "
71463	71551	71449	71449	She	3973	" Well , well , what have I said to make you shake out the red flag ? Ai n't there going to be any daughters -- only boys , eh ? Good gracious , look at her blushing again all over her blushes ! What -- can't I say that either ? Mercy me -- when my children beg me to have all those gods and goddesses painted out overhead I always say I 'm too thankful to have somebody about me that NOTHING can shock ! "
71568	71600	71601	71602	the ancestress	841	" Well , now tell me all about the party , please , my dears , for I shall never get a straight word about it out of that silly Medora , "
71611	71625	71626	71626	she	226	" Cousin Medora ? But I thought she was going back to Portsmouth ? "
71630	71695	71696	71696	she	226	" So she is -- but she 's got to come here first to pick up Ellen . Ah -- you did n't know Ellen had come to spend the day with me ? Such fol - de - rol , her not coming for the summer ; but I gave up arguing with young people about fifty years ago . Ellen -- ELLEN ! "
71761	71764	71758	71758	she	2553	" Miss Ellen "
71780	71802	71803	71803	she	226	" Run down and fetch her , like a good grandson ; this pretty lady will describe the party to me , "

72372	72383	72384	72384	Archer	215	" What am I ? A son - in - law-- "
72538	72563	72564	72564	he	511	" She does n't know -- she has n't guessed . Should n't I know if she came up behind me , I wonder ? "
72574	72593	72569	72569	he	511	" If she does n't turn before that sail crosses the Lime Rock light I 'll go back . "
72675	72694	72695	72695	May	2614	" I 'm sorry you did n't find Ellen -- I should have liked to see her again , "
72705	72719	72695	72695	May	2614	" But perhaps she would n't have cared -- she seems so changed . "
72720	72723	72732	72732	his	645	" Changed ? "
72742	72811	72818	72818	she	2618	" So indifferent to her friends , I mean ; giving up New York and her house , and spending her time with such queer people . Fancy how hideously uncomfortable she must be at the Blenkers ' ! She says she does it to keep cousin Medora out of mischief : to prevent her marrying dreadful people . But I sometimes think we 've always bored her . "
72838	72854	72818	72818	she	2618	" After all , I wonder if she would n't be happier with her husband . "
72861	72865	72866	72866	he	2619	" Sancta simplicitas ! "
72881	72896	72878	72878	he	2619	" I do n't think I ever heard you say a cruel thing before . "
72897	72900	72878	72878	he	2619	" Cruel ? "
72901	72934	72878	72878	he	2619	" Well -- watching the contortions of the damned is supposed to be a favourite sport of the angels ; but I believe even they do n't think people happier in hell . "
72935	72946	72948	72948	May	226	" It 's a pity she ever married abroad then , "
73290	73300	73326	73326	her	553	" A party for the Blenkers -- the Blenkers ? "
73342	73382	73320	73321	his wife	553	" Professor and Mrs. Emerson Sillerton request the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. Welland 's company at the meeting of the Wednesday Afternoon Club on August 25th at 3 o'clock punctually . To meet Mrs. and the Misses Blenker . "

73395	73398	73399	73400	Mr. Welland	335	" Good gracious-- "
73423	73439	73440	73441	Mrs. Welland	219	" Poor Amy Sillerton -- you never can tell what her husband will do next , "
73444	73454	73440	73441	Mrs. Welland	219	" I suppose he 's just discovered the Blenkers . "
73501	73505	73489	73489	He	447	" every advantage . "
73616	73620	73607	73608	Amy Dagonet	448	" something different , "
73746	73752	73753	73754	Mrs. Welland	219	" It 's a wonder , "
73757	73819	73753	73754	Mrs. Welland	219	" that they did n't choose the Cup Race day ! Do you remember , two years ago , their giving a party for a black man on the day of Julia Mingott 's the dansant ? Luckily this time there 's nothing else going on that I know of -- for of course some of us will have to go . "
73825	73898	73820	73821	Mr. Welland	335	" ' Some of us , ' my dear -- more than one ? Three o'clock is such a very awkward hour . I have to be here at half - past three to take my drops : it 's really no use trying to follow Bencomb 's new treatment if I do n't do it systematically ; and if I join you later , of course I shall miss my drive . "
73924	73939	73940	73941	his wife	553	" There 's no reason why you should go at all , my dear , "
73951	73993	73994	73994	She	553	" I have some cards to leave at the other end of Bellevue Avenue , and I 'll drop in at about half - past three and stay long enough to make poor Amy feel that she has n't been slighted . "
74001	74027	73994	73994	She	553	" And if Newland 's afternoon is provided for perhaps May can drive you out with the ponies , and try their new russet harness . "
74048	74052	74045	74046	Mrs. Welland	219	" provided for . "
74059	74062	74045	74046	Mrs. Welland	219	" kill time "
74158	74176	74177	74177	May	2675	" Of course I 'll drive with Papa -- I'm sure Newland will find something to do , "
74250	74267	74245	74245	he	2677	" Oh , I think for a change I 'll just save it instead of spending it-- "
74308	74316	74317	74318	Mrs. Welland	219	" Newland never seems to look ahead , "
74332	74356	74328	74328	May	2681	" No ; but you see it does n't matter , because when there 's nothing particular to do he reads a book . "
74357	74366	74367	74368	Mrs. Welland	219	" Ah , yes -- like his father ! "
74444	74463	74465	74465	she	226	" I shall be back by six , you know , dear : Papa never drives later than that-- "
74529	74547	74519	74519	May	226	" You see he knows how to plan out his time as well as any of us . "

75748	75754	75764	75764	he	2677	" Oh , Mr. Archer ! "
75819	75849	75850	75850	she	241	" Gracious -- where did you drop from ? I must have been sound asleep in the hammock . Everybody else has gone to Newport . Did you ring ? "
75862	75917	75854	75854	Archer	256	" I -- no -- that is , I was just going to . I had to come up the island to see about a horse , and I drove over on a chance of finding Mrs. Blenker and your visitors . But the house seemed empty -- so I sat down to wait . "
75935	75955	75956	75956	Her	241	" The house IS empty . Mother 's not here , or the Marchioness -- or anybody but me . "
75962	76027	76028	76028	she	241	" Did n't you know that Professor and Mrs. Sillerton are giving a garden - party for mother and all of us this afternoon ? It was too unlucky that I could n't go ; but I 've had a sore throat , and mother was afraid of the drive home this evening . Did you ever know anything so disappointing ? Of course , "
76032	76049	76028	76028	she	241	" I should n't have minded half as much if I 'd known you were coming . "
76069	76081	76061	76061	Archer	256	" But Madame Olenska -- has she gone to Newport too ? "
76090	76103	76082	76083	Miss Blenker	452	" Madame Olenska -- didn't you know she 'd been called away ? "
76104	76107	76159	76159	she	452	" Called away?-- "
76108	76151	76082	76083	Miss Blenker	452	" Oh , my best parasol ! I lent it to that goose of a Katie , because it matched her ribbons , and the careless thing must have dropped it here . We Blenkers are all like that ... real Bohemians ! "
76171	76220	76221	76222	Miss Blenker	452	" Yes , Ellen was called away yesterday : she lets us call her Ellen , you know . A telegram came from Boston : she said she might be gone for two days . I do LOVE the way she does her hair , do n't you ? "
76261	76286	76258	76258	he	256	" You do n't happen to know why Madame Olenska went to Boston ? I hope it was not on account of bad news ? "
76296	76364	76287	76288	Miss Blenker	452	" Oh , I do n't believe so . She did n't tell us what was in the telegram . I think she did n't want the Marchioness to know . She 's so romantic - looking , is n't she ? Does n't she remind you of Mrs. Scott - Siddons when she reads ' Lady Geraldine 's Courtship ' ? Did you never hear her ? "
76470	76493	76465	76465	He	256	" You do n't know , I suppose -- I shall be in Boston tomorrow . If I could manage to see her-- "
76510	76538	76506	76506	her	452	" Oh , of course ; how lovely of you ! She 's staying at the Parker House ; it must be horrible there in this weather . "
77110	77118	77119	77119	he	256	" The lady was out , sir , "
77134	77136	77131	77131	he	256	" Out?-- "
77382	77383	77397	77397	her	2785	" Oh"--she
77416	77417	77427	77427	he	256	" Oh"--she
77447	77458	77459	77459	Archer	256	" I 'm here on business -- just got here , "
77478	77490	77491	77491	He	256	" But what on earth are you doing in this wilderness ? "
77525	77537	77538	77538	she	2785	" I ? Oh , I 'm here on business too , "
77605	77612	77613	77613	he	256	" You do your hair differently , "
77627	77649	77700	77700	her	2785	" Differently ? No -- it 's only that I do it as best I can when I 'm without Nastasia . "
77650	77660	77700	77700	her	2785	" Nastasia ; but is n't she with you ? "
77661	77680	77700	77700	her	2785	" No ; I 'm alone . For two days it was not worth while to bring her . "
77681	77691	77700	77700	her	2785	" You 're alone -- at the Parker House ? "
77704	77712	77692	77692	She	2785	" Does it strike you as dangerous ? "
77713	77718	77700	77700	her	2785	" No ; not dangerous-- "
77719	77731	77732	77732	She	2785	" But unconventional ? I see ; I suppose it is . "
77737	77756	77732	77732	She	2785	" I had n't thought of it , because I 've just done something so much more unconventional . "
77767	77785	77764	77764	her	2785	" I 've just refused to take back a sum of money -- that belonged to me . "
77820	77831	77764	77764	her	2785	" Some one -- has come here to meet you ? "
77832	77835	77812	77812	he	256	" Yes . "
77836	77841	77764	77764	her	2785	" With this offer ? "
77845	77855	77812	77812	he	256	" And you refused -- because of the conditions ? "
77856	77860	77861	77861	she	2785	" I refused , "
77874	77880	77867	77867	He	256	" What were the conditions ? "
77881	77902	77812	77812	he	256	" Oh , they were not onerous : just to sit at the head of his table now and then . "
77933	77943	77867	77867	He	256	" He wants you back -- at any price ? "
77944	77960	77867	77867	He	256	" Well -- a considerable price . At least the sum is considerable for me . "
77975	77986	77867	77867	He	256	" It was to meet him here that you came ? "
77997	78017	77987	77987	She	2785	" Meet him -- my husband ? HERE ? At this season he 's always at Cowes or Baden . "
78018	78024	77867	77867	He	256	" He sent some one ? "
78025	78028	77987	77987	She	2785	" Yes . "
78029	78034	77867	77867	He	256	" With a letter ? "
78040	78065	78037	78037	her	2785	" No ; just a message . He never writes . I do n't think I 've had more than one letter from him . "
78085	78092	78037	78037	her	2785	" Why does he never write ? "
78093	78105	78037	78037	her	2785	" Why should he ? What does one have secretaries for ? "
78146	78155	78141	78141	his	511	" Did he send his secretary , then ? "
78184	78187	78174	78174	He	511	" And the person?"--
78188	78195	78196	78197	Madame Olenska	241	" The emissary ? The emissary , "
78203	78232	78196	78197	Madame Olenska	241	" might , for all I care , have left already ; but he has insisted on waiting till this evening ... in case ... on the chance ... "
78233	78245	78174	78174	He	511	" And you came out here to think the chance over ? "
78246	78273	78196	78197	Madame Olenska	241	" I came out to get a breath of air . The hotel 's too stifling . I 'm taking the afternoon train back to Portsmouth . "
78307	78313	78296	78296	she	241	" You 're not changed . "
78319	78329	78314	78314	He	511	" I was , till I saw you again ; "
78346	78384	78385	78385	She	241	" This is horrible . Why should n't we go out a little on the bay ? There 's a breeze , and it will be cooler . We might take the steamboat down to Point Arley . "
78396	78431	78392	78392	he	511	" On a Monday morning there wo n't be anybody on the boat . My train does n't leave till evening : I 'm going back to New York . Why should n't we ? "
78446	78455	78442	78442	he	511	" Have n't we done all we could ? "
78456	78457	78392	78392	he	511	" Oh"--she
78500	78511	78512	78512	she	241	" You must n't say things like that to me , "
78515	78555	78556	78556	he	511	" I 'll say anything you like ; or nothing . I wo n't open my mouth unless you tell me to . What harm can it do to anybody ? All I want is to listen to you , "
78573	78580	78581	78581	he	511	" Oh , do n't calculate , "
78585	78608	78581	78581	he	511	" give me the day ! I want to get you away from that man . At what time was he coming ? "
78614	78618	78609	78609	Her	241	" At eleven . "
78619	78627	78581	78581	he	511	" Then you must come at once . "
78628	78641	78609	78609	Her	241	" You need n't be afraid -- if I do n't come . "
78642	78689	78581	78581	he	511	" Nor you either -- if you do . I swear I only want to hear about you , to know what you 've been doing . It 's a hundred years since we 've met -- it may be another hundred before we meet again . "
78701	78723	78724	78724	she	241	" Why did n't you come down to the beach to fetch me , the day I was at Granny 's ? "
78727	78754	78755	78755	He	511	" Because you did n't look round -- because you did n't know I was there . I swore I would n't unless you looked round . "
78766	78776	78820	78820	She	241	" But I did n't look round on purpose . "
78777	78781	78820	78820	She	241	" On purpose ? "
78782	78806	78820	78820	She	241	" I knew you were there ; when you drove in I recognised the ponies . So I went down to the beach . "
78807	78819	78820	78820	She	241	" To get away from me as far as you could ? "
78827	78839	78820	78820	She	241	" To get away from you as far as I could . "
78851	78868	78869	78869	he	511	" Well , you see it 's no use . I may as well tell you , "
78872	78901	78869	78869	he	511	" that the business I came here for was just to find you . But , look here , we must start or we shall miss our boat . "
78902	78906	78907	78907	She	241	" Our boat ? "
78915	78933	78907	78907	She	241	" Oh , but I must go back to the hotel first : I must leave a note-- "
78934	78947	78948	78948	He	511	" As many notes as you please . You can write here . "
78963	79005	79006	79006	He	511	" I 've even got an envelope -- you see how everything 's predestined ! There -- steady the thing on your knee , and I 'll get the pen going in a second . They have to be humoured ; wait-- "
79021	79039	79006	79006	He	511	" It 's like jerking down the mercury in a thermometer : just a trick . Now try-- "
79159	79161	79135	79135	she	241	" herdic "
79189	79207	79208	79208	They	2805	" I told you everything was predestined ! Here 's a cab for us . You see ! "
79241	79243	79208	79208	They	2805	" foreign "
79296	79303	79304	79304	he	256	" Shall I take it in ? "
79757	79772	79773	79773	he	256	" If she does n't come soon I 'll go in and find her , "
80269	80281	80282	80282	he	256	" This is hopeless -- I'll ask for a private room , "
80589	80591	80566	80566	she	241	" society "
80636	80638	80625	80625	she	241	" different "
80719	80744	80689	80702	poor Medora , who had worn out the patience of all her other relations	2861	" But Dr. Carver -- aren't you afraid of Dr. Carver ? I hear he 's been staying with you at the Blenkers ' . "
80748	80786	80745	80745	She	241	" Oh , the Carver danger is over . Dr. Carver is a very clever man . He wants a rich wife to finance his plans , and Medora is simply a good advertisement as a convert . "
80787	80793	80689	80702	poor Medora , who had worn out the patience of all her other relations	2861	" A convert to what ? "
80794	80853	80854	80854	She	241	" To all sorts of new and crazy social schemes . But , do you know , they interest me more than the blind conformity to tradition -- somebody else 's tradition -- that I see among our own friends . It seems stupid to have discovered America only to make it into a copy of another country . "
80860	80883	80854	80854	She	241	" Do you suppose Christopher Columbus would have taken all that trouble just to go to the Opera with the Selfridge Merrys ? "
80888	80900	80901	80901	he	256	" And Beaufort -- do you say these things to Beaufort ? "
80905	80925	80854	80854	She	241	" I have n't seen him for a long time . But I used to ; and he understands . "
80926	80955	80956	80956	He	256	" Ah , it 's what I 've always told you ; you do n't like us . And you like Beaufort because he 's so unlike us . "
80981	80999	81000	81000	he	256	" We 're damnably dull . We 've no character , no colour , no variety.--I wonder , "
81004	81012	81000	81000	he	256	" why you do n't go back ? "
81056	81065	81053	81053	she	2866	" I believe it 's because of you . "
81139	81143	81144	81144	she	2866	" At least , "
81147	81191	81194	81194	her	2866	" it was you who made me understand that under the dullness there are things so fine and sensitive and delicate that even those I most cared for in my other life look cheap in comparison . I do n't know how to explain myself"--she
81196	81224	81247	81247	her	2866	brows--"but it seems as if I 'd never before understood with how much that is hard and shabby and base the most exquisite pleasures may be paid . "
81225	81237	81238	81238	he	256	" Exquisite pleasures -- it 's something to have had them ! "
81253	81257	81258	81258	she	2866	" I want , "
81262	81303	81258	81258	she	2866	" to be perfectly honest with you -- and with myself . For a long time I 've hoped this chance would come : that I might tell you how you 've helped me , what you 've made of me-- "
81318	81332	81311	81311	He	256	" And what do you make out that you 've made of me ? "
81338	81342	81333	81333	She	2866	" Of you ? "
81343	81376	81424	81424	her	2866	" Yes : for I 'm of your making much more than you ever were of mine . I 'm the man who married one woman because another one told him to . "
81385	81401	81377	81377	Her	2866	" I thought -- you promised -- you were not to say such things today . "
81402	81421	81424	81424	her	2866	" Ah -- how like a woman ! None of you will ever see a bad business through ! "
81427	81437	81424	81424	her	2866	" IS it a bad business -- for May ? "
81468	81490	81491	81491	she	2866	" For that 's the thing we 've always got to think of -- haven't we -- by your own showing ? "
81494	81499	81500	81500	he	2868	" My own showing ? "
81511	81516	81517	81517	she	2866	" Or if not , "
81529	81596	81517	81517	she	2866	" if it 's not worth while to have given up , to have missed things , so that others may be saved from disillusionment and misery -- then everything I came home for , everything that made my other life seem by contrast so bare and so poor because no one there took account of them -- all these things are a sham or a dream-- "
81606	81624	81625	81625	he	2868	" And in that case there 's no reason on earth why you should n't go back ? "
81638	81646	81630	81630	Her	2866	" Oh , IS there no reason ? "
81647	81664	81665	81665	he	2868	" Not if you staked your all on the success of my marriage . My marriage , "
81669	81682	81665	81665	he	2868	" is n't going to be a sight to keep you here . "
81693	81736	81689	81689	he	2868	" What 's the use ? You gave me my first glimpse of a real life , and at the same moment you asked me to go on with a sham one . It 's beyond human enduring -- that 's all . "
81737	81751	81752	81752	she	2866	" Oh , do n't say that ; when I 'm enduring it ! "
81821	81834	81838	81838	she	2866	" You too -- oh , all this time , you too ? "
82068	82080	82081	82081	he	256	" What 's the use -- when you will go back ? "
82112	82121	82104	82104	She	2866	" Oh -- I sha n't go yet ! "
82122	82138	82101	82101	his	256	" Not yet ? Some time , then ? Some time that you already foresee ? "
82147	82174	82141	82141	she	2866	" I promise you : not as long as you hold out . Not as long as we can look straight at each other like this . "
82188	82217	82182	82182	her	2866	" If you lift a finger you 'll drive me back : back to all the abominations you know of , and all the temptations you half guess . "
82252	82258	82259	82259	he	256	" What a life for you!-- "
82262	82275	82225	82225	she	2866	" Oh -- as long as it 's a part of yours . "
82276	82284	82225	82225	she	2866	" And mine a part of yours ? "
82288	82301	82259	82259	he	256	" And that 's to be all -- for either of us ? "
82302	82313	82225	82225	she	2866	" Well ; it IS all , is n't it ? "
82493	82500	82501	82501	she	2866	" Don't -- don't be unhappy , "
82522	82535	82519	82519	he	256	" You wo n't go back -- you wo n't go back ? "
82548	82555	82556	82556	she	2866	" I wo n't go back , "
83241	83251	83227	83227	he	511	" Surely , Monsieur , we met in London ? "
83252	83262	83263	83263	Archer	256	" Ah , to be sure : in London ! "
83272	83282	83283	83283	he	511	" So you DID get here , after all ? "
83304	83313	83314	83315	M. Riviere	433	" Oh , I got here -- yes , "
83321	83334	83314	83315	M. Riviere	433	" But not for long ; I return the day after tomorrow . "
83361	83382	83314	83315	M. Riviere	433	" I wonder , Monsieur , since I 've had the good luck to run across you , if I might-- "
83383	83428	83314	83315	M. Riviere	433	" I was just going to suggest it : come to luncheon , wo n't you ? Down town , I mean : if you 'll look me up in my office I 'll take you to a very decent restaurant in that quarter . "
83437	83475	83429	83430	M. Riviere	433	" You 're too kind . But I was only going to ask if you would tell me how to reach some sort of conveyance . There are no porters , and no one here seems to listen-- "
83476	83522	83523	83525	The young man	511	" I know : our American stations must surprise you . When you ask for a porter they give you chewing - gum . But if you 'll come along I 'll extricate you ; and you must really lunch with me , you know . "
83666	83679	83652	83654	the young man	511	" I believe I saw you , sir , yesterday in Boston . "
83711	83719	83720	83721	M. Riviere	433	" It is extraordinary , very extraordinary , "
83724	83739	83720	83721	M. Riviere	433	" that we should have met in the circumstances in which I find myself . "
83740	83744	83745	83745	Archer	256	" What circumstances ? "
83767	83793	83757	83758	M. Riviere	433	" I have come , not to look for employment , as I spoke of doing when we last met , but on a special mission-- "
83794	83797	83798	83798	Archer	256	" Ah-- ! "
83846	83851	83852	83852	Archer	256	" A special mission , "
83891	83895	83887	83887	himself	256	" Do sit down "
83911	83924	83925	83925	Archer	256	" It was about this mission that you wanted to consult me ? "
83935	83971	83929	83930	M. Riviere	433	" Not in my own behalf : on that score I -- I have fully dealt with myself . I should like -- if I may -- to speak to you about the Countess Olenska . "
84014	84020	84021	84021	he	256	" And on whose behalf , "
84024	84032	84021	84021	he	256	" do you wish to do this ? "
84040	84068	84033	84034	M. Riviere	433	" Well -- I might say HERS , if it did not sound like a liberty . Shall I say instead : on behalf of abstract justice ? "
84074	84086	84069	84069	Archer	256	" In other words : you are Count Olenski 's messenger ? "
84101	84121	84087	84087	He	256	" Not to YOU , Monsieur . If I come to you , it is on quite other grounds . "
84122	84139	84140	84140	Archer	256	" What right have you , in the circumstances , to BE on any other ground ? "
84143	84154	84140	84140	Archer	256	" If you 're an emissary you 're an emissary . "
84160	84178	84155	84157	The young man	511	" My mission is over : as far as the Countess Olenska goes , it has failed . "
84179	84186	84187	84187	Archer	256	" I ca n't help that , "
84196	84203	84204	84205	M. Riviere	433	" No : but you can help-- "
84231	84252	84204	84205	M. Riviere	433	" You can help , Monsieur , I am convinced , to make it equally a failure with her family . "
84262	84271	84272	84272	he	256	" Well -- and by God I will ! "
84332	84337	84338	84338	Archer	256	" Why the devil , "
84342	84380	84338	84338	Archer	256	" should you have thought -- since I suppose you 're appealing to me on the ground of my relationship to Madame Olenska -- that I should take a view contrary to the rest of her family ? "
84428	84432	84398	84398	His	433	" Oh , Monsieur-- "
84433	84439	84440	84440	Archer	256	" I ca n't imagine , "
84443	84483	84440	84440	Archer	256	" why you should have come to me when there are others so much nearer to the Countess ; still less why you thought I should be more accessible to the arguments I suppose you were sent over with . "
84494	84518	84484	84485	M. Riviere	433	" The arguments I want to present to you , Monsieur , are my own and not those I was sent over with . "
84519	84531	84440	84440	Archer	256	" Then I see still less reason for listening to them . "
84568	84602	84562	84562	he	433	" Monsieur -- will you tell me one thing ? Is it my right to be here that you question ? Or do you perhaps believe the whole matter to be already closed ? "
84645	84659	84603	84603	His	433	" I beg your pardon : but why is n't the matter closed ? "
84669	84708	84660	84661	M. Riviere	433	" You do , then , agree with the rest of the family that , in face of the new proposals I have brought , it is hardly possible for Madame Olenska not to return to her husband ? "
84709	84713	84714	84714	Archer	256	" Good God ! "
84728	84780	84660	84661	M. Riviere	433	" Before seeing her , I saw -- at Count Olenski 's request -- Mr. Lovell Mingott , with whom I had several talks before going to Boston . I understand that he represents his mother 's view ; and that Mrs. Manson Mingott 's influence is great throughout her family . "
84903	84917	84887	84887	their	2927	" Perhaps , after all , Ellen would be happier with her husband . "
85080	85119	85069	85069	Archer	215	" Do n't you know , Monsieur -- is it possible you do n't know -- that the family begin to doubt if they have the right to advise the Countess to refuse her husband 's last proposals ? "
85120	85126	85179	85179	he	256	" The proposals you brought ? "
85127	85133	85069	85069	Archer	215	" The proposals I brought . "
85189	85201	85179	85179	he	256	" What is your object in speaking to me of this ? "
85213	85244	85245	85246	M. Riviere	433	" To beg you , Monsieur -- to beg you with all the force I 'm capable of -- not to let her go back.--Oh , do n't let her ! "
85298	85303	85304	85304	he	256	" May I ask , "
85309	85322	85304	85304	he	256	" if this is the line you took with the Countess Olenska ? "
85334	85387	85323	85324	M. Riviere	433	" No , Monsieur : I accepted my mission in good faith . I really believed -- for reasons I need not trouble you with -- that it would be better for Madame Olenska to recover her situation , her fortune , the social consideration that her husband 's standing gives her . "
85388	85403	85304	85304	he	256	" So I supposed : you could hardly have accepted such a mission otherwise . "
85404	85412	85323	85324	M. Riviere	433	" I should not have accepted it . "
85413	85418	85419	85419	Archer	215	" Well , then-- ? "
85432	85458	85323	85324	M. Riviere	433	" Ah , Monsieur , after I had seen her , after I had listened to her , I knew she was better off here . "
85459	85463	85586	85588	The young man	511	" You knew-- ? "
85464	85548	85323	85324	M. Riviere	433	" Monsieur , I discharged my mission faithfully : I put the Count 's arguments , I stated his offers , without adding any comment of my own . The Countess was good enough to listen patiently ; she carried her goodness so far as to see me twice ; she considered impartially all I had come to say . And it was in the course of these two talks that I changed my mind , that I came to see things differently . "
85549	85559	85586	85588	The young man	511	" May I ask what led to this change ? "
85560	85568	85569	85570	M. Riviere	433	" Simply seeing the change in HER , "
85573	85585	85586	85588	The young man	511	" The change in her ? Then you knew her before ? "
85594	85631	85586	85588	The young man	511	" I used to see her in her husband 's house . I have known Count Olenski for many years . You can imagine that he would not have sent a stranger on such a mission . "
85694	85704	85681	85681	his	2940	" The change -- what sort of a change ? "
85705	85716	85717	85718	M. Riviere	433	" Ah , Monsieur , if I could tell you ! "
85721	85842	85843	85844	M. Riviere	433	" Tenez -- the discovery , I suppose , of what I 'd never thought of before : that she 's an American . And that if you 're an American of HER kind -- of your kind -- things that are accepted in certain other societies , or at least put up with as part of a general convenient give - and - take -- become unthinkable , simply unthinkable . If Madame Olenska 's relations understood what these things were , their opposition to her returning would no doubt be as unconditional as her own ; but they seem to regard her husband 's wish to have her back as proof of an irresistible longing for domestic life . "
85851	85863	85843	85844	M. Riviere	433	" Whereas it 's far from being as simple as that . "
85940	85944	85945	85945	Archer	215	" Thank you , "
85949	85965	85966	85967	M. Riviere	433	" There 's nothing to thank me for , Monsieur : it is I , rather-- "
85980	85987	85988	85988	he	433	" I should like , though , "
85995	86100	85988	85988	he	433	" to add one thing . You asked me if I was in Count Olenski 's employ . I am at this moment : I returned to him , a few months ago , for reasons of private necessity such as may happen to any one who has persons , ill and older persons , dependent on him . But from the moment that I have taken the step of coming here to say these things to you I consider myself discharged , and I shall tell him so on my return , and give him the reasons . That 's all , Monsieur . "
86110	86114	86115	86115	Archer	215	" Thank you , "
86562	86564	86559	86559	he	457	" advanced "
86589	86591	86584	86584	he	457	" trend "
86614	86631	86632	86632	she	215	" There 's no doubt that Dr. Ashmore is right : there IS a marked trend , "
86651	86665	86666	86667	Miss Jackson	263	" It was odd , though , to preach about it on Thanksgiving , "
86676	86690	86671	86672	her hostess	2962	" Oh , he means us to give thanks for what 's left . "
86729	86731	86671	86672	her hostess	2962	" trend "
86735	86740	86741	86742	Miss Jackson	263	" The extravagance in dress-- "
86745	86819	86741	86742	Miss Jackson	263	" Sillerton took me to the first night of the Opera , and I can only tell you that Jane Merry 's dress was the only one I recognised from last year ; and even that had had the front panel changed . Yet I know she got it out from Worth only two years ago , because my seamstress always goes in to make over her Paris dresses before she wears them . "
86820	86830	86832	86833	Mrs. Archer	215	" Ah , Jane Merry is one of US , "
86890	86904	86905	86906	Miss Jackson	263	" Yes ; she 's one of the few . In my youth , "
86909	87044	86905	86906	Miss Jackson	263	" it was considered vulgar to dress in the newest fashions ; and Amy Sillerton has always told me that in Boston the rule was to put away one 's Paris dresses for two years . Old Mrs. Baxter Pennilow , who did everything handsomely , used to import twelve a year , two velvet , two satin , two silk , and the other six of poplin and the finest cashmere . It was a standing order , and as she was ill for two years before she died they found forty - eight Worth dresses that had never been taken out of tissue paper ; and when the girls left off their mourning they were able to wear the first lot at the Symphony concerts without looking in advance of the fashion . "
87045	87080	87081	87082	Mrs. Archer	215	" Ah , well , Boston is more conservative than New York ; but I always think it 's a safe rule for a lady to lay aside her French dresses for one season , "
87085	87129	87130	87131	Miss Jackson	263	" It was Beaufort who started the new fashion by making his wife clap her new clothes on her back as soon as they arrived : I must say at times it takes all Regina 's distinction not to look like ... like ... "
87151	87156	87158	87160	Mr. Sillerton Jackson	225	" Like her rivals , "
87170	87172	87173	87174	the ladies	735	" Oh,-- "
87193	87223	87178	87179	Mrs. Archer	215	" Poor Regina ! Her Thanksgiving has n't been a very cheerful one , I 'm afraid . Have you heard the rumours about Beaufort 's speculations , Sillerton ? "
87438	87457	87458	87458	she	215	" Of course , Newland , I know you let dear May go to Mrs. Struthers 's Sunday evenings-- "
87466	87490	87462	87462	May	2981	" Oh , you know , everybody goes to Mrs. Struthers 's now ; and she was invited to Granny 's last reception . "
87596	87605	87606	87607	Mrs. Archer	215	" I know , dear , I know , "
87610	87651	87606	87607	Mrs. Archer	215	" Such things have to be , I suppose , as long as AMUSEMENT is what people go out for ; but I 've never quite forgiven your cousin Madame Olenska for being the first person to countenance Mrs. Struthers . "
87677	87681	87682	87682	she	215	" Oh , ELLEN-- "
87702	87708	87682	87682	she	215	" Oh , THE BLENKERS-- . "
87798	87833	87783	87784	His mother	512	" I 've always thought that people like the Countess Olenska , who have lived in aristocratic societies , ought to help us to keep up our social distinctions , instead of ignoring them . "
87861	87873	87875	87876	Miss Jackson	263	" I 've no doubt we all seem alike to foreigners , "
87879	87899	87900	87900	May	2995	" I do n't think Ellen cares for society ; but nobody knows exactly what she does care for , "
87913	87917	87918	87919	Mrs. Archer	215	" Ah , well-- "
87989	87996	87980	87980	They	3000	" let poor Ellen find her own level"--and
88014	88018	88020	88020	their	3000	" people who wrote "
88050	88053	88060	88060	she	233	" Bohemian . "
88109	88120	88122	88123	Miss Sophy	263	" Madame Olenska is a great favourite with the gentlemen , "
88145	88164	88165	88166	Mrs. Archer	215	" Ah , that 's the danger that a young woman like Madame Olenska is always exposed to , "
88234	88241	88242	88242	he	225	" If the Beaufort smash comes , "
88245	88253	88242	88242	he	225	" there are going to be disclosures . "
88288	88295	88296	88297	Mr. Jackson	225	" There 's bound to be , "
88300	88319	88296	88297	Mr. Jackson	225	" the nastiest kind of a cleaning up . He has n't spent all his money on Regina . "
88320	88342	88344	88346	the young man	511	" Oh , well -- that 's discounted , is n't it ? My belief is he 'll pull out yet , "
88354	88375	88376	88377	Mr. Jackson	225	" Perhaps -- perhaps . I know he was to see some of the influential people today . Of course , "
88381	88423	88376	88377	Mr. Jackson	225	" it 's to be hoped they can tide him over -- this time anyhow . I should n't like to think of poor Regina 's spending the rest of her life in some shabby foreign watering - place for bankrupts . "
88557	88561	88550	88550	she	241	" Not yet . "
88733	88771	88777	88778	Mr. Jackson	225	" I do n't know , of course , how far your wife 's family are aware of what people say about -- well , about Madame Olenska 's refusal to accept her husband 's latest offer . "
88782	88799	88777	88778	Mr. Jackson	225	" It 's a pity -- it 's certainly a pity -- that she refused it . "
88800	88811	88777	88778	Mr. Jackson	225	" A pity ? In God 's name , why ? "
88830	88850	88777	88778	Mr. Jackson	225	" Well -- to put it on the lowest ground -- what 's she going to live on now ? "
88851	88854	88777	88778	Mr. Jackson	225	" Now-- ? "
88855	88858	88777	88778	Mr. Jackson	225	" If Beaufort-- "
88892	88902	88863	88863	his	225	" What the devil do you mean , sir ? "
88925	89017	89018	89019	Mr. Jackson	225	" Well -- I have it on pretty good authority -- in fact , on old Catherine 's herself -- that the family reduced Countess Olenska 's allowance considerably when she definitely refused to go back to her husband ; and as , by this refusal , she also forfeits the money settled on her when she married -- which Olenski was ready to make over to her if she returned -- why , what the devil do YOU mean , my dear boy , by asking me what I mean ? "
89041	89068	89116	89117	the other	907	" I do n't know anything of Madame Olenska 's private affairs ; but I do n't need to , to be certain that what you insinuate-- "
89069	89083	89084	89085	Mr. Jackson	225	" Oh , I do n't : it 's Lefferts , for one , "
89088	89102	89103	89103	Archer	215	" Lefferts -- who made love to her and got snubbed for it ! "
89108	89114	89116	89117	the other	907	" Ah -- DID he ? "
89160	89179	89180	89180	he	907	" Well , well : it 's a pity she did n't go back before Beaufort 's cropper , "
89183	89216	89180	89180	he	907	" If she goes NOW , and if he fails , it will only confirm the general impression : which is n't by any means peculiar to Lefferts , by the way . "
89217	89231	89232	89232	Archer	215	" Oh , she wo n't go back now : less than ever ! "
89264	89381	89257	89259	The old gentleman	3022	" That 's your opinion , eh ? Well , no doubt you know . But everybody will tell you that the few pennies Medora Manson has left are all in Beaufort 's hands ; and how the two women are to keep their heads above water unless he does , I ca n't imagine . Of course , Madame Olenska may still soften old Catherine , who 's been the most inexorably opposed to her staying ; and old Catherine could make her any allowance she chooses . But we all know that she hates parting with good money ; and the rest of the family have no particular interest in keeping Madame Olenska here . "
89543	89553	89554	89554	he	3023	" Shall we go up and join my mother ? "
89652	89655	89656	89656	he	3023	" May ! "
89676	89697	89698	89698	he	3023	" This lamp is smoking again ; I should think the servants might see that it 's kept properly trimmed , "
89702	89714	89715	89715	she	226	" I 'm so sorry : it sha n't happen again , "
89778	89796	89775	89775	he	3023	" How young she is ! For what endless years this life will have to go on ! "
89818	89822	89823	89823	he	3023	" Look here , "
89827	89846	89823	89823	he	3023	" I may have to go to Washington for a few days -- soon ; next week perhaps . "
89885	89889	89890	89890	she	226	" On business ? "
89925	89942	89943	89943	He	3023	" On business , naturally . There 's a patent case coming up before the Supreme Court-- "
89973	89979	89965	89965	she	226	" Yes , I see . "
89980	89988	89989	89989	she	226	" The change will do you good , "
89998	90010	90011	90011	she	226	" and you must be sure to go and see Ellen , "
90072	90316	90021	90021	her	226	" Of course you understand that I know all that people have been saying about Ellen , and heartily sympathise with my family in their effort to get her to return to her husband . I also know that , for some reason you have not chosen to tell me , you have advised her against this course , which all the older men of the family , as well as our grandmother , agree in approving ; and that it is owing to your encouragement that Ellen defies us all , and exposes herself to the kind of criticism of which Mr. Sillerton Jackson probably gave you , this evening , the hint that has made you so irritable .... Hints have indeed not been wanting ; but since you appear unwilling to take them from others , I offer you this one myself , in the only form in which well - bred people of our kind can communicate unpleasant things to each other : by letting you understand that I know you mean to see Ellen when you are in Washington , and are perhaps going there expressly for that purpose ; and that , since you are sure to see her , I wish you to do so with my full and explicit approval -- and to take the opportunity of letting her know what the course of conduct you have encouraged her in is likely to lead to . "
90356	90366	90367	90367	she	3040	" They smell less if one blows them out , "
90769	90772	90785	90785	he	3041	" tide over "
90878	91023	90872	90873	Mr. Letterblair	353	" I 've seen bad things in my time ; but nothing as bad as this . Everybody we know will be hit , one way or another . And what will be done about Mrs. Beaufort ? What CAN be done about her ? I pity Mrs. Manson Mingott as much as anybody : coming at her age , there 's no knowing what effect this affair may have on her . She always believed in Beaufort -- she made a friend of him ! And there 's the whole Dallas connection : poor Mrs. Beaufort is related to every one of you . Her only chance would be to leave her husband -- yet how can any one tell her so ? Her duty is at his side ; and luckily she seems always to have been blind to his private weaknesses . "
91037	91048	91030	91031	Mr. Letterblair	353	" What is it ? I ca n't be disturbed . "
91075	91167	91066	91068	the young man	511	" Wo n't you please come up town as early as you can ? Granny had a slight stroke last night . In some mysterious way she found out before any one else this awful news about the bank . Uncle Lovell is away shooting , and the idea of the disgrace has made poor Papa so nervous that he has a temperature and ca n't leave his room . Mamma needs you dreadfully , and I do hope you can get away at once and go straight to Granny 's . "
91502	91505	91483	91484	The butler	925	" Mrs. Julius Beaufort"--and
91767	91769	91773	91773	she	217	" desert "
91792	91829	91830	91832	the old woman	3094	" I said to her : ' Honour 's always been honour , and honesty honesty , in Manson Mingott 's house , and will be till I 'm carried out of it feet first , ' "
91850	91901	91830	91832	the old woman	3094	" And when she said : ' But my name , Auntie -- my name 's Regina Dallas , ' I said : ' It was Beaufort when he covered you with jewels , and it 's got to stay Beaufort now that he 's covered you with shame . ' "
91938	91981	91982	91984	the poor lady	1727	" If only I could keep it from your father - in - law : he always says : ' Augusta , for pity 's sake , do n't destroy my last illusions'--and how am I to prevent his knowing these horrors ? "
91987	92000	92001	92002	her daughter	534	" After all , Mamma , he wo n't have SEEN them , "
92010	92046	92006	92007	Mrs. Welland	219	" Ah , no ; thank heaven he 's safe in bed . And Dr. Bencomb has promised to keep him there till poor Mamma is better , and Regina has been got away somewhere . "
92204	92223	92224	92225	Mrs. Welland	219	" There was the case of poor Grandmamma Spicer ; your great - grandmother , May. Of course , "
92230	92347	92224	92225	Mrs. Welland	219	" your great - grandfather 's money difficulties were private -- losses at cards , or signing a note for somebody -- I never quite knew , because Mamma would never speak of it . But she was brought up in the country because her mother had to leave New York after the disgrace , whatever it was : they lived up the Hudson alone , winter and summer , till Mamma was sixteen . It would never have occurred to Grandmamma Spicer to ask the family to ' countenance ' her , as I understand Regina calls it ; though a private disgrace is nothing compared to the scandal of ruining hundreds of innocent people . "
92348	92371	92372	92374	Mrs. Lovell Mingott	218	" Yes , it would be more becoming in Regina to hide her own countenance than to talk about other people 's , "
92377	92415	92372	92374	Mrs. Lovell Mingott	218	" I understand that the emerald necklace she wore at the Opera last Friday had been sent on approval from Ball and Black 's in the afternoon . I wonder if they 'll ever get it back ? "
92648	92699	92636	92637	the latter	574	" She wants me to telegraph for Ellen Olenska . I had written to Ellen , of course , and to Medora ; but now it seems that 's not enough . I 'm to telegraph to her immediately , and to tell her that she 's to come alone . "
92733	92741	92742	92744	Mrs. Lovell Mingott	218	" I suppose it must be done , "
92765	92773	92774	92774	she	574	" Of course it must be done , "
92777	92817	92774	92774	she	574	" Granny knows what she wants , and we must carry out all her wishes . Shall I write the telegram for you , Auntie ? If it goes at once Ellen can probably catch tomorrow morning 's train . "
92840	92864	92832	92832	she	574	" Well , it ca n't go at once . Jasper and the pantry - boy are both out with notes and telegrams . "
92874	92901	92865	92865	May	3130	" But here 's Newland , ready to do anything . Will you take the telegram , Newland ? There 'll be just time before luncheon . "
92919	92924	92911	92911	she	215	" Bonheur du Jour , "
92950	92955	92956	92956	she	215	" What a pity , "
92959	92972	92973	92973	she	215	" that you and Ellen will cross each other on the way!--Newland , "
92983	93043	92973	92973	she	215	" is obliged to go to Washington about a patent law - suit that is coming up before the Supreme Court . I suppose Uncle Lovell will be back by tomorrow night , and with Granny improving so much it does n't seem right to ask Newland to give up an important engagement for the firm -- does it ? "
93059	93079	93054	93055	Mrs. Welland	219	" Oh , of course not , darling . Your Granny would be the last person to wish it . "
93105	93118	93101	93103	Mrs. Lovell Mingott	218	" But why on earth she should make you telegraph for Ellen Olenska-- "
93126	93145	93120	93120	May	226	" Perhaps it 's to urge on her again that after all her duty is with her husband . "
93164	93175	93177	93198	the tart young lady to whom Archer had pushed his wife 's telegram across the brass ledge of the Western Union office	3138	" Ol - ol -- howjer spell it , anyhow ? "
93200	93209	93210	93210	he	3135	" Olenska -- O - len - ska , "
93231	93250	93210	93210	he	3135	" It 's an unlikely name for a New York telegraph office ; at least in this quarter , "
93280	93333	93210	93210	he	3135	" Hallo , Newland : thought I 'd catch you here . I 've just heard of old Mrs. Mingott 's stroke ; and as I was on my way to the house I saw you turning down this street and nipped after you . I suppose you 've come from there ? "
93345	93351	93352	93352	Lefferts	224	" Very bad , eh ? "
93355	93377	93352	93352	Lefferts	224	" Wiring to the family , I suppose . I gather it IS bad , if you 're including Countess Olenska . "
93402	93405	93406	93406	he	3135	" Why ? "

93997	94041	94042	94043	Every one	635	" is to go and live at Regina 's little place in North Carolina . Beaufort has always kept a racing stable , and he had better breed trotting horses . I should say he had all the qualities of a successful horsedealer . "
94115	94135	94136	94136	she	217	" If people of my age WILL eat chicken - salad in the evening what are they to expect ? "

94680	94717	94666	94668	the poor lady	1727	" the only thing that makes me think Mamma must be less well than Dr. Bencomb will admit is this morbid desire to have Ellen come at once , however inconvenient it is to meet her . "

94757	94798	94746	94746	he	335	" have you any other reason for thinking that Bencomb is less to be relied on than he was ? Have you noticed that he has been less conscientious than usual in following up my case or your mother 's ? "
94848	94936	94836	94836	she	219	" My dear , how could you imagine such a thing ? I only meant that , after the decided stand Mamma took about its being Ellen 's duty to go back to her husband , it seems strange that she should be seized with this sudden whim to see her , when there are half a dozen other grandchildren that she might have asked for . But we must never forget that Mamma , in spite of her wonderful vitality , is a very old woman . "
94961	95041	95049	95050	Mr. Welland	335	" Yes : your mother 's a very old woman ; and for all we know Bencomb may not be as successful with very old people . As you say , my dear , it 's always one thing after another ; and in another ten or fifteen years I suppose I shall have the pleasing duty of looking about for a new doctor . It 's always better to make such a change before it 's absolutely necessary . "
95057	95063	95064	95065	Mrs. Welland	219	" But all the while , "
95098	95130	95070	95070	she	219	" I do n't see how Ellen 's to be got here tomorrow evening ; and I do like to have things settled for at least twenty - four hours ahead . "
95157	95163	95164	95164	he	335	" Shall I fetch her ? "
95167	95193	95194	95194	His	335	" I can easily get away from the office in time to meet the brougham at the ferry , if May will send it there . "
95232	95250	95251	95251	she	226	" So you see , Mamma , everything WILL be settled twenty - four hours in advance , "
95308	95344	95305	95305	she	226	" I did n't want to worry Mamma by raising fresh obstacles ; but how can you meet Ellen tomorrow , and bring her back to New York , when you 're going to Washington ? "
95345	95353	95354	95354	Archer	215	" Oh , I 'm not going , "
95357	95367	95368	95368	Her	226	" Not going ? Why , what 's happened ? "
95383	95391	95305	95305	she	226	" The case is off -- postponed . "
95392	95444	95305	95305	she	226	" Postponed ? How odd ! I saw a note this morning from Mr. Letterblair to Mamma saying that he was going to Washington tomorrow for the big patent case that he was to argue before the Supreme Court . You said it was a patent case , did n't you ? "
95445	95466	95305	95305	she	226	" Well -- that 's it : the whole office ca n't go . Letterblair decided to go this morning . "
95467	95474	95475	95475	she	226	" Then it 's NOT postponed ? "
95509	95517	95518	95518	he	3196	" No : but my going is , "
95586	95603	95604	95604	he	3196	" I 'm not going till later on : luckily for the convenience of your family , "
95666	95674	95675	95675	May	3202	" Yes ; it IS awfully convenient , "
95679	95703	95675	95675	May	3202	" that you should be able to meet Ellen after all ; you saw how much Mamma appreciated your offering to do it . "
95704	95714	95724	95724	she	226	" Oh , I 'm delighted to do it . "
95735	95742	95743	95743	she	226	" Good - bye , dearest , "
95783	95811	95763	95763	He	3196	" It 's all of two hours from Jersey City to old Catherine 's . It 's all of two hours -- and it may be more . "
95957	95969	95970	95970	Archer	215	" I do n't care which of their visions comes true , "
95973	95984	95970	95970	Archer	215	" as long as the tunnel is n't built yet . "
96220	96229	96230	96230	he	3196	" This way -- I have the carriage , "
96286	96290	96284	96284	her	241	" Poor Regina ! "
96360	96371	96347	96347	her	241	" If only it does n't mean -- poor Granny ! "
96372	96397	96398	96398	he	3196	" Oh , no , no -- she 's much better -- she 's all right , really . There -- we've passed it ! "
96462	96470	96459	96459	he	3196	" You did n't expect me today ? "
96471	96476	96459	96459	he	3196	" Oh , no . "
96477	96504	96459	96459	he	3196	" I meant to go to Washington to see you . I 'd made all my arrangements -- I very nearly crossed you in the train . "
96505	96507	96508	96508	she	241	" Oh-- "
96521	96531	96459	96459	he	3196	" Do you know -- I hardly remembered you ? "
96532	96537	96459	96459	he	3196	" Hardly remembered me ? "
96538	96564	96459	96459	he	3196	" I mean : how shall I explain ? I -- it 's always so . EACH TIME YOU HAPPEN TO ME ALL OVER AGAIN . "
96565	96576	96459	96459	he	3196	" Oh , yes : I know ! I know ! "
96577	96588	96589	96589	he	3239	" Does it -- do I too : to you ? "
96601	96608	96459	96459	he	3196	" Ellen -- Ellen -- Ellen ! "
96724	96735	96736	96736	she	241	" What a pretty carriage ! Is it May 's ? "
96747	96750	96779	96779	he	3239	" Yes . "
96751	96769	96779	96779	he	3239	" It was May who sent you to fetch me , then ? How kind of her ! "
96783	96800	96779	96779	he	3239	" Your husband 's secretary came to see me the day after we met in Boston . "
96900	96908	96897	96897	he	3239	" He writes to her , then . "
96909	96917	96897	96897	he	3239	" M. Riviere went to see you ? "
96918	96926	96897	96897	he	3239	" Yes : did n't you know ? "
96927	96930	96931	96931	she	241	" No , "
96935	96942	96897	96897	he	3239	" And you 're not surprised ? "
96946	96972	96943	96943	She	241	" Why should I be ? He told me in Boston that he knew you ; that he 'd met you in England I think . "
96973	96983	96897	96897	he	3239	" Ellen -- I must ask you one thing . "
96984	96987	96943	96943	She	241	" Yes . "
96988	97025	96897	96897	he	3239	" I wanted to ask it after I saw him , but I could n't put it in a letter . It was Riviere who helped you to get away -- when you left your husband ? "
97042	97052	97053	97053	she	3247	" Yes : I owe him a great debt , "
97110	97123	97124	97124	he	3246	" I think you 're the most honest woman I ever met ! "
97127	97140	97141	97141	she	3247	" Oh , no -- but probably one of the least fussy , "
97150	97165	97088	97088	her	3247	" Call it what you like : you look at things as they are . "
97166	97182	97147	97147	her	3247	" Ah -- I've had to . I 've had to look at the Gorgon . "
97183	97207	97088	97088	her	3247	" Well -- it has n't blinded you ! You 've seen that she 's just an old bogey like all the others . "
97208	97223	97147	97147	her	3247	" She does n't blind one ; but she dries up one 's tears . "
97306	97324	97301	97301	his	511	" If you 're not blind , then , you must see that this ca n't last . "
97325	97330	97301	97301	his	511	" What ca n't ? "
97331	97340	97301	97301	his	511	" Our being together -- and not together . "
97341	97352	97353	97353	she	3247	" No . You ought not to have come today , "
97441	97623	97435	97435	Archer	215	" Do n't be afraid of me : you need n't squeeze yourself back into your corner like that . A stolen kiss is n't what I want . Look : I 'm not even trying to touch the sleeve of your jacket . Do n't suppose that I do n't understand your reasons for not wanting to let this feeling between us dwindle into an ordinary hole - and - corner love - affair . I could n't have spoken like this yesterday , because when we 've been apart , and I 'm looking forward to seeing you , every thought is burnt up in a great flame . But then you come ; and you 're so much more than I remembered , and what I want of you is so much more than an hour or two every now and then , with wastes of thirsty waiting between , that I can sit perfectly still beside you , like this , with that other vision in my mind , just quietly trusting to it to come true . "
97641	97654	97633	97633	she	3257	" What do you mean by trusting to it to come true ? "
97655	97667	97435	97435	Archer	215	" Why -- you know it will , do n't you ? "
97668	97677	97678	97678	She	3257	" Your vision of you and me together ? "
97686	97698	97678	97678	She	3257	" You choose your place well to put it to me ! "
97699	97731	97633	97633	she	3257	" Do you mean because we 're in my wife 's brougham ? Shall we get out and walk , then ? I do n't suppose you mind a little snow ? "
97739	97785	97732	97732	She	3257	" No ; I sha n't get out and walk , because my business is to get to Granny 's as quickly as I can . And you 'll sit beside me , and we 'll look , not at visions , but at realities . "
97786	97805	97633	97633	she	3257	" I do n't know what you mean by realities . The only reality to me is this . "
97837	97863	97864	97864	she	3257	" Is it your idea , then , that I should live with you as your mistress -- since I ca n't be your wife ? "
97950	98008	97937	97937	Her	3257	" I want -- I want somehow to get away with you into a world where words like that -- categories like that -- won't exist . Where we shall be simply two human beings who love each other , who are the whole of life to each other ; and nothing else on earth will matter . "
98020	98037	98038	98038	she	3257	" Oh , my dear -- where is that country ? Have you ever been there ? "
98051	98115	98047	98047	she	3257	" I know so many who 've tried to find it ; and , believe me , they all got out by mistake at wayside stations : at places like Boulogne , or Pisa , or Monte Carlo -- and it was n't at all different from the old world they 'd left , but only rather smaller and dingier and more promiscuous . "
98140	98150	98151	98151	he	3260	" Yes , the Gorgon HAS dried your tears , "
98154	98225	98132	98132	she	3257	" Well , she opened my eyes too ; it 's a delusion to say that she blinds people . What she does is just the contrary -- she fastens their eyelids open , so that they 're never again in the blessed darkness . Is n't there a Chinese torture like that ? There ought to be . Ah , believe me , it 's a miserable little country ! "
98266	98278	98279	98279	he	3260	" Then what , exactly , is your plan for us ? "
98282	98356	98247	98247	he	3260	" For US ? But there 's no US in that sense ! We 're near each other only if we stay far from each other . Then we can be ourselves . Otherwise we 're only Newland Archer , the husband of Ellen Olenska 's cousin , and Ellen Olenska , the cousin of Newland Archer 's wife , trying to be happy behind the backs of the people who trust them . "
98357	98365	98366	98366	he	3260	" Ah , I 'm beyond that , "
98369	98386	98387	98387	she	3264	" No , you 're not ! You 've never been beyond . And I have , "
98395	98405	98387	98387	she	3264	" and I know what it looks like there . "
98461	98473	98474	98475	Madame Olenska	241	" Why are we stopping ? This is not Granny 's , "
98478	98487	98488	98488	he	3260	" No : I shall get out here , "
98538	98551	98552	98552	he	3260	" You 're right : I ought not to have come today , "
98917	98925	98926	98926	she	226	" What became of you , dear ? "
98929	98965	98926	98926	she	226	" I was waiting at Granny 's , and Ellen came alone , and said she had dropped you on the way because you had to rush off on business . There 's nothing wrong ? "
98966	98982	98900	98900	her	226	" Only some letters I 'd forgotten , and wanted to get off before dinner . "
98983	98985	98986	98986	she	226	" Ah-- "
98994	99011	98986	98986	she	226	" I 'm sorry you did n't come to Granny's -- unless the letters were urgent . "
99012	99016	99017	99017	he	3260	" They were , "
99025	99050	99017	99017	he	3260	" Besides , I do n't see why I should have gone to your grandmother 's . I did n't know you were there . "
99162	99165	99156	99156	He	3260	" Yes ! "
99297	99301	99275	99275	she	226	" What news ? "
99302	99336	99275	99275	she	226	" It seems they 're going to stay in New York . I believe he 's going into an insurance business , or something . They 're looking about for a small house . "
99807	99813	99802	99802	she	226	" What 's the matter ? "
99814	99826	99802	99802	she	226	" The room is stifling : I want a little air . "
99977	99991	99974	99974	her	226	" Newland ! Do shut the window . You 'll catch your death . "
100001	100006	99992	99992	He	3260	" Catch my death ! "
100016	100036	99992	99992	He	3260	" But I 've caught it already . I AM dead -- I've been dead for months and months . "
100182	100189	100169	100169	her	3303	" Newland ! Are you ill ? "
100222	100226	100227	100227	he	3260	" Poor May ! "
100230	100236	100237	100237	she	3303	" Poor ? Why poor ? "
100244	100259	100260	100260	he	3260	" Because I shall never be able to open a window without worrying you , "
100286	100296	100274	100274	she	3303	" I shall never worry if you 're happy . "
100297	100316	100274	100274	she	3303	" Ah , my dear ; and I shall never be happy unless I can open the windows ! "
100317	100322	100323	100323	she	3303	" In THIS weather ? "
100546	100557	100537	100537	Archer	215	" All right . Shall we go together this afternoon ? "
100569	100590	100565	100565	she	553	" Oh , you 'd much better go alone . It bores Granny to see the same people too often . "
100986	101005	100959	100959	She	3094	" Do n't let in any one else . If my daughters call , say I 'm asleep . "
101019	101028	101029	101029	she	3973	" My dear , am I perfectly hideous ? "
101049	101078	101029	101029	she	3973	" My daughters tell me it does n't matter at my age -- as if hideousness did n't matter all the more the harder it gets to conceal ! "
101079	101089	101090	101090	Archer	215	" My dear , you 're handsomer than ever ! "
101106	101116	101117	101117	she	3973	" Ah , but not as handsome as Ellen ! "
101134	101150	101131	101131	she	3973	" Was she so awfully handsome the day you drove her up from the ferry ? "
101158	101193	101155	101155	she	3973	" Was it because you told her so that she had to put you out on the way ? In my youth young men did n't desert pretty women unless they were made to ! "
101207	101243	101194	101194	She	3973	" It 's a pity she did n't marry you ; I always told her so . It would have spared me all this worry . But who ever thought of sparing their grandmother worry ? "
101260	101325	101256	101256	she	3973	" Well , it 's settled , anyhow : she 's going to stay with me , whatever the rest of the family say ! She had n't been here five minutes before I 'd have gone down on my knees to keep her -- if only , for the last twenty years , I 'd been able to see where the floor was ! "
101336	101452	101332	101332	she	3973	" They 'd talked me over , as no doubt you know : persuaded me , Lovell , and Letterblair , and Augusta Welland , and all the rest of them , that I must hold out and cut off her allowance , till she was made to see that it was her duty to go back to Olenski . They thought they 'd convinced me when the secretary , or whatever he was , came out with the last proposals : handsome proposals I confess they were . After all , marriage is marriage , and money 's money -- both useful things in their way ... and I did n't know what to answer-- "
101470	101556	101453	101453	She	3327	" But the minute I laid eyes on her , I said : ' You sweet bird , you ! Shut you up in that cage again ? Never ! ' And now it 's settled that she 's to stay here and nurse her Granny as long as there 's a Granny to nurse . It 's not a gay prospect , but she does n't mind ; and of course I 've told Letterblair that she 's to be given her proper allowance . "
101714	101726	101727	101727	he	511	" She could n't have gone back -- it was impossible ! "
101730	101803	101804	101804	she	3331	" Ah , my dear , I always knew you were on her side ; and that 's why I sent for you today , and why I said to your pretty wife , when she proposed to come with you : ' No , my dear , I 'm pining to see Newland , and I do n't want anybody to share our transports . ' For you see , my dear-- "
101823	101890	101819	101819	him	3332	eyes--"you see , we shall have a fight yet . The family do n't want her here , and they 'll say it 's because I 've been ill , because I 'm a weak old woman , that she 's persuaded me . I 'm not well enough yet to fight them one by one , and you 've got to do it for me . "
101891	101894	101895	101895	he	3332	" I ? "
101898	101904	101905	101905	she	3331	" You . Why not ? "
101946	101950	101951	101951	she	3331	" Why not ? "
101971	101983	101951	101951	she	3331	" Oh , I do n't count -- I'm too insignificant . "
101984	102014	102015	102015	she	3331	" Well , you 're Letterblair 's partner , ai n't you ? You 've got to get at them through Letterblair . Unless you 've got a reason , "
102018	102048	102049	102049	he	3333	" Oh , my dear , I back you to hold your own against them all without my help ; but you shall have it if you need it , "
102053	102059	102060	102060	she	3331	" Then we 're safe ! "
102084	102111	102072	102072	she	3331	" I always knew you 'd back us up , because they never quote you when they talk about its being her duty to go home . "
102126	102135	102112	102112	He	3333	" And May -- do they quote her ? "
102146	102158	102159	102159	he	3333	" And Madame Olenska ? When am I to see her ? "
102179	102196	102162	102164	The old lady	3973	" Not today . One at a time , please . Madame Olenska 's gone out . "
102207	102225	102203	102203	she	3973	" She 's gone out , my child : gone in my carriage to see Regina Beaufort . "
102236	102469	102226	102226	She	3973	" That 's what she 's reduced me to already . The day after she got here she put on her best bonnet , and told me , as cool as a cucumber , that she was going to call on Regina Beaufort . ' I do n't know her ; who is she ? ' says I. ' She 's your grand - niece , and a most unhappy woman , ' she says . ' She 's the wife of a scoundrel , ' I answered . ' Well , ' she says , ' and so am I , and yet all my family want me to go back to him . ' Well , that floored me , and I let her go ; and finally one day she said it was raining too hard to go out on foot , and she wanted me to lend her my carriage . ' What for ? ' I asked her ; and she said : ' To go and see cousin Regina'--COUSIN ! Now , my dear , I looked out of the window , and saw it was n't raining a drop ; but I understood her , and I let her have the carriage .... After all , Regina 's a brave woman , and so is she ; and I 've always liked courage above everything . "

104737	104740	104741	104741	she	241	" Yes , "
104878	104883	104884	104884	she	241	" It seems cruel , "

105072	105082	105083	105083	she	241	" What is it you wanted to tell me ? "
105095	105103	105104	105104	he	3413	" What I wanted to tell you ? "
105107	105123	105104	105104	he	3413	" Why , that I believe you came to New York because you were afraid . "
105124	105127	105088	105088	she	241	" Afraid ? "

105213	105216	105088	105088	she	241	" Better-- ? "
105217	105236	105088	105088	she	241	" We shall hurt others less . Is n't it , after all , what you always wanted ? "
105237	105285	105088	105088	she	241	" To have you here , you mean -- in reach and yet out of reach ? To meet you in this way , on the sly ? It 's the very reverse of what I want . I told you the other day what I wanted . "
105289	105298	105286	105286	She	241	" And you still think this -- worse ? "
105299	105304	105305	105305	He	3413	" A thousand times ! "
105308	105327	105305	105305	He	3413	" It would be easy to lie to you ; but the truth is I think it detestable . "

105350	105376	105345	105345	He	3413	" Well , then -- it 's my turn to ask : what is it , in God 's name , that you think better ? "
105447	105454	105458	105458	she	241	" What do you think better ? "
105461	105481	105458	105458	she	241	" I promised Granny to stay with her because it seemed to me that here I should be safer . "
105482	105486	105458	105458	she	241	" From me ? "
105498	105504	105458	105458	she	241	" Safer from loving me ? "
105529	105546	105547	105547	she	241	" Safer from doing irreparable harm . Do n't let us be like all the others ! "
105550	105577	105596	105596	her	241	" What others ? I do n't profess to be different from my kind . I 'm consumed by the same wants and the same longings . "
105599	105613	105614	105614	she	241	" Shall I -- once come to you ; and then go home ? "
105633	105636	105637	105637	he	511	" Dearest ! "
105678	105690	105667	105667	her	241	" Go home ? What do you mean by going home ? "
105691	105697	105667	105667	her	241	" Home to my husband . "
105698	105709	105667	105667	her	241	" And you expect me to say yes to that ? "
105718	105741	105710	105710	She	241	" What else is there ? I ca n't stay here and lie to the people who 've been good to me . "
105742	105757	105667	105667	her	241	" But that 's the very reason why I ask you to come away ! "
105758	105773	105710	105710	She	241	" And destroy their lives , when they 've helped me to remake mine ? "
105797	105805	105806	105806	He	511	" Yes , come ; come once . "
105868	105877	105878	105878	he	511	" If I were to let her come , "
105883	105893	105878	105878	he	511	" I should have to let her go again . "
105918	105922	105923	105923	he	511	" After all , "
105927	105996	105923	105923	he	511	" we have lives of our own .... There 's no use attempting the impossible . You 're so unprejudiced about some things , so used , as you say , to looking at the Gorgon , that I do n't know why you 're afraid to face our case , and see it as it really is -- unless you think the sacrifice is not worth making . "
106010	106021	106022	106022	she	241	" Call it that , then -- I must go , "
106047	106057	106058	106058	he	511	" Well , then : come to me once , "
106087	106090	106091	106091	he	511	" When ? "
106094	106097	106091	106091	he	511	" Tomorrow ? "
106101	106106	106098	106098	She	241	" The day after . "
106107	106110	106111	106111	he	511	" Dearest-- ! "
106172	106194	106195	106195	she	241	" Oh , I shall be late -- good - bye . No , do n't come any farther than this , "
106296	106302	106274	106277	The parlour - maid	3433	" Is Mrs. Archer in ? "
106303	106324	106274	106277	The parlour - maid	3433	" No , sir ; Mrs. Archer went out in the carriage after luncheon , and has n't come back . "
106422	106439	106440	106440	he	511	" This was what had to be , then ... this was what had to be , "
106483	106497	106498	106498	she	3438	" I 'm dreadfully late -- you were n't worried , were you ? "
106519	106524	106514	106514	He	511	" Is it late ? "
106525	106536	106537	106537	She	3438	" After seven . I believe you 've been asleep ! "
106567	106610	106611	106611	She	3438	" I went to see Granny , and just as I was going away Ellen came in from a walk ; so I stayed and had a long talk with her . It was ages since we 'd had a real talk .... "
106640	106646	106647	106647	she	3438	" A really good talk , "
106661	106689	106647	106647	she	3438	" She was so dear -- just like the old Ellen . I 'm afraid I have n't been fair to her lately . I 've sometimes thought-- "
106707	106714	106715	106715	he	511	" Yes , you 've thought-- ? "
106721	106793	106690	106690	Archer	215	" Well , perhaps I have n't judged her fairly . She 's so different -- at least on the surface . She takes up such odd people -- she seems to like to make herself conspicuous . I suppose it 's the life she 's led in that fast European society ; no doubt we seem dreadfully dull to her . But I do n't want to judge her unfairly . "
106875	106880	106881	106881	he	511	" She hates Ellen , "
106884	106905	106881	106881	he	511	" and she 's trying to overcome the feeling , and to get me to help her to overcome it . "
106934	106942	106943	106943	she	3438	" You understand , do n't you , "
106947	107005	106943	106943	she	3438	" why the family have sometimes been annoyed ? We all did what we could for her at first ; but she never seemed to understand . And now this idea of going to see Mrs. Beaufort , of going there in Granny 's carriage ! I 'm afraid she 's quite alienated the van der Luydens ... "
107006	107009	107011	107011	Archer	215	" Ah , "
107026	107042	107043	107043	he	3441	" It 's time to dress ; we 're dining out , are n't we ? "
107118	107126	107127	107127	she	3438	" You have n't kissed me today , "
107144	107152	107154	107156	Mr. Sillerton Jackson	225	" At the court of the Tuileries , "
107162	107170	107154	107156	Mr. Sillerton Jackson	225	" such things were pretty openly tolerated . "
107278	107283	107286	107286	themselves	3446	" owed it to society "
107299	107394	107286	107286	themselves	3446	" It will never do , my dear Louisa , to let people like Mrs. Lemuel Struthers think they can step into Regina 's shoes . It is just at such times that new people push in and get a footing . It was owing to the epidemic of chicken - pox in New York the winter Mrs. Struthers first appeared that the married men slipped away to her house while their wives were in the nursery . You and dear Henry , Louisa , must stand in the breach as you always have . "
107698	107729	107734	107734	she	296	" Is it possible , dear , that what I hear is true ? I was told your grandmother Mingott 's carriage was seen standing at Mrs. Beaufort 's door . "
107758	107775	107752	107753	Mrs. Archer	215	" If it was , I 'm convinced it was there without Mrs. Mingott 's knowledge . "
107776	107782	107783	107786	Mrs. van der Luyden	296	" Ah , you think-- ? "
107797	107802	107803	107806	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" I 'm afraid , "
107809	107829	107803	107806	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" that Madame Olenska 's kind heart may have led her into the imprudence of calling on Mrs. Beaufort . "
107830	107838	107841	107842	Mrs. Archer	215	" Or her taste for peculiar people , "
107858	107869	107871	107874	Mrs. van der Luyden	296	" I 'm sorry to think it of Madame Olenska , "
107881	107897	107877	107878	Mrs. Archer	215	" Ah , my dear -- and after you 'd had her twice at Skuytercliff ! "
107915	107920	107921	107921	he	225	" At the Tuileries , "
107935	107969	107921	107921	he	225	" the standard was excessively lax in some respects ; and if you 'd asked where Morny 's money came from-- ! Or who paid the debts of some of the Court beauties ... "
107970	107977	107979	107980	Mrs. Archer	215	" I hope , dear Sillerton , "
107982	107994	107979	107980	Mrs. Archer	215	" you are not suggesting that we should adopt such standards ? "
107995	108000	108002	108003	Mr. Jackson	225	" I never suggest , "
108006	108020	108002	108003	Mr. Jackson	225	" But Madame Olenska 's foreign bringing - up may make her less particular-- "
108021	108024	108025	108028	the two elder ladies	3471	" Ah , "
108031	108047	108048	108051	Mr. van der Luyden	302	" Still , to have kept her grandmother 's carriage at a defaulter 's door ! "
108082	108097	108098	108099	Mrs. Archer	215	" Of course I 've always said that she looks at things quite differently , "
108124	108133	108111	108111	She	215	" I 'm sure Ellen meant it kindly . "
108134	108141	108143	108144	Mrs. Archer	215	" Imprudent people are often kind , "
108162	108170	108156	108159	Mrs. van der Luyden	296	" If only she had consulted some one-- "
108171	108179	108180	108181	Mrs. Archer	215	" Ah , that she never did ! "
108361	108367	108353	108354	Madame Nilsson	213	" M'ama , non m'ama ... "

108922	108925	108928	108930	the triumphant Marguerite	427	" M'ama ! "
108986	109008	109009	109009	he	427	" I 've got a beastly headache ; do n't tell any one , but come home , wo n't you ? "
109094	109118	109086	109086	May	3510	" I 'm so sorry you do n't feel well . I 'm afraid they 've been overworking you again at the office . "
109119	109136	109137	109137	he	427	" No -- it 's not that : do you mind if I open the window ? "
109198	109204	109205	109205	he	427	" Did you hurt yourself ? "
109214	109229	109230	109230	she	553	" No ; but my poor dress -- see how I 've torn it ! "
109347	109352	109353	109353	she	553	" Oh , no , "
109367	109379	109380	109380	she	553	" But had n't you better go to bed at once ? "
109413	109425	109426	109426	He	427	" No ; my head is not as bad as that . "
109429	109450	109426	109426	He	427	" And there 's something I want to say ; something important -- that I must tell you at once . "
109466	109471	109472	109472	she	553	" Yes , dear ? "
109492	109494	109495	109495	he	427	" May-- "
109539	109553	109536	109536	he	427	" There is something I 've got to tell you ... about myself ... "
109623	109626	109627	109627	he	427	" Madame Olenska-- "
109661	109672	109673	109673	she	553	" Oh , why should we talk about Ellen tonight ? "
109683	109692	109637	109637	her	553	" Because I ought to have spoken before . "
109698	109756	109693	109693	Her	553	" Is it really worth while , dear ? I know I 've been unfair to her at times -- perhaps we all have . You 've understood her , no doubt , better than we did : you 've always been kind to her . But what does it matter , now it 's all over ? "
109785	109794	109795	109795	he	427	" All over -- what do you mean ? "
109811	109840	109802	109802	May	3524	" Why -- since she 's going back to Europe so soon ; since Granny approves and understands , and has arranged to make her independent of her husband-- "
109879	109883	109884	109884	he	427	" I supposed , "
109894	109919	109884	109884	he	427	" that you had been kept at the office this evening about the business arrangements . It was settled this morning , I believe . "
110039	110044	110045	110045	he	427	" It 's impossible , "
110048	110051	110031	110031	Archer	427	" Impossible-- ? "
110052	110065	110117	110117	his	427	" How do you know -- what you 've just told me ? "
110066	110083	110031	110031	Archer	427	" I saw Ellen yesterday -- I told you I 'd seen her at Granny 's . "
110084	110094	110117	110117	his	427	" It was n't then that she told you ? "
110095	110112	110031	110031	Archer	427	" No ; I had a note from her this afternoon.--Do you want to see it ? "
110134	110140	110141	110141	she	3524	" I thought you knew , "
110174	110277	110141	110141	she	3524	" May dear , I have at last made Granny understand that my visit to her could be no more than a visit ; and she has been as kind and generous as ever . She sees now that if I return to Europe I must live by myself , or rather with poor Aunt Medora , who is coming with me . I am hurrying back to Washington to pack up , and we sail next week . You must be very good to Granny when I 'm gone -- as good as you 've always been to me . Ellen . "
110278	110302	110326	110326	his	427	" If any of my friends wish to urge me to change my mind , please tell them it would be utterly useless . "

110404	110460	110461	110461	She	3530	" I told her I was afraid I had n't been fair to her -- hadn't always understood how hard it must have been for her here , alone among so many people who were relations and yet strangers ; who felt the right to criticise , and yet did n't always know the circumstances .

111812	111829	111804	111804	Archer	427	" Do you refer to her husband 's proposal to give her back her own money ? "
111843	111877	111830	111831	Mr. Letterblair	353	" My dear sir , the law 's the law ; and your wife 's cousin was married under the French law . It 's to be presumed she knew what that meant . "

112075	112080	112081	112081	Archer	427	" Oh , eminently , "
112123	112131	112132	112132	she	3973	" You know she 's deserted me ? "
112144	112324	112132	112132	she	3973	" Oh , do n't ask me why ! She gave so many reasons that I 've forgotten them all . My private belief is that she could n't face the boredom . At any rate that 's what Augusta and my daughters - in - law think . And I do n't know that I altogether blame her . Olenski 's a finished scoundrel ; but life with him must have been a good deal gayer than it is in Fifth Avenue . Not that the family would admit that : they think Fifth Avenue is Heaven with the rue de la Paix thrown in . And poor Ellen , of course , has no idea of going back to her husband . She held out as firmly as ever against that . So she 's to settle down in Paris with that fool Medora .... Well , Paris is Paris ; and you can keep a carriage there on next to nothing . But she was as gay as a bird , and I shall miss her . "
112349	112355	112356	112356	she	3572	" All I ask is , "
112359	112379	112356	112356	she	3572	" that they should n't bother me any more . I must really be allowed to digest my gruel .... "

120776	120788	120714	120714	he	485	" Lovely ? I do n't know . She was different . "
120789	120833	120739	120739	Archer	215	" Ah -- there you have it ! That 's what it always comes to , does n't it ? When she comes , SHE 'S DIFFERENT -- and one does n't know why . It 's exactly what I feel about Fanny . "
120845	120865	120842	120842	his	2392	" About Fanny ? But , my dear fellow -- I should hope so ! Only I do n't see-- "
120866	120886	120893	120895	the new generation	3864	" Dash it , Dad , do n't be prehistoric ! Was n't she -- once -- your Fanny ? "
120925	120944	120945	120945	he	485	" What 's the use of making mysteries ? It only makes people want to nose 'em out , "
120968	120972	120945	120945	he	485	" My Fanny ? "
120973	120990	120992	120994	his surprising son	3867	" Well , the woman you 'd have chucked everything for : only you did n't , "
120996	121001	121003	121003	Archer	427	" I did n't , "
121010	121026	120945	120945	he	485	" No : you date , you see , dear old boy . But mother said-- "
121027	121031	120945	120945	he	485	" Your mother ? "
121032	121087	120945	120945	he	485	" Yes : the day before she died . It was when she sent for me alone -- you remember ? She said she knew we were safe with you , and always would be , because once , when she asked you to , you 'd given up the thing you most wanted . "
121119	121125	121112	121112	he	427	" She never asked me . "
121126	121209	121210	121210	Dallas	485	" No . I forgot . You never did ask each other anything , did you ? And you never told each other anything . You just sat and watched each other , and guessed at what was going on underneath . A deaf - and - dumb asylum , in fact ! Well , I back your generation for knowing more about each other 's private thoughts than we ever have time to find out about our own.--I say , Dad , "
121214	121249	121210	121210	Dallas	485	" you 're not angry with me ? If you are , let 's make it up and go and lunch at Henri 's . I 've got to rush out to Versailles afterward . "
121590	121598	121585	121585	he	427	" But I 'm only fifty - seven-- "
121797	121814	121815	121815	he	427	" That 's it : they feel equal to things -- they know their way about , "
121862	121868	121869	121869	he	1711	" Oh , by Jove , "
122109	122124	122099	122107	the young Frenchman who had once said to him	3908	" Ah , good conversation -- there is nothing like it , is there ? "
122374	122380	122381	122381	he	485	" It must be here , "
122477	122483	122484	122484	Dallas	485	" I wonder which floor-- ? "
122510	122523	122494	122494	he	485	" The fifth . It must be the one with the awnings . "
122544	122556	122557	122558	his son	3837	" I say , you know , it 's nearly six , "
122576	122586	122587	122587	he	3932	" I believe I 'll sit there a moment , "
122590	122597	122598	122599	his son	3837	" Why -- aren't you well ? "
122602	122621	122564	122565	The father	3932	" Oh , perfectly . But I should like you , please , to go up without me . "
122630	122649	122622	122622	Dallas	485	" But , I say , Dad : do you mean you wo n't come up at all ? "
122650	122656	122658	122658	Archer	427	" I do n't know , "
122661	122671	122622	122622	Dallas	485	" If you do n't she wo n't understand . "
122672	122684	122622	122622	Dallas	485	" Go , my boy ; perhaps I shall follow you . "
122695	122704	122622	122622	Dallas	485	" But what on earth shall I say ? "
122705	122719	122720	122721	his father	2392	" My dear fellow , do n't you always know what to say ? "
122727	122754	122622	122622	Dallas	485	" Very well . I shall say you 're old - fashioned , and prefer walking up the five flights because you do n't like lifts . "
122760	122772	122755	122756	His father	2392	" Say I 'm old - fashioned : that 's enough . "
122881	122886	122914	122914	them	3945	" took after him . "
122969	122983	122984	122984	he	2392	" It 's more real to me here than if I went up , "
