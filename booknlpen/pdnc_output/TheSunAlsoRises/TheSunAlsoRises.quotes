14484	14492	14493	14493	Cohn	197	" You 're awfully funny , Harvey , "
14496	14506	14493	14493	Cohn	197	" Some day somebody will push your face in . "
14511	14538	14507	14508	Harvey Stone	231	" You think so . They wo n't , though . Because it would n't make any difference to me . I 'm not a fighter . "
14539	14552	14507	14508	Harvey Stone	231	" It would make a difference to you if anybody did it . "
14553	14575	14507	14508	Harvey Stone	231	" No , it would n't . That 's where you make your big mistake . Because you 're not intelligent . "
14576	14583	14507	14508	Harvey Stone	231	" Cut it out about me . "
14584	14587	14589	14589	Harvey	231	" Sure , "
14591	14609	14589	14589	Harvey	231	" It does n't make any difference to me . You do n't mean anything to me . "
14610	14616	14617	14617	I	0	" Come on , Harvey , "
14620	14625	14617	14617	I	0	" Have another porto . "
14626	14629	14630	14630	he	231	" No , "
14633	14649	14630	14630	he	231	" I 'm going up the street and eat . See you later , Jake . "
14680	14687	14688	14688	Cohn	197	" He always gets me sore , "
14691	14698	14688	14688	Cohn	197	" I ca n't stand him . "
14699	14704	14705	14705	I	0	" I like him , "
14708	14725	14705	14705	I	0	" I 'm fond of him . You do n't want to get sore at him . "
14726	14731	14732	14732	Cohn	197	" I know it , "
14735	14743	14732	14732	Cohn	197	" He just gets on my nerves . "
14744	14749	14688	14688	Cohn	197	" Write this afternoon ? "
14750	14779	14732	14732	Cohn	197	" No . I could n't get it going . It 's harder to do than my first book . I 'm having a hard time handling it . "
15097	15105	15106	15106	I	0	" Come on up to the Lilas , "
15109	15115	15151	15162	a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement	779	" I have a date . "
15116	15120	15151	15162	a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement	779	" What time ? "
15121	15131	15151	15162	a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement	779	" Frances is coming here at seven - fifteen . "
15132	15137	15151	15162	a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement	779	" There she is . "
15176	15179	15180	15180	she	200	" Hello , "
15183	15203	15180	15180	she	200	" I 'm so glad you 're here , Jake . I 've been wanting to talk to you . "
15204	15209	15211	15211	Cohn	197	" Hello , Frances , "
15216	15227	15228	15228	She	200	" Why , hello , Robert . Are you here ? "
15235	15244	15245	15245	her	200	" I 've had the darndest time . This one"--shaking
15248	15254	15180	15180	she	200	Cohn--"didn't come home for lunch . "
15255	15262	15180	15180	she	200	" I was n't supposed to . "
15263	15325	15180	15180	she	200	" Oh , I know . But you did n't say anything about it to the cook . Then I had a date myself , and Paula was n't at her office . I went to the Ritz and waited for her , and she never came , and of course I did n't have enough money to lunch at the Ritz---- "
15326	15332	15180	15180	she	200	" What did you do ? "
15333	15342	15180	15180	she	200	" Oh , went out , of course . "
15353	15381	15343	15343	She	200	" I always keep my appointments . No one keeps theirs , nowadays . I ought to know better . How are you , Jake , anyway ? "
15382	15385	15180	15180	she	200	" Fine . "
15386	15407	15343	15343	She	200	" That was a fine girl you had at the dance , and then went off with that Brett one . "
15408	15415	15416	15416	Cohn	197	" Do n't you like her ? "
15419	15431	15487	15488	A boy	432	" I think she 's perfectly charming . Do n't you ? "
15436	15474	15343	15343	She	200	" Look , Jake . I want to talk with you . Would you come over with me to the Dome ? You 'll stay here , wo n't you , Robert ? Come on , Jake . "
15506	15514	15487	15488	A boy	432	" What 's the matter , Frances ? "
15515	15520	15521	15521	she	784	" Oh , nothing , "
15524	15533	15521	15521	she	784	" except that he wants to leave me . "
15534	15540	15487	15488	A boy	432	" How do you mean ? "
15541	15575	15521	15521	she	784	" Oh , he told every one that we were going to be married , and I told my mother and every one , and now he does n't want to do it . "
15576	15582	15487	15488	A boy	432	" What 's the matter ? "
15583	15605	15521	15521	she	784	" He 's decided he has n't lived enough . I knew it would happen when he went to New York . "
15620	15676	15487	15488	A boy	432	" I would n't marry him if he does n't want to . Of course I would n't . I would n't marry him now for anything . But it does seem to me to be a little late now , after we 've waited three years , and I 've just gotten my divorce . "
15681	15727	15677	15677	I	0	" We were going to celebrate so , and instead we 've just had scenes . It 's so childish . We have dreadful scenes , and he cries and begs me to be reasonable , but he says he just ca n't do it . "
15728	15734	15677	15677	I	0	" It 's rotten luck . "
15735	15815	15677	15677	I	0	" I should say it is rotten luck . I 've wasted two years and a half on him now . And I do n't know now if any man will ever want to marry me . Two years ago I could have married anybody I wanted , down at Cannes . All the old ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazy about me . Now I do n't think I could get anybody . "
15816	15824	15677	15677	I	0	" Sure , you could marry anybody . "
15825	15859	15677	15677	I	0	" No , I do n't believe it . And I 'm fond of him , too . And I 'd like to have children . I always thought we 'd have children . "
15867	15899	15860	15860	She	785	" I never liked children much , but I do n't want to think I 'll never have them . I always thought I 'd have them and then like them . "
15900	15906	15985	15985	me	0	" He 's got children . "
15907	15981	15860	15860	She	785	" Oh , yes . He 's got children , and he 's got money , and he 's got a rich mother , and he 's written a book , and nobody will publish my stuff ; nobody at all . It is n't bad , either . And I have n't got any money at all . I could have had alimony , but I got the divorce the quickest way . "
15990	16063	15985	15985	me	0	" It is n't right . It 's my own fault and it 's not , too . I ought to have known better . And when I tell him he just cries and says he ca n't marry . Why ca n't he marry ? I 'd be a good wife . I 'm easy to get along with . I leave him alone . It does n't do any good . "
16064	16071	15985	15985	me	0	" It 's a rotten shame . "
16072	16104	15985	15985	me	0	" Yes , it is a rotten shame . But there 's no use talking about it , is there ? Come on , let 's go back to the caf . "
16105	16117	15985	15985	me	0	" And of course there is n't anything I can do . "
16118	16138	15985	15985	me	0	" No . Just do n't let him know I talked to you . I know what he wants . "
16153	16188	16144	16144	she	787	" He wants to go back to New York alone , and be there when his book comes out so when a lot of little chickens like it . That 's what he wants . "
16189	16208	15985	15985	me	0	" Maybe they wo n't like it . I do n't think he 's that way . Really . "
16209	16260	16144	16144	she	787	" You do n't know him like I do , Jake . That 's what he wants to do . I know it . I know it . That 's why he does n't want to marry . He wants to have a big triumph this fall all by himself . "
16261	16270	15985	15985	me	0	" Want to go back to the caf ? "
16271	16277	16144	16144	she	787	" Yes . Come on . "
16316	16325	16326	16326	Frances	200	" Well , what are you smiling at ? "
16330	16335	16326	16326	Frances	200	" Feel pretty happy ? "
16336	16348	16144	16144	she	787	" I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets . "
16349	16379	16326	16326	Frances	200	" Oh , what I 've told Jake is n't any secret . Everybody will know it soon enough . I only wanted to give Jake a decent version . "
16380	16391	16144	16144	she	787	" What was it ? About your going to England ? "
16392	16417	16326	16326	Frances	200	" Yes , about my going to England . Oh , Jake ! I forgot to tell you . I 'm going to England . "
16418	16424	16144	16144	she	787	" Is n't that fine ! "
16425	16480	16326	16326	Frances	200	" Yes , that 's the way it 's done in the very best families . Robert 's sending me . He 's going to give me two hundred pounds and then I 'm going to visit friends . Wo n't it be lovely ? The friends do n't know about it , yet . "
16496	16535	16326	16326	Frances	200	" You were only going to give me a hundred pounds , were n't you , Robert ? But I made him give me two hundred . He 's really very generous . Are n't you , Robert ? "
16633	16643	16644	16644	Cohn	197	" How can you say such things , Frances ? "
16647	16804	16823	16824	an audience	797	" Listen to him . I 'm going to England . I 'm going to visit friends . Ever visit friends that did n't want you ? Oh , they 'll have to take me , all right . ' How do you do , my dear ? Such a long time since we 've seen you . And how is your dear mother ? ' Yes , how is my dear mother ? She put all her money into French war bonds . Yes , she did . Probably the only person in the world that did . ' And what about Robert ? ' or else very careful talking around Robert . ' You must be most careful not to mention him , my dear . Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience . ' Wo n't it be fun , Robert ? Do n't you think it will be fun , Jake ? "
16828	16893	16805	16805	She	796	" And where are you going to be , Robert ? It 's my own fault , all right . Perfectly my own fault . When I made you get rid of your little secretary on the magazine I ought to have known you 'd get rid of me the same way . Jake does n't know about that . Should I tell him ? "
16894	16905	16823	16824	an audience	797	" Shut up , Frances , for God 's sake . "
16906	17011	16805	16805	She	796	" Yes , I 'll tell him . Robert had a little secretary on the magazine . Just the sweetest little thing in the world , and he thought she was wonderful , and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful , too . So I made him get rid of her , and he had brought her to Provincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine , and he did n't even pay her fare back to the coast . All to please me . He thought I was pretty fine , then . Did n't you , Robert ? "
17012	17091	16823	16824	an audience	797	" You must n't misunderstand , Jake , it was absolutely platonic with the secretary . Not even platonic . Nothing at all , really . It was just that she was so nice . And he did that just to please me . Well , I suppose that we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword . Is n't that literary , though ? You want to remember that for your next book , Robert .
17092	17180	16805	16805	She	796	" You know Robert is going to get material for a new book . Are n't you , Robert ? That 's why he 's leaving me . He 's decided I do n't film well . You see , he was so busy all the time that we were living together , writing on this book , that he does n't remember anything about us . So now he 's going out and get some new material . Well , I hope he gets something frightfully interesting .
17181	17453	17454	17454	She	798	" Listen , Robert , dear . Let me tell you something . You wo n't mind , will you ? Do n't have scenes with your young ladies . Try not to . Because you ca n't have scenes without crying , and then you pity yourself so much you ca n't remember what the other person 's said . You 'll never be able to remember any conversations that way . Just try and be calm . I know it 's awfully hard . But remember , it 's for literature . We all ought to make sacrifices for literature . Look at me . I 'm going to England without a protest . All for literature . We must all help young writers . Do n't you think so , Jake ? But you 're not a young writer . Are you , Robert ? You 're thirty - four . Still , I suppose that is young for a great writer . Look at Hardy . Look at Anatole France . He just died a little while ago . Robert does n't think he 's any good , though . Some of his French friends told him . He does n't read French very well himself . He was n't a good writer like you are , was he , Robert ? Do you think he ever had to go and look for material ? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he would n't marry them ? I wonder if he cried , too ? Oh , I 've just thought of something . "
17464	17650	17454	17454	She	798	" I know the real reason why Robert wo n't marry me , Jake . It 's just come to me . They 've sent it to me in a vision in the Caf Select . Is n't it mystic ? Some day they 'll put a tablet up . Like at Lourdes . Do you want to hear , Robert ? I 'll tell you . It 's so simple . I wonder why I never thought about it . Why , you see , Robert 's always wanted to have a mistress , and if he does n't marry me , why , then he 's had one . She was his mistress for over two years . See how it is ? And if he marries me , like he 's always promised he would , that would be the end of all the romance . Do n't you think that 's bright of me to figure that out ? It 's true , too . Look at him and see if it 's not . Where are you going , Jake ? "
17651	17665	17681	17681	he	197	" I 've got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute . "
17730	17738	17711	17711	Frances	237	" Is n't it so , Robert ? "
17867	17883	17838	17839	the concierge	625	" Here is the post . And there was a lady here to see you . "
17884	17891	17838	17839	the concierge	625	" Did she leave a card ? "
17892	17921	17838	17839	the concierge	625	" No . She was with a gentleman . It was the one who was here last night . In the end I find she is very nice . "
17922	17931	17838	17839	the concierge	625	" Was she with a friend of mine ? "
17932	17973	17974	17974	She	625	" I do n't know . He was never here before . He was very large . Very , very large . She was very nice . Very , very nice . Last night she was , perhaps , a little-- "
17988	18048	17974	17974	She	625	" I 'll speak perfectly frankly , Monsieur Barnes . Last night I found her not so gentille . Last night I formed another idea of her . But listen to what I tell you . She is tr s , tr s gentille . She is of very good family . It is a thing you can see . "
18049	18057	18115	18116	a concierge	809	" They did not leave any word ? "
18058	18071	17974	17974	She	625	" Yes . They said they would be back in an hour . "
18072	18080	18115	18116	a concierge	809	" Send them up when they come . "
18081	18108	17974	17974	She	625	" Yes , Monsieur Barnes . And that lady , that lady there is some one . An eccentric , perhaps , but quelqu'une , quelqu'une ! "
18383	18388	18390	18390	Brett	212	" Hello , darling , "
18392	18402	18390	18390	Brett	212	" Are n't you going to let us in ? "
18403	18412	18371	18372	the count	612	" Come on . I was just bathing . "
18413	18423	18390	18390	Brett	212	" Are n't you the fortunate man . Bathing . "
18424	18440	18371	18372	the count	612	" Only a shower . Sit down , Count Mippipopolous . What will you drink ? "
18441	18453	18454	18455	the count	612	" I do n't know whether you like flowers , sir , "
18458	18470	18454	18455	the count	612	" but I took the liberty of just bringing these roses . "
18471	18479	18480	18480	Brett	212	" Here , give them to me . "
18484	18494	18480	18480	Brett	212	" Get me some water in this , Jake . "
18528	18538	18371	18372	the count	612	" I say . We have had a day . "
18539	18554	18454	18455	the count	612	" You do n't remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon ? "
18555	18569	18371	18372	the count	612	" No . Did we have one ? I must have been blind . "
18570	18579	18581	18582	the count	612	" You were quite drunk , my dear , "
18584	18601	18648	18649	the count	612	" Was n't I , though ? And the count 's been a brick , absolutely . "
18602	18615	18648	18649	the count	612	" You 've got hell 's own drag with the concierge now . "
18616	18628	18648	18649	the count	612	" I ought to have . Gave her two hundred francs . "
18629	18637	18648	18649	the count	612	" Do n't be a damned fool . "
18638	18641	18642	18642	she	834	" His , "
18651	18671	18648	18649	the count	612	" I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night . It was very late . "
18672	18677	18678	18678	Brett	212	" He 's wonderful , "
18681	18689	18678	18678	Brett	212	" He remembers everything that 's happened . "
18690	18698	18648	18649	the count	612	" So do you , my dear . "
18699	18702	18704	18704	Brett	212	" Fancy , "
18706	18725	18704	18704	Brett	212	" Who 'd want to ? I say , Jake , _ do _ we get a drink ? "
18726	18743	18648	18649	the count	612	" You get it while I go in and dress . You know where it is . "
18744	18747	18704	18704	Brett	212	" Rather . "
18802	18815	18793	18793	her	212	" What 's the matter , darling ? Do you feel rocky ? "
18824	18835	18793	18793	her	212	" Oh , Brett , I love you so much . "
18836	18839	18840	18840	she	212	" Darling , "
18845	18855	18840	18840	she	212	" Do you want me to send him away ? "
18856	18863	18793	18793	her	212	" No . He 's nice . "
18864	18871	18840	18840	she	212	" I 'll send him away . "
18872	18878	18793	18793	her	212	" No , do n't . "
18879	18888	18840	18840	she	212	" Yes , I 'll send him away . "
18889	18897	18793	18793	her	212	" You ca n't just like that . "
18898	18919	18840	18840	she	212	" Ca n't I , though ? You stay here . He 's mad about me , I tell you . "
18962	18967	18968	18968	She	212	" Poor old darling . "
18973	18981	18982	18982	I	0	" What did you say to him ? "
19000	19013	18968	18968	She	212	" Sent him for champagne . He loves to go for champagne . "
19017	19031	18968	18968	She	212	" Do you feel better , darling ? Is the head any better ? "
19032	19037	18998	18998	her	212	" It 's better . "

19101	19122	18968	18968	She	212	" That would be different . It 's my fault , Jake . It 's the way I 'm made . "
19123	19136	18998	18998	her	212	" Could n't we go off in the country for a while ? "
19137	19169	18968	18968	She	212	" It would n't be any good . I 'll go if you like . But I could n't live quietly in the country . Not with my own true love . "
19170	19174	18998	18998	her	212	" I know . "
19175	19193	18968	18968	She	212	" Is n't it rotten ? There is n't any use my telling you I love you . "
19194	19201	18998	18998	her	212	" You know I love you . "
19202	19227	18968	18968	She	212	" Let 's not talk . Talking 's all bilge . I 'm going away from you , and then Michael 's coming back . "
19228	19235	18998	18998	her	212	" Why are you going away ? "
19236	19245	18968	18968	She	212	" Better for you . Better for me . "
19246	19252	18998	18998	her	212	" When are you going ? "
19253	19259	18968	18968	She	212	" Soon as I can . "

19277	19296	18968	18968	She	212	" No . That would be a hell of an idea after we 'd just talked it out . "
19297	19302	18998	18998	her	212	" We never agreed . "
19303	19321	18968	18968	She	212	" Oh , you know as well as I do . Do n't be obstinate , darling . "
19322	19327	18998	18998	her	212	" Oh , sure , "
19331	19354	19328	19328	I	0	" I know you 're right . I 'm just low , and when I 'm low I talk like a fool . "
19377	19386	19373	19373	I	0	" Do n't look like that , darling . "
19387	19396	18968	18968	She	212	" How do you want me to look ? "
19397	19414	19373	19373	I	0	" Oh , do n't be a fool . I 'm going away to - morrow . "
19415	19420	18968	18968	She	212	" To - morrow ? "
19421	19433	19373	19373	I	0	" Yes . Did n't I say so ? I am . "

19450	19474	19373	19373	I	0	" Yes . He should be back . You know he 's extraordinary about buying champagne . It means any amount to him . "
19531	19542	19544	19545	the count	612	" Where should I have him put it , sir ? "
19547	19552	19553	19553	Brett	212	" In the kitchen , "

19590	19602	19603	19603	he	612	" I think you 'll find that 's very good wine , "
19606	19641	19603	19603	he	612	" I know we do n't get much of a chance to judge good wine in the States now , but I got this from a friend of mine that 's in the business . "
19642	19654	19655	19655	Brett	212	" Oh , you always have some one in the trade , "
19658	19674	19603	19603	he	612	" This fellow raises the grapes . He 's got thousands of acres of them . "
19675	19681	19683	19683	Brett	212	" What 's his name ? "
19685	19689	19683	19683	Brett	212	" Veuve Cliquot ? "

19717	19732	19715	19715	Brett	212	" We all have titles . Why have n't you a title , Jake ? "
19733	19740	19741	19742	the count	612	" I assure you , sir , "
19750	19768	19744	19744	his	612	" It never does a man any good . Most of the time it costs you money . "
19769	19783	19784	19784	Brett	212	" Oh , I do n't know . It 's damned useful sometimes , "
19787	19799	19744	19744	his	612	" I 've never known it to do me any good . "
19800	19820	19744	19744	his	612	" You have n't used it properly . I 've had hell 's own amount of credit on mine . "
19821	19828	19829	19829	I	0	" Do sit down , count , "
19832	19839	19829	19829	I	0	" Let me take that stick . "
19874	19900	19868	19868	She	612	" I say , Jake , I do n't want to ruin your rugs . Ca n't you give a chap an ash - tray ? "
19924	19933	19934	19935	the count	612	" Put two bottles in it , Henry , "
19938	19944	19934	19935	the count	612	" Anything else , sir ? "
19945	19954	19955	19955	He	720	" No . Wait down in the car . "
19963	19976	19955	19955	He	720	" We 'll want to ride out to the Bois for dinner ? "
19977	19982	19983	19983	Brett	212	" If you like , "
19986	19994	19983	19983	Brett	212	" I could n't eat a thing . "

20113	20123	20111	20112	the count	612	" Half the cigars you smoke do n't draw . "
20140	20158	20124	20124	He	612	" And when you 're divorced , Lady Ashley , then you wo n't have a title . "
20159	20166	20089	20089	he	612	" No . What a pity . "
20167	20170	20172	20173	the count	612	" No , "

20284	20310	20281	20282	the count	612	" I 'm not joking you . I never joke people . Joke people and you make enemies . That 's what I always say . "
20311	20316	20317	20317	Brett	212	" You 're right , "
20320	20344	20317	20317	Brett	212	" You 're terribly right . I always joke people and I have n't a friend in the world . Except Jake here . "
20345	20352	20367	20368	the count	612	" You do n't joke him . "
20353	20358	20317	20317	Brett	212	" That 's it . "

20413	20420	20410	20411	the count	612	" You do n't joke him . "
20421	20431	20432	20432	Brett	212	" This is a hell of a dull talk , "
20435	20443	20432	20432	Brett	212	" How about some of that champagne ? "
20457	20480	20444	20445	The count	612	" It is n't cold , yet . You 're always drinking , my dear . Why do n't you just talk ? "
20481	20498	20394	20394	she	212	" I 've talked too ruddy much . I 've talked myself all out to Jake . "
20499	20525	20444	20445	The count	612	" I should like to hear you really talk , my dear . When you talk to me you never finish your sentences at all . "
20526	20543	20394	20394	she	212	" Leave 'em for you to finish . Let any one finish them as they like . "
20544	20552	20553	20554	the count	612	" It is a very interesting system , "
20564	20576	20553	20554	the count	612	" Still I would like to hear you talk some time . "
20577	20584	20585	20585	Brett	212	" Is n't he a fool ? "
20588	20591	20592	20593	the count	612	" Now , "
20599	20606	20592	20593	the count	612	" I think this is cool . "
20622	20645	20646	20646	He	612	" I like to drink champagne from magnums . The wine is better but it would have been too hard to cool . "
20661	20670	20671	20671	Brett	212	" I say . You might open it , "
20674	20686	20646	20646	He	612	" Yes , my dear . Now I 'll open it . "
20692	20699	20700	20700	Brett	212	" I say that is wine , "
20706	20720	20703	20703	her	863	" We ought to toast something . ' Here 's to royalty . ' "
20721	20754	20646	20646	He	612	" This wine is too good for toast - drinking , my dear . You do n't want to mix emotions up with a wine like that . You lose the taste . "
20761	20773	20774	20774	I	0	" You ought to write a book on wines , count , "
20777	20781	20783	20784	the count	612	" Mr. Barnes , "

20822	20841	20816	20817	The count	612	" There , my dear . Now you enjoy that slowly , and then you can get drunk . "
20842	20847	20783	20784	the count	612	" Drunk ? Drunk ? "
20848	20860	20816	20817	The count	612	" My dear , you are charming when you are drunk . "
20861	20867	20783	20784	the count	612	" Listen to the man . "

20949	20969	20947	20947	Brett	212	" We 've all been around . I dare say Jake here has seen as much as you have . "
20970	21003	20873	20874	the count	612	" My dear , I am sure Mr. Barnes has seen a lot . Do n't think I do n't think so , sir . I have seen a lot , too . "
21004	21013	21014	21014	Brett	212	" Of course you have , my dear , "
21017	21023	21014	21014	Brett	212	" I was only ragging . "

28371	28380	28080	28080	she	212	" Does he think you 're coming alone ? "
28381	28398	28080	28080	she	212	" No . I told him we were all coming down together . Michael and all . "
28399	28404	28080	28080	she	212	" He 's wonderful . "
28405	28410	28080	28080	she	212	" Is n't he ? "
28552	28558	28595	28599	the dining - car conductor	1048	" Nothing until the fifth . "
28559	28564	28595	28599	the dining - car conductor	1048	" What 's this ? "
28588	28594	28595	28599	the dining - car conductor	1048	" They 're all reserved , "
28602	28614	28595	28599	the dining - car conductor	1048	" There will be a fifth service at three - thirty . "
28615	28620	28621	28621	I	0	" This is serious , "
28626	28632	28595	28599	the dining - car conductor	1048	" Give him ten francs . "

28669	28697	28666	28666	he	1045	" I would advise you gentlemen to get some sandwiches . All the places for the first four services were reserved at the office of the company . "
28698	28708	28709	28709	Bill	240	" You 'll go a long way , brother , "
28716	28737	28709	28709	Bill	240	" I suppose if I 'd given you five francs you would have advised us to jump off the train . "
28738	28743	28666	28666	he	1045	" _ Comment ? _ "
28744	28749	28751	28751	Bill	240	" Go to hell ! "
28753	28770	28751	28751	Bill	240	" Get the sandwiches made and a bottle of wine . You tell him , Jake . "
28771	28781	28782	28782	I	0	" And send it up to the next car . "
28802	28813	28814	28815	the man	702	" I suppose you 're Americans , are n't you ? "
28818	28824	28814	28815	the man	702	" Having a good trip ? "
28825	28828	28830	28830	Bill	240	" Wonderful , "
28832	28864	28814	28815	the man	702	" That 's what you want to do . Travel while you 're young . Mother and I always wanted to get over , but we had to wait a while . "
28865	28881	28882	28883	the wife	1057	" You could have come over ten years ago , if you 'd wanted to , "
28886	28916	28882	28883	the wife	1057	" What you always said was : ' See America first ! ' I will say we 've seen a good deal , take it one way and another . "
28917	28929	28930	28931	the husband	1058	" Say , there 's plenty of Americans on this train , "
28934	28967	28930	28931	the husband	1058	" They 've got seven cars of them from Dayton , Ohio . They 've been on a pilgrimage to Rome , and now they 're going down to Biarritz and Lourdes . "
28968	28982	28983	28983	Bill	240	" So , that 's what they are . Pilgrims . Goddam Puritans , "
28986	28996	28882	28883	the wife	1057	" What part of the States you boys from ? "
28997	29001	29002	29002	I	0	" Kansas City , "
29005	29011	29002	29002	I	0	" He 's from Chicago . "

29020	29030	29002	29002	I	0	" No . We 're going fishing in Spain . "
29031	29084	28930	28931	the husband	1058	" Well , I never cared for it , myself . There 's plenty that do out where I come from , though . We got some of the best fishing in the State of Montana . I 've been out with the boys , but I never cared for it any . "
29085	29095	29096	29097	his wife	372	" Mighty little fishing you did on them trips , "
29105	29135	29100	29100	He	1059	" You know how the ladies are . If there 's a jug goes along , or a case of beer , they think it 's hell and damnation . "
29136	29144	29145	29146	his wife	372	" That 's the way men are , "
29157	29197	29151	29151	She	372	" I voted against prohibition to please him , and because I like a little beer in the house , and then he talks that way . It 's a wonder they ever find any one to marry them . "
29198	29201	29203	29203	Bill	240	" Say , "
29205	29227	29203	29203	Bill	240	" do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have cornered the dining - car until half past three this afternoon ? "
29228	29243	29151	29151	She	372	" How do you mean ? They ca n't do a thing like that . "
29244	29251	29203	29203	Bill	240	" You try and get seats . "
29252	29270	29151	29151	She	372	" Well , mother , it looks as though we better go back and get another breakfast . "
29279	29295	29151	29151	She	372	" Will you boys keep an eye on our things ? Come on , Hubert . "
29366	29376	29377	29377	I	0	" You 're going to work to - day , "
29385	29395	29382	29382	his	557	" They start now , at ten - thirty . "
29396	29402	29382	29382	his	557	" When do we eat ? "
29403	29411	29382	29382	his	557	" Huh ! When do I eat ? "
29431	29438	29439	29439	he	557	" I 'll get the plates , "
29442	29449	29439	29439	he	557	" or bring them with you . "
29541	29549	29551	29551	Hubert	197	" Is there good swimming in Biarritz ? "
29553	29567	29568	29569	his mother	349	" That boy 's just crazy till he can get in the water , "
29572	29581	29568	29569	his mother	349	" It 's pretty hard on youngsters travelling . "
29582	29588	29589	29589	I	0	" There 's good swimming , "
29592	29602	29589	29589	I	0	" But it 's dangerous when it 's rough . "
29603	29610	29611	29611	Bill	240	" Did you get a meal ? "
29614	29663	29568	29569	his mother	349	" We sure did . We set right there when they started to come in , and they must have just thought we were in the party . One of the waiters said something to us in French , and then they just sent three of them back . "
29664	29674	29675	29676	the man	702	" They thought we were snappers , all right , "
29679	29712	29675	29676	the man	702	" It certainly shows you the power of the Catholic Church . It 's a pity you boys ai n't Catholics . You could get a meal , then , all right . "
29713	29717	29718	29718	I	0	" I am , "
29721	29730	29718	29718	I	0	" That 's what makes me so sore . "

29781	29796	29752	29765	a priest who was coming back with one of the returning streams of pilgrims	1085	" I do n't know anything about it . Have n't you got tickets ? "
29797	29809	29810	29810	Bill	240	" It 's enough to make a man join the Klan , "
29854	29863	29818	29818	him	240	" He must drink a lot of wine . "
29864	29870	29836	29840	The waiter who served us	1091	" Or wear purple undershirts . "
29871	29877	29818	29818	him	240	" Let 's ask him . "
29878	29886	29836	29840	The waiter who served us	1091	" No . He 's too tired . "
30057	30068	30069	30069	he	702	" Well , I hope you have lots of luck , "

30189	30196	30187	30187	Robert	197	" I 've got a cab . "
30230	30249	30257	30258	the cabman	1112	" We 'll go up to my hotel . It 's all right . It 's quite nice . "
30288	30297	30298	30298	Robert	197	" I 'm awfully glad to meet you , "
30303	30328	30298	30298	Robert	197	" I 've heard so much about you from Jake and I 've read your books . Did you get my line , Jake ? "
31434	31444	31445	31445	I	0	" What 's the matter with the old one ? "

31508	31511	31512	31512	he	1211	" Oh , "
31515	31520	31512	31512	he	1211	" they go through . "

32743	32778	32692	32692	Bill	240	" You 've got a rotten chance . They 've never been on time anywhere . If their money does n't come it 's a cinch they wo n't get in to - night . "
32779	32828	32727	32727	Bill	240	" I was sorry as soon as I opened my mouth . But I had to call him . He 's all right , I guess , but where does he get this inside stuff ? Mike and Brett fixed it up with us about coming down here . "
32838	32843	32727	32727	Bill	240	" Here he comes . "
32844	32855	32727	32727	Bill	240	" Well , let him not get superior and Jewish . "

34065	34069	34070	34070	Bill	240	" You could , "
34073	34081	34070	34070	Bill	240	" but you do n't need to . "
34082	34092	34093	34093	I	0	" It would be like betting on the war , "

40448	40557	40414	40414	Bill	240	" Listen . You 're a hell of a good guy , and I 'm fonder of you than anybody on earth . I could n't tell you that in New York . It 'd mean I was a faggot . That was what the Civil War was about . Abraham Lincoln was a faggot . He was in love with General Grant . So was Jefferson Davis . Lincoln just freed the slaves on a bet . The Dred Scott case was framed by the Anti - Saloon League . Sex explains it all . The Colonel 's Lady and Judy O'Grady are Lesbians under their skin . "

45182	45200	45151	45151	Harris	287	" We 'll fish together again , some time . Do n't you forget it , Harris . "
45201	45216	45151	45151	Harris	287	" We must . We _ have _ had such a jolly good time . "
45217	45224	45151	45151	Harris	287	" How about another bottle around ? "
45225	45230	45232	45232	Harris	287	" Jolly good idea , "
45234	45239	45241	45241	Bill	240	" This is mine , "

45375	45388	45372	45372	Bill	240	" We call you Harris because we 're so fond of you . "

45620	45629	45630	45630	Bill	240	" Say , was n't that Harris nice ? "
45633	45644	45547	45547	He	287	" I think he really did have a good time . "

45880	45887	45798	45798	he	260	" Where are our friends now ? "
45888	45897	45819	45819	He	260	" I think they went to the pelota . "
45898	45905	45798	45798	he	260	" And how about the bulls ? "
45909	45914	45915	45915	he	260	" To - night , "
45918	45946	45915	45915	he	260	" To - night at seven o'clock they bring in the Villar bulls , and to - morrow come the Miuras . Do you all go down ? "

46092	46101	46088	46088	Montoya	260	" But he 's not aficionado like you . "

46639	46653	46621	46621	his	240	" He was telling me about the bulls coming in to - night . "
46654	46664	46628	46628	he	240	" Let 's find the gang and go down . "
46665	46677	46621	46621	his	240	" All right . They 'll probably be at the caf . "
46678	46684	46628	46628	he	240	" Have you got tickets ? "
46685	46696	46621	46621	his	240	" Yes . I got them for all the unloadings . "

46728	46734	46735	46735	I	0	" It 's pretty good , "
46738	46790	46735	46735	I	0	" They let the bulls out of the cages one at a time , and they have steers in the corral to receive them and keep them from fighting , and the bulls tear in at the steers and the steers run around like old maids trying to quiet them down . "
46791	46799	46909	46909	Their	1755	" Do they ever gore the steers ? "
46800	46813	46735	46735	I	0	" Sure . Sometimes they go right after them and kill them . "

46834	46843	46909	46909	Their	1755	" What do they have them in for ? "
46844	46866	46735	46735	I	0	" To quiet down the bulls and keep them from breaking horns against the stone walls , or goring each other . "
46867	46875	46909	46909	Their	1755	" Must be swell being a steer . "
47023	47029	47030	47030	she	212	" Hello , you chaps ! "

47083	47087	47088	47088	Brett	212	" What rot , "
47091	47104	47088	47088	Brett	212	" We 'd have gotten here earlier if you had n't come . "
47105	47113	47069	47069	I	0	" You 'd never have gotten here . "
47114	47127	47088	47088	Brett	212	" What rot ! You chaps are brown . Look at Bill . "
47128	47135	47136	47136	Mike	219	" Did you get good fishing ? "
47139	47146	47136	47136	Mike	219	" We wanted to join you . "
47147	47157	47088	47088	Brett	212	" It was n't bad . We missed you . "
47158	47164	47165	47165	Cohn	197	" I wanted to come , "
47168	47178	47165	47165	Cohn	197	" but I thought I ought to bring them . "
47179	47187	47088	47088	Brett	212	" You bring us . What rot . "
47188	47194	47195	47195	Mike	219	" Was it really good ? "
47198	47204	47195	47195	Mike	219	" Did you take many ? "
47205	47221	47088	47088	Brett	212	" Some days we took a dozen apiece . There was an Englishman up there . "
47222	47226	47227	47227	Bill	240	" Named Harris , "
47230	47245	47227	47227	Bill	240	" Ever know him , Mike ? He was in the war , too . "
47246	47250	47251	47251	Mike	219	" Fortunate fellow , "
47254	47269	47251	47251	Mike	219	" What times we had . How I wish those dear days were back . "
47270	47277	47088	47088	Brett	212	" Do n't be an ass . "
47278	47287	47288	47288	Cohn	197	" Were you in the war , Mike ? "
47291	47296	47088	47088	Brett	212	" Was I not . "
47297	47305	47306	47306	Brett	212	" He was a very distinguished soldier , "
47309	47321	47306	47306	Brett	212	" Tell them about the time your horse bolted down Piccadilly . "
47322	47334	47088	47088	Brett	212	" I 'll not . I 've told that four times . "
47335	47341	47306	47306	Brett	212	" You never told me , "
47346	47360	47088	47088	Brett	212	" I 'll not tell that story . It reflects discredit on me . "
47361	47368	47088	47088	Brett	212	" Tell them about your medals . "
47369	47382	47088	47088	Brett	212	" I 'll not . That story reflects great discredit on me . "
47383	47389	47088	47088	Brett	212	" What story 's that ? "
47390	47407	47088	47088	Brett	212	" Brett will tell you . She tells all the stories that reflect discredit on me . "
47408	47417	47088	47088	Brett	212	" Go on . Tell it , Brett . "
47418	47422	47088	47088	Brett	212	" Should I ? "
47423	47430	47088	47088	Brett	212	" I 'll tell it myself . "
47431	47440	47088	47088	Brett	212	" What medals have you got , Mike ? "
47441	47449	47088	47088	Brett	212	" I have n't got any medals . "
47450	47456	47088	47088	Brett	212	" You must have some . "
47457	47722	47088	47088	Brett	212	" I suppose I 've the usual medals . But I never sent in for them . One time there was this wopping big dinner and the Prince of Wales was to be there , and the cards said medals will be worn . So naturally I had no medals , and I stopped at my tailor 's and he was impressed by the invitation , and I thought that 's a good piece of business , and I said to him : ' You 've got to fix me up with some medals . ' He said : ' What medals , sir ? ' And I said : ' Oh , any medals . Just give me a few medals . ' So he said : ' What medals _ have _ you , sir ? ' And I said : ' How should I know ? ' Did he think I spent all my time reading the bloody gazette ? ' Just give me a good lot . Pick them out yourself . ' So he got me some medals , you know , miniature medals , and handed me the box , and I put it in my pocket and forgot it . Well , I went to the dinner , and it was the night they 'd shot Henry Wilson , so the Prince did n't come and the King did n't come , and no one wore any medals , and all these coves were busy taking off their medals , and I had mine in my pocket . "
47730	47735	47757	47757	Brett	212	" Is that all ? "
47736	47749	47757	47757	Brett	212	" That 's all . Perhaps I did n't tell it right . "
47750	47755	47757	47757	Brett	212	" You did n't , "
47759	47764	47757	47757	Brett	212	" But no matter . "
47770	47775	47777	47777	Mike	219	" Ah , yes , "
47779	47886	47777	47777	Mike	219	" I know now . It was a damn dull dinner , and I could n't stick it , so I left . Later on in the evening I found the box in my pocket . What 's this ? I said . Medals ? Bloody military medals ? So I cut them all off their backing -- you know , they put them on a strip -- and gave them all around . Gave one to each girl . Form of souvenir . They thought I was hell 's own shakes of a soldier . Give away medals in a night club . Dashing fellow . "
47887	47892	47893	47893	Brett	212	" Tell the rest , "
47896	47905	47906	47906	Mike	219	" Do n't you think that was funny ? "
47914	47969	47970	47970	Mike	219	" It was . I swear it was . Any rate , my tailor wrote me and wanted the medals back . Sent a man around . Kept on writing for months . Seems some chap had left them to be cleaned . Frightfully military cove . Set hell 's own store by them . "
47973	47980	47981	47981	he	219	" Rotten luck for the tailor , "
47984	47991	47992	47992	Bill	240	" You do n't mean it , "
47995	48008	47992	47992	Bill	240	" I should think it would have been grand for the tailor . "
48009	48022	48023	48023	Mike	219	" Frightfully good tailor . Never believe it to see me now , "
48026	48076	48023	48023	Mike	219	" I used to pay him a hundred pounds a year just to keep him quiet . So he would n't send me any bills . Frightful blow to him when I went bankrupt . It was right after the medals . Gave his letters rather a bitter tone . "
48077	48084	48085	48085	Bill	240	" How did you go bankrupt ? "
48088	48092	48093	48093	Mike	219	" Two ways , "
48096	48102	48093	48093	Mike	219	" Gradually and then suddenly . "
48103	48109	48023	48023	Mike	219	" What brought it on ? "
48110	48113	48115	48115	Mike	219	" Friends , "
48117	48144	48115	48115	Mike	219	" I had a lot of friends . False friends . Then I had creditors , too . Probably had more creditors than anybody in England . "
48145	48153	48154	48154	Brett	212	" Tell them about in the court , "
48157	48163	48164	48164	Mike	219	" I do n't remember , "
48167	48175	48164	48164	Mike	219	" I was just a little tight . "
48176	48179	48180	48180	Brett	212	" Tight ! "
48183	48188	48180	48180	Brett	212	" You were blind ! "
48189	48193	48194	48194	Mike	219	" Extraordinary thing , "
48197	48213	48194	48194	Mike	219	" Met my former partner the other day . Offered to buy me a drink . "
48214	48222	48223	48223	Brett	212	" Tell them about your learned counsel , "
48226	48231	48232	48232	Mike	219	" I will not , "
48235	48264	48232	48232	Mike	219	" My learned counsel was blind , too . I say this is a gloomy subject . Are we going down and see these bulls unloaded or not ? "
48265	48271	48307	48310	The three of us	1686	" Let 's go down . "
48417	48429	48430	48430	Brett	212	" That 's where we 'll go when funds get low , "
48710	48715	48716	48716	I	0	" Look up there , "
48779	48789	48790	48790	Brett	212	" They must think something is going to happen , "
48793	48801	48790	48790	Brett	212	" They want to see the bulls . "
48841	48848	48849	48850	Robert Cohn	197	" Why do n't they start ? "
48958	48965	48966	48966	Brett	212	" They do n't look happy , "
49216	49225	49226	49226	Brett	212	" My God , is n't he beautiful ? "
49237	49248	49249	49249	I	0	" Look how he knows how to use his horns , "
49252	49266	49249	49249	I	0	" He 's got a left and a right just like a boxer . "
49267	49271	49311	49312	a man	410	" Not really ? "
49272	49276	49249	49249	I	0	" You watch . "
49277	49283	49311	49312	a man	410	" It goes too fast . "
49284	49296	49249	49249	I	0	" Wait . There 'll be another one in a minute . "
49381	49388	49377	49378	the men	816	" Hah ! Hah ! Toro ! "
49414	49419	49420	49420	I	0	" Do n't look , "
49431	49434	49435	49435	I	0	" Fine , "
49438	49446	49435	49435	I	0	" If it does n't buck you . "
49447	49452	49453	49453	she	212	" I saw it , "
49456	49469	49453	49453	she	212	" I saw him shift from his left to his right horn . "
49470	49474	49435	49435	I	0	" Damn good ! "
49787	49794	49795	49795	Brett	212	" That 's an extraordinary business , "
49798	49810	49811	49812	Robert Cohn	197	" Will those last ones fight as well as the first ? "
49815	49824	49811	49812	Robert Cohn	197	" They seemed to quiet down awfully fast . "
49825	49832	49833	49833	I	0	" They all know each other , "
49836	49855	49833	49833	I	0	" They 're only dangerous when they 're alone , or only two or three of them together . "
49856	49864	49865	49865	Bill	240	" What do you mean , dangerous ? "
49868	49876	49865	49865	Bill	240	" They all looked dangerous to me . "
49877	49913	49833	49833	I	0	" They only want to kill when they 're alone . Of course , if you went in there you 'd probably detach one of them from the herd , and he 'd be dangerous . "
49914	49920	49921	49921	Bill	240	" That 's too complicated , "
49924	49937	49921	49921	Bill	240	" Do n't you ever detach me from the herd , Mike . "
49938	49942	49943	49943	Mike	219	" I say , "
49946	49964	49943	49943	Mike	219	" they _ were _ fine bulls , were n't they ? Did you see their horns ? "
49965	49970	49972	49972	Brett	212	" Did I not , "
49974	49984	49972	49972	Brett	212	" I had no idea what they were like . "

49999	50004	49996	49996	Mike	219	" That was extraordinary . "
50005	50014	50015	50016	Robert Cohn	197	" It 's no life being a steer , "
50019	50026	50027	50027	Mike	219	" Do n't you think so ? "
50030	50044	50027	50027	Mike	219	" I would have thought you 'd loved being a steer , Robert . "

50054	50074	50027	50027	Mike	219	" They lead such a quiet life . They never say anything and they 're always hanging about so . "
50092	50125	50015	50016	Robert Cohn	197	" I should think you 'd love it . You 'd never have to say a word . Come on , Robert . Do say something . Do n't just sit there . "
50126	50142	50015	50016	Robert Cohn	197	" I said something , Mike . Do n't you remember ? About the steers . "
50143	50167	50015	50016	Robert Cohn	197	" Oh , say something more . Say something funny . Ca n't you see we 're all having a good time here ? "
50168	50179	50180	50180	Brett	212	" Come off it , Michael . You 're drunk , "
50183	50211	50015	50016	Robert Cohn	197	" I 'm not drunk . I 'm quite serious . _ Is _ Robert Cohn going to follow Brett around like a steer all the time ? "
50212	50225	50015	50016	Robert Cohn	197	" Shut up , Michael . Try and show a little breeding . "
50226	50294	50015	50016	Robert Cohn	197	" Breeding be damned . Who has any breeding , anyway , except the bulls ? Are n't the bulls lovely ? Do n't you like them , Bill ? Why do n't you say something , Robert ? Do n't sit there looking like a bloody funeral . What if Brett did sleep with you ? She 's slept with lots of better people than you . "
50295	50299	50015	50016	Robert Cohn	197	" Shut up , "

Why do you follow Brett around like a poor bloody steer ? Do n't you know you 're not wanted ? I know when I 'm not wanted . Why do n't you know when you 're not wanted ? You came down to San Sebastian where you were n't wanted , and followed Brett around like a bloody steer . Do you think that 's right ? "
50415	50423	50303	50303	He	197	" Shut up . You 're drunk . "
50424	50514	50015	50016	Robert Cohn	197	" Perhaps I am drunk . Why are n't you drunk ? Why do n't you ever get drunk , Robert ? You know you did n't have a good time at San Sebastian because none of our friends would invite you on any of the parties . You ca n't blame them hardly . Can you ? I asked them to . They would n't do it . You ca n't blame them , now . Can you ? Now , answer me . Can you blame them ? "
50515	50522	50303	50303	He	197	" Go to hell , Mike . "
50523	50559	50015	50016	Robert Cohn	197	" I ca n't blame them . Can you blame them ? Why do you follow Brett around ? Have n't you any manners ? How do you think it makes _ me _ feel ? "
50560	50571	50572	50572	Brett	212	" You 're a splendid one to talk about manners , "

50661	50676	50677	50677	she	1880	" I say , Michael , you might not be such a bloody ass , "
50680	50693	50694	50694	She	1880	" I 'm not saying he 's not right , you know . "
50712	50723	50724	50724	he	219	" I 'm not so damn drunk as I sounded , "
50727	50734	50735	50735	Brett	212	" I know you 're not , "
50738	50746	50747	50747	I	0	" We 're none of us sober , "

50762	50770	50771	50771	Brett	212	" But you put it so badly , "
50774	50815	50724	50724	he	219	" He was an ass , though . He came down to San Sebastian where he damn well was n't wanted . He hung around Brett and just _ looked _ at her . It made me damned well sick . "
50816	50823	50824	50824	Brett	212	" He did behave very badly , "
50827	50863	50724	50724	he	219	" Mark you . Brett 's had affairs with men before . She tells me all about everything . She gave me this chap Cohn 's letters to read . I would n't read them . "
50864	50870	50724	50724	he	219	" Damned noble of you . "
50871	50902	50724	50724	he	219	" No , listen , Jake . Brett 's gone off with men . But they were n't ever Jews , and they did n't come and hang about afterward . "
50903	50908	50909	50909	Brett	212	" Damned good chaps , "
50912	50929	50909	50909	Brett	212	" It 's all rot to talk about it . Michael and I understand each other . "
50930	50945	50724	50724	he	219	" She gave me Robert Cohn 's letters . I would n't read them . "
50946	50962	50909	50909	Brett	212	" You would n't read any letters , darling . You would n't read mine . "
50963	50970	50971	50971	Mike	219	" I ca n't read letters , "
50974	50981	50971	50971	Mike	219	" Funny , is n't it ? "
50982	50989	50909	50909	Brett	212	" You ca n't read anything . "
50990	51012	50971	50971	Mike	219	" No . You 're wrong there . I read quite a bit . I read when I 'm at home . "
51013	51020	51021	51021	Brett	212	" You 'll be writing next , "
51024	51055	51021	51021	Brett	212	" Come on , Michael . Do buck up . You 've got to go through with this thing now . He 's here . Do n't spoil the fiesta . "
51056	51065	50971	50971	Mike	219	" Well , let him behave , then . "
51066	51076	51021	51021	Brett	212	" He 'll behave . I 'll tell him . "

51229	51238	51239	51239	Brett	212	" He 'd be good , you know , "
51242	51249	51239	51239	Brett	212	" He writes a good letter . "

51286	51300	51335	51335	Mike	219	" She made me write that . She was supposed to be ill . "
51301	51309	51273	51273	Brett	212	" I damned well was , too . "

51381	51395	51358	51358	Mike	219	" Quite . And the funny thing is I think I was tight . "
51396	51400	51273	51273	Brett	212	" Come on , "

57833	57860	57830	57830	Bill	240	" He 's got this Jewish superiority so strong that he thinks the only emotion he 'll get out of the fight will be being bored . "

72293	72339	72290	72290	Mike	219	" He 'd have knocked you out , too . I never saw him hit me . I rather think I saw him just before , and then quite suddenly I was sitting down in the street , and Jake was lying under a table . "
72340	72347	72348	72348	I	0	" Where did he go afterward ? "
72351	72356	72357	72357	Mike	219	" Here she is , "

72457	72491	72424	72424	Mike	219	" Why he went in and found Brett and the bull - fighter chap in the bull - fighter 's room , and then he massacred the poor , bloody bull - fighter . "
72492	72495	72424	72424	Mike	219	" No . "
72496	72499	72424	72424	Mike	219	" Yes . "
72500	72505	72506	72506	Bill	240	" What a night ! "
72509	72545	72424	72424	Mike	219	" He nearly killed the poor , bloody bull - fighter . Then Cohn wanted to take Brett away . Wanted to make an honest woman of her , I imagine . Damned touching scene . "
72555	72561	72546	72546	He	240	" He is an ass . "
72562	72566	72546	72546	He	240	" What happened ? "
72567	72586	72546	72546	He	240	" Brett gave him what for . She told him off . I think she was rather good . "
72587	72594	72595	72595	Bill	240	" I 'll bet she was , "
72598	72628	72424	72424	Mike	219	" Then Cohn broke down and cried , and wanted to shake hands with the bull - fighter fellow . He wanted to shake hands with Brett , too . "
72629	72639	72546	72546	He	240	" I know . He shook hands with me . "
72640	72694	72424	72424	Mike	219	" Did he ? Well , they were n't having any of it . The bull - fighter fellow was rather good . He did n't say much , but he kept getting up and getting knocked down again . Cohn could n't knock him out . It must have been damned funny . "
72695	72703	72546	72546	He	240	" Where did you hear all this ? "
72704	72713	72424	72424	Mike	219	" Brett . I saw her this morning . "
72714	72719	72546	72546	He	240	" What happened finally ? "
72720	72821	72424	72424	Mike	219	" It seems the bull - fighter fellow was sitting on the bed . He 'd been knocked down about fifteen times , and he wanted to fight some more . Brett held him and would n't let him get up . He was weak , but Brett could n't hold him , and he got up . Then Cohn said he would n't hit him again . Said he could n't do it . Said it would be wicked . So the bull - fighter chap sort of rather staggered over to him . Cohn went back against the wall .
72822	72831	72546	72546	He	240	" ' So you wo n't hit me ? '
72832	72847	72424	72424	Mike	219	" ' No , ' said Cohn . ' I 'd be ashamed to . '
72848	72949	72546	72546	He	240	" So the bull - fighter fellow hit him just as hard as he could in the face , and then sat down on the floor . He could n't get up , Brett said . Cohn wanted to pick him up and carry him to the bed . He said if Cohn helped him he 'd kill him , and he 'd kill him anyway this morning if Cohn was n't out of town . Cohn was crying , and Brett had told him off , and he wanted to shake hands . I 've told you that before . "
72950	72955	72956	72956	Bill	240	" Tell the rest , "
72959	73059	72546	72546	He	240	" It seems the bull - fighter chap was sitting on the floor . He was waiting to get strength enough to get up and hit Cohn again . Brett was n't having any shaking hands , and Cohn was crying and telling her how much he loved her , and she was telling him not to be a ruddy ass . Then Cohn leaned down to shake hands with the bull - fighter fellow . No hard feelings , you know . All for forgiveness . And the bull - fighter chap hit him in the face again . "
73060	73067	73068	73068	Bill	240	" That 's quite a kid , "
73071	73076	73077	73077	Mike	219	" He ruined Cohn , "
73080	73097	73077	73077	Mike	219	" You know I do n't think Cohn will ever want to knock people about again . "
73098	73105	72546	72546	He	240	" When did you see Brett ? "
73106	73126	73077	73077	Mike	219	" This morning . She came in to get some things . She 's looking after this Romero lad . "
73135	73165	72546	72546	He	240	" Brett 's rather cut up . But she loves looking after people . That 's how we came to go off together . She was looking after me . "
73166	73170	73171	73171	I	0	" I know , "
73174	73180	73181	73181	Mike	219	" I 'm rather drunk , "
73184	73216	73181	73181	Mike	219	" I think I 'll _ stay _ rather drunk . This is all awfully amusing , but it 's not too pleasant . It 's not too pleasant for me . "
73223	73255	73256	73256	He	219	" I gave Brett what for , you know . I said if she would go about with Jews and bull - fighters and such people , she must expect trouble . "
73260	73284	73256	73256	He	219	" I say , Jake , do you mind if I drink that bottle of yours ? She 'll bring you another one . "
73285	73288	73289	73289	I	0	" Please , "
73292	73301	73289	73289	I	0	" I was n't drinking it , anyway . "
73309	73316	73317	73317	I	0	" Would you mind opening it ? "
73329	73333	73334	73334	Mike	219	" You know , "
73338	73397	73334	73334	Mike	219	" Brett was rather good . She 's always rather good . I gave her a fearful hiding about Jews and bull - fighters , and all those sort of people , and do you know what she said : ' Yes . I 've had such a hell of a happy life with the British aristocracy ! ' "
73403	73509	73334	73334	Mike	219	" That was rather good . Ashley , chap she got the title from , was a sailor , you know . Ninth baronet . When he came home he would n't sleep in a bed . Always made Brett sleep on the floor . Finally , when he got really bad , he used to tell her he 'd kill her . Always slept with a loaded service revolver . Brett used to take the shells out when he 'd gone to sleep . She has n't had an absolutely happy life . Brett . Damned shame , too . She enjoys things so . "
73519	73534	73599	73599	him	219	" I 'm going in the room . Try and get a little sleep . "
73538	73574	73535	73535	He	219	" We go too long without sleep in these fiestas . I 'm going to start now and get plenty of sleep . Damn bad thing not to get sleep . Makes you frightfully nervy . "
73575	73587	73588	73588	Bill	240	" We 'll see you at noon at the Iru a , "
73619	73634	73635	73635	Mike	219	" Bring up half a dozen bottles of beer and a bottle of Fundador , "
73639	73645	73610	73611	the chambermaid	2604	" Si , Se orito . "
73646	73653	73654	73654	Bill	240	" I 'm going to bed , "
73657	73674	73654	73654	Bill	240	" Poor old Mike . I had a hell of a row about him last night . "
73675	73683	73610	73611	the chambermaid	2604	" Where ? At that Milano place ? "
73684	73710	73654	73654	Bill	240	" Yes . There was a fellow there that had helped pay Brett and Mike out of Cannes , once . He was damned nasty . "
73711	73717	73610	73611	the chambermaid	2604	" I know the story . "
73718	73735	73654	73654	Bill	240	" I did n't . Nobody ought to have a right to say things about Mike . "
73736	73744	73610	73611	the chambermaid	2604	" That 's what makes it bad . "
73745	73771	73654	73654	Bill	240	" They ought n't to have any right . I wish to hell they did n't have any right . I 'm going to bed . "
73772	73780	73610	73611	the chambermaid	2604	" Was anybody killed in the ring ? "
73781	73792	73654	73654	Bill	240	" I do n't think so . Just badly hurt . "
73793	73803	73610	73611	the chambermaid	2604	" A man was killed outside in the runway . "
73804	73808	73810	73810	Bill	240	" Was there ? "
74056	74061	74062	74062	Bill	240	" Here comes Brett , "
74103	74109	74110	74110	she	2633	" Hello , you chaps ! "
74113	74124	74110	74110	she	2633	" I say , I _ have _ a thirst . "
74125	74131	74132	74132	Bill	240	" Get another big beer , "
74138	74141	74110	74110	she	2633	" Shrimps ? "
74142	74147	74148	74148	Brett	212	" Is Cohn gone ? "
74151	74154	74155	74155	Bill	240	" Yes , "
74158	74164	74155	74155	Bill	240	" He hired a car . "
74196	74200	74219	74219	he	219	" Good beer . "
74201	74205	74206	74206	I	0	" Very good , "
74240	74250	74251	74251	Brett	212	" I heard Cohn had hurt you , Jake , "
74254	74265	74233	74233	he	219	" No . Knocked me out . That was all . "
74266	74276	74277	74277	Brett	212	" I say , he did hurt Pedro Romero , "
74280	74287	74277	74277	Brett	212	" He hurt him most badly . "
74288	74293	74233	74233	he	219	" How is he ? "
74294	74310	74277	74277	Brett	212	" He 'll be all right . He wo n't go out of the room . "
74311	74317	74233	74233	he	219	" Does he look badly ? "
74318	74342	74277	74277	Brett	212	" Very . He was really hurt . I told him I wanted to pop out and see you chaps for a minute . "
74343	74350	74233	74233	he	219	" Is he going to fight ? "
74351	74366	74277	74277	Brett	212	" Rather . I 'm going with you , if you do n't mind . "
74367	74374	74375	74375	Mike	219	" How 's your boy friend ? "
74389	74398	74399	74399	he	219	" Brett 's got a bull - fighter , "
74402	74416	74399	74399	he	219	" She had a Jew named Cohn , but he turned out badly . "
74421	74438	74399	74399	he	219	" I am not going to listen to that sort of rot from you , Michael . "
74439	74446	74417	74417	Brett	212	" How 's your boy friend ? "
74447	74451	74452	74452	Brett	212	" Damned well , "
74455	74461	74452	74452	Brett	212	" Watch him this afternoon . "
74462	74471	74472	74472	Mike	219	" Brett 's got a bull - fighter , "
74475	74484	74472	74472	Mike	219	" A beautiful , bloody bull - fighter . "
74485	74503	74417	74417	Brett	212	" Would you mind walking over with me ? I want to talk to you , Jake . "
74504	74514	74515	74515	Mike	219	" Tell him all about your bull - fighter , "
74518	74529	74417	74417	Brett	212	" Oh , to hell with your bull - fighter ! "
74550	74554	74555	74555	Brett	212	" Come on , "
74558	74566	74555	74555	Brett	212	" Let 's get out of this . "

74582	74614	74568	74572	the crowd crossing the square	2637	" I 'm not going to see him after lunch until the fight . His people come in and dress him . They 're very angry about me , he says . "
74633	74639	74640	74640	Brett	212	" I feel altogether changed , "
74643	74651	74640	74640	Brett	212	" You 've no idea , Jake . "
74652	74660	74568	74572	the crowd crossing the square	2637	" Anything you want me to do ? "
74661	74672	74640	74640	Brett	212	" No , just go to the fight with me . "
74673	74681	74568	74572	the crowd crossing the square	2637	" We 'll see you at lunch ? "

74718	74729	74730	74730	Brett	212	" Want to take a turn out to the park ? "
74733	74749	74730	74730	Brett	212	" I do n't want to go up yet . I fancy he 's sleeping . "
74823	74831	74832	74832	Brett	212	" Do n't let 's go there , "
74835	74845	74832	74832	Brett	212	" I do n't want staring at just now . "
74867	74875	74876	74876	Brett	212	" I hope the wind goes down , "
74879	74887	74876	74876	Brett	212	" It 's very bad for him . "
74888	74892	74832	74832	Brett	212	" So do I. "
74893	74902	74876	74876	Brett	212	" He says the bulls are all right . "

75096	75103	75093	75093	Brett	212	" Never does me any good . "

75161	75171	75136	75136	Brett	212	" I wish the wind would drop , though . "
75172	75183	75119	75119	Brett	212	" It 's liable to go down by five o'clock . "
75184	75189	75136	75136	Brett	212	" Let 's hope . "
75190	75195	75196	75196	I	0	" You might pray , "
75199	75218	75136	75136	Brett	212	" Never does me any good . I 've never gotten anything I prayed for . Have you ? "

75225	75230	75232	75232	Brett	212	" Oh , rot , "
75234	75253	75232	75232	Brett	212	" Maybe it works for some people , though . You do n't look very religious , Jake . "
