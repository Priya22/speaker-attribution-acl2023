79	85	87	88	his lady	250	" My dear Mr. Bennet , "
94	106	87	88	his lady	250	" have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? "
115	120	122	122	she	250	" But it is , "
124	141	122	122	she	250	" for Mrs. Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . "
148	160	162	163	his wife	251	" Do not you want to know who has taken it ? "
166	184	87	88	his lady	250	" _ You _ want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . "
190	278	122	122	she	250	" Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . "
279	285	122	122	she	250	" What is his name ? "
286	289	122	122	she	250	" Bingley . "
290	297	122	122	she	250	" Is he married or single ? "
298	332	122	122	she	250	" Oh ! single , my dear , to be sure ! A single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year . What a fine thing for our girls ! "
333	343	122	122	she	250	" How so ? how can it affect them ? "
344	350	352	353	his wife	251	" My dear Mr. Bennet , "
355	377	352	353	his wife	251	" how can you be so tiresome ! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . "
378	387	122	122	she	250	" Is that his design in settling here ? "
388	429	352	353	his wife	251	" Design ! nonsense , how can you talk so ! But it is very likely that he _ may _ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . "
430	482	122	122	she	250	" I see no occasion for that . You and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the party . "
483	534	352	353	his wife	251	" My dear , you flatter me . I certainly _ have _ had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now . When a woman has five grown up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . "
535	551	122	122	she	250	" In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . "
552	573	352	353	his wife	251	" But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . "
574	587	122	122	she	250	" It is more than I engage for , I assure you . "
588	656	352	353	his wife	251	" But consider your daughters . Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them . Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general you know they visit no new comers . Indeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _ us _ to visit him , if you do not . "
657	717	122	122	she	250	" You are over scrupulous surely . I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . "
718	770	352	353	his wife	251	" I desire you will do no such thing . Lizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good humoured as Lydia . But you are always giving _ her _ the preference . "
771	782	784	784	he	254	" They have none of them much to recommend them , "
786	808	784	784	he	254	" they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . "
809	841	352	353	his wife	251	" Mr. Bennet , how can you abuse your own children in such a way ? You take delight in vexing me . You have no compassion on my poor nerves . "
842	879	784	784	he	254	" You mistake me , my dear . I have a high respect for your nerves . They are my old friends . I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least . "
880	891	352	353	his wife	251	" Ah ! you do not know what I suffer . "
892	919	784	784	he	254	" But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . "
920	941	352	353	his wife	251	" It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come since you will not visit them . "
942	962	784	784	he	254	" Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . "
1135	1145	1129	1129	he	86	" I hope Mr. Bingley will like it Lizzy . "
1146	1162	1164	1165	her mother	261	" We are not in a way to know _ what _ Mr. Bingley likes , "
1168	1176	1164	1165	her mother	261	" since we are not to visit . "
1177	1184	1186	1186	Elizabeth	93	" But you forget , mama , "
1188	1208	1186	1186	Elizabeth	93	" that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him . "
1209	1246	1164	1165	her mother	261	" I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing . She has two nieces of her own . She is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . "
1247	1253	1255	1256	Mr. Bennet	86	" No more have I , "
1258	1275	1255	1256	Mr. Bennet	86	" and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . "
1298	1326	1255	1256	Mr. Bennet	86	" Do n't keep coughing so , Kitty , for heaven 's sake ! Have a little compassion on my nerves . You tear them to pieces . "
1327	1336	1338	1339	her father	264	" Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , "
1341	1347	1338	1339	her father	264	" she times them ill . "
1348	1358	1360	1360	Kitty	97	" I do not cough for my own amusement , "
1363	1374	1255	1256	Mr. Bennet	86	" When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? "
1375	1381	1255	1256	Mr. Bennet	86	" To - morrow fortnight . "
1382	1389	1391	1392	her mother	261	" Aye , so it is , "
1394	1427	1391	1392	her mother	261	" and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so , it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . "
1428	1452	1338	1339	her father	264	" Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _ her _ . "
1453	1477	1391	1392	her mother	261	" Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teazing ? "
1478	1562	1338	1339	her father	264	" I honour your circumspection . A fortnight 's acquaintance is certainly very little . One can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight . But if _ we _ do not venture , somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance ; and therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . "
1575	1580	1570	1571	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Nonsense , nonsense ! "
1581	1592	1594	1594	he	267	" What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? "
1596	1655	1594	1594	he	267	" Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ? I can not quite agree with you _ there _ . What say you , Mary ? for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know , and read great books , and make extracts . "
1669	1677	1678	1678	he	267	" While Mary is adjusting her ideas , "
1681	1689	1678	1678	he	267	" let us return to Mr. Bingley . "
1690	1698	1700	1701	his wife	251	" I am sick of Mr. Bingley , "
1703	1763	1767	1768	the ladies	269	" I am sorry to hear _ that _ ; but why did not you tell me so before ? If I had known as much this morning , I certainly would not have called on him . It is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . "
1809	1882	1802	1802	she	251	" How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet ! But I knew I should persuade you at last . I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance . Well , how pleased I am ! and it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning , and never said a word about it till now . "
1883	1897	1899	1900	Mr. Bennet	86	" Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you chuse , "
1921	1931	1933	1933	she	251	" What an excellent father you have , girls , "
1941	2027	1933	1933	she	251	" I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me either , for that matter . At our time of life , it is not so pleasant I can tell you , to be making new acquaintance every day ; but for your sakes , we would do any thing . Lydia , my love , though you _ are _ the youngest , I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . "
2028	2031	2033	2033	Lydia	95	" Oh ! "
2036	2056	2033	2033	Lydia	95	" I am not afraid ; for though I _ am _ the youngest , I 'm the tallest . "
2246	2261	2263	2264	Mrs. Bennet	96	" If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield , "
2269	2286	2263	2264	Mrs. Bennet	96	" and all the others equally well married , I shall have nothing to wish for . "
3040	3045	3047	3047	he	100	" Come , Darcy , "
3049	3076	3047	3047	he	100	" I must have you dance . I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner . You had much better dance . "
3077	3140	3011	3011	her	93	" I certainly shall not . You know how I detest it , unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner . At such an assembly as this , it would be insupportable . Your sisters are engaged , and there is not another woman in the room , whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with . "
3141	3152	3154	3154	Bingley	90	" I would not be so fastidious as you are , "
3156	3194	3154	3154	Bingley	90	" for a kingdom ! Upon my honour , I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life , as I have this evening ; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty . "
3195	3210	3212	3213	Mr. Darcy	100	" _ You _ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room , "
3222	3271	3154	3154	Bingley	90	" Oh ! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld ! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you , who is very pretty , and I dare say , very agreeable . Do let me ask my partner to introduce you . "
3272	3278	3283	3283	he	100	" Which do you mean ? "
3304	3361	3296	3296	he	100	" She is tolerable ; but not handsome enough to tempt _ me _ ; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men . You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles , for you are wasting your time with me . "
3623	3631	3633	3633	she	251	" Oh ! my dear Mr. Bennet , "
3638	3837	3633	3633	she	251	" we have had a most delightful evening , a most excellent ball . I wish you had been there . Jane was so admired , nothing could be like it . Every body said how well she looked ; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful , and danced with her twice . Only think of _ that _ my dear ; he actually danced with her twice ; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time . First of all , he asked Miss Lucas . I was so vexed to see him stand up with her ; but , however , he did not admire her at all : indeed , nobody can , you know ; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance . So , he enquired who she was , and got introduced , and asked her for the two next . Then , the two third he danced with Miss King , and the two fourth with Maria Lucas , and the two fifth with Jane again , and the two sixth with Lizzy , and the Boulanger---- "
3838	3850	3852	3853	her husband	276	" If he had had any compassion for _ me _ , "
3856	3891	3852	3853	her husband	276	" he would not have danced half so much ! For God 's sake , say no more of his partners . Oh ! that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance ! "
3892	3898	3900	3901	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Oh ! my dear , "
3903	3948	3900	3901	Mrs. Bennet	96	" I am quite delighted with him . He is so excessively handsome ! and his sisters are charming women . I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses . I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst 's gown---- "
3995	4002	4003	4003	she	96	" But I can assure you , "
4006	4097	4003	4003	she	96	" that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _ his _ fancy ; for he is a most disagreeable , horrid man , not at all worth pleasing . So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him ! He walked here , and he walked there , fancying himself so very great ! Not handsome enough to dance with ! I wish you had been there , my dear , to have given him one of your set downs . I quite detest the man . "
4134	4146	4148	4148	she	347	" He is just what a young man ought to be , "
4150	4174	4148	4148	she	347	" sensible , good humoured , lively ; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease , with such perfect good breeding ! "
4175	4181	4183	4183	Elizabeth	93	" He is also handsome , "
4185	4206	4183	4183	Elizabeth	93	" which a young man ought likewise to be , if he possibly can . His character is thereby complete . "
4207	4231	4148	4148	she	347	" I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time . I did not expect such a compliment . "
4232	4333	4183	4183	Elizabeth	93	" Did not you ? _ I _ did for you . But that is one great difference between us . Compliments always take _ you _ by surprise , and _ me _ never . What could be more natural than his asking you again ? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room . No thanks to his gallantry for that . Well , he certainly is very agreeable , and I give you leave to like him . You have liked many a stupider person . "
4334	4338	4148	4148	she	347	" Dear Lizzy ! "
4339	4392	4183	4183	Elizabeth	93	" Oh ! you are a great deal too apt you know , to like people in general . You never see a fault in any body . All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes . I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life . "
4393	4414	4148	4148	she	347	" I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one ; but I always speak what I think . "
4415	4521	4183	4183	Elizabeth	93	" I know you do ; and it is _ that _ which makes the wonder . With _ your _ good sense , to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others ! Affectation of candour is common enough;--one meets it every where . But to be candid without ostentation or design -- to take the good of every body 's character and make it still better , and say nothing of the bad -- belongs to you alone . And so , you like this man 's sisters too , do you ? Their manners are not equal to his . "
4522	4571	4148	4148	she	347	" Certainly not ; at first . But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them . Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house ; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her . "
5604	5615	5617	5618	Mrs. Bennet	96	" _ You _ began the evening well , Charlotte , "
5628	5639	5617	5618	Mrs. Bennet	96	" _ You _ were Mr. Bingley 's first choice . "
5640	5650	5594	5595	the former	347	" Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better . "
5651	5703	5617	5618	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Oh!--you mean Jane , I suppose -- because he danced with her twice . To be sure that _ did _ seem as if he admired her -- indeed I rather believe he _ did_--I heard something about it -- but I hardly know what -- something about Mr. Robinson . "
5704	5792	5594	5595	the former	347	" Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson ; did not I mention it to you ? Mr. Robinson 's asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies , and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room , and _ which _ he thought the prettiest ? and his answering immediately to the last question -- Oh ! the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt , there can not be two opinions on that point . "
5793	5820	5617	5618	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Upon my word!--Well , that was very decided indeed -- that does seem as if----but however , it may all come to nothing you know . "
5821	5838	5840	5840	Charlotte	114	" _ My _ overhearings were more to the purpose than _ yours _ , Eliza , "
5842	5866	5840	5840	Charlotte	114	" Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend , is he?--Poor Eliza!--to be only just _ tolerable _ . "
5867	5930	5617	5618	Mrs. Bennet	96	" I beg you would not put it into Lizzy 's head to be vexed by his ill - treatment ; for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him . Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips . "
5931	5944	5840	5840	Charlotte	114	" Are you quite sure , Ma'am?--is not there a little mistake ? "
5946	5955	5617	5618	Mrs. Bennet	96	Jane.--"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her . "
5956	5988	5840	5840	Charlotte	114	" Aye -- because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield , and he could not help answering her;--but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to . "
5989	5995	5997	5997	Jane	94	" Miss Bingley told me , "
5999	6020	5997	5997	Jane	94	" that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance . With _ them _ he is remarkably agreeable . "
6021	6096	5840	5840	Charlotte	114	" I do not believe a word of it , my dear . If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs. Long . But I can guess how it was ; every body says that he is ate up with pride , and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage , and had come to the ball in a hack chaise . "
6097	6109	6111	6112	Miss Lucas	103	" I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long , "
6114	6124	6111	6112	Miss Lucas	103	" but I wish he had danced with Eliza . "
6125	6131	6133	6134	her mother	261	" Another time , Lizzy , "
6136	6151	6133	6134	her mother	261	" I would not dance with _ him _ , if I were you . "
6152	6171	5840	5840	Charlotte	114	" I believe , Ma'am , I may safely promise you _ never _ to dance with him . "
6172	6176	6178	6179	Miss Lucas	103	" His pride , "
6181	6249	6178	6179	Miss Lucas	103	" does not offend _ me _ so much as pride often does , because there is an excuse for it . One can not wonder that so very fine a young man , with family , fortune , every thing in his favour , should think highly of himself . If I may so express it , he has a _ right _ to be proud . "
6250	6256	6258	6258	Elizabeth	93	" That is very true , "
6260	6280	6258	6258	Elizabeth	93	" and I could easily forgive _ his _ pride , if he had not mortified _ mine _ . "
6281	6284	6286	6286	Mary	98	" Pride , "
6298	6409	6286	6286	Mary	98	" is a very common failing I believe . By all that I have ever read , I am convinced that it is very common indeed , that human nature is particularly prone to it , and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self - complacency on the score of some quality or other , real or imaginary . Vanity and pride are different things , though the words are often used synonimously . A person may be proud without being vain . Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves , vanity to what we would have others think of us . "
6410	6420	6422	6429	a young Lucas who came with his sisters	407	" If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy , "
6431	6458	6422	6429	a young Lucas who came with his sisters	407	" I should not care how proud I was . I would keep a pack of foxhounds , and drink a bottle of wine every day . "
6459	6472	6474	6475	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought , "
6477	6495	6474	6475	Mrs. Bennet	96	" and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly . "
6774	6781	6783	6783	Charlotte	114	" It may perhaps be pleasant , "
6785	6955	6783	6783	Charlotte	114	" to be able to impose on the public in such a case ; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded . If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it , she may lose the opportunity of fixing him ; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark . There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment , that it is not safe to leave any to itself . We can all _ begin _ freely -- a slight preference is natural enough ; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement . In nine cases out of ten , a woman had better shew _ more _ affection than she feels . Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly ; but he may never do more than like her , if she does not help him on . "
6956	6995	6757	6757	her	94	" But she does help him on , as much as her nature will allow . If _ I _ can perceive her regard for him , he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too . "
6996	7013	6783	6783	Charlotte	114	" Remember , Eliza , that he does not know Jane 's disposition as you do . "
7014	7039	6757	6757	her	94	" But if a woman is partial to a man , and does not endeavour to conceal it , he must find it out . "
7040	7133	6783	6783	Charlotte	114	" Perhaps he must , if he sees enough of her . But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often , it is never for many hours together ; and as they always see each other in large mixed parties , it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together . Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention . When she is secure of him , there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses . "
7134	7142	6757	6757	her	94	" Your plan is a good one , "
7146	7270	6757	6757	her	94	" where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married ; and if I were determined to get a rich husband , or any husband , I dare say I should adopt it . But these are not Jane 's feelings ; she is not acting by design . As yet , she can not even be certain of the degree of her own regard , nor of its reasonableness . She has known him only a fortnight . She danced four dances with him at Meryton ; she saw him one morning at his own house , and has since dined in company with him four times . This is not quite enough to make her understand his character . "
7271	7321	7551	7551	she	93	" Not as you represent it . Had she merely _ dined _ with him , she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite ; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together -- and four evenings may do a great deal . "
7322	7363	6757	6757	her	94	" Yes ; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt - un better than Commerce ; but with respect to any other leading characteristic , I do not imagine that much has been unfolded . "
7364	7367	7369	7369	Charlotte	114	" Well , "
7371	7500	7369	7369	Charlotte	114	" I wish Jane success with all my heart ; and if she were married to him to - morrow , I should think she had as good a chance of happiness , as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth . Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance . If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other , or ever so similar before - hand , it does not advance their felicity in the least . They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation ; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life . "
7501	7533	7551	7551	she	93	" You make me laugh , Charlotte ; but it is not sound . You know it is not sound , and that you would never act in this way yourself . "
7793	7800	7802	7802	she	93	" What does Mr. Darcy mean , "
7806	7816	7802	7802	she	93	" by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster ? "
7817	7829	7787	7791	a large party were assembled	427	" That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer . "
7830	7878	7802	7802	she	93	" But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about . He has a very satirical eye , and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself , I shall soon grow afraid of him . "
7924	7956	7917	7917	she	103	" Did not you think , Mr. Darcy , that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now , when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton ? "
7957	7972	7917	7917	she	103	" With great energy;--but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic . "
7973	7980	7917	7917	she	103	" You are severe on us . "
7981	7994	7996	7997	Miss Lucas	103	" It will be _ her _ turn soon to be teazed , "
7999	8016	7996	7997	Miss Lucas	103	" I am going to open the instrument , Eliza , and you know what follows . "
8017	8082	8091	8091	she	103	" You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body!--If my vanity had taken a musical turn , you would have been invaluable , but as it is , I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers . "
8094	8107	8091	8091	she	103	" Very well ; if it must be so , it must . "
8115	8147	8091	8091	she	103	" There is a fine old saying , which every body here is of course familiar with--'Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'--and I shall keep mine to swell my song . "
8387	8418	8378	8379	his neighbour	436	" What a charming amusement for young people this is , Mr. Darcy!--There is nothing like dancing after all.--I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies . "
8419	8444	8378	8379	his neighbour	436	" Certainly , Sir;--and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world.--Every savage can dance . "
8450	8456	8457	8457	he	91	" Your friend performs delightfully ; "
8468	8485	8378	8379	his neighbour	436	group;--"and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself , Mr. Darcy . "
8486	8499	8378	8379	his neighbour	436	" You saw me dance at Meryton , I believe , Sir . "
8500	8523	8378	8379	his neighbour	436	" Yes , indeed , and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight . Do you often dance at St. James 's ? "
8524	8529	8378	8379	his neighbour	436	" Never , sir . "
8530	8545	8378	8379	his neighbour	436	" Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place ? "
8546	8564	8378	8379	his neighbour	436	" It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it . "
8565	8576	8378	8379	his neighbour	436	" You have a house in town , I conclude ? "
8581	8619	8378	8379	his neighbour	436	" I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself -- for I am fond of superior society ; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas . "
8666	8714	8647	8647	he	100	" My dear Miss Eliza , why are not you dancing?--Mr . Darcy , you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner.--You can not refuse to dance , I am sure , when so much beauty is before you . "
8757	8788	8743	8743	she	437	" Indeed , Sir , I have not the least intention of dancing.--I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner . "
8827	8880	8743	8743	she	437	" You excel so much in the dance , Miss Eliza , that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you ; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general , he can have no objection , I am sure , to oblige us for one half hour . "
8881	8888	8890	8890	Elizabeth	93	" Mr. Darcy is all politeness , "
8894	8926	8743	8743	she	437	" He is indeed -- but considering the inducement , my dear Miss Eliza , we can not wonder at his complaisance ; for who would object to such a partner ? "
8962	8972	8743	8743	she	437	" I can guess the subject of your reverie . "
8973	8979	8743	8743	she	437	" I should imagine not . "
8980	9045	8743	8743	she	437	" You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner -- in such society ; and indeed I am quite of your opinion . I was never more annoyed ! The insipidity and yet the noise ; the nothingness and yet the self - importance of all these people!--What would I give to hear your strictures on them ! "
9046	9089	8743	8743	she	437	" Your conjecture is totally wrong , I assure you . My mind was more agreeably engaged . I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow . "
9123	9128	9116	9117	Mr. Darcy	100	" Miss Elizabeth Bennet . "
9129	9134	9136	9137	Miss Bingley	102	" Miss Elizabeth Bennet ! "
9139	9162	9136	9137	Miss Bingley	102	" I am all astonishment . How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray when am I to wish you joy ? "
9163	9208	9116	9117	Mr. Darcy	100	" That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask . A lady 's imagination is very rapid ; it jumps from admiration to love , from love to matrimony in a moment . I knew you would be wishing me joy . "
9209	9254	9136	9137	Miss Bingley	102	" Nay , if you are so serious about it , I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled . You will have a charming mother - in - law , indeed , and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you . "
9694	9732	9689	9690	Mr. Bennet	86	" From all that I can collect by your manner of talking , you must be two of the silliest girls in the country . I have suspected it some time , but I am now convinced . "
9781	9789	9791	9792	Mrs. Bennet	96	" I am astonished , my dear , "
9794	9829	9791	9792	Mrs. Bennet	96	" that you should be so ready to think your own children silly . If I wished to think slightingly of any body 's children , it should not be of my own however . "
9830	9846	9752	9752	her	95	" If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it . "
9847	9863	9791	9792	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Yes -- but as it happens , they are all of them very clever . "
9864	9911	9752	9752	her	95	" This is the only point , I flatter myself , on which we do not agree . I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular , but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish . "
9912	10026	9791	9792	Mrs. Bennet	96	" My dear Mr. Bennet , you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother.--When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do . I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well -- and indeed so I do still at my heart ; and if a smart young colonel , with five or six thousand a year , should want one of my girls , I shall not say nay to him ; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William 's in his regimentals . "
10027	10030	10032	10032	Lydia	95	" Mama , "
10034	10073	10032	10032	Lydia	95	" my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson 's as they did when they first came ; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke 's library . "
10125	10161	10114	10114	she	96	" Well , Jane , who is it from ? what is it about ? what does he say ? Well , Jane , make haste and tell us ; make haste , my love . "
10162	10169	10171	10171	Jane	94	" It is from Miss Bingley , "
10179	10183	10114	10114	she	96	" My dear Friend ,
10184	10260	10114	10114	she	96	" If you are not so compassionate as to dine to - day with Louisa and me , we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives , for a whole day 's t?te-?-t?te between two women can never end without a quarrel . Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this . My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers . Yours ever ,
10261	10265	10114	10114	she	96	" CAROLINE BINGLEY . "
10266	10271	10273	10273	Lydia	95	" With the officers ! "
10275	10289	10273	10273	Lydia	95	" I wonder my aunt did not tell us of _ that _ . "
10290	10294	10296	10297	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Dining out , "
10299	10305	10296	10297	Mrs. Bennet	96	" that is very unlucky . "
10306	10313	10315	10315	Jane	94	" Can I have the carriage ? "
10317	10345	10296	10297	Mrs. Bennet	96	" No , my dear , you had better go on horseback , because it seems likely to rain ; and then you must stay all night . "
10346	10354	10356	10356	Elizabeth	93	" That would be a good scheme , "
10358	10373	10356	10356	Elizabeth	93	" if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home . "
10374	10400	10296	10297	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Oh ! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley 's chaise to go to Meryton ; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs . "
10401	10411	10356	10356	Elizabeth	93	" I had much rather go in the coach . "
10412	10444	10296	10297	Mrs. Bennet	96	" But , my dear , your father can not spare the horses , I am sure . They are wanted in the farm , Mr. Bennet , are not they ? "
10445	10460	10356	10356	Elizabeth	93	" They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them . "
10461	10472	10474	10474	Elizabeth	93	" But if you have got them to - day , "
10476	10485	10474	10474	Elizabeth	93	" my mother 's purpose will be answered . "
10573	10584	10586	10587	Mrs. Bennet	96	" This was a lucky idea of mine , indeed ! "
10641	10646	10879	10879	she	93	" My dearest Lizzy , "
10647	10731	10603	10603	her	96	" I FIND myself very unwell this morning , which , I suppose , is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday . My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better . They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones -- therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me -- and excepting a sore - throat and head - ache there is not much the matter with me . "
10732	10737	10879	10879	she	93	" Yours , & c. "
10738	10744	10746	10747	Mr. Bennet	86	" Well , my dear , "
10757	10796	10750	10750	Elizabeth	93	" if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness , if she should die , it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley , and under your orders . "
10797	10854	10888	10888	her	93	" Oh ! I am not at all afraid of her dying . People do not die of little trifling colds . She will be taken good care of . As long as she stays there , it is all very well . I would go and see her , if I could have the carriage . "
10897	10905	10907	10908	her mother	261	" How can you be so silly , "
10910	10937	10907	10908	her mother	261	" as to think of such a thing , in all this dirt ! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there . "
10938	10954	10888	10888	her	93	" I shall be very fit to see Jane -- which is all I want . "
10955	10965	10967	10968	her father	264	" Is this a hint to me , Lizzy , "
10970	10977	10967	10968	her father	264	" to send for the horses ? "
10978	11014	10888	10888	her	93	" No , indeed . I do not wish to avoid the walk . The distance is nothing , when one has a motive ; only three miles . I shall be back by dinner . "
11015	11024	11026	11026	Mary	98	" I admire the activity of your benevolence , "
11028	11057	11026	11026	Mary	98	" but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason ; and , in my opinion , exertion should always be in proportion to what is required . "
11058	11069	11071	11071	Catherine	97	" We will go as far as Meryton with you , "
11087	11093	11095	11095	Lydia	95	" If we make haste , "
11102	11115	11095	11095	Lydia	95	" perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes . "
12026	12059	12017	12018	Mrs. Hurst	101	" She has nothing , in short , to recommend her , but being an excellent walker . I shall never forget her appearance this morning . She really looked almost wild . "
12060	12107	12003	12003	she	93	" She did indeed , Louisa . I could hardly keep my countenance . Very nonsensical to come at all ! Why must _ she _ be scampering about the country , because her sister had a cold ? Her hair so untidy , so blowsy ! "
12108	12150	12017	12018	Mrs. Hurst	101	" Yes , and her petticoat ; I hope you saw her petticoat , six inches deep in mud , I am absolutely certain ; and the gown which had been let down to hide it , not doing its office . "
12151	12161	12163	12163	Bingley	102	" Your picture may be very exact , Louisa , "
12165	12200	12163	12163	Bingley	102	" but this was all lost upon me . I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well , when she came into the room this morning . Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice . "
12201	12215	12217	12218	Miss Bingley	102	" _ You _ observed it , Mr. Darcy , I am sure , "
12220	12243	12217	12218	Miss Bingley	102	" and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _ your sister _ make such an exhibition . "
12244	12248	12017	12018	Mrs. Hurst	101	" Certainly not . "
12249	12308	12217	12218	Miss Bingley	102	" To walk three miles , or four miles , or five miles , or whatever it is , above her ancles in dirt , and alone , quite alone ! what could she mean by it ? It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence , a most country town indifference to decorum . "
12309	12322	12324	12324	Bingley	102	" It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing , "
12326	12334	12336	12337	Miss Bingley	102	" I am afraid , Mr. Darcy , "
12344	12358	12336	12337	Miss Bingley	102	" that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes . "
12359	12364	12365	12365	he	521	" Not at all , "
12368	12376	12365	12365	he	521	" they were brightened by the exercise . "--A
12389	12442	12336	12337	Miss Bingley	102	" I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet , she is really a very sweet girl , and I wish with all my heart she were well settled . But with such a father and mother , and such low connections , I am afraid there is no chance of it . "
12443	12461	12365	12365	he	521	" I think I have heard you say , that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton . "
12462	12476	12336	12337	Miss Bingley	102	" Yes ; and they have another , who lives somewhere near Cheapside . "
12477	12482	12484	12485	her sister	348	" That is capital , "
12493	12506	12508	12508	Bingley	102	" If they had uncles enough to fill _ all _ Cheapside , "
12510	12521	12508	12508	Bingley	102	" it would not make them one jot less agreeable . "
12522	12541	12543	12543	Darcy	100	" But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world , "
12723	12731	12733	12733	he	99	" Do you prefer reading to cards ? "
12735	12741	12733	12733	he	99	" that is rather singular . "
12742	12747	12749	12750	Miss Bingley	102	" Miss Eliza Bennet , "
12752	12769	12749	12750	Miss Bingley	102	" despises cards . She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else . "
12770	12780	12782	12782	Elizabeth	93	" I deserve neither such praise nor such censure , "
12784	12802	12782	12782	Elizabeth	93	" I am _ not _ a great reader , and I have pleasure in many things . "
12803	12815	12817	12817	Bingley	102	" In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure , "
12819	12834	12817	12817	Bingley	102	" and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well . "
12869	12908	12913	12913	she	93	" And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit ; but I am an idle fellow , and though I have not many , I have more than I ever look into . "
12924	12929	12931	12932	Miss Bingley	102	" I am astonished , "
12934	12958	12931	12932	Miss Bingley	102	" that my father should have left so small a collection of books.--What a delightful library you have at Pemberley , Mr. Darcy ! "
12959	12966	12967	12967	he	99	" It ought to be good , "
12970	12980	12967	12967	he	99	" it has been the work of many generations . "
12981	12999	12913	12913	she	93	" And then you have added so much to it yourself , you are always buying books . "
13000	13017	12967	12967	he	99	" I can not comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these . "
13018	13059	12913	12913	she	93	" Neglect ! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place . Charles , when you build _ your _ house , I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley . "
13060	13066	12967	12967	he	99	" I wish it may . "
13067	13102	12913	12913	she	93	" But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood , and take Pemberley for a kind of model . There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire . "
13103	13120	12967	12967	he	99	" With all my heart ; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it . "
13121	13130	12913	12913	she	93	" I am talking of possibilities , Charles . "
13131	13153	12967	12967	he	99	" Upon my word , Caroline , I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation . "
13205	13215	13217	13218	Miss Bingley	102	" Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring ? "
13220	13230	13217	13218	Miss Bingley	102	" will she be as tall as I am ? "
13231	13251	13181	13181	she	93	" I think she will . She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet 's height , or rather taller . "
13252	13297	13217	13218	Miss Bingley	102	" How I long to see her again ! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much . Such a countenance , such manners ! and so extremely accomplished for her age ! Her performance on the piano - forte is exquisite . "
13298	13305	13307	13307	Bingley	90	" It is amazing to me , "
13309	13327	13307	13307	Bingley	90	" how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished , as they all are . "
13328	13343	13217	13218	Miss Bingley	102	" All young ladies accomplished ! My dear Charles , what do you mean ? "
13344	13403	13307	13307	Bingley	90	" Yes , all of them , I think . They all paint tables , cover skreens and net purses . I scarcely know any one who can not do all this , and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time , without being informed that she was very accomplished . "
13404	13414	13416	13416	Darcy	139	" Your list of the common extent of accomplishments , "
13418	13490	13416	13416	Darcy	139	" has too much truth . The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse , or covering a skreen . But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general . I can not boast of knowing more than half a dozen , in the whole range of my acquaintance , that are really accomplished . "
13491	13499	13501	13502	Miss Bingley	102	" Nor I , I am sure , "
13504	13507	13509	13509	Elizabeth	93	" Then , "
13511	13526	13509	13509	Elizabeth	93	" you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman . "
13527	13539	13416	13416	Darcy	139	" Yes ; I do comprehend a great deal in it . "
13540	13545	13547	13549	his faithful assistant	537	" Oh ! certainly , "
13551	13636	13547	13549	his faithful assistant	537	" no one can be really esteemed accomplished , who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with . A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing , and the modern languages , to deserve the word ; and besides all this , she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking , the tone of her voice , her address and expressions , or the word will be but half deserved . "
13637	13644	13646	13646	Darcy	139	" All this she must possess , "
13648	13671	13646	13646	Darcy	139	" and to all this she must yet add something more substantial , in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading . "
13672	13699	13547	13549	his faithful assistant	537	" I am no longer surprised at your knowing _ only _ six accomplished women . I rather wonder now at your knowing _ any _ . "
13700	13719	13646	13646	Darcy	139	" Are you so severe upon your own sex , as to doubt the possibility of all this ? "
13720	13753	13547	13549	his faithful assistant	537	" _ I _ never saw such a woman . _ I _ never saw such capacity , and taste , and application , and elegance , as you describe , united . "
13820	13824	13826	13827	Miss Bingley	102	" Eliza Bennet , "
13837	13888	13826	13827	Miss Bingley	102	" is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex , by undervaluing their own ; and with many men , I dare say , it succeeds . But , in my opinion , it is a paltry device , a very mean art . "
13889	13892	13894	13894	Darcy	139	" Undoubtedly , "
13904	13931	13894	13894	Darcy	139	" there is meanness in _ all _ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation . Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable . "
14367	14374	14376	14376	her	96	" Indeed I have , Sir , "
14379	14412	14376	14376	her	96	" She is a great deal too ill to be moved . Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her . We must trespass a little longer on your kindness . "
14413	14416	14418	14418	Bingley	102	" Removed ! "
14420	14442	14418	14418	Bingley	102	" It must not be thought of . My sister , I am sure , will not hear of her removal . "
14443	14452	14454	14455	Miss Bingley	102	" You may depend upon it , Madam , "
14461	14476	14454	14455	Miss Bingley	102	" that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us . "
14485	14490	14491	14491	she	96	" I am sure , "
14494	14627	14491	14491	she	96	" if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her , for she is very ill indeed , and suffers a vast deal , though with the greatest patience in the world , which is always the way with her , for she has , without exception , the sweetest temper I ever met with . I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _ her _ . You have a sweet room here , Mr. Bingley , and a charming prospect over that gravel walk . I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield . You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope , though you have but a short lease . "
14628	14638	14640	14640	he	564	" Whatever I do is done in a hurry , "
14642	14675	14640	14640	he	564	" and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield , I should probably be off in five minutes . At present , however , I consider myself as quite fixed here . "
14676	14688	14690	14690	Elizabeth	93	" That is exactly what I should have supposed of you , "
14692	14702	14704	14704	he	564	" You begin to comprehend me , do you ? "
14710	14720	14640	14640	he	564	" Oh ! yes -- I understand you perfectly . "
14721	14745	14640	14640	he	564	" I wish I might take this for a compliment ; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful . "
14746	14776	14640	14640	he	564	" That is as it happens . It does not necessarily follow that a deep , intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours . "
14777	14780	14640	14640	he	564	" Lizzy , "
14785	14809	14640	14640	he	564	" remember where you are , and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home . "
14810	14817	14819	14819	Bingley	90	" I did not know before , "
14822	14838	14819	14819	Bingley	90	" that you were a studier of character . It must be an amusing study . "
14839	14859	14640	14640	he	564	" Yes ; but intricate characters are the _ most _ amusing . They have at least that advantage . "
14860	14864	14866	14866	Darcy	139	" The country , "
14868	14895	14866	14866	Darcy	139	" can in general supply but few subjects for such a study . In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society . "
14896	14917	14640	14640	he	564	" But people themselves alter so much , that there is something new to be observed in them for ever . "
14918	14923	14925	14926	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Yes , indeed , "
14938	14960	14925	14926	Mrs. Bennet	96	" I assure you there is quite as much of _ that _ going on in the country as in town . "
14999	15039	14996	14996	her	96	" I can not see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part , except the shops and public places . The country is a vast deal pleasanter , is not it , Mr. Bingley ? "
15040	15048	15049	15049	he	90	" When I am in the country , "
15052	15088	15049	15049	he	90	" I never wish to leave it ; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same . They have each their advantages , and I can be equally happy in either . "
15089	15105	15108	15108	Darcy	139	" Aye -- that is because you have the right disposition . But that gentleman , "
15110	15121	15108	15108	Darcy	139	" seemed to think the country was nothing at all . "
15122	15131	15133	15133	Elizabeth	93	" Indeed , Mama , you are mistaken , "
15140	15178	15133	15133	Elizabeth	93	" You quite mistook Mr. Darcy . He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town , which you must acknowledge to be true . "
15179	15220	15137	15138	her mother	261	" Certainly , my dear , nobody said there were ; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood , I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger . I know we dine with four and twenty families . "
15286	15358	15281	15281	her	114	" Yes , she called yesterday with her father . What an agreeable man Sir William is , Mr. Bingley -- is not he ? so much the man of fashion ! so genteel and so easy!--He has always something to say to every body.--_That _ is my idea of good breeding ; and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths , quite mistake the matter . "
15359	15366	15281	15281	her	114	" Did Charlotte dine with you ? "
15367	15467	15281	15281	her	114	" No , she would go home . I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies . For my part , Mr. Bingley , _ I _ always keep servants that can do their own work ; _ my _ daughters are brought up differently . But every body is to judge for themselves , and the Lucases are very good sort of girls , I assure you . It is a pity they are not handsome ! Not that _ I _ think Charlotte so _ very _ plain -- but then she is our particular friend . "
15468	15477	15479	15479	Bingley	90	" She seems a very pleasant young woman , "
15481	15626	15281	15281	her	114	" Oh ! dear , yes;--but you must own she is very plain . Lady Lucas herself has often said so , and envied me Jane 's beauty . I do not like to boast of my own child , but to be sure , Jane -- one does not often see any body better looking . It is what every body says . I do not trust my own partiality . When she was only fifteen , there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiner 's in town , so much in love with her , that my sister - in - law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away . But however he did not . Perhaps he thought her too young . However , he wrote some verses on her , and very pretty they were . "
15627	15634	15636	15636	Elizabeth	93	" And so ended his affection , "
15639	15670	15636	15636	Elizabeth	93	" There has been many a one , I fancy , overcome in the same way . I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ! "
15671	15687	15689	15689	Darcy	100	" I have been used to consider poetry as the _ food _ of love , "
15691	15737	15752	15753	her mother	261	" Of a fine , stout , healthy love it may . Every thing nourishes what is strong already . But if it be only a slight , thin sort of inclination , I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away . "
16049	16097	16145	16145	she	95	" I am perfectly ready , I assure you , to keep my engagement ; and when your sister is recovered , you shall if you please name the very day of the ball . But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill . "
16103	16144	16145	16145	she	95	" Oh ! yes -- it would be much better to wait till Jane was well , and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again . And when you have given _ your _ ball , "
16148	16174	16145	16145	she	95	" I shall insist on their giving one also . I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not . "
16434	16447	16595	16595	He	596	" How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter ! "
16453	16459	16595	16595	He	596	" You write uncommonly fast . "
16460	16470	16595	16595	He	596	" You are mistaken . I write rather slowly . "
16471	16500	16595	16595	He	596	" How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year ! Letters of business too ! How odious I should think them ! "
16501	16519	16595	16595	He	596	" It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of to yours . "
16520	16532	16595	16595	He	596	" Pray tell your sister that I long to see her . "
16533	16546	16595	16595	He	596	" I have already told her so once , by your desire . "
16547	16571	16595	16595	He	596	" I am afraid you do not like your pen . Let me mend it for you . I mend pens remarkably well . "
16572	16583	16595	16595	He	596	" Thank you -- but I always mend my own . "
16584	16594	16595	16595	He	596	" How can you contrive to write so even ? "
16599	16646	16595	16595	He	596	" Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp , and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table , and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley 's . "
16647	16671	16595	16595	He	596	" Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?--At present I have not room to do them justice . "
16672	16703	16595	16595	He	596	" Oh ! it is of no consequence . I shall see her in January . But do you always write such charming long letters to her , Mr. Darcy ? "
16704	16723	16595	16595	He	596	" They are generally long ; but whether always charming , it is not for me to determine . "
16724	16750	16595	16595	He	596	" It is a rule with me , that a person who can write a long letter , with ease , can not write ill . "
16751	16764	16595	16595	He	596	" That will not do for a compliment to Darcy , Caroline , "
16767	16791	16595	16595	He	596	brother--"because he does _ not _ write with ease . He studies too much for words of four syllables.--Do not you , Darcy ? "
16792	16803	16595	16595	He	596	" My style of writing is very different from yours . "
16804	16807	16809	16810	Miss Bingley	102	" Oh ! "
16812	16834	16809	16810	Miss Bingley	102	" Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable . He leaves out half his words , and blots the rest . "
16835	16865	16595	16595	He	596	" My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them -- by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents . "
16866	16873	16875	16875	Elizabeth	93	" Your humility , Mr. Bingley , "
16877	16882	16875	16875	Elizabeth	93	" must disarm reproof . "
16883	16889	16891	16891	Darcy	100	" Nothing is more deceitful , "
16893	16914	16891	16891	Darcy	100	" than the appearance of humility . It is often only carelessness of opinion , and sometimes an indirect boast . "
16915	16933	16595	16595	He	596	" And which of the two do you call _ my _ little recent piece of modesty ? "
16934	17075	16891	16891	Darcy	100	" The indirect boast;--for you are really proud of your defects in writing , because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution , which if not estimable , you think at least highly interesting . The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor , and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance . When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes , you meant it to be a sort of panegyric , of compliment to yourself -- and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone , and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ? "
17076	17079	16595	16595	He	596	" Nay , "
17083	17152	17081	17081	Bingley	90	" this is too much , to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning . And yet , upon my honour , I believed what I said of myself to be true , and I believe it at this moment . At least , therefore , I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies . "
17153	17245	16891	16891	Darcy	100	" I dare say you believed it ; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity . Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know ; and if , as you were mounting your horse , a friend were to say , ' Bingley , you had better stay till next week , ' you would probably do it , you would probably not go -- and , at another word , might stay a month . "
17246	17254	17256	17256	Elizabeth	93	" You have only proved by this , "
17258	17284	17256	17256	Elizabeth	93	" that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition . You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself . "
17285	17291	17293	17293	Bingley	90	" I am exceedingly gratified , "
17295	17364	17293	17293	Bingley	90	" by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper . But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend ; for he would certainly think the better of me , if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial , and ride off as fast as I could . "
17365	17388	16891	16891	Darcy	100	" Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it ? "
17389	17407	17293	17293	Bingley	90	" Upon my word I can not exactly explain the matter , Darcy must speak for himself . "
17408	17488	16891	16891	Darcy	100	" You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine , but which I have never acknowledged . Allowing the case , however , to stand according to your representation , you must remember , Miss Bennet , that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house , and the delay of his plan , has merely desired it , asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety . "
17489	17510	17293	17293	Bingley	90	" To yield readily -- easily -- to the _ persuasion _ of a friend is no merit with you . "
17511	17525	16891	16891	Darcy	100	" To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either . "
17526	17662	17293	17293	Bingley	90	" You appear to me , Mr. Darcy , to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection . A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request , without waiting for arguments to reason one into it . I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley . We may as well wait , perhaps , till the circumstance occurs , before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon . But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend , where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment , should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire , without waiting to be argued into it ? "
17663	17707	16891	16891	Darcy	100	" Will it not be advisable , before we proceed on this subject , to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request , as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ? "
17708	17713	17293	17293	Bingley	90	" By all means , "
17717	17822	17715	17715	Bingley	90	" let us hear all the particulars , not forgetting their comparative height and size ; for that will have more weight in the argument , Miss Bennet , than you may be aware of . I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow , in comparison with myself , I should not pay him half so much deference . I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy , on particular occasions , and in particular places ; at his own house especially , and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do . "
17866	17874	17876	17876	his	100	" I see your design , Bingley , "
17877	17888	17859	17859	her	102	friend.--"You dislike an argument , and want to silence this . "
17889	17934	17876	17876	his	100	" Perhaps I do . Arguments are too much like disputes . If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room , I shall be very thankful ; and then you may say whatever you like of me . "
17935	17940	17942	17942	Elizabeth	93	" What you ask , "
17944	17962	17942	17942	Elizabeth	93	" is no sacrifice on my side ; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter . "
18199	18221	18189	18190	Mr. Darcy	100	" Do not you feel a great inclination , Miss Bennet , to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel ? "
18242	18245	18247	18247	she	93	" Oh ! "
18249	18342	18247	18247	she	93	" I heard you before ; but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply . You wanted me , I know , to say ' Yes , ' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste ; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes , and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt . I have therefore made up my mind to tell you , that I do not want to dance a reel at all -- and now despise me if you dare . "
18343	18350	18376	18376	her	93	" Indeed I do not dare . "
18489	18493	18495	18495	she	102	" I hope , "
18509	18584	18495	18495	she	102	" you will give your mother - in - law a few hints , when this desirable event takes place , as to the advantage of holding her tongue ; and if you can compass it , do cure the younger girls of running after the officers.--And , if I may mention so delicate a subject , endeavour to check that little something , bordering on conceit and impertinence , which your lady possesses . "
18585	18598	18482	18482	his	100	" Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity ? "
18599	18672	18495	18495	she	102	" Oh ! yes.--Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley . Put them next to your great uncle the judge . They are in the same profession , you know ; only in different lines . As for your Elizabeth 's picture , you must not attempt to have it taken , for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ? "
18673	18707	18482	18482	his	100	" It would not be easy , indeed , to catch their expression , but their colour and shape , and the eye - lashes , so remarkably fine , might be copied . "
18725	18736	18738	18739	Miss Bingley	102	" I did not know that you intended to walk , "
18751	18758	18760	18761	Mrs. Hurst	101	" You used us abominably ill , "
18763	18776	18760	18761	Mrs. Hurst	101	" in running away without telling us that you were coming out . "
18808	18827	18840	18840	them	609	" This walk is not wide enough for our party . We had better go into the avenue . "
18845	18877	18840	18840	them	609	" No , no ; stay where you are.--You are charmingly group'd , and appear to uncommon advantage . The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth . Good bye . "
19086	19090	19084	19084	he	99	" very glad ; "
19425	19481	19417	19417	she	622	" How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way ! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading ! How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book!--When I have a house of my own , I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library . "
19530	19590	19522	19522	she	622	" By the bye , Charles , are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?--I would advise you , before you determine on it , to consult the wishes of the present party ; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure . "
19591	19597	19599	19600	her brother	3126	" If you mean Darcy , "
19602	19647	19599	19600	her brother	3126	" he may go to bed , if he chuses , before it begins -- but as for the ball , it is quite a settled thing ; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards . "
19648	19656	19657	19657	she	622	" I should like balls infinitely better , "
19660	19705	19657	19657	she	622	" if they were carried on in a different manner ; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting . It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day . "
19706	19731	19755	19755	she	102	" Much more rational , my dear Caroline , I dare say , but it would not be near so much like a ball . "
19793	19828	19778	19778	she	102	" Miss Eliza Bennet , let me persuade you to follow my example , and take a turn about the room.--I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude . "
19928	19943	19945	19945	Elizabeth	93	" What could he mean ? she was dying to know what could be his meaning"--and
19954	19959	19961	19961	her	102	" Not at all , "
19964	19994	19961	19961	her	102	" but depend upon it , he means to be severe on us , and our surest way of disappointing him , will be to ask nothing about it . "
20022	20033	20035	20035	he	100	" I have not the smallest objection to explaining them , "
20046	20113	20035	20035	he	100	" You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each other 's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking;--if the first , I should be completely in your way;--and if the second , I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire . "
20114	20119	20121	20122	Miss Bingley	102	" Oh ! shocking ! "
20124	20143	20121	20122	Miss Bingley	102	" I never heard any thing so abominable . How shall we punish him for such a speech ? "
20144	20156	20158	20158	Elizabeth	93	" Nothing so easy , if you have but the inclination , "
20160	20190	20158	20158	Elizabeth	93	" We can all plague and punish one another . Teaze him -- laugh at him.--Intimate as you are , you must know how it is to be done . "
20191	20268	20035	20035	he	100	" But upon my honour I do _ not _ . I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me _ that _ . Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind ! No , no -- I feel he may defy us there . And as to laughter , we will not expose ourselves , if you please , by attempting to laugh without a subject . Mr. Darcy may hug himself . "
20269	20279	20281	20281	Elizabeth	93	" Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at ! "
20283	20321	20281	20281	Elizabeth	93	" That is an uncommon advantage , and uncommon I hope it will continue , for it would be a great loss to _ me _ to have many such acquaintance . I dearly love a laugh . "
20322	20326	20328	20328	he	633	" Miss Bingley , "
20330	20375	20328	20328	he	633	" has given me credit for more than can be . The wisest and the best of men , nay , the wisest and best of their actions , may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke . "
20376	20379	20035	20035	he	100	" Certainly , "
20381	20445	20328	20328	he	633	Elizabeth--"there are such people , but I hope I am not one of _ them _ . I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good . Follies and nonsense , whims and inconsistencies _ do _ divert me , I own , and I laugh at them whenever I can.--But these , I suppose , are precisely what you are without . "
20446	20478	20281	20281	Elizabeth	93	" Perhaps that is not possible for any one . But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule . "
20479	20486	20328	20328	he	633	" Such as vanity and pride . "
20487	20516	20281	20281	Elizabeth	93	" Yes , vanity is a weakness indeed . But pride -- where there is a real superiority of mind , pride will be always under good regulation . "
20525	20537	20539	20540	Miss Bingley;--"and	145	" Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over , I presume , "
20540	20547	20328	20328	he	633	Bingley;--"and pray what is the result ? "
20548	20569	20281	20281	Elizabeth	93	" I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect . He owns it himself without disguise . "
20570	20571	20328	20328	he	633	" No"--said
20574	20673	20281	20281	Elizabeth	93	" I have made no such pretension . I have faults enough , but they are not , I hope , of understanding . My temper I dare not vouch for.--It is I believe too little yielding -- certainly too little for the convenience of the world . I can not forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought , nor their offences against myself . My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them . My temper would perhaps be called resentful.--My good opinion once lost is lost for ever . "
20674	20681	20682	20682	Elizabeth	93	" _ That _ is a failing indeed!"--cried
20684	20718	20682	20682	Elizabeth	93	" Implacable resentment _ is _ a shade in a character . But you have chosen your fault well.--I really can not _ laugh _ at it . You are safe from me . "
20719	20749	20281	20281	Elizabeth	93	" There is , I believe , in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil , a natural defect , which not even the best education can overcome . "
20750	20764	20682	20682	Elizabeth	93	" And _ your _ defect is a propensity to hate every body . "
20765	20769	20770	20770	he	634	" And yours , "
20776	20783	20770	20770	he	634	" is wilfully to misunderstand them . "
20784	20791	20792	20793	Miss Bingley	102	" Do let us have a little music,"--cried
20804	20815	20770	20770	he	634	share.--"Louisa , you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst . "
21632	21639	21641	21642	Mr. Bennet	86	" I hope , my dear , "
21656	21681	21641	21642	Mr. Bennet	86	" that you have ordered a good dinner to - day , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party . "
21682	21735	21629	21630	CHAPTER XIII	146	" Who do you mean , my dear ? I know of nobody that is coming I am sure , unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in , and I hope _ my _ dinners are good enough for her . I do not believe she often sees such at home . "
21736	21751	21752	21753	Mrs. Bennet	96	" The person of whom I speak , is a gentleman and a stranger . "
21756	21838	21629	21630	CHAPTER XIII	146	sparkled.--"A gentleman and a stranger ! It is Mr. Bingley I am sure . Why Jane -- you never dropt a word of this ; you sly thing ! Well , I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley.--But -- good lord ! how unlucky ! there is not a bit of fish to be got to - day . Lydia , my love , ring the bell . I must speak to Hill , this moment . "
21839	21848	21850	21851	her husband	276	" It is _ not _ Mr. Bingley , "
21853	21870	21850	21851	her husband	276	" it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life . "
21908	21972	21904	21904	he	276	" About a month ago I received this letter , and about a fortnight ago I answered it , for I thought it a case of some delicacy , and requiring early attention . It is from my cousin , Mr. Collins , who , when I am dead , may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases . "
21973	21979	21981	21982	his wife	251	" Oh ! my dear , "
21984	22051	21981	21982	his wife	251	" I can not bear to hear that mentioned . Pray do not talk of that odious man . I do think it is the hardest thing in the world , that your estate should be entailed away from your own children ; and I am sure if I had been you , I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it . "
22121	22130	22132	22133	Mr. Bennet	86	" It certainly is a most iniquitous affair , "
22135	22172	22132	22133	Mr. Bennet	86	" and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn . But if you will listen to his letter , you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself . "
22173	22227	22113	22119	a man whom nobody cared anything about	670	" No , that I am sure I shall not ; and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all , and very hypocritical . I hate such false friends . Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you , as his father did before him ? "
22228	22251	22132	22133	Mr. Bennet	86	" Why , indeed , he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head , as you will hear . "
22252	22260	22113	22119	a man whom nobody cared anything about	670	" _ Hunsford , near Westerham , Kent ,
22348	22353	22344	22344	him	673	variance.--"There , Mrs. Bennet . "--My
22687	22687	22684	22685	WILLIAM COLLINS	151	"
22688	22704	22706	22707	Mr. Bennet	86	" At four o'clock , therefore , we may expect this peace - making gentleman , "
22716	22760	22706	22707	Mr. Bennet	86	" He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man , upon my word ; and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance , especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again . "
22761	22796	22848	22848	his	690	" There is some sense in what he says about the girls however ; and if he is disposed to make them any amends , I shall not be the person to discourage him . "
22797	22803	22805	22805	Jane	94	" Though it is difficult , "
22807	22834	22805	22805	Jane	94	" to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due , the wish is certainly to his credit . "
22865	22875	22877	22877	she	93	" He must be an oddity , I think , "
22879	22924	22877	22877	she	93	" I can not make him out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail?--We can not suppose he would help it , if he could.--Can he be a sensible man , sir ? "
22925	22971	22858	22859	his parishioners	691	" No , my dear ; I think not . I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse . There is a mixture of servility and self - importance in his letter , which promises well . I am impatient to see him . "
22972	22978	22980	22980	Mary	98	" In point of composition , "
22982	23010	22980	22980	Mary	98	" his letter does not seem defective . The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new , yet I think it is well expressed . "
23276	23314	23263	23270	Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments	96	" You are very kind , sir , I am sure ; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so ; for else they will be destitute enough . Things are settled so oddly . "
23315	23326	23263	23270	Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments	96	" You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate . "
23327	23390	23263	23270	Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments	96	" Ah ! sir , I do indeed . It is a grievous affair to my poor girls , you must confess . Not that I mean to find fault with _ you _ , for such things I know are all chance in this world . There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed . "
23391	23454	23263	23270	Mrs. Bennet , who quarrelled with no compliments	96	" I am very sensible , madam , of the hardship to my fair cousins,--and could say much on the subject , but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate . But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them . At present I will not say more , but perhaps when we are better acquainted---- "
23966	23979	23981	23982	Mrs. Bennet	96	" That is all very proper and civil , I am sure , "
23984	24019	23981	23982	Mrs. Bennet	96	" and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman . It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her . Does she live near you , sir ? "
24020	24045	23939	23939	she	97	" The garden in which stands my humble abode , is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park , her ladyship 's residence . "
24046	24063	23981	23982	Mrs. Bennet	96	" I think you said she was a widow , sir ? has she any family ? "
24064	24082	23939	23939	she	97	" She has one only daughter , the heiress of Rosings , and of very extensive property . "
24083	24086	24088	24089	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Ah ! "
24095	24118	24088	24089	Mrs. Bennet	96	" then she is better off than many girls . And what sort of young lady is she ? is she handsome ? "
24119	24238	23939	23939	she	97	" She is a most charming young lady indeed . Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty , Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex ; because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth . She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution , which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments , which she could not otherwise have failed of ; as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education , and who still resides with them . But she is perfectly amiable , and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . "
24239	24257	24088	24089	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Has she been presented ? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court . "
24258	24393	23939	23939	she	97	" Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town ; and by that means , as I told Lady Catherine myself one day , has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament . Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea , and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies . I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine , that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess , and that the most elevated rank , instead of giving her consequence , would be adorned by her.--These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship , and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay . "
24394	24400	24402	24403	Mr. Bennet	86	" You judge very properly , "
24405	24445	24402	24403	Mr. Bennet	86	" and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy . May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment , or are the result of previous study ? "
24446	24493	24513	24513	he	86	" They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible . "
24686	24748	24681	24681	she	95	" Do you know , mama , that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard , and if he does , Colonel Forster will hire him . My aunt told me so herself on Saturday . I shall walk to Meryton to - morrow to hear more about it , and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town . "
24777	24831	24763	24764	Mr. Collins	149	" I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp , though written solely for their benefit . It amazes me , I confess;--for certainly , there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction . But I will no longer importune my young cousin . "
25356	25415	25353	25353	he	149	on.--"As to her _ younger _ daughters she could not take upon her to say -- she could not positively answer -- but she did not _ know _ of any prepossession;--her _ eldest _ daughter , she must just mention -- she felt it incumbent on her to hint , was likely to be very soon engaged . "
26610	26616	26617	26619	Some of them	815	" stupid , disagreeable fellows . "
27528	27539	27541	27541	he	149	" I know little of the game , at present , "
27543	27559	27541	27541	he	149	" but I shall be glad to improve myself , for in my situation of life---- "
27764	27769	27771	27771	Elizabeth	93	" About a month , "
27785	27800	27747	27747	her	93	" He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire , I understand . "
27801	27804	27747	27747	her	93	" Yes , "
27806	27858	27747	27747	her	93	Wickham;--"his estate there is a noble one . A clear ten thousand per annum . You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself -- for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy . "
27866	27904	27747	27747	her	93	" You may well be surprised , Miss Bennet , at such an assertion , after seeing , as you probably might , the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday.--Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy ? "
27905	27915	27917	27917	Elizabeth	93	" As much as I ever wish to be , "
27918	27937	27747	27747	her	93	warmly,--"I have spent four days in the same house with him , and I think him very disagreeable . "
27938	27950	27952	27952	Wickham	156	" I have no right to give _ my _ opinion , "
27954	28028	27952	27952	Wickham	156	" as to his being agreeable or otherwise . I am not qualified to form one . I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge . It is impossible for _ me _ to be impartial . But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish -- and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family . "
28029	28084	27747	27747	her	93	" Upon my word I say no more _ here _ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood , except Netherfield . He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire . Every body is disgusted with his pride . You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one . "
28085	28094	28096	28096	Wickham	156	" I can not pretend to be sorry , "
28103	28161	28096	28096	Wickham	156	" that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts ; but with _ him _ I believe it does not often happen . The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence , or frightened by his high and imposing manners , and sees him only as he chuses to be seen . "
28162	28184	28185	28185	Wickham	156	" I should take him , even on _ my _ slight acquaintance , to be an ill - tempered man . "
28191	28195	28197	28197	he	156	" I wonder , "
28206	28219	28197	28197	he	156	" whether he is likely to be in this country much longer . "
28220	28264	27747	27747	her	93	" I do not at all know ; but I _ heard _ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield . I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood . "
28265	28445	28197	28197	he	156	" Oh ! no -- it is not for _ me _ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy . If _ he _ wishes to avoid seeing _ me _ , he must go . We are not on friendly terms , and it always gives me pain to meet him , but I have no reason for avoiding _ him _ but what I might proclaim to all the world ; a sense of very great ill usage , and most painful regrets at his being what he is . His father , Miss Bennet , the late Mr. Darcy , was one of the best men that ever breathed , and the truest friend I ever had ; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections . His behaviour to myself has been scandalous ; but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing , rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father . "
28514	28527	28528	28528	he	156	" It was the prospect of constant society , and good society , "
28531	28682	28528	28528	he	156	" which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire . I knew it to be a most respectable , agreeable corps , and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters , and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them . Society , I own , is necessary to me . I have been a disappointed man , and my spirits will not bear solitude . I _ must _ have employment and society . A military life is not what I was intended for , but circumstances have now made it eligible . The church _ ought _ to have been my profession -- I was brought up for the church , and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living , had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now . "
28683	28686	28486	28487	the society	864	" Indeed ! "
28687	28753	28528	28528	he	156	" Yes -- the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift . He was my godfather , and excessively attached to me . I can not do justice to his kindness . He meant to provide for me amply , and thought he had done it ; but when the living fell , it was given elsewhere . "
28754	28758	28760	28760	Elizabeth	93	" Good heavens ! "
28762	28782	28760	28760	Elizabeth	93	" but how could _ that _ be?--How could his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress ? "
28783	28972	28528	28528	he	156	" There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law . A man of honour could not have doubted the intention , but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it -- or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation , and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance , imprudence , in short any thing or nothing . Certain it is , that the living became vacant two years ago , exactly as I was of an age to hold it , and that it was given to another man ; and no less certain is it , that I can not accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it . I have a warm , unguarded temper , and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _ of _ him , and _ to _ him , too freely . I can recal nothing worse . But the fact is , that we are very different sort of men , and that he hates me . "
28973	28984	28760	28760	Elizabeth	93	" This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced . "
28985	29023	28528	28528	he	156	" Some time or other he _ will _ be -- but it shall not be by _ me _ . Till I can forget his father , I can never defy or expose _ him _ . "
29042	29046	29048	29048	she	93	" But what , "
29054	29069	29048	29048	she	93	" can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly ? "
29070	29155	29026	29026	him	866	" A thorough , determined dislike of me -- a dislike which I can not but attribute in some measure to jealousy . Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less , his son might have borne with me better ; but his father 's uncommon attachment to me , irritated him I believe very early in life . He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood -- the sort of preference which was often given me . "
29156	29219	29048	29048	she	93	" I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this -- though I have never liked him , I had not thought so very ill of him -- I had supposed him to be despising his fellow - creatures in general , but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge , such injustice , such inhumanity as this ! "
29231	29265	29228	29228	she	867	" I _ do _ remember his boasting one day , at Netherfield , of the implacability of his resentments , of his having an unforgiving temper . His disposition must be dreadful . "
29266	29276	29278	29278	Wickham	156	" I will not trust myself on the subject , "
29280	29291	29278	29278	Wickham	156	" _ I _ can hardly be just to him . "
29305	29325	29292	29292	Elizabeth	93	" To treat in such a manner , the god - son , the friend , the favourite of his father!"--She
29330	29349	29350	29350	she	93	" A young man too , like _ you _ , whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but
29354	29384	29352	29352	herself	93	" And one , too , who had probably been his own companion from childhood , connected together , as I think you said , in the closest manner ! "
29385	29561	29352	29352	herself	93	" We were born in the same parish , within the same park , the greatest part of our youth was passed together ; inmates of the same house , sharing the same amusements , objects of the same parental care . _ My _ father began life in the profession which your uncle , Mr. Philips , appears to do so much credit to -- but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy , and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property . He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy , a most intimate , confidential friend . Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father 's active superintendance , and when immediately before my father 's death , Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me , I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _ him _ , as of affection to myself . "
29562	29566	29568	29568	Elizabeth	93	" How strange ! "
29570	29611	29568	29568	Elizabeth	93	" How abominable!--I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better motive , that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it . "
29612	29617	29352	29352	herself	93	" It _ is _ wonderful,"--replied
29618	29671	29568	29568	Elizabeth	93	Wickham,--"for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend . It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling . But we are none of us consistent ; and in his behaviour to me , there were stronger impulses even than pride . "
29672	29686	29352	29352	herself	93	" Can such abominable pride as his , have ever done him good ? "
29687	29817	29568	29568	Elizabeth	93	" Yes . It has often led him to be liberal and generous,--to give his money freely , to display hospitality , to assist his tenants , and relieve the poor . Family pride , and _ filial _ pride , for he is very proud of what his father was , have done this . Not to appear to disgrace his family , to degenerate from the popular qualities , or lose the influence of the Pemberley House , is a powerful motive . He has also _ brotherly _ pride , which with _ some _ brotherly affection , makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister ; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers . "
29818	29828	29352	29352	herself	93	" What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy ? "
29832	29937	29831	29831	his	868	head.--"I wish I could call her amiable . It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy . But she is too much like her brother,--very , very proud.--As a child , she was affectionate and pleasing , and extremely fond of me ; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement . But she is nothing to me now . She is a handsome girl , about fifteen or sixteen , and I understand highly accomplished . Since her father 's death , her home has been London , where a lady lives with her , and superintends her education . "
29962	30013	30134	30136	The whist party	869	" I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley ! How can Mr. Bingley , who seems good humour itself , and is , I really believe , truly amiable , be in friendship with such a man ? How can they suit each other?--Do you know Mr. Bingley ? "
30014	30019	30134	30136	The whist party	869	" Not at all . "
30020	30041	30134	30136	The whist party	869	" He is a sweet tempered , amiable , charming man . He can not know what Mr. Darcy is . "
30042	30133	30134	30136	The whist party	869	" Probably not;--but Mr. Darcy can please where he chuses . He does not want abilities . He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while . Among those who are at all his equals in consequence , he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous . His pride never deserts him ; but with the rich , he is liberal - minded , just , sincere , rational , honourable , and perhaps agreeable,--allowing something for fortune and figure . "
30234	30242	30244	30244	he	149	" I know very well , madam , "
30246	30311	30244	30244	he	149	" that when persons sit down to a card table , they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object . There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same , but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh , I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters . "
30350	30356	30357	30357	she	93	" Lady Catherine de Bourgh , "
30360	30391	30357	30357	she	93	" has very lately given him a living . I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice , but he certainly has not known her long . "
30392	30420	30329	30329	he	149	" You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters ; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy . "
30421	30451	30357	30357	she	93	" No , indeed , I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine 's connections . I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday . "
30452	30482	30329	30329	he	149	" Her daughter , Miss de Bourgh , will have a very large fortune , and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates . "
30529	30533	30535	30535	she	93	" Mr. Collins , "
30537	30585	30535	30535	she	93	" speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter ; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship , I suspect his gratitude misleads him , and that in spite of her being his patroness , she is an arrogant , conceited woman . "
30586	30598	30600	30600	Wickham	156	" I believe her to be both in a great degree , "
30602	30692	30600	30600	Wickham	156	" I have not seen her for many years , but I very well remember that I never liked her , and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent . She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever ; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune , part from her authoritative manner , and the rest from the pride of her nephew , who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class . "
31042	31047	31049	31049	she	94	" They have both , "
31051	31111	31049	31049	she	94	" been deceived , I dare say , in some way or other , of which we can form no idea . Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other . It is , in short , impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them , without actual blame on either side . "
31112	31160	31364	31364	he	90	" Very true , indeed;--and now , my dear Jane , what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--Do clear _ them _ too , or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody . "
31161	31258	31049	31049	she	94	" Laugh as much as you chuse , but you will not laugh me out of my opinion . My dearest Lizzy , do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy , to be treating his father 's favourite in such a manner,--one , whom his father had promised to provide for.--It is impossible . No man of common humanity , no man who had any value for his character , could be capable of it . Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him ? oh ! no . "
31259	31320	31364	31364	he	90	" I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley 's being imposed on , than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night ; names , facts , every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it be not so , let Mr. Darcy contradict it . Besides , there was truth in his looks . "
31321	31337	31049	31049	she	94	" It is difficult indeed -- it is distressing.--One does not know what to think . "
31338	31349	31364	31364	he	90	" I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think . "
31721	31731	31733	31733	she	98	" While I can have my mornings to myself , "
31735	31777	31733	31733	she	98	" it is enough.--I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements . Society has claims on us all ; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body . "
31876	31889	31891	31891	he	149	" I am by no means of opinion , I assure you , "
31893	31991	31891	31891	he	149	" that a ball of this kind , given by a young man of character , to respectable people , can have any evil tendency ; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening , and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours , Miss Elizabeth , for the two first dances especially,--a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause , and not to any disrespect for her . "
32571	32598	32602	32602	his	156	" I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now , if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here . "
32977	32988	32946	32946	she	93	" I dare say you will find him very agreeable . "
32989	33017	33045	33046	a simpleton	3153	" Heaven forbid!--_That _ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me such an evil . "
33201	33245	33194	33194	she	93	" It is _ your _ turn to say something now , Mr. Darcy.--_I _ talked about the dance , and _ you _ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room , or the number of couples . "
33263	33295	33194	33194	she	93	" Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.--But _ now _ we may be silent . "
33296	33309	33194	33194	she	93	" Do you talk by rule then , while you are dancing ? "
33310	33366	33194	33194	she	93	" Sometimes . One must speak a little , you know . It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together , and yet for the advantage of _ some _ , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible . "
33367	33389	33194	33194	she	93	" Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case , or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine ? "
33390	33393	33395	33395	Elizabeth	93	" Both , "
33398	33453	33395	33395	Elizabeth	93	" for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . "
33454	33470	33472	33472	he	928	" This is no very striking resemblance of your own character , I am sure , "
33474	33499	33472	33472	he	928	" How near it may be to _ mine _ , I can not pretend to say.--_You _ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly . "
33500	33510	33536	33536	her	93	" I must not decide on my own performance . "
33562	33581	33546	33546	She	93	" When you met us there the other day , we had just been forming a new acquaintance . "
33631	33665	33621	33621	Darcy	100	" Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _ making _ friends -- whether he may be equally capable of _ retaining _ them , is less certain . "
33666	33680	33682	33682	Elizabeth	93	" He has been so unlucky as to lose _ your _ friendship , "
33686	33702	33682	33682	Elizabeth	93	" and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life . "
33764	33893	33746	33746	he	91	" I have been most highly gratified indeed , my dear Sir . Such very superior dancing is not often seen . It is evident that you belong to the first circles . Allow me to say , however , that your fair partner does not disgrace you , and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated , especially when a certain desirable event , my dear Miss Eliza , ( glancing at her sister and Bingley , ) shall take place . What congratulations will then flow in ! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you , Sir.--You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady , whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me . "
33956	33971	33947	33947	he	91	" Sir William 's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of . "
33972	34025	33921	33921	his	91	" I do not think we were speaking at all . Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without success , and what we are to talk of next I can not imagine . "
34026	34033	34035	34035	he	91	" What think you of books ? "
34039	34060	33947	33947	he	91	" Books -- Oh ! no.--I am sure we never read the same , or not with the same feelings . "
34061	34091	33947	33947	he	91	" I am sorry you think so ; but if that be the case , there can at least be no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions . "
34092	34116	33947	33947	he	91	" No -- I can not talk of books in a ball - room ; my head is always full of something else . "
34117	34132	34134	34134	he	91	" The _ present _ always occupies you in such scenes -- does it ? "
34142	34147	34148	34148	she	936	" Yes , always , "
34176	34217	34172	34172	her	936	" I remember hearing you once say , Mr. Darcy , that you hardly ever forgave , that your resentment once created was unappeasable . You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its _ being created _ . "
34218	34222	34224	34224	he	91	" I am , "
34231	34242	34172	34172	her	936	" And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice ? "
34243	34248	34172	34172	her	936	" I hope not . "
34249	34271	34172	34172	her	936	" It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion , to be secure of judging properly at first . "
34272	34282	34172	34172	her	936	" May I ask to what these questions tend ? "
34283	34294	34296	34296	she	936	" Merely to the illustration of _ your _ character , "
34305	34314	34296	34296	she	936	" I am trying to make it out . "
34315	34322	34172	34172	her	936	" And what is your success ? "
34328	34349	34325	34325	her	936	" I do not get on at all . I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly . "
34350	34356	34358	34358	he	91	" I can readily believe , "
34361	34409	34358	34358	he	91	" that report may vary greatly with respect to me ; and I could wish , Miss Bennet , that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment , as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either . "
34410	34428	34487	34487	her	936	" But if I do not take your likeness now , I may never have another opportunity . "
34429	34441	34442	34442	he	91	" I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours , "
34526	34779	34498	34498	his	100	" So , Miss Eliza , I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!--Your sister has been talking to me about him , and asking me a thousand questions ; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you , among his other communications , that he was the son of old Wickham , the late Mr. Darcy 's steward . Let me recommend you , however , as a friend , not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions ; for as to Mr. Darcy 's using him ill , it is perfectly false ; for , on the contrary , he has been always remarkably kind to him , though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner . I do not know the particulars , but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame , that he can not bear to hear George Wickham mentioned , and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers , he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way . His coming into the country at all , is a most insolent thing indeed , and I wonder how he could presume to do it . I pity you , Miss Eliza , for this discovery of your favourite 's guilt ; but really considering his descent , one could not expect much better . "
34780	34795	34797	34797	Elizabeth	93	" His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same , "
34800	34838	34797	34797	Elizabeth	93	" for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy 's steward , and of _ that _ , I can assure you , he informed me himself . "
34839	34845	34847	34848	Miss Bingley	102	" I beg your pardon , "
34856	34864	34847	34848	Miss Bingley	102	" Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant . "
34865	34869	34871	34871	Elizabeth	93	" Insolent girl ! "
34873	34908	34847	34848	Miss Bingley	102	herself.--"You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this . I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy . "
34999	35005	35007	35007	she	93	" I want to know , "
35020	35055	35007	35007	she	93	" what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham . But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person ; in which case you may be sure of my pardon . "
35056	35059	35061	35061	Jane	94	" No , "
35063	35188	35061	35061	Jane	94	" I have not forgotten him ; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you . Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history , and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy ; but he will vouch for the good conduct , the probity and honour of his friend , and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received ; and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sister 's , Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man . I am afraid he has been very imprudent , and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy 's regard . "
35189	35199	35007	35007	she	93	" Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself ? "
35200	35214	35061	35061	Jane	94	" No ; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton . "
35215	35242	35007	35007	she	93	" This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy . I am perfectly satisfied . But what does he say of the living ? "
35243	35278	35061	35061	Jane	94	" He does not exactly recollect the circumstances , though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once , but he believes that it was left to him _ conditionally _ only . "
35279	35291	35293	35293	Elizabeth	93	" I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley 's sincerity , "
35296	35361	35293	35293	Elizabeth	93	" but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only . Mr. Bingley 's defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say , but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story , and has learnt the rest from that friend himself , I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before . "
35475	35481	35483	35483	he	149	" I have found out , "
35485	35619	35483	35483	he	149	" by a singular accident , that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness . I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh , and of her mother Lady Catherine . How wonderfully these sort of things occur ! Who would have thought of my meeting with -- perhaps -- a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly!--I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him , which I am now going to do , and trust he will excuse my not having done it before . My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology . "
35620	35632	35693	35693	him	944	" You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy ? "
35633	35680	35483	35483	he	149	" Indeed I am . I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier . I believe him to be Lady Catherine 's _ nephew _ . It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'night . "
35780	35958	35964	35964	he	946	" My dear Miss Elizabeth , I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding , but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity , and those which regulate the clergy ; for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom -- provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained . You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion , which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty . Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice , which on every other subject shall be my constant guide , though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself . "
36031	36034	36027	36027	his	946	" apology , "
36035	36038	36027	36027	his	946	" Hunsford , "
36040	36046	36051	36051	him	946	" Lady Catherine de Bourgh . "--It
36142	36152	36154	36154	he	149	" I have no reason , I assure you , "
36156	36232	36154	36154	he	149	" to be dissatisfied with my reception . Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention . He answered me with the utmost civility , and even paid me the compliment of saying , that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine 's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily . It was really a very handsome thought . Upon the whole , I am much pleased with him . "
36708	36752	36699	36700	Her mother	261	" What is Mr. Darcy to me , pray , that I should be afraid of him ? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _ he _ may not like to hear . "
36753	36784	36797	36798	Her mother	261	" For heaven 's sake , madam , speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr. Darcy?--You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing . "
37196	37222	37189	37189	her	98	" That will do extremely well , child . You have delighted us long enough . Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit . "
37265	37269	37271	37272	Mr. Collins	149	" If I , "
37274	37497	37271	37272	Mr. Collins	149	" were so fortunate as to be able to sing , I should have great pleasure , I am sure , in obliging the company with an air ; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion , and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman.--I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music , for there are certainly other things to be attended to . The rector of a parish has much to do.--In the first place , he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron . He must write his own sermons ; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties , and the care and improvement of his dwelling , which he can not be excused from making as comfortable as possible . And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body , especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment . I can not acquit him of that duty ; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family . "
38142	38150	38129	38129	Lydia	95	" Lord , how tired I am ! "
38486	38521	38478	38478	he	149	" May I hope , Madam , for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth , when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning ? "
38540	38570	38577	38577	she	93	" Oh dear!--Yes -- certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy -- I am sure she can have no objection.--Come , Kitty , I want you up stairs . "
38587	38624	38658	38658	she	93	" Dear Ma'am , do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr . Collins must excuse me.--He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear . I am going away myself . "
38625	38641	38658	38658	she	93	" No , no , nonsense , Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are . "--And
38661	38676	38658	38658	she	93	" Lizzy , I _ insist _ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins . "
38751	38913	38747	38748	Mr. Collins	149	" Believe me , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that your modesty , so far from doing you any disservice , rather adds to your other perfections . You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _ not _ been this little unwillingness ; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mother 's permission for this address . You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse , however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble ; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject , perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying -- and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife , as I certainly did . "
38961	39537	38958	38958	he	149	" My reasons for marrying are , first , that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances ( like myself ) to set the example of matrimony in his parish . Secondly , that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness ; and thirdly -- which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier , that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness . Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion ( unasked too ! ) on this subject ; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford -- between our pools at quadrille , while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh 's foot - stool , that she said , ' Mr. Collins , you must marry . A clergyman like you must marry.--Chuse properly , chuse a gentlewoman for _ my _ sake ; and for your _ own _ , let her be an active , useful sort of person , not brought up high , but able to make a small income go a good way . This is my advice . Find such a woman as soon as you can , bring her to Hunsford , and I will visit her . ' Allow me , by the way , to observe , my fair cousin , that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer . You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe ; and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her , especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite . Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony ; it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood , where I assure you there are many amiable young women . But the fact is , that being , as I am , to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father , ( who , however , may live many years longer , ) I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters , that the loss to them might be as little as possible , when the melancholy event takes place -- which , however , as I have already said , may not be for several years . This has been my motive , my fair cousin , and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem . And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection . To fortune I am perfectly indifferent , and shall make no demand of that nature on your father , since I am well aware that it could not be complied with ; and that one thousand pounds in the 4 per cents . which will not be yours till after your mother 's decease , is all that you may ever be entitled to . On that head , therefore , I shall be uniformly silent ; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married . "
39547	39555	39556	39556	she	1017	" You are too hasty , Sir , "
39559	39614	39556	39556	she	1017	" You forget that I have made no answer . Let me do it without farther loss of time . Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me . I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals , but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them . "
39615	39623	39625	39626	Mr. Collins	149	" I am not now to learn , "
39636	39707	39625	39626	Mr. Collins	149	" that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept , when he first applies for their favour ; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time . I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said , and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long . "
39708	39715	39717	39717	Elizabeth	93	" Upon my word , Sir , "
39719	39832	39717	39717	Elizabeth	93	" your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration . I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies ( if such young ladies there are ) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time . I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _ me _ happy , and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _ you _ so.--Nay , were your friend Lady Catherine to know me , I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation . "
39833	39844	39846	39847	Mr. Collins	149	" Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so , "
39849	39897	39717	39717	Elizabeth	93	gravely--"but I can not imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you . And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty , economy , and other amiable qualifications . "
39898	40009	39717	39717	Elizabeth	93	" Indeed , Mr. Collins , all praise of me will be unnecessary . You must give me leave to judge for myself , and pay me the compliment of believing what I say . I wish you very happy and very rich , and by refusing your hand , do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise . In making me the offer , you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family , and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls , without any self - reproach . This matter may be considered , therefore , as finally settled . "
40032	40122	39717	39717	Elizabeth	93	" When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me ; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present , because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application , and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character . "
40123	40129	40131	40131	Elizabeth	93	" Really , Mr. Collins , "
40136	40179	40131	40131	Elizabeth	93	" you puzzle me exceedingly . If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement , I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one . "
40180	40366	39717	39717	Elizabeth	93	" You must give me leave to flatter myself , my dear cousin , that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course . My reasons for believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance , or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable . My situation in life , my connections with the family of De Bourgh , and my relationship to your own , are circumstances highly in my favour ; and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions , it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you . Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications . As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me , I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females . "
40367	40470	40131	40131	Elizabeth	93	" I do assure you , Sir , that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man . I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere . I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals , but to accept them is absolutely impossible . My feelings in every respect forbid it . Can I speak plainer ? Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you , but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart . "
40471	40477	40479	40479	he	1020	" You are uniformly charming ! "
40488	40515	40479	40479	he	1020	" and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents , my proposals will not fail of being acceptable . "
40777	40786	40787	40787	she	171	" But depend upon it , Mr. Collins , "
40790	40835	40787	40787	she	171	" that Lizzy shall be brought to reason . I will speak to her about it myself directly . She is a very headstrong foolish girl , and does not know her own interest ; but I will _ make _ her know it . "
40836	40845	40847	40848	Mr. Collins	149	" Pardon me for interrupting you , Madam , "
40850	40929	40847	40848	Mr. Collins	149	" but if she is really headstrong and foolish , I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation , who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state . If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit , perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me , because if liable to such defects of temper , she could not contribute much to my felicity . "
40930	40938	40940	40941	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Sir , you quite misunderstand me , "
40945	40993	40940	40941	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these . In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived . I will go directly to Mr. Bennet , and we shall very soon settle it with her , I am sure . "
41018	41074	41078	41078	his	86	" Oh ! Mr. Bennet , you are wanted immediately ; we are all in an uproar . You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins , for she vows she will not have him , and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _ her _ . "
41108	41118	41120	41120	he	86	" I have not the pleasure of understanding you , "
41129	41136	41120	41120	he	86	" Of what are you talking ? "
41137	41166	41084	41084	she	96	" Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy . Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins , and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy . "
41167	41182	41120	41120	he	86	" And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business . "
41183	41201	41084	41084	she	96	" Speak to Lizzy about it yourself . Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him . "
41202	41215	41120	41120	he	86	" Let her be called down . She shall hear my opinion . "
41231	41237	41239	41240	her father	264	" Come here , child , "
41245	41274	41275	41275	Elizabeth	93	" I have sent for you on an affair of importance . I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage . Is it true ? "
41281	41294	41275	41275	Elizabeth	93	" Very well -- and this offer of marriage you have refused ? "
41295	41301	41120	41120	he	86	" I have , Sir . "
41302	41329	41275	41275	Elizabeth	93	" Very well . We now come to the point . Your mother insists upon your accepting it . Is not it so , Mrs. Bennet ? "
41330	41341	41120	41120	he	86	" Yes , or I will never see her again . "
41342	41394	41275	41275	Elizabeth	93	" An unhappy alternative is before you , Elizabeth . From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you again if you do _ not _ marry Mr. Collins , and I will never see you again if you _ do _ . "
41431	41458	41275	41275	Elizabeth	93	" What do you mean , Mr. Bennet , by talking in this way ? You promised me to _ insist _ upon her marrying him . "
41459	41463	41465	41466	her husband	276	" My dear , "
41468	41518	41465	41466	her husband	276	" I have two small favours to request . First , that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion ; and secondly , of my room . I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be . "
41707	41744	41693	41693	Lydia	95	" I am glad you are come , for there is such fun here!--What do you think has happened this morning?--Mr . Collins has made an offer to Lizzy , and she will not have him . "
41818	41827	41828	41828	she	97	" Pray do , my dear Miss Lucas , "
41835	41861	41828	41828	she	97	" for nobody is on my side , nobody takes part with me , I am cruelly used , nobody feels for my poor nerves . "
41875	41882	41884	41885	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Aye , there she comes , "
41887	42078	41884	41885	Mrs. Bennet	96	" looking as unconcerned as may be , and caring no more for us than if we were at York , provided she can have her own way.--But I tell you what , Miss Lizzy , if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way , you will never get a husband at all -- and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead.--_I _ shall not be able to keep you -- and so I warn you.--I have done with you from this very day.--I told you in the library , you know , that I should never speak to you again , and you will find me as good as my word . I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children.--Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body . People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking . Nobody can tell what I suffer!--But it is always so . Those who do not complain are never pitied . "
42145	42177	42139	42139	she	1043	" Now , I do insist upon it , that you , all of you , hold your tongues , and let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together . "
42258	42261	42252	42253	Mrs. Bennet	96	conversation.--"Oh ! Mr. Collins!"--
42262	42267	42269	42269	he	149	" My dear Madam , "
42271	42288	42289	42289	he	149	" let us be for ever silent on this point . Far be it from me , "
42300	42531	42289	42289	he	149	" to resent the behaviour of your daughter . Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all ; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment ; and I trust I am resigned . Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand ; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation . You will not , I hope , consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family , my dear Madam , by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter 's favour , without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf . My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter 's lips instead of your own . But we are all liable to error . I have certainly meant well through the whole affair . My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself , with due consideration for the advantage of all your family , and if my _ manner _ has been at all reprehensible , I here beg leave to apologise . "
42810	42814	42816	42816	he	306	" I found , "
42818	42870	42816	42816	he	306	" as the time drew near , that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room , the same party with him for so many hours together , might be more than I could bear , and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself . "
43110	43162	43102	43102	Jane	94	" This is from Caroline Bingley ; what it contains , has surprised me a good deal . The whole party have left Netherfield by this time , and are on their way to town ; and without any intention of coming back again . You shall hear what she says . "
43214	43285	43327	43327	their	1066	" I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire , except your society , my dearest friend ; but we will hope at some future period , to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known , and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence . I depend on you for that . "
43366	43371	43373	43373	she	93	" It is unlucky , "
43380	43454	43373	43373	she	93	" that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country . But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward , may arrive earlier than she is aware , and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends , will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?--Mr . Bingley will not be detained in London by them . "
43455	43477	43348	43348	she	93	" Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter . I will read it to you-- "
43478	43648	43373	43373	she	93	" When my brother left us yesterday , he imagined that the business which took him to London , might be concluded in three or four days , but as we are certain it can not be so , and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town , he will be in no hurry to leave it again , we have determined on following him thither , that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel . Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter ; I wish I could hear that you , my dearest friend , had any intention of making one in the croud , but of that I despair . I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings , and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three , of whom we shall deprive you . "
43649	43656	43658	43658	Jane	94	" It is evident by this , "
43660	43670	43658	43658	Jane	94	" that he comes back no more this winter . "
43671	43687	43373	43373	she	93	" It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _ should _ . "
43688	43738	43658	43658	Jane	94	" Why will you think so ? It must be his own doing.--He is his own master . But you do not know _ all _ . I _ will _ read you the passage which particularly hurts me . I will have no reserves from _ you _ . "
43739	43953	43373	43373	she	93	" Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister , and to confess the truth , _ we _ are scarcely less eager to meet her again . I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance , and accomplishments ; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself , is heightened into something still more interesting , from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister . I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject , but I will not leave the country without confiding them , and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable . My brother admires her greatly already , he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing , her relations all wish the connection as much as his own , and a sister 's partiality is not misleading me , I think , when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman 's heart . With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it , am I wrong , my dearest Jane , in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ? "
43954	43966	43658	43658	Jane	94	" What think you of _ this _ sentence , my dear Lizzy?"--said
43973	44043	43967	43967	Jane	94	" Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister ; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother 's indifference , and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him , she means ( most kindly ! ) to put me on my guard ? Can there be any other opinion on the subject ? "
44044	44059	43658	43658	Jane	94	" Yes , there can ; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it ? "
44060	44064	43967	43967	Jane	94	" Most willingly . "
44065	44120	43658	43658	Jane	94	" You shall have it in few words . Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you , and wants him to marry Miss Darcy . She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there , and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you . "
44126	44344	43658	43658	Jane	94	" Indeed , Jane , you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you together , can doubt his affection . Miss Bingley I am sure can not . She is not such a simpleton . Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself , she would have ordered her wedding clothes . But the case is this . We are not rich enough , or grand enough for them ; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother , from the notion that when there has been _ one _ intermarriage , she may have less trouble in achieving a second ; in which there is certainly some ingenuity , and I dare say it would succeed , if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way . But , my dearest Jane , you can not seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy , he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _ your _ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday , or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you , he is very much in love with her friend . "
44345	44354	44356	44356	Jane	94	" If we thought alike of Miss Bingley , "
44358	44405	44356	44356	Jane	94	" your representation of all this , might make me quite easy . But I know the foundation is unjust . Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one ; and all that I can hope in this case is , that she is deceived herself . "
44406	44452	44619	44619	his	1073	" That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea , since you will not take comfort in mine . Believe her to be deceived by all means . You have now done your duty by her , and must fret no longer . "
44453	44486	44356	44356	Jane	94	" But , my dear sister , can I be happy , even supposing the best , in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere ? "
44487	44494	44496	44496	Elizabeth	93	" You must decide for yourself , "
44498	44537	44496	44496	Elizabeth	93	" and if upon mature deliberation , you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife , I advise you by all means to refuse him . "
44538	44543	44544	44544	Jane	94	" How can you talk so?"--said
44546	44565	44496	44496	Elizabeth	93	smiling,--"You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation , I could not hesitate . "
44566	44588	44544	44544	Jane	94	" I did not think you would;--and that being the case , I can not consider your situation with much compassion . "
44589	44615	44496	44496	Elizabeth	93	" But if he returns no more this winter , my choice will never be required . A thousand things may arise in six months ! "
44907	44915	44917	44917	she	93	" It keeps him in good humour , "
44919	44932	44917	44917	she	93	" and I am more obliged to you than I can express . "
45884	45889	45890	45890	he	149	" My dear Madam , "
45893	45929	45890	45890	he	149	" this invitation is particularly gratifying , because it is what I have been hoping to receive ; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible . "
45954	45985	45936	45937	Mr. Bennet	86	" But is there not danger of Lady Catherine 's disapprobation here , my good sir?--You had better neglect your relations , than run the risk of offending your patroness . "
45986	45991	45993	45994	Mr. Collins	149	" My dear sir , "
45996	46026	45993	45994	Mr. Collins	149	" I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution , and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship 's concurrence . "
46027	46086	45936	45937	Mr. Bennet	86	" You can not be too much on your guard . Risk any thing rather than her displeasure ; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again , which I should think exceedingly probable , stay quietly at home , and be satisfied that _ we _ shall take no offence . "
46087	46177	46181	46182	the ladies	269	" Believe me , my dear sir , my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention ; and depend upon it , you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this , as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire . As for my fair cousins , though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary , I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness , not excepting my cousin Elizabeth . "
46400	46410	46393	46393	she	114	" Engaged to Mr. Collins ! my dear Charlotte,--impossible ! "
46459	46499	46449	46449	she	103	" Why should you be surprised , my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman 's good opinion , because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ? "
46544	46552	46449	46449	she	103	" I see what you are feeling , "
46554	46653	46667	46671	the rest of the family	894	Charlotte,--"you must be surprised , very much surprised,--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you . But when you have had time to think it all over , I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done . I am not romantic you know . I never was . I ask only a comfortable home ; and considering Mr. Collins 's character , connections , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair , as most people can boast on entering the marriage state . "
46657	46658	46654	46654	Elizabeth	93	" Undoubtedly;"--and
46940	46965	46929	46929	Lydia	95	" Good Lord ! Sir William , how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy ? "
48418	48424	48426	48426	she	114	" Indeed , Mr. Bennet , "
48428	48470	48426	48426	she	114	" it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house , that I should be forced to make way for _ her _ , and live to see her take my place in it ! "
48471	48504	48524	48524	she	114	" My dear , do not give way to such gloomy thoughts . Let us hope for better things . Let us flatter ourselves that _ I _ may be the survivor . "
48530	48558	48524	48524	she	114	" I can not bear to think that they should have all this estate . If it was not for the entail I should not mind it . "
48559	48566	48524	48524	she	114	" What should not you mind ? "
48567	48577	48524	48524	she	114	" I should not mind any thing at all . "
48578	48594	48524	48524	she	114	" Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility . "
48595	48654	48524	48524	she	114	" I never can be thankful , Mr. Bennet , for any thing about the entail . How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one 's own daughters I can not understand ; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!--Why should _ he _ have it more than anybody else ? "
48655	48664	48666	48667	Mr. Bennet	86	" I leave it to yourself to determine , "
48697	48702	48694	48700	the Author of " Sense and Sensibility	3832	" Sense and Sensibility . "
49226	49284	49220	49220	she	94	" Oh ! that my dear mother had more command over herself ; she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him . But I will not repine . It can not last long . He will be forgot , and we shall all be as we were before . "
49298	49303	49305	49305	Jane	94	" You doubt me , "
49310	49376	49305	49305	Jane	94	" indeed you have no reason . He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance , but that is all . I have nothing either to hope or fear , and nothing to reproach him with . Thank God ! I have not _ that _ pain . A little time therefore.--I shall certainly try to get the better . "
49385	49420	49381	49381	she	94	" I have this comfort immediately , that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side , and that it has done no harm to any one but myself . "
49421	49426	49428	49428	Elizabeth	93	" My dear Jane ! "
49430	49472	49428	49428	Elizabeth	93	" you are too good . Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic ; I do not know what to say to you . I feel as if I had never done you justice , or loved you as you deserve . "
49493	49496	49498	49498	Elizabeth	93	" Nay , "
49500	49671	49498	49498	Elizabeth	93	" this is not fair . _ You _ wish to think all the world respectable , and are hurt if I speak ill of any body . _ I _ only want to think _ you _ perfect , and you set yourself against it . Do not be afraid of my running into any excess , of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will . You need not . There are few people whom I really love , and still fewer of whom I think well . The more I see of the world , the more am I dissatisfied with it ; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters , and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense . I have met with two instances lately ; one I will not mention ; the other is Charlotte 's marriage . It is unaccountable ! in every view it is unaccountable ! "
49672	49767	49487	49488	her sister	348	" My dear Lizzy , do not give way to such feelings as these . They will ruin your happiness . You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper . Consider Mr. Collins 's respectability , and Charlotte 's prudent , steady character . Remember that she is one of a large family ; that as to fortune , it is a most eligible match ; and be ready to believe , for every body 's sake , that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin . "
49768	49935	49498	49498	Elizabeth	93	" To oblige you , I would try to believe almost any thing , but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this ; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him , I should only think worse of her understanding , than I now do of her heart . My dear Jane , Mr. Collins is a conceited , pompous , narrow - minded , silly man ; you know he is , as well as I do ; and you must feel , as well as I do , that the woman who marries him , can not have a proper way of thinking . You shall not defend her , though it is Charlotte Lucas . You shall not , for the sake of one individual , change the meaning of principle and integrity , nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me , that selfishness is prudence , and insensibility of danger , security for happiness . "
49936	49949	49951	49951	Jane	94	" I must think your language too strong in speaking of both , "
49953	50074	49951	49951	Jane	94	" and I hope you will be convinced of it , by seeing them happy together . But enough of this . You alluded to something else . You mentioned _ two _ instances . I can not misunderstand you , but I intreat you , dear Lizzy , not to pain me by thinking _ that person _ to blame , and saying your opinion of him is sunk . We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured . We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect . It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us . Women fancy admiration means more than it does . "
50075	50084	49498	49498	Elizabeth	93	" And men take care that they should . "
50085	50117	49951	49951	Jane	94	" If it is designedly done , they can not be justified ; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine . "
50118	50134	50136	50136	Elizabeth	93	" I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley 's conduct to design , "
50138	50184	50136	50136	Elizabeth	93	" but without scheming to do wrong , or to make others unhappy , there may be error , and there may be misery . Thoughtlessness , want of attention to other people 's feelings , and want of resolution , will do the business . "
50185	50196	49498	49498	Elizabeth	93	" And do you impute it to either of those ? "
50197	50230	50136	50136	Elizabeth	93	" Yes ; to the last . But if I go on , I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem . Stop me whilst you can . "
50231	50244	49498	49498	Elizabeth	93	" You persist , then , in supposing his sisters influence him . "
50245	50254	50136	50136	Elizabeth	93	" Yes , in conjunction with his friend . "
50255	50292	49498	49498	Elizabeth	93	" I can not believe it . Why should they try to influence him ? They can only wish his happiness , and if he is attached to me , no other woman can secure it . "
50293	50341	50136	50136	Elizabeth	93	" Your first position is false . They may wish many things besides his happiness ; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence ; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money , great connections , and pride . "
50342	50358	50360	50360	Jane	94	" Beyond a doubt , they _ do _ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy , "
50362	50544	50360	50360	Jane	94	" but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing . They have known her much longer than they have known me ; no wonder if they love her better . But , whatever may be their own wishes , it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother 's . What sister would think herself at liberty to do it , unless there were something very objectionable ? If they believed him attached to me , they would not try to part us ; if he were so , they could not succeed . By supposing such an affection , you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong , and me most unhappy . Do not distress me by the idea . I am not ashamed of having been mistaken -- or , at least , it is slight , it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters . Let me take it in the best light , in the light in which it may be understood . "
50699	50704	50706	50706	he	86	" So , Lizzy , "
50710	50820	50706	50706	he	86	" your sister is crossed in love I find . I congratulate her . Next to being married , a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then . It is something to think of , and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions . When is your turn to come ? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane . Now is your time . Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country . Let Wickham be _ your _ man . He is a pleasant fellow , and would jilt you creditably . "
50821	50846	50930	50931	general unreserve	1194	" Thank you , Sir , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . We must not all expect Jane 's good fortune . "
50847	50850	50852	50853	Mr. Bennet	86	" True , "
50855	50887	50852	50853	Mr. Bennet	86	" but it is a comfort to think that , whatever of that kind may befal you , you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it . "
51404	51411	51412	51412	she	141	" I do not blame Jane , "
51415	51601	51412	51412	she	141	" for Jane would have got Mr. Bingley , if she could . But , Lizzy ! Oh , sister ! it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins 's wife by this time , had not it been for her own perverseness . He made her an offer in this very room , and she refused him . The consequence of it is , that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have , and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever . The Lucases are very artful people indeed , sister . They are all for what they can get . I am sorry to say it of them , but so it is . It makes me very nervous and poorly , to be thwarted so in my own family , and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else . However , your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts , and I am very glad to hear what you tell us , of long sleeves . "
51659	51672	51674	51674	she	141	" It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane , "
51676	51736	51674	51674	she	141	" I am sorry it went off . But these things happen so often ! A young man , such as you describe Mr. Bingley , so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks , and when accident separates them , so easily forgets her , that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent . "
51737	51745	51747	51747	Elizabeth	93	" An excellent consolation in its way , "
51749	51808	51747	51747	Elizabeth	93	" but it will not do for _ us _ . We do not suffer by _ accident _ . It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl , whom he was violently in love with only a few days before . "
51809	51874	51652	51652	she	141	" But that expression of ' violently in love ' is so hackneyed , so doubtful , so indefinite , that it gives me very little idea . It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half - hour 's acquaintance , as to a real , strong attachment . Pray , how _ violent was _ Mr. Bingley 's love ? "
51875	51959	51747	51747	Elizabeth	93	" I never saw a more promising inclination . He was growing quite inattentive to other people , and wholly engrossed by her . Every time they met , it was more decided and remarkable . At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies , by not asking them to dance , and I spoke to him twice myself , without receiving an answer . Could there be finer symptoms ? Is not general incivility the very essence of love ? "
51960	52059	51652	51652	she	141	" Oh , yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt . Poor Jane ! I am sorry for her , because , with her disposition , she may not get over it immediately . It had better have happened to _ you _ , Lizzy ; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner . But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us ? Change of scene might be of service -- and perhaps a little relief from home , may be as useful as anything . "
52078	52082	52084	52085	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" I hope , "
52087	52150	52084	52085	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her . We live in so different a part of town , all our connections are so different , and , as you well know , we go out so little , that it is very improbable they should meet at all , unless he really comes to see her . "
52151	52253	52072	52073	her sister	348	" And _ that _ is quite impossible ; for he is now in the custody of his friend , and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London ! My dear aunt , how could you think of it ? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _ heard _ of such a place as Gracechurch Street , but he would hardly think a month 's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities , were he once to enter it ; and depend upon it , Mr. Bingley never stirs without him . "
52254	52289	52084	52085	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" So much the better . I hope they will not meet at all . But does not Jane correspond with the sister ? _ She _ will not be able to help calling . "
52290	52298	52072	52073	her sister	348	" She will drop the acquaintance entirely . "
52886	53046	52881	52881	she	141	" You are too sensible a girl , Lizzy , to fall in love merely because you are warned against it ; and , therefore , I am not afraid of speaking openly . Seriously , I would have you be on your guard . Do not involve yourself , or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent . I have nothing to say against _ him _ ; he is a most interesting young man ; and if he had the fortune he ought to have , I should think you could not do better . But as it is -- you must not let your fancy run away with you . You have sense , and we all expect you to use it . Your father would depend on _ your _ resolution and good conduct , I am sure . You must not disappoint your father . "
53047	53058	52881	52881	she	141	" My dear aunt , this is being serious indeed . "
53059	53073	52881	52881	she	141	" Yes , and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise . "
53074	53115	52881	52881	she	141	" Well , then , you need not be under any alarm . I will take care of myself , and of Mr. Wickham too . He shall not be in love with me , if I can prevent it . "
53116	53125	52881	52881	she	141	" Elizabeth , you are not serious now . "
53126	53377	52881	52881	she	141	" I beg your pardon . I will try again . At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham ; no , I certainly am not . But he is , beyond all comparison , the most agreeable man I ever saw -- and if he becomes really attached to me -- I believe it will be better that he should not . I see the imprudence of it.--Oh ! _ that _ abominable Mr. Darcy!--My father 's opinion of me does me the greatest honour ; and I should be miserable to forfeit it . My father , however , is partial to Mr. Wickham . In short , my dear aunt , I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy ; but since we see every day that where there is affection , young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune , from entering into engagements with each other , how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted , or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist ? All that I can promise you , therefore , is not to be in a hurry . I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object . When I am in company with him , I will not be wishing . In short , I will do my best . "
53378	53411	53525	53525	she	93	" Perhaps it will be as well , if you discourage his coming here so very often . At least , you should not _ remind _ your Mother of inviting him . "
53412	53420	53422	53422	Elizabeth	93	" As I did the other day , "
53429	53519	53422	53422	Elizabeth	93	" very true , it will be wise in me to refrain from _ that _ . But do not imagine that he is always here so often . It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week . You know my mother 's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends . But really , and upon my honour , I will try to do what I think to be wisest ; and now , I hope you are satisfied . "
53631	53640	53630	53630	she	96	" _ wished _ they might be happy . "
53702	53715	53671	53672	her mother	261	" I shall depend on hearing from you very often , Eliza . "
53716	53724	53671	53672	her mother	261	" _ That _ you certainly shall . "
53725	53741	53671	53672	her mother	261	" And I have another favour to ask . Will you come and see me ? "
53742	53754	53671	53672	her mother	261	" We shall often meet , I hope , in Hertfordshire . "
53755	53777	53671	53672	her mother	261	" I am not likely to leave Kent for some time . Promise me , therefore , to come to Hunsford . "
53792	53805	53807	53807	Charlotte	114	" My father and Maria are to come to me in March , "
53809	53838	53807	53807	Charlotte	114	" and I hope you will consent to be of the party . Indeed , Eliza , you will be as welcome to me as either of them . "
54190	54194	54195	54195	she	94	" My aunt , "
54198	54224	54195	54195	she	94	" is going to - morrow into that part of the town , and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor - street . "
54241	54250	54252	54252	her	94	" I did not think Caroline in spirits , "
54255	54363	54252	54252	her	94	" but she was very glad to see me , and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London . I was right , therefore ; my last letter had never reached her . I enquired after their brother , of course . He was well , but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy , that they scarcely ever saw him . I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner . I wish I could see her . My visit was not long , as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out . I dare say I shall soon see them here . "
54499	55069	54484	54484	she	94	" My dearest Lizzy will , I am sure , be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment , at my expence , when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley 's regard for me . But , my dear sister , though the event has proved you right , do not think me obstinate if I still assert , that , considering what her behaviour was , my confidence was as natural as your suspicion . I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me , but if the same circumstances were to happen again , I am sure I should be deceived again . Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday ; and not a note , not a line , did I receive in the mean time . When she did come , it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it ; she made a slight , formal , apology , for not calling before , said not a word of wishing to see me again , and was in every respect so altered a creature , that when she went away , I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer . I pity , though I can not help blaming her . She was very wrong in singling me out as she did ; I can safely say , that every advance to intimacy began on her side . But I pity her , because she must feel that she has been acting wrong , and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it . I need not explain myself farther ; and though _ we _ know this anxiety to be quite needless , yet if she feels it , it will easily account for her behaviour to me ; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister , whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf , is natural and amiable . I can not but wonder , however , at her having any such fears now , because , if he had at all cared about me , we must have met long , long ago . He knows of my being in town , I am certain , from something she said herself ; and yet it should seem by her manner of talking , as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy . I can not understand it . If I were not afraid of judging harshly , I should be almost tempted to say , that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this . But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought , and think only of what will make me happy , your affection , and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt . Let me hear from you very soon . Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again , of giving up the house , but not with any certainty . We had better not mention it . I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford . Pray go to see them , with Sir William and Maria . I am sure you will be very comfortable there . "
55070	55076	54496	54496	she	94	" Your 's , & c. "
55412	55614	55409	55409	she	141	on:--"I am now convinced , my dear aunt , that I have never been much in love ; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion , I should at present detest his very name , and wish him all manner of evil . But my feelings are not only cordial towards _ him _ ; they are even impartial towards Miss King . I can not find out that I hate her at all , or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl . There can be no love in all this . My watchfulness has been effectual ; and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance , were I distractedly in love with him , I can not say that I regret my comparative insignificance . Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly . Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do . They are young in the ways of the world , and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on , as well as the plain . "
56433	56440	56441	56441	she	141	" But , my dear Elizabeth , "
56444	56463	56441	56441	she	141	" what sort of girl is Miss King ? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary . "
56464	56539	56426	56426	her	1304	" Pray , my dear aunt , what is the difference in matrimonial affairs , between the mercenary and the prudent motive ? Where does discretion end , and avarice begin ? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me , because it would be imprudent ; and now , because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds , you want to find out that he is mercenary . "
56540	56562	56441	56441	she	141	" If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is , I shall know what to think . "
56563	56583	56426	56426	her	1304	" She is a very good kind of girl , I believe . I know no harm of her . "
56584	56606	56441	56441	she	141	" But he paid her not the smallest attention , till her grandfather 's death made her mistress of this fortune . "
56607	56658	56426	56426	her	1304	" No -- why should he ? If it was not allowable for him to gain _ my _ affections , because I had no money , what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about , and who was equally poor ? "
56659	56677	56441	56441	she	141	" But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her , so soon after this event . "
56678	56714	56426	56426	her	1304	" A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe . If _ she _ does not object to it , why should _ we _ ? "
56715	56743	56441	56441	she	141	" _ Her _ not objecting , does not justify _ him _ . It only shews her being deficient in something herself -- sense or feeling . "
56744	56747	56749	56749	Elizabeth	93	" Well , "
56751	56773	56749	56749	Elizabeth	93	" have it as you choose . _ He _ shall be mercenary , and _ she _ shall be foolish . "
56774	56812	56441	56441	she	141	" No , Lizzy , that is what I do _ not _ choose . I should be sorry , you know , to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire . "
56813	56899	56749	56749	Elizabeth	93	" Oh ! if that is all , I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire ; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better . I am sick of them all . Thank Heaven ! I am going to - morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality , who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him . Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing , after all . "
56900	56913	56441	56441	she	141	" Take care , Lizzy ; that speech savours strongly of disappointment . "
56952	56965	56967	56968	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us , "
56970	56977	56967	56968	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" but perhaps to the Lakes . "
57000	57007	57008	57008	she	1306	" My dear , dear aunt , "
57012	57152	57008	57008	she	1306	" what delight ! what felicity ! You give me fresh life and vigour . Adieu to disappointment and spleen . What are men to rocks and mountains ? Oh ! what hours of transport we shall spend ! And when we _ do _ return , it shall not be like other travellers , without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing . We _ will _ know where we have gone -- we _ will _ recollect what we have seen . Lakes , mountains , and rivers , shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations ; nor , when we attempt to describe any particular scene , will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation . Let _ our _ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers . "
58042	58187	58035	58036	Mr. Collins	149	" Yes , Miss Elizabeth , you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church , and I need not say you will be delighted with her . She is all affability and condescension , and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over . I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here . Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming . We dine at Rosings twice every week , and are never allowed to walk home . Her ladyship 's carriage is regularly ordered for us . I _ should _ say , one of her ladyship 's carriages , for she has several . "
58188	58200	58202	58202	Charlotte	114	" Lady Catherine is a very respectable , sensible woman indeed , "
58204	58211	58202	58202	Charlotte	114	" and a most attentive neighbour . "
58212	58242	58035	58036	Mr. Collins	149	" Very true , my dear , that is exactly what I say . She is the sort of woman whom one can not regard with too much deference . "
58432	58478	58395	58395	somebody	3579	" Oh , my dear Eliza ! pray make haste and come into the dining - room , for there is such a sight to be seen ! I will not tell you what it is . Make haste , and come down this moment . "
58527	58533	58535	58535	Elizabeth	93	" And is this all ? "
58537	58562	58535	58535	Elizabeth	93	" I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden , and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter ! "
58563	58569	58571	58571	Maria	105	" La ! my dear , "
58578	58628	58571	58571	Maria	105	" it is not Lady Catherine . The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson , who lives with them . The other is Miss De Bourgh . Only look at her . She is quite a little creature . Who would have thought she could be so thin and small ! "
58629	58652	58535	58535	Elizabeth	93	" She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind . Why does she not come in ? "
58653	58677	58571	58571	Maria	105	" Oh ! Charlotte says , she hardly ever does . It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in . "
58678	58684	58686	58686	Elizabeth	93	" I like her appearance , "
58693	58717	58686	58686	Elizabeth	93	" She looks sickly and cross.--Yes , she will do for him very well . She will make him a very proper wife . "
58914	58918	58920	58920	he	149	" I confess , "
58922	59005	58920	58920	he	149	" that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyship 's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings . I rather expected , from my knowledge of her affability , that it would happen . But who could have foreseen such an attention as this ? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there ( an invitation moreover including the whole party ) so immediately after your arrival ! "
59006	59017	59019	59020	Sir William	91	" I am the less surprised at what has happened , "
59022	59060	59019	59020	Sir William	91	" from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are , which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire . About the Court , such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon . "
59129	59214	59124	59124	he	149	" Do not make yourself uneasy , my dear cousin , about your apparel . Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us , which becomes herself and daughter . I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest , there is no occasion for any thing more . Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed . She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved . "
60447	60465	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" Your father 's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins , I think . For your sake , "
60470	60509	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" I am glad of it ; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh 's family.--Do you play and sing , Miss Bennet ? "
60510	60514	60425	60426	her mother	261	" A little . "
60515	60553	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" Oh ! then -- some time or other we shall be happy to hear you . Our instrument is a capital one , probably superior to----You shall try it some day.--Do your sisters play and sing ? "
60554	60560	60425	60426	her mother	261	" One of them does . "
60561	60594	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" Why did not you all learn?--You ought all to have learned . The Miss Webbs all play , and their father has not so good an income as your's.--Do you draw ? "
60595	60602	60425	60426	her mother	261	" No , not at all . "
60603	60610	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" What , none of you ? "
60611	60615	60425	60426	her mother	261	" Not one . "
60616	60646	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" That is very strange . But I suppose you had no opportunity . Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters . "
60647	60662	60425	60426	her mother	261	" My mother would have had no objection , but my father hates London . "
60663	60670	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" Has your governess left you ? "
60671	60678	60425	60426	her mother	261	" We never had any governess . "
60679	60716	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" No governess ! How was that possible ? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess!--I never heard of such a thing . Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education . "
60734	60755	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" Then , who taught you ? who attended to you ? Without a governess you must have been neglected . "
60756	60807	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" Compared with some families , I believe we were ; but such of us as wished to learn , never wanted the means . We were always encouraged to read , and had all the masters that were necessary . Those who chose to be idle , certainly might . "
60808	60995	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" Aye , no doubt ; but that is what a governess will prevent , and if I had known your mother , I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one . I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction , and nobody but a governess can give it . It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way . I am always glad to get a young person well placed out . Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means ; and it was but the other day , that I recommended another young person , who was merely accidentally mentioned to me , and the family are quite delighted with her . Mrs. Collins , did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe 's calling yesterday to thank me ? She finds Miss Pope a treasure . ' Lady Catherine , ' said she , ' you have given me a treasure . ' Are any of your younger sisters out , Miss Bennet ? "
60996	61003	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" Yes , Ma'am , all . "
61004	61034	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" All!--What , all five out at once ? Very odd!--And you only the second.--The younger ones out before the elder are married!--Your younger sisters must be very young ? "
61035	61141	60443	60443	Catherine	97	" Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . Perhaps _ she _ is full young to be much in company . But really , Ma'am , I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters , that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.--The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth , as the first . And to be kept back on _ such _ a motive!--I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind . "
61142	61147	61149	61150	her Ladyship	677	" Upon my word , "
61152	61170	61149	61150	her Ladyship	677	" you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person.--Pray , what is your age ? "
61171	61179	61181	61181	Elizabeth	93	" With three younger sisters grown up , "
61184	61195	61181	61181	Elizabeth	93	" your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it . "
61229	61248	61263	61263	them	311	" You can not be more than twenty , I am sure,--therefore you need not conceal your age . "
61249	61257	61263	61263	them	311	" I am not one and twenty . "
62690	62717	62751	62757	Colonel Fitzwilliam , who led the way	1491	" I may thank you , Eliza , for this piece of civility . Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me . "
62924	62945	62907	62907	She	93	" My eldest sister has been in town these three months . Have you never happened to see her there ? "
63392	63424	63384	63384	she	677	" What is that you are saying , Fitzwilliam ? What is it you are talking of ? What are you telling Miss Bennet ? Let me hear what it is . "
63425	63434	63436	63436	he	100	" We are speaking of music , Madam , "
63447	63552	63384	63384	she	677	" Of music ! Then pray speak aloud . It is of all subjects my delight . I must have my share in the conversation , if you are speaking of music . There are few people in England , I suppose , who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , or a better natural taste . If I had ever learnt , I should have been a great proficient . And so would Anne , if her health had allowed her to apply . I am confident that she would have performed delightfully . How does Georgiana get on , Darcy ? "
63565	63579	63581	63582	Lady Catherine	97	" I am very glad to hear such a good account of her , "
63584	63609	63581	63582	Lady Catherine	97	" and pray tell her from me , that she can not expect to excel , if she does not practise a great deal . "
63610	63617	63618	63618	he	100	" I assure you , Madam , "
63621	63635	63618	63618	he	100	" that she does not need such advice . She practises very constantly . "
63636	63769	63581	63582	Lady Catherine	97	" So much the better . It can not be done too much ; and when I next write to her , I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account . I often tell young ladies , that no excellence in music is to be acquired , without constant practice . I have told Miss Bennet several times , that she will never play really well , unless she practises more ; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument , she is very welcome , as I have often told her , to come to Rosings every day , and play on the piano - forte in Mrs. Jenkinson 's room . She would be in nobody 's way , you know , in that part of the house . "
63902	63968	63880	63880	he	100	" You mean to frighten me , Mr. Darcy , by coming in all this state to hear me ? But I will not be alarmed though your sister _ does _ play so well . There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others . My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me . "
63969	63979	63980	63980	he	100	" I shall not say that you are mistaken , "
63983	64030	63980	63980	he	100	" because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you ; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know , that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own . "
64046	64167	64031	64031	Elizabeth	93	" Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me , and teach you not to believe a word I say . I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character , in a part of the world , where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit . Indeed , Mr. Darcy , it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire -- and , give me leave to say , very impolitic too -- for it is provoking me to retaliate , and such things may come out , as will shock your relations to hear . "
64168	64176	64178	64178	he	1526	" I am not afraid of you , "
64182	64195	64197	64198	Colonel Fitzwilliam	192	" Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of , "
64200	64212	64197	64198	Colonel Fitzwilliam	192	" I should like to know how he behaves among strangers . "
64213	64319	64031	64031	Elizabeth	93	" You shall hear then -- but prepare yourself for something very dreadful . The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire , you must know , was at a ball -- and at this ball , what do you think he did ? He danced only four dances ! I am sorry to pain you -- but so it was . He danced only four dances , though gentlemen were scarce ; and , to my certain knowledge , more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner . Mr. Darcy , you can not deny the fact . "
64320	64341	64197	64198	Colonel Fitzwilliam	192	" I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party . "
64342	64373	64031	64031	Elizabeth	93	" True ; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room . Well , Colonel Fitzwilliam , what do I play next ? My fingers wait your orders . "
64374	64377	64379	64379	Darcy	100	" Perhaps , "
64381	64405	64379	64379	Darcy	100	" I should have judged better , had I sought an introduction , but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers . "
64406	64417	64419	64419	Elizabeth	93	" Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this ? "
64426	64456	64419	64419	Elizabeth	93	" Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education , and who has lived in the world , is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ? "
64457	64464	64466	64466	Fitzwilliam	192	" I can answer your question , "
64468	64485	64466	64466	Fitzwilliam	192	" without applying to him . It is because he will not give himself the trouble . "
64486	64498	64500	64500	Darcy	100	" I certainly have not the talent which some people possess , "
64502	64536	64500	64500	Darcy	100	" of conversing easily with those I have never seen before . I can not catch their tone of conversation , or appear interested in their concerns , as I often see done . "
64537	64541	64543	64543	Elizabeth	93	" My fingers , "
64545	64628	64543	64543	Elizabeth	93	" do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women 's do . They have not the same force or rapidity , and do not produce the same expression . But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault -- because I would not take the trouble of practising . It is not that I do not believe _ my _ fingers as capable as any other woman 's of superior execution . "
64634	64672	64629	64629	Darcy	100	" You are perfectly right . You have employed your time much better . No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you , can think any thing wanting . We neither of us perform to strangers . "
64715	64775	64698	64699	Lady Catherine	97	" Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss , if she practised more , and could have the advantage of a London master . She has a very good notion of fingering , though her taste is not equal to Anne 's . Anne would have been a delightful performer , had her health allowed her to learn . "
65112	65175	65109	65109	she	93	" How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November , Mr. Darcy ! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon ; for , if I recollect right , he went but the day before . He and his sisters were well , I hope , when you left London . "
65176	65184	65109	65109	she	93	" Perfectly so -- I thank you . "
65205	65225	65109	65109	she	93	" I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again ? "
65226	65273	65109	65109	she	93	" I have never heard him say so ; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future . He has many friends , and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing . "
65274	65349	65109	65109	she	93	" If he means to be but little at Netherfield , it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely , for then we might possibly get a settled family there . But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own , and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle . "
65350	65357	65359	65359	Darcy	100	" I should not be surprised , "
65361	65378	65359	65359	Darcy	100	" if he were to give it up , as soon as any eligible purchase offers . "
65426	65454	65416	65416	He	1540	" This seems a very comfortable house . Lady Catherine , I believe , did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford . "
65455	65478	65359	65359	Darcy	100	" I believe she did -- and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object . "
65479	65492	65416	65416	He	1540	" Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife . "
65493	65580	65359	65359	Darcy	100	" Yes , indeed ; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him , or have made him happy if they had . My friend has an excellent understanding -- though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did . She seems perfectly happy , however , and in a prudential light , it is certainly a very good match for her . "
65581	65604	65416	65416	He	1540	" It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends . "
65605	65620	65359	65359	Darcy	100	" An easy distance do you call it ? It is nearly fifty miles . "
65621	65652	65416	65416	He	1540	" And what is fifty miles of good road ? Little more than half a day 's journey . Yes , I call it a _ very _ easy distance . "
65653	65672	65674	65674	Elizabeth	93	" I should never have considered the distance as one of the _ advantages _ of the match , "
65676	65692	65674	65674	Elizabeth	93	" I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled _ near _ her family . "
65693	65721	65723	65723	he	1542	" It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire . Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn , I suppose , would appear far . "
65758	65866	65755	65755	she	93	" I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family . The far and the near must be relative , and depend on many varying circumstances . Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant , distance becomes no evil . But that is not the case _ here _ . Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income , but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys -- and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _ near _ her family under less than _ half _ the present distance . "
65880	65907	65867	65868	Mr. Darcy	100	" _ You _ can not have a right to such very strong local attachment . _ You _ can not have been always at Longbourn . "
65946	65953	65920	65920	he	100	" Are you pleased with Kent ? "
66029	66038	66040	66040	Charlotte	114	" What can be the meaning of this ! "
66049	66074	66040	66040	Charlotte	114	" My dear Eliza he must be in love with you , or he would never have called on us in this familiar way . "
67035	67048	67032	67032	she	93	" I did not know before that you ever walked this way . "
67049	67060	67061	67061	he	100	" I have been making the tour of the Park , "
67064	67090	67061	67061	he	100	" as I generally do every year , and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage . Are you going much farther ? "
67091	67102	67032	67032	she	93	" No , I should have turned in a moment . "
67117	67126	67128	67128	she	93	" Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday ? "
67130	67158	67032	67032	she	93	" Yes -- if Darcy does not put it off again . But I am at his disposal . He arranges the business just as he pleases . "
67159	67205	67105	67105	she	93	" And if not able to please himself in the arrangement , he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice . I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy . "
67206	67217	67219	67220	Colonel Fitzwilliam	192	" He likes to have his own way very well , "
67222	67276	67219	67220	Colonel Fitzwilliam	192	" But so we all do . It is only that he has better means of having it than many others , because he is rich , and many others are poor . I speak feelingly . A younger son , you know , must be inured to self - denial and dependence . "
67277	67336	67105	67105	she	93	" In my opinion , the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either . Now , seriously , what have you ever known of self - denial and dependence ? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose , or procuring any thing you had a fancy for ? "
67337	67384	67219	67220	Colonel Fitzwilliam	192	" These are home questions -- and perhaps I can not say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature . But in matters of greater weight , I may suffer from the want of money . Younger sons can not marry where they like . "
67385	67402	67105	67105	she	93	" Unless where they like women of fortune , which I think they very often do . "
67403	67434	67219	67220	Colonel Fitzwilliam	192	" Our habits of expence make us too dependant , and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money . "
67435	67439	67441	67441	Elizabeth	93	" Is this , "
67443	67448	67441	67441	Elizabeth	93	" meant for me ? "
67467	67502	67459	67459	herself	93	" And pray , what is the usual price of an Earl 's younger son ? Unless the elder brother is very sickly , I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds . "
67537	67605	67532	67532	she	93	" I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal . I wonder he does not marry , to secure a lasting convenience of that kind . But , perhaps his sister does as well for the present , and , as she is under his sole care , he may do what he likes with her . "
67606	67609	67611	67612	Colonel Fitzwilliam	192	" No , "
67614	67638	67611	67612	Colonel Fitzwilliam	192	" that is an advantage which he must divide with me . I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy . "
67639	67695	67713	67713	he	192	" Are you , indeed ? And pray what sort of guardians do you make ? Does your charge give you much trouble ? Young ladies of her age , are sometimes a little difficult to manage , and if she has the true Darcy spirit , she may like to have her own way . "
67747	67809	67713	67713	he	192	" You need not be frightened . I never heard any harm of her ; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world . She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance , Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley . I think I have heard you say that you know them . "
67810	67836	67713	67713	he	192	" I know them a little . Their brother is a pleasant gentleman - like man -- he is a great friend of Darcy 's . "
67837	67842	67713	67713	he	192	" Oh ! yes , "
67845	67865	67713	67713	he	192	drily--"Mr . Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley , and takes a prodigious deal of care of him . "
67866	67941	67713	67713	he	192	" Care of him!--Yes , I really believe Darcy _ does _ take care of him in those points where he most wants care . From something that he told me in our journey hither , I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him . But I ought to beg his pardon , for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant . It was all conjecture . "
67942	67949	67713	67713	he	192	" What is it you mean ? "
67950	67987	67713	67713	he	192	" It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known , because if it were to get round to the lady 's family , it would be an unpleasant thing . "
67988	67998	67713	67713	he	192	" You may depend upon my not mentioning it . "
67999	68090	67713	67713	he	192	" And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley . What he told me was merely this ; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage , but without mentioning names or any other particulars , and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort , and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer . "
68091	68103	67713	67713	he	192	" Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference ? "
68104	68118	67713	67713	he	192	" I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady . "
68119	68130	67713	67713	he	192	" And what arts did he use to separate them ? "
68131	68143	68145	68145	Fitzwilliam	100	" He did not talk to me of his own arts , "
68148	68161	68145	68145	Fitzwilliam	100	" He only told me , what I have now told you . "
68192	68204	68206	68206	she	93	" I am thinking of what you have been telling me , "
68208	68227	68206	68206	she	93	" Your cousin 's conduct does not suit my feelings . Why was he to be the judge ? "
68228	68239	68187	68187	she	93	" You are rather disposed to call his interference officious ? "
68240	68286	68206	68206	she	93	" I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend 's inclination , or why , upon his own judgment alone , he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy . "
68287	68290	68291	68291	she	93	" But , "
68297	68329	68291	68291	she	93	" as we know none of the particulars , it is not fair to condemn him . It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case . "
68330	68338	68340	68340	Fitzwilliam	100	" That is not an unnatural surmise , "
68342	68357	68340	68340	Fitzwilliam	100	" but it is lessening the honour of my cousin 's triumph very sadly . "
68587	68598	68600	68601	Colonel Fitzwilliam	192	" There were some very strong objections against the lady , "
68631	68636	68637	68637	she	93	" To Jane herself , "
68640	68706	68637	68637	she	93	" there could be no possibility of objection . All loveliness and goodness as she is ! Her understanding excellent , her mind improved , and her manners captivating . Neither could any thing be urged against my father , who , though with some peculiarities , has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain , and respectability which he will probably never reach . "
69354	69388	69341	69341	he	100	" In vain have I struggled . It will not do . My feelings will not be repressed . You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you . "
69701	69837	69698	69698	she	93	" In such cases as this , it is , I believe , the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed , however unequally they may be returned . It is natural that obligation should be felt , and if I could _ feel _ gratitude , I would now thank you . But I cannot -- I have never desired your good opinion , and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly . I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one . It has been most unconsciously done , however , and I hope will be of short duration . The feelings which , you tell me , have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard , can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation . "
69935	69984	69932	69932	he	100	" And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting ! I might , perhaps , wish to be informed why , with so little _ endeavour _ at civility , I am thus rejected . But it is of small importance . "
69985	69992	69994	69994	she	93	" I might as well enquire , "
69996	70113	69994	69994	she	93	" why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will , against your reason , and even against your character ? Was not this some excuse for incivility , if I _ was _ uncivil ? But I have other provocations . You know I have . Had not my own feelings decided against you , had they been indifferent , or had they even been favourable , do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man , who has been the means of ruining , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ? "
70143	70233	70140	70140	she	93	" I have every reason in the world to think ill of you . No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _ there _ . You dare not , you can not deny that you have been the principal , if not the only means of dividing them from each other , of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability , the other to its derision for disappointed hopes , and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind . "
70273	70283	70284	70284	she	93	" Can you deny that you have done it ? "
70294	70337	70290	70290	he	100	" I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister , or that I rejoice in my success . Towards _ him _ I have been kinder than towards myself . "
70363	70372	70373	70373	she	93	" But it is not merely this affair , "
70376	70450	70373	70373	she	93	" on which my dislike is founded . Long before it had taken place , my opinion of you was decided . Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham . On this subject , what can you have to say ? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself ? or under what misrepresentation , can you here impose upon others ? "
70451	70463	70465	70465	Darcy	100	" You take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns , "
70478	70496	70373	70373	she	93	" Who that knows what his misfortunes have been , can help feeling an interest in him ? "
70497	70501	70503	70503	Darcy	100	" His misfortunes ! "
70506	70516	70503	70503	Darcy	100	" yes , his misfortunes have been great indeed . "
70517	70523	70525	70525	Elizabeth	93	" And of your infliction , "
70529	70605	70525	70525	Elizabeth	93	" You have reduced him to his present state of poverty , comparative poverty . You have withheld the advantages , which you must know to have been designed for him . You have deprived the best years of his life , of that independence which was no less his due than his desert . You have done all this ! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule . "
70606	70610	70612	70612	Darcy	100	" And this , "
70624	70665	70667	70667	he	100	" is your opinion of me ! This is the estimation in which you hold me ! I thank you for explaining it so fully . My faults , according to this calculation , are heavy indeed ! But perhaps , "
70679	70811	70667	70667	he	100	" these offences might have been overlooked , had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design . These bitter accusations might have been suppressed , had I with greater policy concealed my struggles , and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified , unalloyed inclination ; by reason , by reflection , by every thing . But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence . Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related . They were natural and just . Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections ? To congratulate myself on the hope of relations , whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ? "
70835	70886	70822	70822	she	93	" You are mistaken , Mr. Darcy , if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way , than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you , had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner . "
70903	70928	70900	70900	she	93	" You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it . "
70953	71052	70936	70936	he	1603	" From the very beginning , from the first moment I may almost say , of my acquaintance with you , your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance , your conceit , and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others , were such as to form that ground - work of disapprobation , on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike ; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry . "
71053	71105	70936	70936	he	1603	" You have said quite enough , madam . I perfectly comprehend your feelings , and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been . Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time , and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness . "
71702	71728	71690	71690	she	93	" I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you . Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?"--And
71825	71964	71797	71797	her	93	" Be not alarmed , Madam , on receiving this letter , by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments , or renewal of those offers , which were last night so disgusting to you . I write without any intention of paining you , or humbling myself , by dwelling on wishes , which , for the happiness of both , can not be too soon forgotten ; and the effort which the formation , and the perusal of this letter must occasion , should have been spared , had not my character required it to be written and read . You must , therefore , pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention ; your feelings , I know , will bestow it unwillingly , but I demand it of your justice . "
71965	74735	71797	71797	her	93	" Two offences of a very different nature , and by no means of equal magnitude , you last night laid to my charge . The first mentioned was , that , regardless of the sentiments of either , I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister,--and the other , that I had , in defiance of various claims , in defiance of honour and humanity , ruined the immediate prosperity , and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham.--Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth , the acknowledged favourite of my father , a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage , and who had been brought up to expect its exertion , would be a depravity , to which the separation of two young persons , whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks , could bear no comparison.--But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed , respecting each circumstance , I shall hope to be in future secured , when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read.--If , in the explanation of them which is due to myself , I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to your 's , I can only say that I am sorry.--The necessity must be obeyed -- and farther apology would be absurd.--I had not been long in Hertfordshire , before I saw , in common with others , that Bingley preferred your eldest sister , to any other young woman in the country.--But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment.--I had often seen him in love before.--At that ball , while I had the honour of dancing with you , I was first made acquainted , by Sir William Lucas 's accidental information , that Bingley 's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage . He spoke of it as a certain event , of which the time alone could be undecided . From that moment I observed my friend 's behaviour attentively ; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him . Your sister I also watched.--Her look and manners were open , cheerful and engaging as ever , but without any symptom of peculiar regard , and I remained convinced from the evening 's scrutiny , that though she received his attentions with pleasure , she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment.--If _ you _ have not been mistaken here , _ I _ must have been in an error . Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable.--If it be so , if I have been misled by such error , to inflict pain on her , your resentment has not been unreasonable . But I shall not scruple to assert , that the serenity of your sister 's countenance and air was such , as might have given the most acute observer , a conviction that , however amiable her temper , her heart was not likely to be easily touched.--That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain,--but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears.--I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it;--I believed it on impartial conviction , as truly as I wished it in reason.--My objections to the marriage were not merely those , which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside , in my own case ; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me.--But there were other causes of repugnance;--causes which , though still existing , and existing to an equal degree in both instances , I had myself endeavoured to forget , because they were not immediately before me.--These causes must be stated , though briefly.--The situation of your mother 's family , though objectionable , was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently , so almost uniformly betrayed by herself , by your three younger sisters , and occasionally even by your father.--Pardon me.--It pains me to offend you . But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations , and your displeasure at this representation of them , let it give you consolation to consider that , to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure , is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister , than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both.--I will only say farther , that from what passed that evening , my opinion of all parties was confirmed , and every inducement heightened , which could have led me before , to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection.--He left Netherfield for London , on the day following , as you , I am certain , remember , with the design of soon returning.--The part which I acted , is now to be explained.--His sisters ' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own ; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered ; and , alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother , we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London.--We accordingly went -- and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend , the certain evils of such a choice.--I described , and enforced them earnestly.--But , however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination , I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage , had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving , of your sister 's indifference . He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere , if not with equal regard.--But Bingley has great natural modesty , with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own.--To convince him , therefore , that he had deceived himself , was no very difficult point . To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire , when that conviction had been given , was scarcely the work of a moment.--I can not blame myself for having done thus much . There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair , on which I do not reflect with satisfaction ; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister 's being in town . I knew it myself , as it was known to Miss Bingley , but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.--That they might have met without ill consequence , is perhaps probable;--but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.--Perhaps this concealment , this disguise , was beneath me.--It is done , however , and it was done for the best.--On this subject I have nothing more to say , no other apology to offer . If I have wounded your sister 's feelings , it was unknowingly done ; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient , I have not yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other , more weighty accusation , of having injured Mr. Wickham , I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family . Of what he has _ particularly _ accused me I am ignorant ; but of the truth of what I shall relate , I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity . Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man , who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates ; and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust , naturally inclined my father to be of service to him , and on George Wickham , who was his god - son , his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed . My father supported him at school , and afterwards at Cambridge;--most important assistance , as his own father , always poor from the extravagance of his wife , would have been unable to give him a gentleman 's education . My father was not only fond of this young man 's society , whose manners were always engaging ; he had also the highest opinion of him , and hoping the church would be his profession , intended to provide for him in it . As for myself , it is many , many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner . The vicious propensities -- the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend , could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself , and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments , which Mr. Darcy could not have . Here again I shall give you pain -- to what degree you only can tell . But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created , a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character . It adds even another motive . My excellent father died about five years ago ; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady , that in his will he particularly recommended it to me , to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow , and if he took orders , desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant . There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds . His own father did not long survive mine , and within half a year from these events , Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that , having finally resolved against taking orders , he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage , in lieu of the preferment , by which he could not be benefited . He had some intention , he added , of studying the law , and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein . I rather wished , than believed him to be sincere ; but at any rate , was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal . I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman . The business was therefore soon settled . He resigned all claim to assistance in the church , were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it , and accepted in return three thousand pounds . All connection between us seemed now dissolved . I thought too ill of him , to invite him to Pemberley , or admit his society in town . In town I believe he chiefly lived , but his studying the law was a mere pretence , and being now free from all restraint , his life was a life of idleness and dissipation . For about three years I heard little of him ; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him , he applied to me again by letter for the presentation . His circumstances , he assured me , and I had no difficulty in believing it , were exceedingly bad . He had found the law a most unprofitable study , and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained , if I would present him to the living in question -- of which he trusted there could be little doubt , as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for , and I could not have forgotten my revered father 's intentions . You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty , or for resisting every repetition of it . His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances -- and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others , as in his reproaches to myself . After this period , every appearance of acquaintance was dropt . How he lived I know not . But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice . I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself , and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being . Having said thus much , I feel no doubt of your secrecy . My sister , who is more than ten years my junior , was left to the guardianship of my mother 's nephew , Colonel Fitzwilliam , and myself . About a year ago , she was taken from school , and an establishment formed for her in London ; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it , to Ramsgate ; and thither also went Mr. Wickham , undoubtedly by design ; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge , in whose character we were most unhappily deceived ; and by her connivance and aid , he so far recommended himself to Georgiana , whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child , that she was persuaded to believe herself in love , and to consent to an elopement . She was then but fifteen , which must be her excuse ; and after stating her imprudence , I am happy to add , that I owed the knowledge of it to herself . I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement , and then Georgiana , unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father , acknowledged the whole to me . You may imagine what I felt and how I acted . Regard for my sister 's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure , but I wrote to Mr. Wickham , who left the place immediately , and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge . Mr. Wickham 's chief object was unquestionably my sister 's fortune , which is thirty thousand pounds ; but I can not help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me , was a strong inducement . His revenge would have been complete indeed . This , madam , is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together ; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false , you will , I hope , acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham . I know not in what manner , under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you ; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at . Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either , detection could not be in your power , and suspicion certainly not in your inclination . You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night . But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed . For the truth of every thing here related , I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam , who from our near relationship and constant intimacy , and still more as one of the executors of my father 's will , has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions . If your abhorrence of _ me _ should make _ my _ assertions valueless , you can not be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin ; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him , I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning . I will only add , God bless you . "

76419	76540	76418	76418	she	93	cried.--"I , who have prided myself on my discernment!--I , who have valued myself on my abilities ! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister , and gratified my vanity , in useless or blameable distrust.--How humiliating is this discovery!--Yet , how just a humiliation!--Had I been in love , I could not have been more wretchedly blind . But vanity , not love , has been my folly.--Pleased with the preference of one , and offended by the neglect of the other , on the very beginning of our acquaintance , I have courted prepossession and ignorance , and driven reason away , where either were concerned . Till this moment , I never knew myself . "
77205	77216	77221	77221	she	93	" What would she have said?--how would she have behaved ? "

77248	77331	77245	77246	Lady Catherine	97	" I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do . But I am particularly attached to these young men ; and know them to be so much attached to me!--They were excessively sorry to go ! But so they always are . The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last ; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely , more I think than last year . His attachment to Rosings , certainly increases . "
77396	77434	77393	77393	she	97	" But if that is the case , you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer . Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company , I am sure . "

77452	77470	77450	77450	Elizabeth	93	" but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town next Saturday . "
77471	77525	77393	77393	she	97	" Why , at that rate , you will have been here only six weeks . I expected you to stay two months . I told Mrs. Collins so before you came . There can be no occasion for your going so soon . Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight . "
77526	77539	77450	77450	Elizabeth	93	" But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return . "
77540	77656	77393	77393	she	97	" Oh ! your father of course may spare you , if your mother can.--Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father . And if you will stay another _ month _ complete , it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London , for I am going there early in June , for a week ; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box , there will be very good room for one of you -- and indeed , if the weather should happen to be cool , I should not object to taking you both , as you are neither of you large . "
77657	77676	77450	77450	Elizabeth	93	" You are all kindness , Madam ; but I believe we must abide by our original plan . "
77682	77854	77450	77450	Elizabeth	93	" Mrs. Collins , you must send a servant with them . You know I always speak my mind , and I can not bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves . It is highly improper . You must contrive to send somebody . I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing.--Young women should always be properly guarded and attended , according to their situation in life . When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer , I made a point of her having two men servants go with her.--Miss Darcy , the daughter of Mr. Darcy , of Pemberley , and Lady Anne , could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner.--I am excessively attentive to all those things . You must send John with the young ladies , Mrs. Collins . I am glad it occurred to me to mention it ; for it would really be discreditable to _ you _ to let them go alone . "
77855	77866	77963	77963	she	97	" My uncle is to send a servant for us . "
77867	77914	77450	77450	Elizabeth	93	" Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man - servant , does he?--I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things . Where shall you change horses?--Oh ! Bromley , of course.--If you mention my name at the Bell , you will be attended to . "
78662	78670	78672	78672	he	149	" I know not , Miss Elizabeth , "
78674	78803	78672	78672	he	149	" whether Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us , but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it . The favour of your company has been much felt , I assure you . We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode . Our plain manner of living , our small rooms , and few domestics , and the little we see of the world , must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself ; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension , and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly . "
78862	79018	78849	78850	Mr. Collins	149	" It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably . We have certainly done our best ; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society , and from our connection with Rosings , the frequent means of varying the humble home scene , I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit can not have been entirely irksome . Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine 's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast . You see on what a footing we are . You see how continually we are engaged there . In truth I must acknowledge that , with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage , I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion , while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings . "
79053	79200	79030	79030	he	1678	" You may , in fact , carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire , my dear cousin . I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so . Lady Catherine 's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of ; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate -- but on this point it will be as well to be silent . Only let me assure you , my dear Miss Elizabeth , that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage . My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking . There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us . We seem to have been designed for each other . "
79460	79463	79464	79464	he	149	" But , "
79467	79497	79464	79464	he	149	" you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them , with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here . "
79516	79520	79522	79522	Maria	105	" Good gracious ! "
79530	79549	79522	79522	Maria	105	" it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened ! "
79550	79556	79558	79559	her companion	1696	" A great many indeed , "
79564	79585	79522	79522	Maria	105	" We have dined nine times at Rosings , besides drinking tea there twice!--How much I shall have to tell ! "
79590	79600	79586	79586	Elizabeth	93	" And how much I shall have to conceal . "
79952	79965	79932	79932	they	1708	" Is not this nice ? is not this an agreeable surprise ? "
79966	79975	79977	79977	Lydia	95	" And we mean to treat you all , "
79979	80000	79977	79977	Lydia	95	" but you must lend us the money , for we have just spent ours at the shop out there . "
80006	80061	79977	79977	Lydia	95	" Look here , I have bought this bonnet . I do not think it is very pretty ; but I thought I might as well buy it as not . I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home , and see if I can make it up any better . "
80078	80145	80071	80071	she	95	" Oh ! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop ; and when I have bought some prettier - coloured satin to trim it with fresh , I think it will be very tolerable . Besides , it will not much signify what one wears this summer , after the ----shire have left Meryton , and they are going in a fortnight . "
80146	80151	80153	80153	Elizabeth	93	" Are they indeed ? "
80160	80226	80071	80071	she	95	" They are going to be encamped near Brighton ; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer ! It would be such a delicious scheme , and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all . Mamma would like to go too of all things ! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ! "
80227	80230	80232	80232	Elizabeth	93	" Yes , "
80234	80288	80232	80232	Elizabeth	93	" _ that _ would be a delightful scheme , indeed , and completely do for us at once . Good Heaven ! Brighton , and a whole campful of soldiers , to us , who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia , and the monthly balls of Meryton . "
80289	80299	80301	80301	Lydia	95	" Now I have got some news for you , "
80310	80334	80301	80301	Lydia	95	" What do you think ? It is excellent news , capital news , and about a certain person that we all like . "
80360	80484	80354	80354	Lydia	95	" Aye , that is just like your formality and discretion . You thought the waiter must not hear , as if he cared ! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say . But he is an ugly fellow ! I am glad he is gone . I never saw such a long chin in my life . Well , but now for my news : it is about dear Wickham ; too good for the waiter , is not it ? There is no danger of Wickham 's marrying Mary King . There 's for you ! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool ; gone to stay . Wickham is safe . "
80485	80492	80494	80494	Elizabeth	93	" And Mary King is safe ! "
80496	80506	80494	80494	Elizabeth	93	" safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune . "
80507	80522	80354	80354	Lydia	95	" She is a great fool for going away , if she liked him . "
80523	80536	80538	80538	Jane	94	" But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side , "
80540	80577	80354	80354	Lydia	95	" I am sure there is not on _ his _ . I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her . Who _ could _ about such a nasty little freckled thing ? "
80671	80679	80681	80681	Lydia	95	" How nicely we are crammed in ! "
80683	81105	80681	80681	Lydia	95	" I am glad I bought my bonnet , if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox ! Well , now let us be quite comfortable and snug , and talk and laugh all the way home . And in the first place , let us hear what has happened to you all , since you went away . Have you seen any pleasant men ? Have you had any flirting ? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back . Jane will be quite an old maid soon , I declare . She is almost three and twenty ! Lord , how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty ! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands , you ca n't think . She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins ; but _ I _ do not think there would have been any fun in it . Lord ! how I should like to be married before any of you ; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls . Dear me ! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster 's . Kitty and me were to spend the day there , and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening ; ( by the bye , Mrs. Forster and me are _ such _ friends ! ) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come , but Harriet was ill , and so Pen was forced to come by herself ; and then , what do you think we did ? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman 's clothes , on purpose to pass for a lady,--only think what fun ! Not a soul knew of it , but Col . and Mrs. Forster , and Kitty and me , except my aunt , for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns ; and you can not imagine how well he looked ! When Denny , and Wickham , and Pratt , and two or three more of the men came in , they did not know him in the least . Lord ! how I laughed ! and so did Mrs. Forster . I thought I should have died . And _ that _ made the men suspect something , and then they soon found out what was the matter . "
81193	81204	81186	81187	Mr. Bennet	86	" I am glad you are come back , Lizzy . "
81328	81333	81335	81335	she	1728	" Oh ! Mary , "
81337	81496	81335	81335	she	1728	" I wish you had gone with us , for we had such fun ! as we went along , Kitty and me drew up all the blinds , and pretended there was nobody in the coach ; and I should have gone so all the way , if Kitty had not been sick ; and when we got to the George , I do think we behaved very handsomely , for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world , and if you would have gone , we would have treated you too . And then when we came away it was such fun ! I thought we never should have got into the coach . I was ready to die of laughter . And then we were so merry all the way home ! we talked and laughed so loud , that any body might have heard us ten miles off ! "
81505	81553	81500	81500	Mary	98	" Far be it from me , my dear sister , to depreciate such pleasures . They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds . But I confess they would have no charms for _ me _ . I should infinitely prefer a book . "
81926	81937	81939	81939	she	93	" His being so sure of succeeding , was wrong , "
81941	81960	81939	81939	she	93	" and certainly ought not to have appeared ; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment . "
81961	81964	81966	81966	Elizabeth	93	" Indeed , "
81968	82004	81966	81966	Elizabeth	93	" I am heartily sorry for him ; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me . You do not blame me , however , for refusing him ? "
82005	82013	81939	81939	she	93	" Blame you ! Oh , no . "
82014	82027	81966	81966	Elizabeth	93	" But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham . "
82028	82045	81939	81939	she	93	" No -- I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did . "
82046	82067	81966	81966	Elizabeth	93	" But you _ will _ know it , when I have told you what happened the very next day . "
82171	82177	82179	82179	Elizabeth	93	" This will not do , "
82181	82265	82179	82179	Elizabeth	93	" You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing . Take your choice , but you must be satisfied with only one . There is but such a quantity of merit between them ; just enough to make one good sort of man ; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much . For my part , I am inclined to believe it all Mr. Darcy 's , but you shall do as you chuse . "
82282	82294	82296	82296	she	94	" I do not know when I have been more shocked , "
82298	82366	82296	82296	she	94	" Wickham so very bad ! It is almost past belief . And poor Mr. Darcy ! dear Lizzy , only consider what he must have suffered . Such a disappointment ! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too ! and having to relate such a thing of his sister ! It is really too distressing . I am sure you must feel it so . "
82367	82434	82151	82151	she	94	" Oh ! no , my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both . I know you will do him such ample justice , that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent . Your profusion makes me saving ; and if you lament over him much longer , my heart will be as light as a feather . "
82435	82459	82296	82296	she	94	" Poor Wickham ; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance ! such an openness and gentleness in his manner . "
82460	82492	82151	82151	she	94	" There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men . One has got all the goodness , and the other all the appearance of it . "
82493	82514	82296	82296	she	94	" I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _ appearance _ of it as you used to do . "
82515	82590	82151	82151	she	94	" And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him , without any reason . It is such a spur to one 's genius , such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind . One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just ; but one can not be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty . "
82591	82615	82296	82296	she	94	" Lizzy , when you first read that letter , I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now . "
82616	82682	82151	82151	she	94	" Indeed I could not . I was uncomfortable enough . I was very uncomfortable , I may say unhappy . And with no one to speak to , of what I felt , no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had ! Oh ! how I wanted you ! "
82683	82713	82296	82296	she	94	" How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy , for now they _ do _ appear wholly undeserved . "
82714	82773	82151	82151	she	94	" Certainly . But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness , is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging . There is one point , on which I want your advice . I want to be told whether I ought , or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickham 's character . "
82783	82802	82774	82775	Miss Bennet	93	" Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully . What is your own opinion ? "
82803	82960	83041	83043	a willing listener	1747	" That it ought not to be attempted . Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public . On the contrary every particular relative to his sister , was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself ; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct , who will believe me ? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent , that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton , to attempt to place him in an amiable light . I am not equal to it . Wickham will soon be gone ; and therefore it will not signify to anybody here , what he really is . Sometime hence it will be all found out , and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before . At present I will say nothing about it . "
82961	83006	82774	82775	Miss Bennet	93	" You are quite right . To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever . He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done , and anxious to re - establish a character . We must not make him desperate . "
83136	83140	83142	83142	she	93	" And then , "
83144	83190	83142	83142	she	93	" if that very improbable event should ever take place , I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself . The liberty of communication can not be mine till it has lost all its value ! "
83320	83325	83327	83328	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Well , Lizzy , "
83332	83449	83327	83328	Mrs. Bennet	96	" what is your opinion _ now _ of this sad business of Jane 's ? For my part , I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody . I told my sister Philips so the other day . But I can not find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London . Well , he is a very undeserving young man -- and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now . There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer ; and I have enquired of every body too , who is likely to know . "
83450	83465	83294	83295	her friends	330	" I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more . "
83466	83541	83327	83328	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Oh , well ! it is just as he chooses . Nobody wants him to come . Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill ; and if I was her , I would not have put up with it . Well , my comfort is , I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart , and then he will be sorry for what he has done . "
83559	83564	83566	83567	her mother	261	" Well , Lizzy , "
83571	83642	83566	83567	her mother	261	" and so the Collinses live very comfortable , do they ? Well , well , I only hope it will last . And what sort of table do they keep ? Charlotte is an excellent manager , I dare say . If she is half as sharp as her mother , she is saving enough . There is nothing extravagant in _ their _ housekeeping , I dare say . "
83643	83650	83294	83295	her friends	330	" No , nothing at all . "
83651	83733	83566	83567	her mother	261	" A great deal of good management , depend upon it . Yes , yes . _ They _ will take care not to outrun their income . _ They _ will never be distressed for money . Well , much good may it do them ! And so , I suppose , they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead . They look upon it quite as their own , I dare say , whenever that happens . "
83734	83747	83294	83295	her friends	330	" It was a subject which they could not mention before me . "
83748	83812	83566	83567	her mother	261	" No . It would have been strange if they had . But I make no doubt , they often talk of it between themselves . Well , if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own , so much the better . _ I _ should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me . "
83919	83936	83938	83938	they	1757	" Good Heaven ! What is to become of us ! What are we to do ! "
83947	83957	83938	83938	they	1757	" How can you be smiling so , Lizzy ? "
83984	83989	83991	83991	she	1763	" I am sure , "
83993	84017	83991	83991	she	1763	" I cried for two days together when Colonel Millar 's regiment went away . I thought I should have broke my heart . "
84018	84029	84031	84031	Lydia	95	" I am sure I shall break _ mine _ , "
84033	84042	84044	84045	Mrs. Bennet	96	" If one could but go to Brighton ! "
84047	84064	83991	83991	she	1763	" Oh , yes!--if one could but go to Brighton ! But papa is so disagreeable . "
84065	84078	83991	83991	she	1763	" A little sea - bathing would set me up for ever . "
84079	84098	84100	84100	Kitty	97	" And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _ me _ a great deal of good , "
84337	84356	84358	84358	she	97	" I can not see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _ me _ as well as Lydia , "
84360	84395	84358	84358	she	97	" though I am _ not _ her particular friend . I have just as much right to be asked as she has , and more too , for I am two years older . "
84548	84590	84539	84539	He	264	" Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances . "
84591	84597	84599	84599	Elizabeth	93	" If you were aware , "
84601	84646	84599	84599	Elizabeth	93	" of the very great disadvantage to us all , which must arise from the public notice of Lydia 's unguarded and imprudent manner ; nay , which has already arisen from it , I am sure you would judge differently in the affair . "
84647	84651	84653	84654	Mr. Bennet	86	" Already arisen ! "
84656	84721	84653	84654	Mr. Bennet	86	" What , has she frightened away some of your lovers ? Poor little Lizzy ! But do not be cast down . Such squeamish youths as can not bear to be connected with a little absurdity , are not worth a regret . Come , let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia 's folly . "
84722	84979	84539	84539	He	264	" Indeed you are mistaken . I have no such injuries to resent . It is not of peculiar , but of general evils , which I am now complaining . Our importance , our respectability in the world , must be affected by the wild volatility , the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia 's character . Excuse me -- for I must speak plainly . If you , my dear father , will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits , and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life , she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment . Her character will be fixed , and she will , at sixteen , be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous . A flirt too , in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation ; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person ; and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind , wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite . In this danger Kitty is also comprehended . She will follow wherever Lydia leads . Vain , ignorant , idle , and absolutely uncontrouled ! Oh ! my dear father , can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known , and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ? "
85002	85175	84980	84981	Mr. Bennet	86	" Do not make yourself uneasy , my love . Wherever you and Jane are known , you must be respected and valued ; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of -- or I may say , three very silly sisters . We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton . Let her go then . Colonel Forster is a sensible man , and will keep her out of any real mischief ; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body . At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here . The officers will find women better worth their notice . Let us hope , therefore , that her being there may teach her her own insignificance . At any rate , she can not grow many degrees worse , without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life . "
85821	85833	85816	85816	he	156	" How long did you say that he was at Rosings ? "
85834	85839	85788	85793	a very gentleman - like man	1805	" Nearly three weeks . "
85840	85847	85816	85816	he	156	" And you saw him frequently ? "
85848	85855	85788	85793	a very gentleman - like man	1805	" Yes , almost every day . "
85856	85867	85816	85816	he	156	" His manners are very different from his cousin 's . "
85868	85883	85788	85793	a very gentleman - like man	1805	" Yes , very different . But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance . "
85884	85887	85889	85889	Wickham	156	" Indeed ! "
85899	85906	85911	85911	he	156	" And pray may I ask ? "
85918	85946	85947	85947	he	156	" Is it in address that he improves ? Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style ? for I dare not hope , "
85957	85965	85947	85947	he	156	" that he is improved in essentials . "
85966	85971	85973	85973	Elizabeth	93	" Oh , no ! "
85975	85991	85973	85973	Elizabeth	93	" In essentials , I believe , he is very much what he ever was . "
86037	86077	86034	86034	she	93	" When I said that he improved on acquaintance , I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement , but that from knowing him better , his disposition was better understood . "
86120	86284	86106	86106	he	156	" You , who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy , will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _ appearance _ of what is right . His pride , in that direction , may be of service , if not to himself , to many others , for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by . I only fear that the sort of cautiousness , to which you , I imagine , have been alluding , is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt , of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe . His fear of her , has always operated , I know , when they were together ; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh , which I am certain he has very much at heart . "
87167	87173	87175	87175	she	93	" But it is fortunate , "
87177	87259	87175	87175	she	93	" that I have something to wish for . Were the whole arrangement complete , my disappointment would be certain . But here , by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister 's absence , I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized . A scheme of which every part promises delight , can never be successful ; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation . "
87860	87864	87866	87866	she	93	" But surely , "
87868	87890	87866	87866	she	93	" I may enter his county with impunity , and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me . "
88244	88264	88266	88267	her aunt	1226	" My love , should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much ? "
88269	88294	88266	88267	her aunt	1226	" A place too , with which so many of your acquaintance are connected . Wickham passed all his youth there , you know . "
88355	88366	88368	88368	she	141	" If it were merely a fine house richly furnished , "
88370	88396	88368	88368	she	141	" I should not care about it myself ; but the grounds are delightful . They have some of the finest woods in the country . "
88645	88650	88642	88648	the Author of " Sense and Sensibility	3832	" Sense and Sensibility . "
89241	89247	89249	89249	she	93	" And of this place , "
89251	89297	89249	89249	she	93	" I might have been mistress ! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted ! Instead of viewing them as a stranger , I might have rejoiced in them as my own , and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt.--But no,"--recollecting
89298	89324	89249	89249	she	93	herself,--"that could never be : my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me : I should not have been allowed to invite them . "
89392	89408	89387	89387	he	583	" but we expect him to - morrow , with a large party of friends . "
89509	89517	89518	89518	she	839	expence.--"He is now gone into the army , "
89521	89533	89518	89518	she	839	" but I am afraid he has turned out very wild . "
89551	89555	89557	89558	Mrs. Reynolds	212	" And that , "
89567	89593	89557	89558	Mrs. Reynolds	212	" is my master -- and very like him . It was drawn at the same time as the other -- about eight years ago . "
89594	89606	89608	89609	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" I have heard much of your master 's fine person , "
89616	89638	89608	89609	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" it is a handsome face . But , Lizzy , you can tell us whether it is like or not . "
89657	89666	89557	89558	Mrs. Reynolds	212	" Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy ? "
89671	89674	89667	89667	Elizabeth	93	said--"A little . "
89675	89689	89557	89558	Mrs. Reynolds	212	" And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman , Ma'am ? "
89690	89696	89667	89667	Elizabeth	93	" Yes , very handsome . "
89697	89757	89557	89558	Mrs. Reynolds	212	" I am sure _ I _ know none so handsome ; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer , larger picture of him than this . This room was my late master 's favourite room , and these miniatures are just as they used to be then . He was very fond of them . "
89791	89802	89804	89805	Mr. Gardiner	180	" And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother ? "
89807	89860	89784	89784	she	139	" Oh ! yes -- the handsomest young lady that ever was seen ; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long . In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her -- a present from my master ; she comes here to - morrow with him . "
89902	89916	89899	89899	his	1919	" Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year ? "
89917	89951	89899	89899	his	1919	" Not so much as I could wish , Sir ; but I dare say he may spend half his time here ; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months . "
89952	89955	89957	89957	Elizabeth	93	" Except , "
89959	89966	89957	89957	Elizabeth	93	" when she goes to Ramsgate . "
89967	89981	89899	89899	his	1919	" If your master would marry , you might see more of him . "
89982	90010	89957	89957	Elizabeth	93	" Yes , Sir ; but I do not know when _ that _ will be . I do not know who is good enough for him . "
90023	90042	90017	90017	Elizabeth	93	" It is very much to his credit , I am sure , that you should think so . "
90043	90062	90064	90065	the other	3363	" I say no more than the truth , and what every body will say that knows him , "
90086	90113	90082	90083	the housekeeper	839	" I have never had a cross word from him in my life , and I have known him ever since he was four years old . "
90167	90190	90162	90163	her uncle	583	" There are very few people of whom so much can be said . You are lucky in having such a master . "
90191	90262	90134	90138	a good - tempered man	1935	" Yes , Sir , I know I am . If I was to go through the world , I could not meet with a better . But I have always observed , that they who are good - natured when children , are good - natured when they grow up ; and he was always the sweetest - tempered , most generous - hearted , boy in the world . "
90267	90273	90275	90275	she	93	her.--"Can this be Mr. Darcy ! "
90277	90285	90287	90288	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" His father was an excellent man , "
90290	90316	90134	90138	a good - tempered man	1935	" Yes , Ma'am , that he was indeed ; and his son will be just like him -- just as affable to the poor . "
90413	90425	90427	90427	she	93	" He is the best landlord , and the best master , "
90429	90507	90427	90427	she	93	" that ever lived . Not like the wild young men now - a - days , who think of nothing but themselves . There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name . Some people call him proud ; but I am sure I never saw any thing of it . To my fancy , it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men . "
90508	90519	90521	90521	Elizabeth	93	" In what an amiable light does this place him ! "
90523	90530	90532	90533	her aunt	1226	" This fine account of him , "
90539	90552	90532	90533	her aunt	1226	" is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend . "
90553	90560	90427	90427	she	93	" Perhaps we might be deceived . "
90561	90574	90532	90533	her aunt	1226	" That is not very likely ; our authority was too good . "
90637	90645	90647	90647	Elizabeth	93	" He is certainly a good brother , "
90673	90683	90684	90684	she	139	" And this is always the way with him , "
90685	90712	90684	90684	she	139	added.--"Whatever can give his sister any pleasure , is sure to be done in a moment . There is nothing he would not do for her . "
92571	92574	92564	92564	she	93	" delightful , "
92576	92579	92564	92564	she	93	" charming , "
92690	92697	92699	92699	she	93	" What will be his surprise , "
92701	92718	92699	92699	she	93	" when he knows who they are ! He takes them now for people of fashion . "
92995	93056	92992	92992	she	93	" Why is he so altered ? From what can it proceed ? It can not be for _ me _ , it can not be for _ my _ sake that his manners are thus softened . My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this . It is impossible that he should still love me . "
93197	93201	93202	93202	she	595	unexpected--"for your housekeeper , "
93205	93240	93202	93202	she	595	" informed us that you would certainly not be here till to - morrow ; and indeed , before we left Bakewell , we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country . "
93277	93287	93288	93288	he	276	" They will join me early to - morrow , "
93291	93310	93288	93288	he	276	" and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr . Bingley and his sisters . "
93359	93370	93371	93371	he	276	" There is also one other person in the party , "
93377	93411	93371	93371	he	276	" who more particularly wishes to be known to you,--Will you allow me , or do I ask too much , to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton ? "
93755	93767	93769	93770	her uncle	583	" He is perfectly well behaved , polite , and unassuming , "
93772	93787	93789	93790	her aunt	1226	" There _ is _ something a little stately in him to be sure , "
93792	93832	93789	93790	her aunt	1226	" but it is confined to his air , and is not unbecoming . I can now say with the housekeeper , that though some people may call him proud , _ I _ have seen nothing of it . "
93833	93874	93769	93770	her uncle	583	" I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us . It was more than civil ; it was really attentive ; and there was no necessity for such attention . His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling . "
93875	93882	93884	93885	her aunt	1226	" To be sure , Lizzy , "
93887	93925	93884	93885	her aunt	1226	" he is not so handsome as Wickham ; or rather he has not Wickham 's countenance , for his features are perfectly good . But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable ? "
93963	93976	93978	93979	her uncle	583	" But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities , "
93981	94017	93978	93979	her uncle	583	" Your great men often are ; and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing , as he might change his mind another day , and warn me off his grounds . "
94032	94041	94043	94044	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" From what we have seen of him , "
94046	94175	94043	94044	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body , as he has done by poor Wickham . He has not an ill - natured look . On the contrary , there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks . And there is something of dignity in his countenance , that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart . But to be sure , the good lady who shewed us the house , did give him a most flaming character ! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes . But he is a liberal master , I suppose , and _ that _ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue . "
95528	95544	95552	95552	he	90	" was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her ; "
95555	95581	95552	95552	he	90	" It is above eight months . We have not met since the 26th of November , when we were all dancing together at Netherfield . "
98064	98091	98096	98096	she	93	" Pray , Miss Eliza , are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton ? They must be a great loss to _ your _ family . "
98598	98611	98612	98612	she	102	" How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning , Mr. Darcy , "
98615	98656	98612	98612	she	102	" I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter . She is grown so brown and coarse ! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again . "
98694	98700	98701	98701	she	102	" For my own part , "
98704	98824	98701	98701	she	102	" I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her . Her face is too thin ; her complexion has no brilliancy ; and her features are not at all handsome . Her nose wants character ; there is nothing marked in its lines . Her teeth are tolerable , but not out of the common way ; and as for her eyes , which have sometimes been called so fine , I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them . They have a sharp , shrewish look , which I do not like at all ; and in her air altogether , there is a self - sufficiency without fashion , which is intolerable . "
98890	98970	98887	98887	she	102	" I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty ; and I particularly recollect your saying one night , after they had been dining at Netherfield , ' _ She _ a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit . ' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you , and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time . "
98971	98974	98976	98976	Darcy	100	" Yes , "
98985	99018	98976	98976	Darcy	100	" but _ that _ was only when I first knew her , for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance . "
99345	99668	99683	99683	Elizabeth	93	" Since writing the above , dearest Lizzy , something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature ; but I am afraid of alarming you -- be assured that we are all well . What I have to say relates to poor Lydia . An express came at twelve last night , just as we were all gone to bed , from Colonel Forster , to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers ; to own the truth , with Wickham!--Imagine our surprise . To Kitty , however , it does not seem so wholly unexpected . I am very , very sorry . So imprudent a match on both sides!--But I am willing to hope the best , and that his character has been misunderstood . Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him , but this step ( and let us rejoice over it ) marks nothing bad at heart . His choice is disinterested at least , for he must know my father can give her nothing . Our poor mother is sadly grieved . My father bears it better . How thankful am I , that we never let them know what has been said against him ; we must forget it ourselves . They were off Saturday night about twelve , as is conjectured , but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight . The express was sent off directly . My dear Lizzy , they must have passed within ten miles of us . Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon . Lydia left a few lines for his wife , informing her of their intention . I must conclude , for I can not be long from my poor mother . I am afraid you will not be able to make it out , but I hardly know what I have written . "
99720	100492	100544	100545	a servant	510	" By this time , my dearest sister , you have received my hurried letter ; I wish this may be more intelligible , but though not confined for time , my head is so bewildered that I can not answer for being coherent . Dearest Lizzy , I hardly know what I would write , but I have bad news for you , and it can not be delayed . Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be , we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place , for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland . Colonel Forster came yesterday , having left Brighton the day before , not many hours after the express . Though Lydia 's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green , something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there , or to marry Lydia at all , which was repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the alarm , set off from B. intending to trace their route . He did trace them easily to Clapham , but no farther ; for on entering that place they removed into a hackney - coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom . All that is known after this is , that they were seen to continue the London road . I know not what to think . After making every possible enquiry on that side London , Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire , anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes , and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield , but without any success , no such people had been seen to pass through . With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn , and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart . I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them . Our distress , my dear Lizzy , is very great . My father and mother believe the worst , but I can not think so ill of him . Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan ; and even if _ he _ could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia 's connections , which is not likely , can I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible . I grieve to find , however , that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage ; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes , and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted . My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room . Could she exert herself it would be better , but this is not to be expected ; and as to my father , I never in my life saw him so affected . Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment ; but as it was a matter of confidence one can not wonder . I am truly glad , dearest Lizzy , that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes ; but now as the first shock is over , shall I own that I long for your return ? I am not so selfish , however , as to press for it , if inconvenient . Adieu . I take up my pen again to do , what I have just told you I would not , but circumstances are such , that I can not help earnestly begging you all to come here , as soon as possible . I know my dear uncle and aunt so well , that I am not afraid of requesting it , though I have still something more to ask of the former . My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly , to try to discover her . What he means to do , I am sure I know not ; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way , and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to - morrow evening . In such an exigence my uncle 's advice and assistance would be every thing in the world ; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel , and I rely upon his goodness . "
100493	100503	100505	100505	Elizabeth	93	" Oh ! where , where is my uncle ? "
100589	100625	100572	100572	she	93	" I beg your pardon , but I must leave you . I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment , on business that can not be delayed ; I have not an instant to lose . "
100626	100635	100637	100637	he	2228	" Good God ! what is the matter ? "
100649	100684	100637	100637	he	2228	" I will not detain you a minute , but let me , or let the servant , go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner . You are not well enough;--you can not go yourself . "
100788	100818	100738	100738	mistress	4438	" Let me call your maid . Is there nothing you could take , to give you present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very ill . "
100819	100826	100827	100827	she	93	" No , I thank you ; "
100835	100865	100827	100827	she	93	" There is nothing the matter with me . I am quite well . I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn . "
100916	101003	100912	100912	she	93	" I have just had a letter from Jane , with such dreadful news . It can not be concealed from any one . My youngest sister has left all her friends -- has eloped;--has thrown herself into the power of -- of Mr. Wickham . They are gone off together from Brighton . _ You _ know him too well to doubt the rest . She has no money , no connections , nothing that can tempt him to -- she is lost for ever . "
101010	101015	101016	101016	she	93	" When I consider , "
101026	101086	101016	101016	she	93	" that _ I _ might have prevented it!--_I _ who knew what he was . Had I but explained some part of it only -- some part of what I learnt , to my own family ! Had his character been known , this could not have happened . But it is all , all too late now . "
101087	101094	101096	101096	Darcy	100	" I am grieved , indeed , "
101098	101111	101096	101096	Darcy	100	" grieved -- shocked . But is it certain , absolutely certain ? "
101112	101141	101016	101016	she	93	" Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night , and were traced almost to London , but not beyond ; they are certainly not gone to Scotland . "
101142	101158	101096	101096	Darcy	100	" And what has been done , what has been attempted , to recover her ? "
101159	101240	101016	101016	she	93	" My father is gone to London , and Jane has written to beg my uncle 's immediate assistance , and we shall be off , I hope , in half an hour . But nothing can be done ; I know very well that nothing can be done . How is such a man to be worked on ? How are they even to be discovered ? I have not the smallest hope . It is every way horrible ! "
101249	101295	101016	101016	she	93	" When _ my _ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh ! had I known what I ought , what I dared , to do ! But I knew not -- I was afraid of doing too much . Wretched , wretched , mistake ! "
101529	101628	101508	101509	her companion	1696	" I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence , nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay , but real , though unavailing , concern . Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part , that might offer consolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain wishes , which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks . This unfortunate affair will , I fear , prevent my sister 's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to - day . "
101629	101672	101683	101683	his	1696	" Oh , yes . Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy . Say that urgent business calls us home immediately . Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible.--I know it can not be long . "
102448	102458	102460	102461	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" But what is to be done about Pemberley ? "
102463	102479	102460	102461	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so ? "
102480	102504	102460	102461	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" Yes ; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement . _ That _ is all settled . "
102505	102511	102513	102514	the other	3363	" That is all settled ; "
102525	102550	102513	102514	the other	3363	" And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth ! Oh , that I knew how it was ! "
102710	102721	102723	102724	her uncle	583	" I have been thinking it over again , Elizabeth , "
102733	102849	102723	102724	her uncle	583	" and really , upon serious consideration , I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter . It appears to me so very unlikely , that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless , and who was actually staying in his colonel 's family , that I am strongly inclined to hope the best . Could he expect that her friends would not step forward ? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment , after such an affront to Colonel Forster ? His temptation is not adequate to the risk . "
102850	102857	102859	102859	Elizabeth	93	" Do you really think so ? "
102867	102872	102874	102875	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" Upon my word , "
102877	102942	102874	102875	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" I begin to be of your uncle 's opinion . It is really too great a violation of decency , honour , and interest , for him to be guilty of it . I can not think so very ill of Wickham . Can you , yourself , Lizzy , so wholly give him up , as to believe him capable of it ? "
102943	102995	102723	102724	her uncle	583	" Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest . But of every other neglect I can believe him capable . If , indeed , it should be so ! But I dare not hope it . Why should they not go on to Scotland , if that had been the case ? "
102996	103002	103004	103005	Mr. Gardiner	180	" In the first place , "
103007	103021	103004	103005	Mr. Gardiner	180	" there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland . "
103022	103057	102723	102724	her uncle	583	" Oh ! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption ! And , besides , no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road . "
103058	103126	103004	103005	Mr. Gardiner	180	" Well , then -- supposing them to be in London . They may be there , though for the purpose of concealment , for no more exceptionable purpose . It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side ; and it might strike them that they could be more economically , though less expeditiously , married in London , than in Scotland . "
103127	103358	102723	102724	her uncle	583	" But why all this secrecy ? Why any fear of detection ? Why must their marriage be private ? Oh ! no , no , this is not likely . His most particular friend , you see by Jane 's account , was persuaded of his never intending to marry her . Wickham will never marry a woman without some money . He can not afford it . And what claims has Lydia , what attractions has she beyond youth , health , and good humour , that could make him for her sake , forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well ? As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her , I am not able to judge ; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce . But as to your other objection , I am afraid it will hardly hold good . Lydia has no brothers to step forward ; and he might imagine , from my father 's behaviour , from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family , that _ he _ would do as little , and think as little about it , as any father could do , in such a matter . "
103359	103391	103004	103005	Mr. Gardiner	180	" But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him , as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage ? "
103392	103404	103406	103406	Elizabeth	93	" It does seem , and it is most shocking indeed , "
103414	103603	103406	103406	Elizabeth	93	" that a sister 's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt . But , really , I know not what to say . Perhaps I am not doing her justice . But she is very young ; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects ; and for the last half year , nay , for a twelvemonth , she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity . She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner , and to adopt any opinions that came in her way . Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton , nothing but love , flirtation , and officers , have been in her head . She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject , to give greater -- what shall I call it ? susceptibility to her feelings ; which are naturally lively enough . And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman . "
103604	103611	103613	103614	her aunt	1226	" But you see that Jane , "
103616	103634	103613	103614	her aunt	1226	" does not think so ill of Wickham , as to believe him capable of the attempt . "
103635	103724	103746	103746	her	141	" Of whom does Jane ever think ill ? And who is there , whatever might be their former conduct , that she would believe capable of such an attempt , till it were proved against them ? But Jane knows , as well as I do , what Wickham really is . We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word . That he has neither integrity nor honour . That he is as false and deceitful , as he is insinuating . "
103725	103734	103736	103737	Mrs. Gardiner	141	" And do you really know all this ? "
103752	103758	103760	103760	Elizabeth	93	" I do , indeed , "
103764	103889	103746	103746	her	141	" I told you the other day , of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy ; and you , yourself , when last at Longbourn , heard in what manner he spoke of the man , who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him . And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty -- which it is not worth while to relate ; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless . From what he said of Miss Darcy , I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud , reserved , disagreeable girl . Yet he knew to the contrary himself . He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her . "
103890	103914	103746	103746	her	141	" But does Lydia know nothing of this ? Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand ? "
103915	104100	103746	103746	her	141	" Oh , yes!--that , that is the worst of all . Till I was in Kent , and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation , Colonel Fitzwilliam , I was ignorant of the truth myself . And when I returned home , the ----shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight 's time . As that was the case , neither Jane , to whom I related the whole , nor I , thought it necessary to make our knowledge public ; for of what use could it apparently be to any one , that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him , should then be overthrown ? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster , the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me . That _ she _ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head . That such a consequence as _ this _ should ensue , you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts . "
104101	104127	103746	103746	her	141	" When they all removed to Brighton , therefore , you had no reason , I suppose , to believe them fond of each other . "
104128	104266	103746	103746	her	141	" Not the slightest . I can remember no symptom of affection on either side ; and had any thing of the kind been perceptible , you must be aware that ours is not a family , on which it could be thrown away . When first he entered the corps , she was ready enough to admire him ; but so we all were . Every girl in , or near Meryton , was out of her senses about him for the first two months ; but he never distinguished _ her _ by any particular attention , and , consequently , after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration , her fancy for him gave way , and others of the regiment , who treated her with more distinction , again became her favourites . "
104537	104541	104543	104543	Jane	94	" Not yet , "
104545	104563	104543	104543	Jane	94	" But now that my dear uncle is come , I hope every thing will be well . "
104564	104571	104534	104535	the fugitives	2287	" Is my father in town ? "
104572	104585	104543	104543	Jane	94	" Yes , he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word . "
104586	104595	104534	104535	the fugitives	2287	" And have you heard from him often ? "
104596	104656	104543	104543	Jane	94	" We have heard only once . He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday , to say that he had arrived in safety , and to give me his directions , which I particularly begged him to do . He merely added , that he should not write again , till he had something of importance to mention . "
104657	104671	104534	104535	the fugitives	2287	" And my mother -- How is she ? How are you all ? "
104672	104725	104543	104543	Jane	94	" My mother is tolerably well , I trust ; though her spirits are greatly shaken . She is up stairs , and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all . She does not yet leave her dressing - room . Mary and Kitty , thank Heaven ! are quite well . "
104726	104734	104736	104736	Elizabeth	93	" But you -- How are you ? "
104738	104751	104736	104736	Elizabeth	93	" You look pale . How much you must have gone through ! "
104989	104996	104998	104998	she	96	" If I had been able , "
105000	105187	104998	104998	she	96	" to carry my point of going to Brighton , with all my family , _ this _ would not have happened ; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her . Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight ? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side , for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing , if she had been well looked after . I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her ; but I was over - ruled , as I always am . Poor dear child ! And now here 's Mr. Bennet gone away , and I know he will fight Wickham , wherever he meets him , and then he will be killed , and what is to become of us all ? The Collinses will turn us out , before he is cold in his grave ; and if you are not kind to us , brother , I do not know what we shall do . "
105239	105248	105250	105250	he	180	" Do not give way to useless alarm , "
105252	105368	105250	105250	he	180	" though it is right to be prepared for the worst , there is no occasion to look on it as certain . It is not quite a week since they left Brighton . In a few days more , we may gain some news of them , and till we know that they are not married , and have no design of marrying , do not let us give the matter over as lost . As soon as I get to town , I shall go to my brother , and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street , and then we may consult together as to what is to be done . "
105369	105376	105378	105379	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Oh ! my dear brother , "
105381	105581	105378	105379	Mrs. Bennet	96	" that is exactly what I could most wish for . And now do , when you get to town , find them out , wherever they may be ; and if they are not married already , _ make _ them marry . And as for wedding clothes , do not let them wait for that , but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses , to buy them , after they are married . And , above all things , keep Mr. Bennet from fighting . Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened out of my wits ; and have such tremblings , such flutterings , all over me , such spasms in my side , and pains in my head , and such beatings at heart , that I can get no rest by night nor by day . And tell my dear Lydia , not to give any directions about her clothes , till she has seen me , for she does not know which are the best warehouses . Oh , brother , how kind you are ! I know you will contrive it all . "
105866	105907	105918	105918	she	98	" This is a most unfortunate affair ; and will probably be much talked of . But we must stem the tide of malice , and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other , the balm of sisterly consolation . "
105921	105990	105918	105918	she	98	" Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia , we may draw from it this useful lesson ; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable -- that one false step involves her in endless ruin -- that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she can not be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex . "
106111	106162	106102	106103	the former	347	" But tell me all and every thing about it , which I have not already heard . Give me farther particulars . What did Colonel Forster say ? Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place ? They must have seen them together for ever . "
106163	106249	106102	106103	the former	347	" Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality , especially on Lydia 's side , but nothing to give him any alarm . I am so grieved for him . His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost . He _ was _ coming to us , in order to assure us of his concern , before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland : when that apprehension first got abroad , it hastened his journey . "
106250	106278	106102	106103	the former	347	" And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry ? Did he know of their intending to go off ? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself ? "
106279	106338	106102	106103	the former	347	" Yes ; but when questioned by _ him _ Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan , and would not give his real opinion about it . He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying -- and from _ that _ , I am inclined to hope , he might have been misunderstood before . "
106339	106364	106102	106103	the former	347	" And till Colonel Forster came himself , not one of you entertained a doubt , I suppose , of their being really married ? "
106365	106484	106102	106103	the former	347	" How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains ! I felt a little uneasy -- a little fearful of my sister 's happiness with him in marriage , because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right . My father and mother knew nothing of that , they only felt how imprudent a match it must be . Kitty then owned , with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us , that in Lydia 's last letter , she had prepared her for such a step . She had known , it seems , of their being in love with each other , many weeks . "
106485	106494	106102	106103	the former	347	" But not before they went to Brighton ? "
106495	106502	106102	106103	the former	347	" No , I believe not . "
106503	106523	106102	106103	the former	347	" And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself ? Does he know his real character ? "
106524	106580	106102	106103	the former	347	" I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did . He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant . And since this sad affair has taken place , it is said , that he left Meryton greatly in debt ; but I hope this may be false . "
106581	106607	106102	106103	the former	347	" Oh , Jane , had we been less secret , had we told what we knew of him , this could not have happened ! "
106608	106616	106618	106619	her sister	348	" Perhaps it would have been better ; "
106621	106650	106618	106619	her sister	348	" But to expose the former faults of any person , without knowing what their present feelings were , seemed unjustifiable . We acted with the best intentions . "
106651	106666	106102	106103	the former	347	" Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia 's note to his wife ? "
106667	106678	106618	106619	her sister	348	" He brought it with him for us to see . "
106700	106705	106618	106619	her sister	348	" MY DEAR HARRIET , "
106706	106963	106618	106619	her sister	348	" You will laugh when you know where I am gone , and I can not help laughing myself at your surprise to - morrow morning , as soon as I am missed . I am going to Gretna Green , and if you can not guess with who , I shall think you a simpleton , for there is but one man in the world I love , and he is an angel . I should never be happy without him , so think it no harm to be off . You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going , if you do not like it , for it will make the surprise the greater , when I write to them , and sign my name Lydia Wickham . What a good joke it will be ! I can hardly write for laughing . Pray make my excuses to Pratt , for not keeping my engagement , and dancing with him to - night . Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all , and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet , with great pleasure . I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn ; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown , before they are packed up . Good bye . Give my love to Colonel Forster , I hope you will drink to our good journey . "
106964	106969	106618	106619	her sister	348	" Your affectionate friend , "
106970	106974	106618	106619	her sister	348	" LYDIA BENNET . "
106975	106983	106985	106985	Elizabeth	93	" Oh ! thoughtless , thoughtless Lydia ! "
106992	107058	106985	106985	Elizabeth	93	" What a letter is this , to be written at such a moment . But at least it shews , that _ she _ was serious in the object of her journey . Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to , it was not on her side a _ scheme _ of infamy . My poor father ! how he must have felt it ! "
107059	107094	106618	106619	her sister	348	" I never saw any one so shocked . He could not speak a word for full ten minutes . My mother was taken ill immediately , and the whole house in such confusion ! "
107095	107100	107102	107102	Elizabeth	93	" Oh ! Jane , "
107104	107127	107102	107102	Elizabeth	93	" was there a servant belonging to it , who did not know the whole story before the end of the day ? "
107128	107198	106618	106619	her sister	348	" I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time , is very difficult . My mother was in hysterics , and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power , I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done ! But the horror of what might possibly happen , almost took from me my faculties . "
107199	107238	107102	107102	Elizabeth	93	" Your attendance upon her , has been too much for you . You do not look well . Oh ! that I had been with you , you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone . "
107239	107373	106618	106619	her sister	348	" Mary and Kitty have been very kind , and would have shared in every fatigue , I am sure , but I did not think it right for either of them . Kitty is slight and delicate , and Mary studies so much , that her hours of repose should not be broken in on . My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday , after my father went away ; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me . She was of great use and comfort to us all , and lady Lucas has been very kind ; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us , and offered her services , or any of her daughters , if they could be of use to us . "
107374	107383	107385	107385	Elizabeth	93	" She had better have stayed at home , "
107387	107436	107385	107385	Elizabeth	93	" perhaps she _ meant _ well , but , under such a misfortune as this , one can not see too little of one 's neighbours . Assistance is impossible ; condolence , insufferable . Let them triumph over us at a distance , and be satisfied . "
107464	107471	107473	107473	Jane	94	" He meant , I believe , "
107475	107652	107473	107473	Jane	94	" to go to Epsom , the place where they last changed horses , see the postilions , and try if any thing could be made out from them . His principal object must be , to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham . It had come with a fare from London ; and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady 's removing from one carriage into another , might be remarked , he meant to make enquiries at Clapham . If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare , he determined to make enquiries there , and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach . I do not know of any other designs that he had formed : but he was in such a hurry to be gone , and his spirits so greatly discomposed , that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this . "
108281	108421	108443	108443	her	93	" I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out , if possible , from some of the young man 's intimates in the regiment , whether Wickham has any relations or connections , who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself . If there were any one , that one could apply to , with a probability of gaining such a clue as that , it might be of essential consequence . At present we have nothing to guide us . Colonel Forster will , I dare say , do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head . But , on second thoughts , perhaps Lizzy could tell us , what relations he has now living , better than any other person . "
108674	108679	108662	108662	her	94	" MY DEAR SIR , "
108680	109077	108662	108662	her	94	" I feel myself called upon , by our relationship , and my situation in life , to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under , of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire . Be assured , my dear Sir , that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you , and all your respectable family , in your present distress , which must be of the bitterest kind , because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove . No arguments shall be wanting on my part , that can alleviate so severe a misfortune ; or that may comfort you , under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parent 's mind . The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this . And it is the more to be lamented , because there is reason to suppose , as my dear Charlotte informs me , that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter , has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence , though , at the same time , for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet , I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad , or she could not be guilty of such an enormity , at so early an age . Howsoever that may be , you are grievously to be pitied , in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins , but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter , to whom I have related the affair . They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter , will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others , for who , as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says , will connect themselves with such a family . And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November , for had it been otherwise , I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace . Let me advise you then , my dear Sir , to console yourself as much as possible , to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever , and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence . "
109078	109089	108662	108662	her	94	" I am , dear Sir , & c. & c. "
109312	109316	109317	109317	she	94	" A gamester ! "
109320	109334	109317	109317	she	94	" This is wholly unexpected . I had not an idea of it . "
109444	109457	109458	109458	she	96	" What , is he coming home , and without poor Lydia ! "
109461	109491	109458	109458	she	96	" Sure he will not leave London before he has found them . Who is to fight Wickham , and make him marry her , if he comes away ? "
109820	109846	109817	109817	he	86	" Say nothing of that . Who should suffer but myself ? It has been my own doing , and I ought to feel it . "
109847	109857	109859	109859	Elizabeth	93	" You must not be too severe upon yourself , "
109861	109919	109817	109817	he	86	" You may well warn me against such an evil . Human nature is so prone to fall into it ! No , Lizzy , let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame . I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression . It will pass away soon enough . "
109920	109930	109817	109817	he	86	" Do you suppose them to be in London ? "
109931	109943	109817	109817	he	86	" Yes ; where else can they be so well concealed ? "
109944	109955	109957	109957	Kitty	97	" And Lydia used to want to go to London , "
109959	109966	109968	109969	her father	264	" She is happy , then , "
109973	109985	109968	109969	her father	264	" and her residence there will probably be of some duration . "
109996	110029	109993	109993	he	264	" Lizzy , I bear you no ill - will for being justified in your advice to me last May , which , considering the event , shews some greatness of mind . "
110046	110052	110054	110054	he	264	" This is a parade , "
110056	110114	110054	110054	he	264	" which does one good ; it gives such an elegance to misfortune ! Another day I will do the same ; I will sit in my library , in my night cap and powdering gown , and give as much trouble as I can,--or , perhaps , I may defer it , till Kitty runs away . "
110115	110126	110128	110128	Kitty	97	" I am not going to run away , Papa , "
110132	110150	110128	110128	Kitty	97	" if _ I _ should ever go to Brighton , I would behave better than Lydia . "
110151	110257	110054	110054	he	264	" _ You _ go to Brighton!--I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds ! No , Kitty , I have at last learnt to be cautious , and you will feel the effects of it . No officer is ever to enter my house again , nor even to pass through the village . Balls will be absolutely prohibited , unless you stand up with one of your sisters . And you are never to stir out of doors , till you can prove , that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner . "
110274	110279	110281	110281	he	2391	" Well , well , "
110283	110315	110281	110281	he	2391	" do not make yourself unhappy . If you are a good girl for the next ten years , I will take you to a review at the end of them . "
110387	110424	110381	110381	she	839	" I beg your pardon , madam , for interrupting you , but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town , so I took the liberty of coming to ask . "
110425	110440	110381	110381	she	839	" What do you mean , Hill ? We have heard nothing from town . "
110441	110445	110447	110448	Mrs. Hill	148	" Dear madam , "
110454	110485	110447	110448	Mrs. Hill	148	" do n't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner ? He has been here this half hour , and master has had a letter . "
110548	110567	110542	110543	the butler	2402	" If you are looking for my master , ma'am , he is walking towards the little copse . "
110648	110666	110631	110632	her sister	348	" Oh , Papa , what news ? what news ? have you heard from my uncle ? "
110667	110680	110631	110632	her sister	348	" Yes , I have had a letter from him by express . "
110681	110695	110631	110632	her sister	348	" Well , and what news does it bring ? good or bad ? "
110696	110706	110708	110708	he	267	" What is there of good to be expected ? "
110717	110727	110708	110708	he	267	" but perhaps you would like to read it . "
110741	110746	110748	110749	their father	267	" Read it aloud , "
110751	110762	110748	110749	their father	267	" for I hardly know myself what it is about . "
110763	110769	110708	110708	he	267	" Gracechurch - street , Monday ,
110777	110777	110773	110775	MY DEAR BROTHER	4638	"
110778	110854	110748	110749	their father	267	" At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece , and such as , upon the whole , I hope will give you satisfaction . Soon after you left me on Saturday , I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were . The particulars , I reserve till we meet . It is enough to know they are discovered , I have seen them both---- "
110855	110865	110867	110867	Jane	94	" Then it is , as I always hoped , "
110869	110874	110867	110867	Jane	94	" they are married ! "
110879	111251	110875	110875	Elizabeth	93	" I have seen them both . They are not married , nor can I find there was any intention of being so ; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side , I hope it will not be long before they are . All that is required of you is , to assure to your daughter , by settlement , her equal share of the five thousand pounds , secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister ; and , moreover , to enter into an engagement of allowing her , during your life , one hundred pounds per annum . These are conditions , which , considering every thing , I had no hesitation in complying with , as far as I thought myself privileged , for you . I shall send this by express , that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer . You will easily comprehend , from these particulars , that Mr. Wickham 's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be . The world has been deceived in that respect ; and I am happy to say , there will be some little money , even when all his debts are discharged , to settle on my niece , in addition to her own fortune . If , as I conclude will be the case , you send me full powers to act in your name , throughout the whole of this business , I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement . There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again ; therefore , stay quietly at Longbourn , and depend on my diligence and care . Send back your answer as soon as you can , and be careful to write explicitly . We have judged it best , that my niece should be married from this house , of which I hope you will approve . She comes to us to - day . I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on . Your 's , & c. "
111252	111257	111301	111302	her sister	348	" EDW . GARDINER . "
111258	111263	111265	111265	Elizabeth	93	" Is it possible ! "
111272	111283	111265	111265	Elizabeth	93	" Can it be possible that he will marry her ? "
111284	111299	111301	111302	her sister	348	" Wickham is not so undeserving , then , as we have thought him ; "
111304	111313	111301	111302	her sister	348	" My dear father , I congratulate you . "
111314	111322	111324	111324	Elizabeth	93	" And have you answered the letter ? "
111326	111336	111301	111302	her sister	348	" No ; but it must be done soon . "
111353	111360	111361	111361	she	93	" Oh ! my dear father , "
111364	111384	111361	111361	she	93	" come back , and write immediately . Consider how important every moment is , in such a case . "
111385	111392	111394	111394	Jane	94	" Let me write for you , "
111396	111404	111394	111394	Jane	94	" if you dislike the trouble yourself . "
111405	111412	111413	111413	he	2413	" I dislike it very much , "
111416	111423	111413	111413	he	2413	" but it must be done . "
111440	111446	111448	111448	Elizabeth	93	" And may I ask ? "
111450	111463	111448	111448	Elizabeth	93	" but the terms , I suppose , must be complied with . "
111464	111478	111394	111394	Jane	94	" Complied with ! I am only ashamed of his asking so little . "
111479	111496	111448	111448	Elizabeth	93	" And they _ must _ marry ! Yet he is _ such _ a man ! "
111497	111554	111394	111394	Jane	94	" Yes , yes , they must marry . There is nothing else to be done . But there are two things that I want very much to know:--one is , how much money your uncle has laid down , to bring it about ; and the other , how I am ever to pay him . "
111555	111561	111563	111563	Jane	94	" Money ! my uncle ! "
111565	111573	111563	111563	Jane	94	" what do you mean , Sir ? "
111574	111610	111394	111394	Jane	94	" I mean , that no man in his senses , would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a - year during my life , and fifty after I am gone . "
111611	111617	111619	111619	Elizabeth	93	" That is very true , "
111621	111675	111619	111619	Elizabeth	93	" though it had not occurred to me before . His debts to be discharged , and something still to remain ! Oh ! it must be my uncle 's doings ! Generous , good man , I am afraid he has distressed himself . A small sum could not do all this . "
111676	111679	111681	111682	her father	264	" No , "
111684	111722	111681	111682	her father	264	" Wickham 's a fool , if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds . I should be sorry to think so ill of him , in the very beginning of our relationship . "
111723	111741	111776	111777	the girls	3033	" Ten thousand pounds ! Heaven forbid ! How is half such a sum to be repaid ? "
111785	111794	111796	111796	Elizabeth	93	" And they are really to be married ! "
111806	111853	111796	111796	Elizabeth	93	" How strange this is ! And for _ this _ we are to be thankful . That they should marry , small as is their chance of happiness , and wretched as is his character , we are forced to rejoice ! Oh , Lydia ! "
111854	111861	111863	111863	Jane	94	" I comfort myself with thinking , "
111865	111935	111863	111863	Jane	94	" that he certainly would not marry Lydia , if he had not a real regard for her . Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him , I can not believe that ten thousand pounds , or any thing like it , has been advanced . He has children of his own , and may have more . How could he spare half ten thousand pounds ? "
111936	111951	111953	111953	Elizabeth	93	" If we are ever able to learn what Wickham 's debts have been , "
111955	112072	111953	111953	Elizabeth	93	" and how much is settled on his side on our sister , we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them , because Wickham has not sixpence of his own . The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited . Their taking her home , and affording her their personal protection and countenance , is such a sacrifice to her advantage , as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge . By this time she is actually with them ! If such goodness does not make her miserable now , she will never deserve to be happy ! What a meeting for her , when she first sees my aunt ! "
112073	112087	112089	112089	Jane	94	" We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side , "
112091	112161	112089	112089	Jane	94	" I hope and trust they will yet be happy . His consenting to marry her is a proof , I will believe , that he is come to a right way of thinking . Their mutual affection will steady them ; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly , and live in so rational a manner , as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten . "
112162	112169	112171	112171	Elizabeth	93	" Their conduct has been such , "
112173	112197	112171	112171	Elizabeth	93	" as neither you , nor I , nor any body , can ever forget . It is useless to talk of it . "
112258	112264	112252	112252	his	267	" Just as you please . "
112265	112278	112252	112252	his	267	" May we take my uncle 's letter to read to her ? "
112279	112289	112252	112252	his	267	" Take whatever you like , and get away . "
112429	112436	112437	112437	she	94	" My dear , dear Lydia ! "
112440	112571	112437	112437	she	94	" This is delightful indeed!--She will be married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My good , kind brother!--I knew how it would be -- I knew he would manage every thing . How I long to see her ! and to see dear Wickham too ! But the clothes , the wedding clothes ! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly . Lizzy , my dear , run down to your father , and ask him how much he will give her . Stay , stay , I will go myself . Ring the bell , Kitty , for Hill . I will put on my things in a moment . My dear , dear Lydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet ! "
112604	112613	112614	112614	she	2429	" For we must attribute this happy conclusion , "
112617	112642	112614	112614	she	2429	" in a great measure , to his kindness . We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money . "
112643	112646	112648	112649	her mother	261	" Well , "
112651	112796	112648	112649	her mother	261	" it is all very right ; who should do it but her own uncle ? If he had not had a family of his own , I and my children must have had all his money you know , and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him , except a few presents . Well ! I am so happy . In a short time , I shall have a daughter married . Mrs. Wickham ! How well it sounds . And she was only sixteen last June . My dear Jane , I am in such a flutter , that I am sure I ca n't write ; so I will dictate , and you write for me . We will settle with your father about the money afterwards ; but the things should be ordered immediately . "
112883	112890	112892	112892	she	2434	" I will go to Meryton , "
112894	113008	112892	112892	she	2434	" as soon as I am dressed , and tell the good , good news to my sister Philips . And as I come back , I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long . Kitty , run down and order the carriage . An airing would do me a great deal of good , I am sure . Girls , can I do any thing for you in Meryton ? Oh ! here comes Hill . My dear Hill , have you heard the good news ? Miss Lydia is going to be married ; and you shall all have a bowl of punch , to make merry at her wedding . "
114036	114043	114045	114045	she	230	" Haye - Park might do , "
114047	114100	114045	114045	she	230	" if the Gouldings would quit it , or the great house at Stoke , if the drawing - room were larger ; but Ashworth is too far off ! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me ; and as for Purvis Lodge , the attics are dreadful . "
114127	114186	114122	114122	he	276	" Mrs. Bennet , before you take any , or all of these houses , for your son and daughter , let us come to a right understanding . Into _ one _ house in this neighbourhood , they shall never have admittance . I will not encourage the impudence of either , by receiving them at Longbourn . "
114980	114992	114993	114993	he	100	" It was greatly my wish that he should do so , "
114996	115299	114993	114993	he	100	" as soon as his marriage was fixed on . And I think you will agree with me , in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable , both on his account and my niece 's . It is Mr. Wickham 's intention to go into the regulars ; and , among his former friends , there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army . He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ---- 's regiment , now quartered in the North . It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom . He promises fairly , and I hope among different people , where they may each have a character to preserve , they will both be more prudent . I have written to Colonel Forster , to inform him of our present arrangements , and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton , with assurances of speedy payment , for which I have pledged myself . And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton , of whom I shall subjoin a list , according to his information . He has given in all his debts ; I hope at least he has not deceived us . Haggerston has our directions , and all will be completed in a week . They will then join his regiment , unless they are first invited to Longbourn ; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner , that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all , before she leaves the South . She is well , and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.--Your 's , & c. "
115300	115304	115352	115352	she	95	" E. GARDINER . "
115414	115423	115425	115425	she	95	" She is so fond of Mrs. Forster , "
115427	115468	115425	115425	she	95	" it will be quite shocking to send her away ! And there are several of the young men , too , that she likes very much . The officers may not be so pleasant in General ---- 's regiment . "
116240	116249	116250	116250	she	93	" Only think of its being three months , "
116253	116317	116250	116250	she	93	" since I went away ; it seems but a fortnight I declare ; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time . Good gracious ! when I went away , I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again ! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was . "
116356	116446	116336	116336	she	93	" Oh ! mamma , do the people here abouts know I am married to - day ? I was afraid they might not ; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle , so I was determined he should know it , and so I let down the side glass next to him , and took off my glove , and let my hand just rest upon the window frame , so that he might see the ring , and then I bowed and smiled like any thing . "
116516	116540	116509	116509	her	95	" Ah ! Jane , I take your place now , and you must go lower , because I am a married woman . "
116594	116598	116592	116592	herself	93	" Mrs. Wickham , "
116632	116637	116639	116639	she	93	" Well , mamma , "
116651	116718	116639	116639	she	93	" and what do you think of my husband ? Is not he a charming man ? I am sure my sisters must all envy me . I only hope they may have half my good luck . They must all go to Brighton . That is the place to get husbands . What a pity it is , mamma , we did not all go . "
116719	116756	116610	116610	she	93	" Very true ; and if I had my will , we should . But my dear Lydia , I do n't at all like your going such a way off . Must it be so ? "
116757	116823	116639	116639	she	93	" Oh , lord ! yes;--there is nothing in that . I shall like it of all things . You and papa , and my sisters , must come down and see us . We shall be at Newcastle all the winter , and I dare say there will be some balls , and I will take care to get good partners for them all . "
116824	116833	116835	116836	her mother	261	" I should like it beyond any thing ! "
116838	116874	116639	116639	she	93	" And then when you go away , you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you ; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over . "
116875	116886	116888	116888	Elizabeth	93	" I thank you for my share of the favour , "
116890	116903	116888	116888	Elizabeth	93	" but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands . "
117210	117257	117205	117205	she	93	" Lizzy , I never gave _ you _ an account of my wedding , I believe . You were not by , when I told mamma , and the others , all about it . Are not you curious to hear how it was managed ? "
117258	117262	117205	117205	she	93	" No really , "
117266	117280	117205	117205	she	93	" I think there can not be too little said on the subject . "
117281	117460	117205	117205	she	93	" La ! You are so strange ! But I must tell you how it went off . We were married , you know , at St. Clement 's , because Wickham 's lodgings were in that parish . And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock . My uncle and aunt and I were to go together ; and the others were to meet us at the church . Well , Monday morning came , and I was in such a fuss ! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off , and then I should have gone quite distracted . And there was my aunt , all the time I was dressing , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon . However , I did not hear above one word in ten , for I was thinking , you may suppose , of my dear Wickham . I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat . "
117461	117697	117205	117205	she	93	" Well , and so we breakfasted at ten as usual ; I thought it would never be over ; for , by the bye , you are to understand , that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them . If you 'll believe me , I did not once put my foot out of doors , though I was there a fortnight . Not one party , or scheme , or any thing . To be sure London was rather thin , but however the little Theatre was open . Well , and so just as the carriage came to the door , my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone . And then , you know , when once they get together , there is no end of it . Well , I was so frightened I did not know what to do , for my uncle was to give me away ; and if we were beyond the hour , we could not be married all day . But , luckily , he came back again in ten minutes time , and then we all set out . However , I recollected afterwards , that if he _ had _ been prevented going , the wedding need not be put off , for Mr. Darcy might have done as well . "
117698	117702	117704	117704	Elizabeth	93	" Mr. Darcy ! "
117710	117762	117205	117205	she	93	" Oh , yes!--he was to come there with Wickham , you know . But gracious me ! I quite forgot ! I ought not to have said a word about it . I promised them so faithfully ! What will Wickham say ? It was to be such a secret ! "
117763	117771	117773	117773	Jane	94	" If it was to be secret , "
117775	117793	117773	117773	Jane	94	" say not another word on the subject . You may depend upon my seeking no further . "
117794	117799	117801	117801	Elizabeth	93	" Oh ! certainly , "
117808	117816	117801	117801	Elizabeth	93	" we will ask you no questions . "
117817	117821	117823	117823	Lydia	95	" Thank you , "
117825	117845	117823	117823	Lydia	95	" for if you did , I should certainly tell you all , and then Wickham would be angry . "
118014	118020	118021	118021	she	93	" You may readily comprehend , "
118024	118104	118021	118021	she	93	" what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us , and ( comparatively speaking ) a stranger to our family , should have been amongst you at such a time . Pray write instantly , and let me understand it -- unless it is , for very cogent reasons , to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary ; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance . "
118105	118114	118115	118115	she	93	" Not that I _ shall _ though , "
118126	118157	118115	118115	she	93	" and my dear aunt , if you do not tell me in an honourable manner , I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out . "
118280	118288	118249	118249	she	93	" Gracechurch - street , Sept. 6 . "
118289	118294	118249	118249	she	93	" MY DEAR NIECE , "
118295	120398	118249	118249	she	93	" I have just received your letter , and shall devote this whole morning to answering it , as I foresee that a _ little _ writing will not comprise what I have to tell you . I must confess myself surprised by your application ; I did not expect it from _ you _ . Do n't think me angry , however , for I only mean to let you know , that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _ your _ side . If you do not choose to understand me , forgive my impertinence . Your uncle is as much surprised as I am -- and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned , would have allowed him to act as he has done . But if you are really innocent and ignorant , I must be more explicit . On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn , your uncle had a most unexpected visitor . Mr. Darcy called , and was shut up with him several hours . It was all over before I arrived ; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _ your 's _ seems to have been . He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were , and that he had seen and talked with them both , Wickham repeatedly , Lydia once . From what I can collect , he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves , and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them . The motive professed , was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham 's worthlessness had not been so well known , as to make it impossible for any young woman of character , to love or confide in him . He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride , and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him , to lay his private actions open to the world . His character was to speak for itself . He called it , therefore , his duty to step forward , and endeavour to remedy an evil , which had been brought on by himself . If he _ had another _ motive , I am sure it would never disgrace him . He had been some days in town , before he was able to discover them ; but he had something to direct his search , which was more than _ we _ had ; and the consciousness of this , was another reason for his resolving to follow us . There is a lady , it seems , a Mrs. Younge , who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy , and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation , though he did not say what . She then took a large house in Edward - street , and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings . This Mrs. Younge was , he knew , intimately acquainted with Wickham ; and he went to her for intelligence of him , as soon as he got to town . But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted . She would not betray her trust , I suppose , without bribery and corruption , for she really did know where her friend was to be found . Wickham indeed had gone to her , on their first arrival in London , and had she been able to receive them into her house , they would have taken up their abode with her . At length , however , our kind friend procured the wished - for direction . They were in ---- street . He saw Wickham , and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia . His first object with her , he acknowledged , had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation , and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her , offering his assistance , as far as it would go . But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was . She cared for none of her friends , she wanted no help of his , she would not hear of leaving Wickham . She was sure they should be married some time or other , and it did not much signify when . Since such were her feelings , it only remained , he thought , to secure and expedite a marriage , which , in his very first conversation with Wickham , he easily learnt , had never been _ his _ design . He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment , on account of some debts of honour , which were very pressing ; and scrupled not to lay all the ill - consequences of Lydia 's flight , on her own folly alone . He meant to resign his commission immediately ; and as to his future situation , he could conjecture very little about it . He must go somewhere , but he did not know where , and he knew he should have nothing to live on . Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once . Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich , he would have been able to do something for him , and his situation must have been benefited by marriage . But he found , in reply to this question , that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage , in some other country . Under such circumstances , however , he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief . They met several times , for there was much to be discussed . Wickham of course wanted more than he could get ; but at length was reduced to be reasonable . Every thing being settled between _ them _ , Mr. Darcy 's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it , and he first called in Gracechurch - street the evening before I came home . But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen , and Mr. Darcy found , on further enquiry , that your father was still with him , but would quit town the next morning . He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle , and therefore readily postponed seeing him , till after the departure of the former . He did not leave his name , and till the next day , it was only known that a gentleman had called on business . On Saturday he came again . Your father was gone , your uncle at home , and , as I said before , they had a great deal of talk together . They met again on Sunday , and then _ I _ saw him too . It was not all settled before Monday : as soon as it was , the express was sent off to Longbourn . But our visitor was very obstinate . I fancy , Lizzy , that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all . He has been accused of many faults at different times ; but _ this _ is the true one . Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself ; though I am sure ( and I do not speak it to be thanked , therefore say nothing about it , ) your uncle would most readily have settled the whole . They battled it together for a long time , which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved . But at last your uncle was forced to yield , and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece , was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it , which went sorely against the grain ; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure , because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers , and give the praise where it was due . But , Lizzy , this must go no farther than yourself , or Jane at most . You know pretty well , I suppose , what has been done for the young people . His debts are to be paid , amounting , I believe , to considerably more than a thousand pounds , another thousand in addition to her own settled upon _ her _ , and his commission purchased . The reason why all this was to be done by him alone , was such as I have given above . It was owing to him , to his reserve , and want of proper consideration , that Wickham 's character had been so misunderstood , and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was . Perhaps there was some truth in _ this _ ; though I doubt whether _ his _ reserve , or _ anybody 's _ reserve , can be answerable for the event . But in spite of all this fine talking , my dear Lizzy , you may rest perfectly assured , that your uncle would never have yielded , if we had not given him credit for _ another interest _ in the affair . When all this was resolved on , he returned again to his friends , who were still staying at Pemberley ; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place , and all money matters were then to receive the last finish . I believe I have now told you every thing . It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise ; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure . Lydia came to us ; and Wickham had constant admission to the house . _ He _ was exactly what he had been , when I knew him in Hertfordshire ; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _ her _ behaviour while she staid with us , if I had not perceived , by Jane 's letter last Wednesday , that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it , and therefore what I now tell you , can give you no fresh pain . I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner , representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done , and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family . If she heard me , it was by good luck , for I am sure she did not listen . I was sometimes quite provoked , but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane , and for their sakes had patience with her . Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return , and as Lydia informed you , attended the wedding . He dined with us the next day , and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday . Will you be very angry with me , my dear Lizzy , if I take this opportunity of saying ( what I was never bold enough to say before ) how much I like him . His behaviour to us has , in every respect , been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire . His understanding and opinions all please me ; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness , and _ that _ , if he marry _ prudently _ , his wife may teach him . I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name . But slyness seems the fashion . Pray forgive me , if I have been very presuming , or at least do not punish me so far , as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park . A low phaeton , with a nice little pair of ponies , would be the very thing . But I must write no more . The children have been wanting me this half hour . Your 's , very sincerely , "
120399	120403	118249	118249	she	93	" M. GARDINER . "
120977	120991	120993	120993	he	156	" I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble , my dear sister ? "
121000	121005	121006	121006	she	93	" You certainly do , "
121012	121025	121006	121006	she	93	" but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome . "
121026	121051	120971	120971	she	93	" I should be sorry indeed , if it were . _ We _ were always good friends ; and now we are better . "
121052	121061	121006	121006	she	93	" True . Are the others coming out ? "
121062	121102	120971	120971	she	93	" I do not know . Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton . And so , my dear sister , I find from our uncle and aunt , that you have actually seen Pemberley . "
121109	121174	120971	120971	she	93	" I almost envy you the pleasure , and yet I believe it would be too much for me , or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle . And you saw the old housekeeper , I suppose ? Poor Reynolds , she was always very fond of me . But of course she did not mention my name to you . "
121175	121181	121241	121241	she	93	" Yes , she did . "
121182	121189	120971	120971	she	93	" And what did she say ? "
121190	121227	121241	121241	she	93	" That you were gone into the army , and she was afraid had -- not turned out well . At such a distance as _ that _ , you know , things are strangely misrepresented . "
121228	121231	121232	121232	he	2597	" Certainly , "
121252	121280	121247	121247	he	2597	" I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month . We passed each other several times . I wonder what he can be doing there . "
121281	121292	121294	121294	Elizabeth	93	" Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh , "
121296	121313	121294	121294	Elizabeth	93	" It must be something particular , to take him there at this time of year . "
121314	121338	121247	121247	he	2597	" Undoubtedly . Did you see him while you were at Lambton ? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had . "
121339	121349	121294	121294	Elizabeth	93	" Yes ; he introduced us to his sister . "
121350	121357	121247	121247	he	2597	" And do you like her ? "
121358	121362	121294	121294	Elizabeth	93	" Very much . "
121363	121409	121247	121247	he	2597	" I have heard , indeed , that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two . When I last saw her , she was not very promising . I am very glad you liked her . I hope she will turn out well . "
121410	121426	121294	121294	Elizabeth	93	" I dare say she will ; she has got over the most trying age . "
121427	121437	121247	121247	he	2597	" Did you go by the village of Kympton ? "
121438	121447	121294	121294	Elizabeth	93	" I do not recollect that we did . "
121448	121481	121247	121247	he	2597	" I mention it , because it is the living which I ought to have had . A most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House ! It would have suited me in every respect . "
121482	121491	121294	121294	Elizabeth	93	" How should you have liked making sermons ? "
121492	121577	121247	121247	he	2597	" Exceedingly well . I should have considered it as part of my duty , and the exertion would soon have been nothing . One ought not to repine;--but , to be sure , it would have been such a thing for me ! The quiet , the retirement of such a life , would have answered all my ideas of happiness ! But it was not to be . Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance , when you were in Kent ? "
121578	121612	121294	121294	Elizabeth	93	" I _ have _ heard from authority , which I thought _ as good _ , that it was left you conditionally only , and at the will of the present patron . "
121613	121639	121247	121247	he	2597	" You have . Yes , there was something in _ that _ ; I told you so from the first , you may remember . "
121640	121693	121294	121294	Elizabeth	93	" I _ did _ hear , too , that there was a time , when sermon - making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present ; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders , and that the business had been compromised accordingly . "
121694	121724	121247	121247	he	2597	" You did ! and it was not wholly without foundation . You may remember what I told you on that point , when first we talked of it . "
121772	121809	121759	121759	she	2600	" Come , Mr. Wickham , we are brother and sister , you know . Do not let us quarrel about the past . In future , I hope we shall be always of one mind . "
121937	121944	121945	121945	she	96	" Oh ! my dear Lydia , "
121948	121955	121945	121945	she	96	" when shall we meet again ? "
121956	121974	121912	121912	her	96	" Oh , lord ! I do n't know . Not these two or three years perhaps . "
121975	121985	121945	121945	she	96	" Write to me very often , my dear . "
121986	122022	121912	121912	her	96	" As often as I can . But you know married women have never much time for writing . My sisters may write to _ me _ . They will have nothing else to do . "
122048	122056	122058	122059	Mr. Bennet	86	" He is as fine a fellow , "
122071	122116	122058	122059	Mr. Bennet	86	" as ever I saw . He simpers , and smirks , and makes love to us all . I am prodigiously proud of him . I defy even Sir William Lucas himself , to produce a more valuable son - in - law . "
122131	122136	122138	122138	she	251	" I often think , "
122140	122161	122138	122138	she	251	" that there is nothing so bad as parting with one 's friends . One seems so forlorn without them . "
122162	122177	122179	122179	Elizabeth	93	" This is the consequence you see , Madam , of marrying a daughter , "
122181	122195	122179	122179	Elizabeth	93	" It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single . "
122196	122241	122138	122138	she	251	" It is no such thing . Lydia does not leave me because she is married ; but only because her husband 's regiment happens to be so far off . If that had been nearer , she would not have gone so soon . "
122338	122353	122333	122333	her	96	" Well , well , and so Mr. Bingley is coming down , sister , "
122365	122467	122333	122333	her	96	" Well , so much the better . Not that I care about it , though . He is nothing to us , you know , and I am sure _ I _ never want to see him again . But , however , he is very welcome to come to Netherfield , if he likes it . And who knows what _ may _ happen ? But that is nothing to us . You know , sister , we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it . And so , is it quite certain he is coming ? "
122468	122475	122477	122478	the other	3363	" You may depend on it , "
122480	122570	122477	122478	the other	3363	" for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night ; I saw her passing by , and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it ; and she told me that it was certain true . He comes down on Thursday at the latest , very likely on Wednesday . She was going to the butcher 's , she told me , on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday , and she has got three couple of ducks , just fit to be killed . "
122614	122732	122611	122611	she	95	" I saw you look at me to - day , Lizzy , when my aunt told us of the present report ; and I know I appeared distressed . But do n't imagine it was from any silly cause . I was only confused for the moment , because I felt that I _ should _ be looked at . I do assure you , that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain . I am glad of one thing , that he comes alone ; because we shall see the less of him . Not that I am afraid of _ myself _ , but I dread other people 's remarks . "
122808	122814	122815	122815	she	93	" Yet it is hard , "
122819	122852	122815	122815	she	93	" that this poor man can not come to a house , which he has legally hired , without raising all this speculation ! I _ will _ leave him to himself . "
122926	122938	122940	122941	Mrs. Bennet	96	" As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes , my dear , "
122943	122952	122940	122941	Mrs. Bennet	96	" you will wait on him of course . "
122953	123003	123004	123005	His wife	251	" No , no . You forced me into visiting him last year , and promised if I went to see him , he should marry one of my daughters . But it ended in nothing , and I will not be sent on a fool 's errand again . "
123029	123037	123039	123039	he	2622	" ' Tis an etiquette I despise , "
123041	123083	123039	123039	he	2622	" If he wants our society , let him seek it . He knows where we live . I will not spend _ my _ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away , and come back again . "
123084	123153	123166	123167	her husband	276	" Well , all I know is , that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him . But , however , that sha n't prevent my asking him to dine here , I am determined . We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon . That will make thirteen with ourselves , so there will be just room at table for him . "
123206	123218	123220	123220	Jane	94	" I begin to be sorry that he comes at all , "
123225	123289	123220	123220	Jane	94	" It would be nothing ; I could see him with perfect indifference , but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of . My mother means well ; but she does not know , no one can know how much I suffer from what she says . Happy shall I be , when his stay at Netherfield is over ! "
123290	123302	123304	123304	Elizabeth	93	" I wish I could say any thing to comfort you , "
123306	123342	123304	123304	Elizabeth	93	" but it is wholly out of my power . You must feel it ; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me , because you have always so much . "
123484	123494	123496	123496	Kitty	97	" There is a gentleman with him , mamma , "
123498	123504	123496	123496	Kitty	97	" who can it be ? "
123505	123525	123468	123468	she	93	" Some acquaintance or other , my dear , I suppose ; I am sure I do not know . "
123526	123529	123531	123531	Kitty	97	" La ! "
123533	123560	123531	123531	Kitty	97	" it looks just like that man that used to be with him before . Mr. what 's his name . That tall , proud man . "
123561	123604	123633	123634	her sister	348	" Good gracious ! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does I vow . Well , any friend of Mr. Bingley 's will always be welcome here to be sure ; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him . "
123916	123925	123927	123927	she	93	" Let me first see how he behaves , "
123929	123939	123927	123927	she	93	" it will then be early enough for expectation . "
124386	124395	124397	124397	she	93	" Could I expect it to be otherwise ! "
124399	124406	124397	124397	she	93	" Yet why did he come ? "
124442	124457	124459	124460	Mrs. Bennet	96	" It is a long time , Mr. Bingley , since you went away , "
124468	124650	124654	124654	he	90	" I began to be afraid you would never come back again . People _ did _ say , you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas ; but , however , I hope it is not true . A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood , since you went away . Miss Lucas is married and settled . And one of my own daughters . I suppose you have heard of it ; indeed , you must have seen it in the papers . It was in the Times and the Courier , I know ; though it was not put in as it ought to be . It was only said , ' Lately , George Wickham , Esq . to Miss Lydia Bennet , ' without there being a syllable said of her father , or the place where she lived , or any thing . It was my brother Gardiner 's drawing up too , and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it . Did you see it ? "
124682	124700	124702	124703	her mother	261	" It is a delightful thing , to be sure , to have a daughter well married , "
124705	124803	124702	124703	her mother	261	" but at the same time , Mr. Bingley , it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me . They are gone down to Newcastle , a place quite northward , it seems , and there they are to stay , I do not know how long . His regiment is there ; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire , and of his being gone into the regulars . Thank Heaven ! he has _ some _ friends , though perhaps not so many as he deserves . "
124877	124890	124892	124893	her mother	261	" When you have killed all your own birds , Mr. Bingley , "
124895	124941	124892	124893	her mother	261	" I beg you will come here , and shoot as many as you please , on Mr. Bennet 's manor . I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of the covies for you . "
125014	125022	125024	125024	she	93	" The first wish of my heart , "
125028	125068	125024	125024	she	93	" is never more to be in company with either of them . Their society can afford no pleasure , that will atone for such wretchedness as this ! Let me never see either one or the other again ! "
125241	125254	125255	125255	she	96	" You are quite a visit in my debt , Mr. Bingley , "
125258	125313	125255	125255	she	96	" for when you went to town last winter , you promised to take a family dinner with us , as soon as you returned . I have not forgot , you see ; and I assure you , I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement . "
125459	125475	125477	125477	she	93	" Why , if he came only to be silent , grave , and indifferent , "
125479	125486	125477	125477	she	93	" did he come at all ? "
125499	125561	125587	125587	shewed	2672	" He could be still amiable , still pleasing , to my uncle and aunt , when he was in town ; and why not to me ? If he fears me , why come hither ? If he no longer cares for me , why silent ? Teazing , teazing , man ! I will think no more about him . "
125598	125601	125603	125603	she	93	" Now , "
125605	125665	125603	125603	she	93	" that this first meeting is over , I feel perfectly easy . I know my own strength , and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming . I am glad he dines here on Tuesday . It will then be publicly seen , that on both sides , we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance . "
125666	125673	125675	125675	Elizabeth	93	" Yes , very indifferent indeed , "
125679	125687	125675	125675	Elizabeth	93	" Oh , Jane , take care . "
125688	125708	125603	125603	she	93	" My dear Lizzy , you can not think me so weak , as to be in danger now . "
125709	125730	125675	125675	Elizabeth	93	" I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever . "
126289	126302	126304	126304	she	93	" If he does not come to me , _ then _ , "
126306	126315	126304	126304	she	93	" I shall give him up for ever . "
126408	126431	126390	126393	one of the girls	2698	" The men sha n't come and part us , I am determined . We want none of them ; do we ? "
126479	126537	126447	126447	her	93	" A man who has once been refused ! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love ? Is there one among the sex , who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman ? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ! "
126563	126571	126556	126556	she	93	" Is your sister at Pemberley still ? "
126572	126582	126556	126556	she	93	" Yes , she will remain there till Christmas . "
126583	126595	126556	126556	she	93	" And quite alone ? Have all her friends left her ? "
126596	126616	126556	126556	she	93	" Mrs. Annesley is with her . The others have been gone on to Scarborough , these three weeks . "
126825	126829	126831	126831	she	96	" Well girls , "
126842	127033	126831	126831	she	96	" What say you to the day ? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well , I assure you . The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw . The venison was roasted to a turn -- and everybody said , they never saw so fat a haunch . The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucas 's last week ; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged , that the partridges were remarkably well done ; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least . And , my dear Jane , I never saw you look in greater beauty . Mrs. Long said so too , for I asked her whether you did not . And what do you think she said besides ? ' Ah ! Mrs. Bennet , we shall have her at Netherfield at last . ' She did indeed . I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived -- and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls , and not at all handsome : I like them prodigiously . "
127109	127118	127120	127121	Miss Bennet	95	" It has been a very agreeable day , "
127125	127148	127120	127121	Miss Bennet	95	" The party seemed so well selected , so suitable one with the other . I hope we may often meet again . "
127152	127245	127090	127090	she	96	" Lizzy , you must not do so . You must not suspect me . It mortifies me . I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man , without having a wish beyond it . I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are , that he never had any design of engaging my affection . It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address , and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man . "
127246	127252	127254	127255	her sister	348	" You are very cruel , "
127257	127274	127254	127255	her sister	348	" you will not let me smile , and are provoking me to it every moment . "
127275	127287	127090	127090	she	96	" How hard it is in some cases to be believed ! "
127288	127295	127254	127255	her sister	348	" And how impossible in others ! "
127296	127313	127090	127090	she	96	" But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge ? "
127314	127363	127254	127255	her sister	348	" That is a question which I hardly know how to answer . We all love to instruct , though we can teach only what is not worth knowing . Forgive me ; and if you persist in indifference , do not make _ me _ your confidante . "
127440	127446	127448	127448	she	96	" Next time you call , "
127450	127459	127448	127448	she	96	" I hope we shall be more lucky . "
127492	127500	127476	127476	she	96	" Can you come to - morrow ? "
127566	127621	127558	127558	her	96	" My dear Jane , make haste and hurry down . He is come -- Mr. Bingley is come.--He is , indeed . Make haste , make haste . Here , Sarah , come to Miss Bennet this moment , and help her on with her gown . Never mind Miss Lizzy 's hair . "
127622	127633	127635	127635	Jane	94	" We will be down as soon as we can , "
127637	127660	127635	127635	Jane	94	" but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us , for she went up stairs half an hour ago . "
127661	127689	127692	127693	her mother	261	" Oh ! hang Kitty ! what has she to do with it ? Come be quick , be quick ! where is your sash my dear ? "
127801	127823	127796	127796	she	97	" What is the matter mamma ? What do you keep winking at me for ? What am I to do ? "
127824	127837	127796	127796	she	97	" Nothing child , nothing . I did not wink at you . "
127865	127879	127855	127855	she	94	" Come here , my love , I want to speak to you , "
127931	127944	127921	127922	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Lizzy , my dear , I want to speak with you . "
127951	127963	127970	127970	she	261	" We may as well leave them by themselves you know ; "
127976	127991	127970	127970	she	261	" Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing - room . "
128558	128564	128565	128565	she	94	" ' Tis too much ! "
128568	128590	128565	128565	she	94	" by far too much . I do not deserve it . Oh ! why is not every body as happy ? "
128651	128660	128661	128661	she	93	" I must go instantly to my mother ; "
128664	128727	128661	128661	she	93	" I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude ; or allow her to hear it from any one but myself . He is gone to my father already . Oh ! Lizzy , to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family ! how shall I bear so much happiness ! "
128789	128793	128795	128795	she	93	" And this , "
128797	128827	128795	128795	she	93	" is the end of all his friend 's anxious circumspection ! of all his sister 's falsehood and contrivance ! the happiest , wisest , most reasonable end ! "
128851	128857	128859	128859	he	90	" Where is your sister ? "
128868	128886	128841	128841	her	93	" With my mother up stairs . She will be down in a moment I dare say . "
129160	129175	129152	129152	he	86	" Jane , I congratulate you . You will be a very happy woman . "
129192	129199	129200	129200	he	86	" You are a good girl ; "
129203	129276	129200	129200	he	86	" and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled . I have not a doubt of your doing very well together . Your tempers are by no means unlike . You are each of you so complying , that nothing will ever be resolved on ; so easy , that every servant will cheat you ; and so generous , that you will always exceed your income . "
129277	129298	129189	129189	his	86	" I hope not so . Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters , would be unpardonable in _ me _ . "
129299	129309	129311	129312	his wife	251	" Exceed their income ! My dear Mr. Bennet , "
129314	129338	129311	129312	his wife	251	" what are you talking of ? Why , he has four or five thousand a - year , and very likely more . "
129344	129446	129341	129342	her daughter	475	" Oh ! my dear , dear Jane , I am so happy ! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night . I knew how it would be . I always said it must be so , at last . I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing ! I remember , as soon as ever I saw him , when he first came into Hertfordshire last year , I thought how likely it was that you should come together . Oh ! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ! "
129663	129671	129673	129673	she	94	" He has made me so happy , "
129678	129703	129673	129673	she	94	" by telling me , that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring ! I had not believed it possible . "
129704	129710	129712	129712	Elizabeth	93	" I suspected as much , "
129714	129723	129712	129712	Elizabeth	93	" But how did he account for it ? "
129724	129813	129673	129673	she	94	" It must have been his sister 's doing . They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me , which I can not wonder at , since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects . But when they see , as I trust they will , that their brother is happy with me , they will learn to be contented , and we shall be on good terms again ; though we can never be what we once were to each other . "
129814	129822	129824	129824	Elizabeth	93	" That is the most unforgiving speech , "
129826	129857	129824	129824	Elizabeth	93	" that I ever heard you utter . Good girl ! It would vex me , indeed , to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley 's pretended regard . "
129858	129900	129673	129673	she	94	" Would you believe it , Lizzy , that when he went to town last November , he really loved me , and nothing but a persuasion of _ my _ being indifferent , would have prevented his coming down again ! "
129901	129921	129824	129824	Elizabeth	93	" He made a little mistake to be sure ; but it is to the credit of his modesty . "
129990	130002	130004	130004	Jane	94	" I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed ! "
130006	130049	130004	130004	Jane	94	" Oh ! Lizzy , why am I thus singled from my family , and blessed above them all ! If I could but see _ you _ as happy ! If there _ were _ but such another man for you ! "
130050	130117	130146	130146	she	96	" If you were to give me forty such men , I never could be so happy as you . Till I have your disposition , your goodness , I never can have your happiness . No , no , let me shift for myself ; and , perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time . "
130536	130554	130529	130529	she	96	" I hope you are well , Miss Bennet . That lady I suppose is your mother . "
130563	130576	130529	130529	she	96	" And _ that _ I suppose is one of your sisters . "
130577	130582	130584	130585	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Yes , madam , "
130595	130640	130584	130585	Mrs. Bennet	96	" She is my youngest girl but one . My youngest of all , is lately married , and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds , walking with a young man , who I believe will soon become a part of the family . "
130641	130650	130652	130653	Lady Catherine	97	" You have a very small park here , "
130659	130689	130584	130585	Mrs. Bennet	96	" It is nothing in comparison of Rosings , my lady , I dare say ; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas 's . "
130690	130712	130584	130585	Mrs. Bennet	96	" This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening , in summer ; the windows are full west . "
130729	130748	130713	130714	Mrs. Bennet	96	" May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well . "
130749	130763	130713	130714	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Yes , very well . I saw them the night before last . "
130840	130882	130816	130817	Lady Catherine	97	" Miss Bennet , there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn . I should be glad to take a turn in it , if you will favour me with your company . "
130883	130889	130891	130892	her mother	261	" Go , my dear , "
130894	130914	130891	130892	her mother	261	" and shew her ladyship about the different walks . I think she will be pleased with the hermitage . "
131031	131042	131044	131044	she	93	" How could I ever think her like her nephew ? "
131068	131103	131061	131062	Lady Catherine	97	" You can be at no loss , Miss Bennet , to understand the reason of my journey hither . Your own heart , your own conscience , must tell you why I come . "
131110	131136	131061	131062	Lady Catherine	97	" Indeed , you are mistaken , Madam . I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here . "
131137	131141	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" Miss Bennet , "
131151	131330	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" you ought to know , that I am not to be trifled with . But however insincere _ you _ may choose to be , you shall not find _ me _ so . My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness , and in a cause of such moment as this , I shall certainly not depart from it . A report of a most alarming nature , reached me two days ago . I was told , that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married , but that _ you _ , that Miss Elizabeth Bennet , would , in all likelihood , be soon afterwards united to my nephew , my own nephew , Mr. Darcy . Though I _ know _ it must be a scandalous falsehood ; though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible , I instantly resolved on setting off for this place , that I might make my sentiments known to you . "
131331	131341	131343	131343	Elizabeth	93	" If you believed it impossible to be true , "
131351	131371	131343	131343	Elizabeth	93	" I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far . What could your ladyship propose by it ? "
131372	131385	131061	131062	Lady Catherine	97	" At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted . "
131386	131399	131401	131401	Elizabeth	93	" Your coming to Longbourn , to see me and my family , "
131405	131425	131401	131401	Elizabeth	93	" will be rather a confirmation of it ; if , indeed , such a report is in existence . "
131426	131460	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" If ! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves ? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad ? "
131461	131469	131401	131401	Elizabeth	93	" I never heard that it was . "
131470	131487	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" And can you likewise declare , that there is no _ foundation _ for it ? "
131488	131518	131401	131401	Elizabeth	93	" I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . _ You _ may ask questions , which _ I _ shall not choose to answer . "
131519	131550	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" This is not to be borne . Miss Bennet , I insist on being satisfied . Has he , has my nephew , made you an offer of marriage ? "
131551	131561	131401	131401	Elizabeth	93	" Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible . "
131562	131620	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" It ought to be so ; it must be so , while he retains the use of his reason . But _ your _ arts and allurements may , in a moment of infatuation , have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family . You may have drawn him in . "
131621	131636	131401	131401	Elizabeth	93	" If I have , I shall be the last person to confess it . "
131637	131681	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" Miss Bennet , do you know who I am ? I have not been accustomed to such language as this . I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world , and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns . "
131682	131708	131401	131401	Elizabeth	93	" But you are not entitled to know _ mine _ ; nor will such behaviour as this , ever induce me to be explicit . "
131709	131754	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" Let me be rightly understood . This match , to which you have the presumption to aspire , can never take place . No , never . Mr. Darcy is engaged to _ my daughter _ . Now what have you to say ? "
131755	131780	131401	131401	Elizabeth	93	" Only this ; that if he is so , you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me . "
131792	131939	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind . From their infancy , they have been intended for each other . It was the favourite wish of _ his _ mother , as well as of her 's . While in their cradles , we planned the union : and now , at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished , in their marriage , to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world , and wholly unallied to the family ! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends ? To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh ? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy ? Have you not heard me say , that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ? "
131940	132050	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" Yes , and I had heard it before . But what is that to me ? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew , I shall certainly not be kept from it , by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh . You both did as much as you could , in planning the marriage . Its completion depended on others . If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin , why is not he to make another choice ? And if I am that choice , why may not I accept him ? "
132051	132132	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" Because honour , decorum , prudence , nay , interest , forbid it . Yes , Miss Bennet , interest ; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends , if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all . You will be censured , slighted , and despised , by every one connected with him . Your alliance will be a disgrace ; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us . "
132133	132139	132141	132141	Elizabeth	93	" These are heavy misfortunes , "
132143	132177	132141	132141	Elizabeth	93	" But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation , that she could , upon the whole , have no cause to repine . "
132178	132211	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" Obstinate , headstrong girl ! I am ashamed of you ! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring ? Is nothing due to me on that score ? "
132212	132271	132141	132141	Elizabeth	93	" Let us sit down . You are to understand , Miss Bennet , that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose ; nor will I be dissuaded from it . I have not been used to submit to any person 's whims . I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment . "
132272	132298	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" _ That _ will make your ladyship 's situation at present more pitiable ; but it will have no effect on _ me _ . "
132299	132443	132141	132141	Elizabeth	93	" I will not be interrupted . Hear me in silence . My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other . They are descended on the maternal side , from the same noble line ; and , on the father 's , from respectable , honourable , and ancient , though untitled families . Their fortune on both sides is splendid . They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses ; and what is to divide them ? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family , connections , or fortune . Is this to be endured ! But it must not , shall not be . If you were sensible of your own good , you would not wish to quit the sphere , in which you have been brought up . "
132444	132478	131143	131144	her ladyship	677	" In marrying your nephew , I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere . He is a gentleman ; I am a gentleman 's daughter ; so far we are equal . "
132479	132513	132141	132141	Elizabeth	93	" True . You _ are _ a gentleman 's daughter . But who was your mother ? Who are your uncles and aunts ? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition . "
132514	132521	132523	132523	Elizabeth	93	" Whatever my connections may be , "
132525	132544	132523	132523	Elizabeth	93	" if your nephew does not object to them , they can be nothing to _ you _ . "
132545	132558	132141	132141	Elizabeth	93	" Tell me once for all , are you engaged to him ? "
132590	132595	132596	132597	Lady Catherine	97	" I am not . "
132601	132616	132578	132578	she	93	" And will you promise me , never to enter into such an engagement ? "
132617	132627	132578	132578	she	93	" I will make no promise of the kind . "
132628	132677	132578	132578	she	93	" Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished . I expected to find a more reasonable young woman . But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede . I shall not go away , till you have given me the assurance I require . "
132678	132860	132578	132578	she	93	" And I certainly _ never _ shall give it . I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable . Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter ; but would my giving you the wished - for promise , make _ their _ marriage at all more probable ? Supposing him to be attached to me , would _ my _ refusing to accept his hand , make him wish to bestow it on his cousin ? Allow me to say , Lady Catherine , that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application , have been as frivolous as the application was ill - judged . You have widely mistaken my character , if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these . How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _ his _ affairs , I can not tell ; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine . I must beg , therefore , to be importuned no farther on the subject . "
132861	132990	132578	132578	she	93	" Not so hasty , if you please . I have by no means done . To all the objections I have already urged , I have still another to add . I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister 's infamous elopement . I know it all ; that the young man 's marrying her , was a patched - up business , at the expence of your father and uncles . And is _ such _ a girl to be my nephew 's sister ? Is _ her _ husband , is the son of his late father 's steward , to be his brother ? Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking ? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted ? "
132991	133003	133004	133004	she	2827	" You can _ now _ have nothing farther to say , "
133008	133028	133004	133004	she	2827	" You have insulted me , in every possible method . I must beg to return to the house . "
133052	133093	133033	133033	she	2827	" You have no regard , then , for the honour and credit of my nephew ! Unfeeling , selfish girl ! Do you not consider that a connection with you , must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody ? "
133094	133110	133033	133033	she	2827	" Lady Catherine , I have nothing farther to say . You know my sentiments . "
133111	133120	133033	133033	she	2827	" You are then resolved to have him ? "
133121	133168	133033	133033	she	2827	" I have said no such thing . I am only resolved to act in that manner , which will , in my own opinion , constitute my happiness , without reference to _ you _ , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me . "
133169	133220	133033	133033	she	2827	" It is well . You refuse , then , to oblige me . You refuse to obey the claims of duty , honour , and gratitude . You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends , and make him the contempt of the world . "
133221	133231	133033	133033	she	2827	" Neither duty , nor honour , nor gratitude , "
133235	133318	133233	133233	Elizabeth	93	" have any possible claim on me , in the present instance . No principle of either , would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy . And with regard to the resentment of his family , or the indignation of the world , if the former _ were _ excited by his marrying me , it would not give me one moment 's concern -- and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn . "
133319	133382	133406	133406	she	97	" And this is your real opinion ! This is your final resolve ! Very well . I shall now know how to act . Do not imagine , Miss Bennet , that your ambition will ever be gratified . I came to try you . I hoped to find you reasonable ; but depend upon it I will carry my point . "
133409	133440	133406	133406	she	97	" I take no leave of you , Miss Bennet . I send no compliments to your mother . You deserve no such attention . I am most seriously displeased . "
133505	133512	133514	133515	her daughter	475	" She did not choose it , "
133517	133522	133514	133515	her daughter	475	" she would go . "
133523	133596	133514	133515	her daughter	475	" She is a very fine - looking woman ! and her calling here was prodigiously civil ! for she only came , I suppose , to tell us the Collinses were well . She is on her road somewhere , I dare say , and so passing through Meryton , thought she might as well call on you . I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you , Lizzy ? "
134116	134139	134140	134140	she	93	" If , therefore , an excuse for not keeping his promise , should come to his friend within a few days , "
134143	134195	134140	134140	she	93	" I shall know how to understand it . I shall then give over every expectation , every wish of his constancy . If he is satisfied with only regretting me , when he might have obtained my affections and hand , I shall soon cease to regret him at all . "
134285	134288	134290	134290	he	264	" Lizzy , "
134292	134306	134290	134290	he	264	" I was going to look for you ; come into my room . "
134383	134440	134379	134379	He	264	" I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly . As it principally concerns yourself , you ought to know its contents . I did not know before , that I had _ two _ daughters on the brink of matrimony . Let me congratulate you , on a very important conquest . "
134500	134543	134496	134497	her father	264	" You look conscious . Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these ; but I think I may defy even _ your _ sagacity , to discover the name of your admirer . This letter is from Mr. Collins . "
134544	134559	134496	134497	her father	264	" From Mr. Collins ! and what can _ he _ have to say ? "
134560	134629	134496	134497	her father	264	" Something very much to the purpose of course . He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter , of which it seems he has been told , by some of the good - natured , gossiping Lucases . I shall not sport with your impatience , by reading what he says on that point . What relates to yourself , is as follows . "
134722	134723	134712	134720	one of the most illustrious personages in this land	2871	" "
134724	134738	134712	134720	one of the most illustrious personages in this land	2871	" Can you possibly guess , Lizzy , who is meant by this ? "
134739	134819	134712	134720	one of the most illustrious personages in this land	2871	" This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way , with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property , noble kindred , and extensive patronage . Yet in spite of all these temptations , let me warn my cousin Elizabeth , and yourself , of what evils you may incur , by a precipitate closure with this gentleman 's proposals , which , of course , you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of . "
134820	134839	134712	134720	one of the most illustrious personages in this land	2871	" Have you any idea , Lizzy , who this gentleman is ? But now it comes out . "
134840	134876	134712	134720	one of the most illustrious personages in this land	2871	" My motive for cautioning you , is as follows . We have reason to imagine that his aunt , lady Catherine de Bourgh , does not look on the match with a friendly eye . "
134877	134969	134712	134720	one of the most illustrious personages in this land	2871	" _ Mr. Darcy _ , you see , is the man ! Now , Lizzy , I think I _ have _ surprised you . Could he , or the Lucases , have pitched on any man , within the circle of our acquaintance , whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related ? Mr. Darcy , who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish , and who probably never looked at _ you _ in his life ! It is admirable ! "
135004	135010	134712	134720	one of the most illustrious personages in this land	2871	" Are you not diverted ? "
135011	135020	134712	134720	one of the most illustrious personages in this land	2871	" Oh ! yes . Pray read on . "
135021	135131	134712	134720	one of the most illustrious personages in this land	2871	" After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night , she immediately , with her usual condescension , expressed what she felt on the occasion ; when it became apparent , that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin , she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match . I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin , that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about , and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned . "
135132	135138	134712	134720	one of the most illustrious personages in this land	2871	" Mr. Collins moreover adds , "
135139	135270	134712	134720	one of the most illustrious personages in this land	2871	" I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia 's sad business has been so well hushed up , and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place , should be so generally known . I must not , however , neglect the duties of my station , or refrain from declaring my amazement , at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married . It was an encouragement of vice ; and had I been the rector of Longbourn , I should very strenuously have opposed it . You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian , but never to admit them in your sight , or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing . "
135271	135365	134712	134720	one of the most illustrious personages in this land	2871	" _ That _ is his notion of christian forgiveness ! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte 's situation , and his expectation of a young olive - branch . But , Lizzy , you look as if you did not enjoy it . You are not going to be _ Missish _ , I hope , and pretend to be affronted at an idle report . For what do we live , but to make sport for our neighbours , and laugh at them in our turn ? "
135366	135369	135371	135371	Elizabeth	93	" Oh ! "
135373	135385	135371	135371	Elizabeth	93	" I am excessively diverted . But it is so strange ! "
135386	135506	135534	135534	his	2874	" Yes--_that _ is what makes it amusing . Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing ; but _ his _ perfect indifference , and _ your _ pointed dislike , make it so delightfully absurd ! Much as I abominate writing , I would not give up Mr. Collins 's correspondence for any consideration . Nay , when I read a letter of his , I can not help giving him the preference even over Wickham , much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son - in - law . And pray , Lizzy , what said Lady Catherine about this report ? Did she call to refuse her consent ? "
135874	135968	135870	135870	she	93	" Mr. Darcy , I am a very selfish creature ; and , for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings , care not how much I may be wounding your 's . I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister . Ever since I have known it , I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it . Were it known to the rest of my family , I should not have merely my own gratitude to express . "
135969	135977	135979	135979	Darcy	100	" I am sorry , exceedingly sorry , "
135989	136023	135979	135979	Darcy	100	" that you have ever been informed of what may , in a mistaken light , have given you uneasiness . I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted . "
136024	136105	135870	135870	she	93	" You must not blame my aunt . Lydia 's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter ; and , of course , I could not rest till I knew the particulars . Let me thank you again and again , in the name of all my family , for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble , and bear so many mortifications , for the sake of discovering them . "
136106	136115	136116	136116	he	100	" If you _ will _ thank me , "
136119	136181	136116	136116	he	100	" let it be for yourself alone . That the wish of giving happiness to you , might add force to the other inducements which led me on , I shall not attempt to deny . But your _ family _ owe me nothing . Much as I respect them , I believe , I thought only of _ you _ . "
136201	136251	136197	136198	her companion	1696	" You are too generous to trifle with me . If your feelings are still what they were last April , tell me so at once . _ My _ affections and wishes are unchanged , but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever . "
136577	136584	136586	136586	he	1696	" It taught me to hope , "
136588	136635	136586	136586	he	1696	" as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before . I knew enough of your disposition to be certain , that , had you been absolutely , irrevocably decided against me , you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine , frankly and openly . "
136644	136686	136641	136641	she	93	" Yes , you know enough of my _ frankness _ to believe me capable of _ that _ . After abusing you so abominably to your face , I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations . "
136687	136743	136567	136568	her ladyship	677	" What did you say of me , that I did not deserve ? For , though your accusations were ill - founded , formed on mistaken premises , my behaviour to you at the time , had merited the severest reproof . It was unpardonable . I can not think of it without abhorrence . "
136744	136760	136762	136762	Elizabeth	93	" We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening , "
136764	136793	136762	136762	Elizabeth	93	" The conduct of neither , if strictly examined , will be irreproachable ; but since then , we have both , I hope , improved in civility . "
136794	136904	136567	136568	her ladyship	677	" I can not be so easily reconciled to myself . The recollection of what I then said , of my conduct , my manners , my expressions during the whole of it , is now , and has been many months , inexpressibly painful to me . Your reproof , so well applied , I shall never forget : ' had you behaved in a more gentleman - like manner . ' Those were your words . You know not , you can scarcely conceive , how they have tortured me;--though it was some time , I confess , before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice . "
136905	136937	136762	136762	Elizabeth	93	" I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression . I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way . "
136938	136994	136567	136568	her ladyship	677	" I can easily believe it . You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling , I am sure you did . The turn of your countenance I shall never forget , as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way , that would induce you to accept me . "
136995	137029	136762	136762	Elizabeth	93	" Oh ! do not repeat what I then said . These recollections will not do at all . I assure you , that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it . "
137035	137039	137041	137041	he	100	" Did it , "
137043	137070	137041	137041	he	100	" did it _ soon _ make you think better of me ? Did you , on reading it , give any credit to its contents ? "
137092	137096	137098	137098	he	100	" I knew , "
137100	137159	137098	137098	he	100	" that what I wrote must give you pain , but it was necessary . I hope you have destroyed the letter . There was one part especially , the opening of it , which I should dread your having the power of reading again . I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me . "
137160	137210	137085	137085	her	2892	" The letter shall certainly be burnt , if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard ; but , though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable , they are not , I hope , quite so easily changed as that implies . "
137211	137218	137220	137220	Darcy	100	" When I wrote that letter , "
137222	137247	137220	137220	Darcy	100	" I believed myself perfectly calm and cool , but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit . "
137248	137337	137085	137085	her	2892	" The letter , perhaps , began in bitterness , but it did not end so . The adieu is charity itself . But think no more of the letter . The feelings of the person who wrote , and the person who received it , are now so widely different from what they were then , that every unpleasant circumstance attending it , ought to be forgotten . You must learn some of my philosophy . Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure . "
137338	137647	137220	137220	Darcy	100	" I can not give you credit for any philosophy of the kind . _ Your _ retrospections must be so totally void of reproach , that the contentment arising from them , is not of philosophy , but what is much better , of ignorance . But with _ me _ , it is not so . Painful recollections will intrude , which can not , which ought not to be repelled . I have been a selfish being all my life , in practice , though not in principle . As a child I was taught what was _ right _ , but I was not taught to correct my temper . I was given good principles , but left to follow them in pride and conceit . Unfortunately an only son , ( for many years an only _ child _ ) I was spoilt by my parents , who though good themselves , ( my father particularly , all that was benevolent and amiable , ) allowed , encouraged , almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing , to care for none beyond my own family circle , to think meanly of all the rest of the world , to _ wish _ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own . Such I was , from eight to eight and twenty ; and such I might still have been but for you , dearest , loveliest Elizabeth ! What do I not owe you ! You taught me a lesson , hard indeed at first , but most advantageous . By you , I was properly humbled . I came to you without a doubt of my reception . You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased . "
137648	137658	137959	137959	his	100	" Had you then persuaded yourself that I should ? "
137659	137683	137220	137220	Darcy	100	" Indeed I had . What will you think of my vanity ? I believed you to be wishing , expecting my addresses . "
137684	137728	137959	137959	his	100	" My manners must have been in fault , but not intentionally I assure you . I never meant to deceive you , but my spirits might often lead me wrong . How you must have hated me after _ that _ evening ? "
137729	137751	137220	137220	Darcy	100	" Hate you ! I was angry perhaps at first , but my anger soon began to take a proper direction . "
137752	137777	137959	137959	his	100	" I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me ; when we met at Pemberley . You blamed me for coming ? "
137778	137788	137220	137220	Darcy	100	" No indeed ; I felt nothing but surprise . "
137789	137834	137959	137959	his	100	" Your surprise could not be greater than _ mine _ in being noticed by you . My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness , and I confess that I did not expect to receive _ more _ than my due . "
137835	137842	137844	137844	Darcy	100	" My object _ then _ , "
137846	137923	137844	137844	Darcy	100	" was to shew you , by every civility in my power , that I was not so mean as to resent the past ; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness , to lessen your ill opinion , by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to . How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell , but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you . "
138063	138073	138094	138095	his friend	307	" What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane ! "
138105	138114	138116	138116	Elizabeth	93	" I must ask whether you were surprised ? "
138118	138136	138094	138095	his friend	307	" Not at all . When I went away , I felt that it would soon happen . "
138137	138154	138157	138157	he	100	" That is to say , you had given your permission . I guessed as much . "
138174	138184	138186	138186	he	100	" On the evening before my going to London , "
138187	138290	138157	138157	he	100	" I made a confession to him , which I believe I ought to have made long ago . I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs , absurd and impertinent . His surprise was great . He had never had the slightest suspicion . I told him , moreover , that I believed myself mistaken in supposing , as I had done , that your sister was indifferent to him ; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated , I felt no doubt of their happiness together . "
138305	138314	138316	138316	she	93	" Did you speak from your own observation , "
138318	138337	138316	138316	she	93	" when you told him that my sister loved him , or merely from my information last spring ? "
138338	138368	138302	138303	his friend	307	" From the former . I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here ; and I was convinced of her affection . "
138369	138385	138316	138316	she	93	" And your assurance of it , I suppose , carried immediate conviction to him . "
138386	138509	138302	138303	his friend	307	" It did . Bingley is most unaffectedly modest . His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case , but his reliance on mine , made every thing easy . I was obliged to confess one thing , which for a time , and not unjustly , offended him . I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter , that I had known it , and purposely kept it from him . He was angry . But his anger , I am persuaded , lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister 's sentiments . He has heartily forgiven me now . "
138598	138611	138579	138579	he	90	" My dear Lizzy , where can you have been walking to ? "
138836	138868	138811	138811	she	93	" You are joking , Lizzy . This can not be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy ! No , no , you shall not deceive me . I know it to be impossible . "
138869	138925	138811	138811	she	93	" This is a wretched beginning indeed ! My sole dependence was on you ; and I am sure nobody else will believe me , if you do not . Yet , indeed , I am in earnest . I speak nothing but the truth . He still loves me , and we are engaged . "
138932	138950	138926	138926	Jane	94	" Oh , Lizzy ! it can not be . I know how much you dislike him . "
138951	139007	138811	138811	she	93	" You know nothing of the matter . _ That _ is all to be forgot . Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now . But in such cases as these , a good memory is unpardonable . This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself . "
139027	139044	139046	139046	Jane	94	" Good Heaven ! can it be really so ! Yet now I must believe you , "
139048	139084	139046	139046	Jane	94	" My dear , dear Lizzy , I would -- I do congratulate you -- but are you certain ? forgive the question -- are you quite certain that you can be happy with him ? "
139085	139129	138811	138811	she	93	" There can be no doubt of that . It is settled between us already , that we are to be the happiest couple in the world . But are you pleased , Jane ? Shall you like to have such a brother ? "
139130	139194	139046	139046	Jane	94	" Very , very much . Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight . But we considered it , we talked of it as impossible . And do you really love him quite well enough ? Oh , Lizzy ! do any thing rather than marry without affection . Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ? "
139195	139221	138811	138811	she	93	" Oh , yes ! You will only think I feel _ more _ than I ought to do , when I tell you all . "
139222	139228	139046	139046	Jane	94	" What do you mean ? "
139229	139254	138811	138811	she	93	" Why , I must confess , that I love him better than I do Bingley . I am afraid you will be angry . "
139255	139299	139046	139046	Jane	94	" My dearest sister , now _ be _ be serious . I want to talk very seriously . Let me know every thing that I am to know , without delay . Will you tell me how long you have loved him ? "
139300	139334	138811	138811	she	93	" It has been coming on so gradually , that I hardly know when it began . But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley . "
139376	139383	139385	139385	she	2913	" Now I am quite happy , "
139387	139489	139385	139385	she	2913	" for you will be as happy as myself . I always had a value for him . Were it for nothing but his love of you , I must always have esteemed him ; but now , as Bingley 's friend and your husband , there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me . But Lizzy , you have been very sly , very reserved with me . How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton ! I owe all that I know of it , to another , not to you . "
139560	139564	139566	139567	Mrs. Bennet	96	" Good gracious ! "
139579	139661	139570	139570	she	96	" if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley ! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here ? I had no notion but he would go a shooting , or something or other , and not disturb us with his company . What shall we do with him ? Lizzy , you must walk out with him again , that he may not be in Bingley 's way . "
139725	139747	139719	139719	he	90	" Mr. Bennet , have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to - day ? "
139748	139760	139762	139763	Mrs. Bennet	96	" I advise Mr. Darcy , and Lizzy , and Kitty , "
139765	139790	139762	139763	Mrs. Bennet	96	" to walk to Oakham Mount this morning . It is a nice long walk , and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view . "
139791	139801	139803	139804	Mr. Bingley	90	" It may do very well for the others , "
139806	139825	139803	139804	Mr. Bingley	90	" but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty . Wo nt it , Kitty ? "
139870	139937	139863	139864	Mrs. Bennet	96	" I am quite sorry , Lizzy , that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself . But I hope you will not mind it : it is all for Jane 's sake , you know ; and there is no occasion for talking to him , except just now and then . So , do not put yourself to inconvenience . "
140215	140228	140229	140229	She	93	" Go to your father , he wants you in the library . "
140247	140250	140252	140252	he	264	" Lizzy , "
140254	140280	140252	140252	he	264	" what are you doing ? Are you out of your senses , to be accepting this man ? Have not you always hated him ? "
140339	140380	140325	140325	she	93	" Or in other words , you are determined to have him . He is rich , to be sure , and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane . But will they make you happy ? "
140381	140388	140390	140390	Elizabeth	93	" Have you any other objection , "
140392	140400	140390	140390	Elizabeth	93	" than your belief of my indifference ? "
140401	140431	140325	140325	she	93	" None at all . We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of man ; but this would be nothing if you really liked him . "
140432	140441	140442	140442	she	93	" I do , I do like him , "
140451	140491	140442	140442	she	93	" I love him . Indeed he has no improper pride . He is perfectly amiable . You do not know what he really is ; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms . "
140492	140495	140497	140498	her father	264	" Lizzy , "
140500	140649	140497	140498	her father	264	" I have given him my consent . He is the kind of man , indeed , to whom I should never dare refuse any thing , which he condescended to ask . I now give it to _ you _ , if you are resolved on having him . But let me advise you to think better of it . I know your disposition , Lizzy . I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable , unless you truly esteemed your husband ; unless you looked up to him as a superior . Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage . You could scarcely escape discredit and misery . My child , let me not have the grief of seeing _ you _ unable to respect your partner in life . You know not what you are about . "
140744	140750	140752	140752	he	100	" Well , my dear , "
140759	140794	140752	140752	he	100	" I have no more to say . If this be the case , he deserves you . I could not have parted with you , my Lizzy , to any one less worthy . "
140820	140936	140801	140801	she	93	" This is an evening of wonders , indeed ! And so , Darcy did every thing ; made up the match , gave the money , paid the fellow 's debts , and got him his commission ! So much the better . It will save me a world of trouble and economy . Had it been your uncle 's doing , I must and _ would _ have paid him ; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way . I shall offer to pay him to - morrow ; he will rant and storm about his love for you , and there will be an end of the matter . "
140978	141000	140973	140973	she	93	" If any young men come for Mary or Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at leisure . "
141198	141346	141196	141196	herself	96	" Good gracious ! Lord bless me ! only think ! dear me ! Mr. Darcy ! Who would have thought it ! And is it really true ? Oh ! my sweetest Lizzy ! how rich and how great you will be ! What pin - money , what jewels , what carriages you will have ! Jane 's is nothing to it -- nothing at all . I am so pleased -- so happy . Such a charming man!--so handsome ! so tall!--Oh , my dear Lizzy ! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before . I hope he will overlook it . Dear , dear Lizzy . A house in town ! Every thing that is charming ! Three daughters married ! Ten thousand a year ! Oh , Lord ! What will become of me . I shall go distracted . "
141395	141400	141401	141401	she	261	" My dearest child , "
141404	141471	141401	141401	she	261	" I can think of nothing else ! Ten thousand a year , and very likely more ! ' Tis as good as a Lord ! And a special licence . You must and shall be married by a special licence . But my dearest love , tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of , that I may have it to - morrow . "
141611	141624	141626	141626	he	86	" I admire all my three sons - in - law highly , "
141628	141654	141626	141626	he	86	" Wickham , perhaps , is my favourite ; but I think I shall like _ your _ husband quite as well as Jane 's . "
141683	141689	141691	141691	she	93	" How could you begin ? "
141693	141721	141691	141691	she	93	" I can comprehend your going on charmingly , when you had once made a beginning ; but what could set you off in the first place ? "
141722	141769	141667	141667	she	93	" I can not fix on the hour , or the spot , or the look , or the words , which laid the foundation . It is too long ago . I was in the middle before I knew that I _ had _ begun . "
141770	141827	141691	141691	she	93	" My beauty you had early withstood , and as for my manners -- my behaviour to _ you _ was at least always bordering on the uncivil , and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not . Now be sincere ; did you admire me for my impertinence ? "
141828	141839	141667	141667	she	93	" For the liveliness of your mind , I did . "
141840	142016	141691	141691	she	93	" You may as well call it impertinence at once . It was very little less . The fact is , that you were sick of civility , of deference , of officious attention . You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking , and thinking for _ your _ approbation alone . I roused , and interested you , because I was so unlike _ them _ . Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it ; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself , your feelings were always noble and just ; and in your heart , you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you . There -- I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it ; and really , all things considered , I begin to think it perfectly reasonable . To be sure , you knew no actual good of me -- but nobody thinks of _ that _ when they fall in love . "
142017	142036	141667	141667	she	93	" Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane , while she was ill at Netherfield ? "
142037	142161	141691	141691	she	93	" Dearest Jane ! who could have done less for her ? But make a virtue of it by all means . My good qualities are under your protection , and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible ; and , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be ; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last . What made you so shy of me , when you first called , and afterwards dined here ? Why , especially , when you called , did you look as if you did not care about me ? "
142162	142176	141667	141667	she	93	" Because you were grave and silent , and gave me no encouragement . "
142177	142183	141691	141691	she	93	" But I was embarrassed . "
142184	142189	141667	141667	she	93	" And so was I. "
142190	142204	141691	141691	she	93	" You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner . "
142205	142215	141667	141667	she	93	" A man who had felt less , might . "
142216	142335	141691	141691	she	93	" How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give , and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it ! But I wonder how long you _ would _ have gone on , if you had been left to yourself . I wonder when you _ would _ have spoken , if I had not asked you ! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect . _ Too much _ , I am afraid ; for what becomes of the moral , if our comfort springs from a breach of promise , for I ought not to have mentioned the subject ? This will never do . "
142336	142420	141667	141667	she	93	" You need not distress yourself . The moral will be perfectly fair . Lady Catherine 's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us , were the means of removing all my doubts . I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude . I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of your 's . My aunt 's intelligence had given me hope , and I was determined at once to know every thing . "
142421	142478	141691	141691	she	93	" Lady Catherine has been of infinite use , which ought to make her happy , for she loves to be of use . But tell me , what did you come down to Netherfield for ? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed ? or had you intended any more serious consequence ? "
142479	142549	141667	141667	she	93	" My real purpose was to see _ you _ , and to judge , if I could , whether I might ever hope to make you love me . My avowed one , or what I avowed to myself , was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley , and if she were , to make the confession to him which I have since made . "
142550	142568	141691	141691	she	93	" Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine , what is to befall her ? "
142569	142606	141667	141667	she	93	" I am more likely to want time than courage , Elizabeth . But it ought to be done , and if you will give me a sheet of paper , it shall be done directly . "
142607	142655	141691	141691	she	93	" And if I had not a letter to write myself , I might sit by you , and admire the evenness of your writing , as another young lady once did . But I have an aunt , too , who must not be longer neglected . "
142728	142953	142702	142702	she	93	" I would have thanked you before , my dear aunt , as I ought to have done , for your long , kind , satisfactory , detail of particulars ; but to say the truth , I was too cross to write . You supposed more than really existed . But _ now _ suppose as much as you chuse ; give a loose to your fancy , indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford , and unless you believe me actually married , you can not greatly err . You must write again very soon , and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last . I thank you , again and again , for not going to the Lakes . How could I be so silly as to wish it ! Your idea of the ponies is delightful . We will go round the Park every day . I am the happiest creature in the world . Perhaps other people have said so before , but not one with such justice . I am happier even than Jane ; she only smiles , I laugh . Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world , that he can spare from me . You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas .
142959	142959	142702	142702	she	93	"
142995	142999	142702	142702	she	93	" DEAR SIR , "
143000	143049	142982	142983	Mr. Bennet	86	" I must trouble you once more for congratulations . Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy . Console Lady Catherine as well as you can . But , if I were you , I would stand by the nephew . He has more to give . "
143050	143057	143096	143096	her	102	" Your 's sincerely , & c. "
144135	144140	144279	144279	she	93	" MY DEAR LIZZY , "
144141	144260	144282	144282	her	93	" I wish you joy . If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham , you must be very happy . It is a great comfort to have you so rich , and when you have nothing else to do , I hope you will think of us . I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much , and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help . Any place would do , of about three or four hundred a year ; but , however , do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it , if you had rather not . "
144261	144266	144279	144279	she	93	" Yours , & c. "
