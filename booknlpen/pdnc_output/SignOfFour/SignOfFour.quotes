290	298	299	299	I	0	" Which is it to - day ? "
302	307	299	299	I	0	" morphine or cocaine ? "
325	330	331	331	he	105	" It is cocaine , "
334	351	331	331	he	105	" a seven - per - cent . solution . Would you care to try it ? "
352	357	358	358	I	0	" No , indeed , "
363	387	358	358	I	0	" My constitution has not got over the Afghan campaign yet . I can not afford to throw any extra strain upon it . "
394	402	403	403	he	105	" Perhaps you are right , Watson , "
406	443	403	403	he	105	" I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one . I find it , however , so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment . "
444	448	449	449	I	0	" But consider ! "
454	571	449	449	I	0	" Count the cost ! Your brain may , as you say , be roused and excited , but it is a pathological and morbid process , which involves increased tissue - change and may at last leave a permanent weakness . You know , too , what a black reaction comes upon you . Surely the game is hardly worth the candle . Why should you , for a mere passing pleasure , risk the loss of those great powers with which you have been endowed ? Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to another , but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to some extent answerable . "
609	613	614	614	he	105	" My mind , "
617	700	614	614	he	105	" rebels at stagnation . Give me problems , give me work , give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis , and I am in my own proper atmosphere . I can dispense then with artificial stimulants . But I abhor the dull routine of existence . I crave for mental exaltation . That is why I have chosen my own particular profession , or rather created it , for I am the only one in the world . "
701	707	708	708	I	0	" The only unofficial detective ? "
715	722	723	723	he	105	" The only unofficial consulting detective , "
726	837	723	723	he	105	" I am the last and highest court of appeal in detection . When Gregson or Lestrade or Athelney Jones are out of their depths which , by the way , is their normal state the matter is laid before me . I examine the data , as an expert , and pronounce a specialist s opinion . I claim no credit in such cases . My name figures in no newspaper . The work itself , the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers , is my highest reward . But you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case . "
838	843	845	845	I	0	" Yes , indeed , "
849	880	845	845	I	0	" I was never so struck by anything in my life . I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat fantastic title of A Study in Scarlet . "
887	893	895	895	he	198	" I glanced over it , "
897	965	895	895	he	198	" Honestly , I can not congratulate you upon it . Detection is , or ought to be , an exact science , and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional manner . You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism , which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love - story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid . "
966	973	974	974	I	0	" But the romance was there , "
977	986	974	974	I	0	" I could not tamper with the facts . "
987	1035	895	895	he	198	" Some facts should be suppressed , or at least a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them . The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes by which I succeeded in unraveling it . "
1162	1172	1174	1174	Holmes	105	" My practice has extended recently to the Continent , "
1189	1317	1318	1318	He	105	" I was consulted last week by Fran ois Le Villard , who , as you probably know , has come rather to the front lately in the French detective service . He has all the Celtic power of quick intuition , but he is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his art . The case was concerned with a will , and possessed some features of interest . I was able to refer him to two parallel cases , the one at Riga in 1857 , and the other at St. Louis in 1871 , which have suggested to him the true solution . Here is the letter which I had this morning acknowledging my assistance . "
1350	1353	1333	1333	I	0	" magnifiques , "
1354	1362	1333	1333	I	0	" coup - de - ma tres , "
1364	1371	1333	1333	I	0	" tours - de - force , "
1382	1392	1394	1394	I.	0	" He speaks as a pupil to his master , "
1395	1405	1407	1408	Sherlock Holmes	105	" Oh , he rates my assistance too highly , "
1412	1468	1407	1408	Sherlock Holmes	105	" He has considerable gifts himself . He possesses two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective . He has the power of observation and that of deduction . He is only wanting in knowledge ; and that may come in time . He is now translating my small works into French . "
1469	1473	1333	1333	I	0	" Your works ? "
1474	1482	1483	1483	he	105	" Oh , didn t you know ? "
1488	1645	1483	1483	he	105	" Yes , I have been guilty of several monographs . They are all upon technical subjects . Here , for example , is one Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccoes . In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar- , cigarette- , and pipe - tobacco , with coloured plates illustrating the difference in the ash . It is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials , and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue . If you can say definitely , for example , that some murder has been done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah , it obviously narrows your field of search . To the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird s - eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato . "
1646	1655	1656	1656	I	0	" You have an extraordinary genius for minuti , "
1659	1770	1483	1483	he	105	" I appreciate their importance . Here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps , with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a preserver of impresses . Here , too , is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand , with lithotypes of the hands of slaters , sailors , corkcutters , compositors , weavers , and diamond - polishers . That is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective , especially in cases of unclaimed bodies , or in discovering the antecedents of criminals . But I weary you with my hobby . "
1771	1776	1777	1777	I	0	" Not at all , "
1782	1827	1777	1777	I	0	" It is of the greatest interest to me , especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it . But you spoke just now of observation and deduction . Surely the one to some extent implies the other . "
1828	1833	1834	1834	he	202	" Why , hardly , "
1856	1890	1834	1834	he	202	" For example , observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street Post - Office this morning , but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram . "
1891	1894	1896	1896	I.	0	" Right ! "
1897	1935	1834	1834	he	202	" Right on both points ! But I confess that I don t see how you arrived at it . It was a sudden impulse upon my part , and I have mentioned it to no one . "
1936	1942	1943	1943	he	202	" It is simplicity itself , "
1951	2060	1943	1943	he	202	" so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous ; and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction . Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep . Just opposite the Seymour Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering . The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found , as far as I know , nowhere else in the neighbourhood . So much is observation . The rest is deduction . "
2061	2072	1834	1834	he	202	" How , then , did you deduce the telegram ? "
2073	2155	1943	1943	he	202	" Why , of course I knew that you had not written a letter , since I sat opposite to you all morning . I see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post - cards . What could you go into the post - office for , then , but to send a wire ? Eliminate all other factors , and the one which remains must be the truth . "
2156	2165	2166	2166	I	0	" In this case it certainly is so , "
2174	2208	2166	2166	I	0	" The thing , however , is , as you say , of the simplest . Would you think me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test ? "
2209	2214	2215	2215	he	203	" On the contrary , "
2218	2247	2215	2215	he	203	" it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine . I should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me . "
2248	2325	2166	2166	I	0	" I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it . Now , I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession . Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner ? "
2430	2437	2438	2438	he	203	" There are hardly any data , "
2441	2458	2438	2438	he	203	" The watch has been recently cleaned , which robs me of my most suggestive facts . "
2459	2464	2465	2465	I	0	" You are right , "
2468	2478	2465	2465	I	0	" It was cleaned before being sent to me . "
2510	2522	2523	2523	he	203	" Though unsatisfactory , my research has not been entirely barren , "
2539	2564	2523	2523	he	203	" Subject to your correction , I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother , who inherited it from your father . "
2565	2581	2497	2497	his	203	" That you gather , no doubt , from the H. W. upon the back ? "
2582	2673	2523	2523	he	203	" Quite so . The W. suggests your own name . The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back , and the initials are as old as the watch : so it was made for the last generation . Jewelry usually descends to the eldest son , and he is most likely to have the same name as the father . Your father has , if I remember right , been dead many years . It has , therefore , been in the hands of your eldest brother . "
2674	2680	2682	2682	I.	205	" Right , so far , "
2683	2687	2523	2523	he	203	" Anything else ? "
2688	2746	2682	2682	I.	205	" He was a man of untidy habits , very untidy and careless . He was left with good prospects , but he threw away his chances , lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity , and finally , taking to drink , he died . That is all I can gather . "
2765	2774	2775	2775	I	0	" This is unworthy of you , Holmes , "
2778	2853	2775	2775	I	0	" I could not have believed that you would have descended to this . You have made inquires into the history of my unhappy brother , and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way . You can not expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch ! It is unkind , and , to speak plainly , has a touch of charlatanism in it . "
2854	2859	2861	2861	he	207	" My dear doctor , "
2865	2917	2861	2861	he	207	" pray accept my apologies . Viewing the matter as an abstract problem , I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you . I assure you , however , that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch . "
2918	2943	2775	2775	I	0	" Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts ? They are absolutely correct in every particular . "
2944	2974	2861	2861	he	207	" Ah , that is good luck . I could only say what was the balance of probability . I did not at all expect to be so accurate . "
2975	2985	2775	2775	I	0	" But it was not mere guess - work ? "
2986	3154	2861	2861	he	207	" No , no : I never guess . It is a shocking habit , destructive to the logical faculty . What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend . For example , I began by stating that your brother was careless . When you observe the lower part of that watch - case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places , but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects , such as coins or keys , in the same pocket . Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty - guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man . Neither is it a very far - fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects . "
3166	3356	3533	3534	our landlady	210	" It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England , when they take a watch , to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin - point upon the inside of the case . It is more handy than a label , as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed . There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case . Inference , that your brother was often at low water . Secondary inference , that he had occasional bursts of prosperity , or he could not have redeemed the pledge . Finally , I ask you to look at the inner plate , which contains the key - hole . Look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole , marks where the key has slipped . What sober man s key could have scored those grooves ? But you will never see a drunkard s watch without them . He winds it at night , and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand . Where is the mystery in all this ? "
3357	3365	3366	3366	I	0	" It is as clear as daylight , "
3369	3404	3366	3366	I	0	" I regret the injustice which I did you . I should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty . May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present ? "
3405	3516	3533	3534	our landlady	210	" None . Hence the cocaine . I can not live without brain - work . What else is there to live for ? Stand at the window here . Was ever such a dreary , dismal , unprofitable world ? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the dun - coloured houses . What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material ? What is the use of having powers , doctor , when one has no field upon which to exert them ? Crime is commonplace , existence is commonplace , and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth . "
3545	3554	3555	3555	she	210	" A young lady for you , sir , "
3562	3567	3568	3568	he	195	" Miss Mary Morstan , "
3571	3606	3568	3568	he	195	" Hum ! I have no recollection of the name . Ask the young lady to step up , Mrs. Hudson . Don t go , doctor . I should prefer that you remain . "
3811	3821	3822	3822	she	112	" I have come to you , Mr. Holmes , "
3825	3854	3822	3822	she	112	" because you once enabled my employer , Mrs. Cecil Forrester , to unravel a little domestic complication . She was much impressed by your kindness and skill . "
3855	3860	3861	3861	he	105	" Mrs. Cecil Forrester , "
3865	3894	3861	3861	he	105	" I believe that I was of some slight service to her . The case , however , as I remember it , was a very simple one . "
3895	3935	3959	3959	his	105	" She did not think so . But at least you can not say the same of mine . I can hardly imagine anything more strange , more utterly inexplicable , than the situation in which I find myself . "
3967	3972	3974	3974	he	105	" State your case , "
3992	4003	4004	4004	I	0	" You will , I am sure , excuse me , "
4028	4033	4034	4034	she	766	" If your friend , "
4037	4054	4034	4034	she	766	" would be good enough to stop , he might be of inestimable service to me . "
4061	4064	4065	4065	she	766	" Briefly , "
4068	4316	4065	4065	she	766	" the facts are these . My father was an officer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite a child . My mother was dead , and I had no relative in England . I was placed , however , in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh , and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age . In the year 1878 my father , who was senior captain of his regiment , obtained twelve months leave and came home . He telegraphed to me from London that he had arrived all safe , and directed me to come down at once , giving the Langham Hotel as his address . His message , as I remember , was full of kindness and love . On reaching London I drove to the Langham , and was informed that Captain Morstan was staying there , but that he had gone out the night before and had not yet returned . I waited all day without news of him . That night , on the advice of the manager of the hotel , I communicated with the police , and next morning we advertised in all the papers . Our inquiries led to no result ; and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father . He came home with his heart full of hope , to find some peace , some comfort , and instead "
4334	4338	4340	4340	Holmes	105	" The date ? "
4348	4364	4065	4065	she	766	" He disappeared upon the 3rd of December , 1878 , nearly ten years ago . "
4365	4369	4065	4065	she	766	" His luggage ? "
4370	4419	4065	4065	she	766	" Remained at the hotel . There was nothing in it to suggest a clue , some clothes , some books , and a considerable number of curiosities from the Andaman Islands . He had been one of the officers in charge of the convict - guard there . "
4420	4428	4065	4065	she	766	" Had he any friends in town ? "
4429	4487	4065	4065	she	766	" Only one that we know of , Major Sholto , of his own regiment , the 34th Bombay Infantry . The major had retired some little time before , and lived at Upper Norwood . We communicated with him , of course , but he did not even know that his brother officer was in England . "
4488	4493	4495	4495	Holmes	105	" A singular case , "
4497	4688	4689	4689	She	218	" I have not yet described to you the most singular part . About six years ago to be exact , upon the 4th of May , 1882 an advertisement appeared in the _ Times _ asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward . There was no name or address appended . I had at that time just entered the family of Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess . By her advice I published my address in the advertisement column . The same day there arrived through the post a small card - board box addressed to me , which I found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl . No word of writing was enclosed . Since then every year upon the same date there has always appeared a similar box , containing a similar pearl , without any clue as to the sender . They have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value . You can see for yourselves that they are very handsome . "
4712	4719	4721	4722	Sherlock Holmes	105	" Your statement is most interesting , "
4724	4732	4721	4722	Sherlock Holmes	105	" Has anything else occurred to you ? "
4733	4768	4695	4695	she	218	" Yes , and no later than to - day . That is why I have come to you . This morning I received this letter , which you will perhaps read for yourself . "
4769	4773	4775	4775	Holmes	105	" Thank you , "
4777	4907	4775	4775	Holmes	105	" The envelope too , please . Postmark , London , S.W. Date , July 7 . Hum ! Man s thumb - mark on corner , probably postman . Best quality paper . Envelopes at sixpence a packet . Particular man in his stationery . No address . Be at the third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to - night at seven o clock . If you are distrustful , bring two friends . You are a wronged woman , and shall have justice . Do not bring police . If you do , all will be in vain . Your unknown friend . Well , really , this is a very pretty little mystery . What do you intend to do , Miss Morstan ? "
4908	4919	4972	4972	her	219	" That is exactly what I want to ask you . "
4920	4957	4775	4775	Holmes	105	" Then we shall most certainly go . You and I and yes , why , Dr. Watson is the very man . Your correspondent says two friends . He and I have worked together before . "
4958	4964	4965	4965	she	219	" But would he come ? "
4977	4985	4987	4987	I	0	" I should be proud and happy , "
4991	5000	4987	4987	I	0	" if I can be of any service . "
5001	5008	5009	5009	she	219	" You are both very kind , "
5012	5043	5009	5009	she	219	" I have led a retired life , and have no friends whom I could appeal to . If I am here at six it will do , I suppose ? "
5044	5051	5053	5053	Holmes	105	" You must not be later , "
5055	5078	5053	5053	Holmes	105	" There is one other point , however . Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl - box addresses ? "
5079	5085	5086	5086	she	219	" I have them here , "
5097	5117	5118	5118	He	105	" You are certainly a model client . You have the correct intuition . Let us see , now . "
5138	5148	5149	5149	he	105	" They are disguised hands , except the letter , "
5154	5223	5149	5149	he	105	" but there can be no question as to the authorship . See how the irrepressible Greek _ e _ will break out , and see the twirl of the final _ s _ . They are undoubtedly by the same person . I should not like to suggest false hopes , Miss Morstan , but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father ? "
5224	5231	5313	5313	she	221	" Nothing could be more unlike . "
5232	5285	5149	5149	he	105	" I expected to hear you say so . We shall look out for you , then , at six . Pray allow me to keep the papers . I may look into the matter before then . It is only half - past three . _ Au revoir _ , then . "
5286	5292	5294	5295	our visitor	221	" _ Au revoir _ , "
5356	5363	5364	5364	I	0	" What a very attractive woman ! "
5387	5391	5392	5392	he	195	" Is she ? "
5397	5403	5392	5392	he	195	" I did not observe . "
5404	5416	5417	5417	I	0	" You really are an automaton , a calculating - machine ! "
5420	5431	5417	5417	I	0	" There is something positively inhuman in you at times . "
5436	5444	5445	5445	he	195	" It is of the first importance , "
5448	5534	5445	5445	he	195	" not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities . A client is to me a mere unit , a factor in a problem . The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning . I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance - money , and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor . "
5535	5541	5417	5417	I	0	" In this case , however "
5542	5575	5445	5445	he	195	" I never make exceptions . An exception disproves the rule . Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting ? What do you make of this fellow s scribble ? "
5576	5583	5584	5584	I	0	" It is legible and regular , "
5587	5599	5584	5584	I	0	" A man of business habits and some force of character . "
5605	5612	5613	5613	he	105	" Look at his long letters , "
5616	5723	5613	5613	he	105	" They hardly rise above the common herd . That _ d _ might be an _ a _ , and that _ l _ an _ e _ . Men of character always differentiate their long letters , however illegibly they may write . There is vacillation in his _ k _ s and self - esteem in his capitals . I am going out now . I have some few references to make . Let me recommend this book , one of the most remarkable ever penned . It is Winwood Reade s Martyrdom of Man . I shall be back in an hour . "
5964	5974	5975	5975	he	105	" There is no great mystery in this matter , "
5991	6002	5975	5975	he	105	" The facts appear to admit of only one explanation . "
6003	6012	5939	5939	He	105	" What ! you have solved it already ? "
6013	6093	5975	5975	he	105	" Well , that would be too much to say . I have discovered a suggestive fact , that is all . It is , however , _ very _ suggestive . The details are still to be added . I have just found , on consulting the back files of the _ Times _ , that Major Sholto , of Upper Norword , late of the 34th Bombay Infantry , died upon the 28th of April , 1882 . "
6094	6112	5939	5939	He	105	" I may be very obtuse , Holmes , but I fail to see what this suggests . "
6113	6257	5975	5975	he	105	" No ? You surprise me . Look at it in this way , then . Captain Morstan disappears . The only person in London whom he could have visited is Major Sholto . Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London . Four years later Sholto dies . _ Within a week of his death _ Captain Morstan s daughter receives a valuable present , which is repeated from year to year , and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman . What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father ? And why should the presents begin immediately after Sholto s death , unless it is that Sholto s heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation ? Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts ? "
6258	6329	6403	6403	my	0	" But what a strange compensation ! And how strangely made ! Why , too , should he write a letter now , rather than six years ago ? Again , the letter speaks of giving her justice . What justice can she have ? It is too much to suppose that her father is still alive . There is no other injustice in her case that you know of . "
6330	6340	6342	6343	Sherlock Holmes	105	" There are difficulties ; there are certainly difficulties , "
6347	6396	6342	6343	Sherlock Holmes	105	" But our expedition of to - night will solve them all . Ah , here is a four - wheeler , and Miss Morstan is inside . Are you all ready ? Then we had better go down , for it is a little past the hour . "
6508	6520	6521	6521	she	112	" Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa s , "
6524	6610	6521	6521	she	112	" His letters were full of allusions to the major . He and papa were in command of the troops at the Andaman Islands , so they were thrown a great deal together . By the way , a curious paper was found in papa s desk which no one could understand . I don t suppose that it is of the slightest importance , but I thought you might care to see it , so I brought it with me . It is here . "
6637	6646	6647	6647	he	105	" It is paper of native Indian manufacture , "
6650	6810	6647	6647	he	105	" It has at some time been pinned to a board . The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls , corridors , and passages . At one point is a small cross done in red ink , and above it is 3.37 from left , in faded pencil - writing . In the left - hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching . Beside it is written , in very rough and coarse characters , The sign of the four , Jonathan Small , Mahomet Singh , Abdullah Khan , Dost Akbar . No , I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the matter . Yet it is evidently a document of importance . It has been kept carefully in a pocket - book ; for the one side is as clean as the other . "
6811	6824	6896	6896	he	105	" It was in his pocket - book that we found it . "
6825	6875	6647	6647	he	105	" Preserve it carefully , then , Miss Morstan , for it may prove to be of use to us . I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed . I must reconsider my ideas . "
7252	7263	7264	7264	he	236	" Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan ? "
7267	7281	7283	7283	she	249	" I am Miss Morstan , and these two gentlemen are my friends , "
7298	7306	7307	7307	he	236	" You will excuse me , miss , "
7315	7338	7307	7307	he	236	" but I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police - officer . "
7339	7348	7349	7349	she	249	" I give you my word on that , "
7652	7656	7658	7658	he	105	" Rochester Row , "
7660	7706	7658	7658	he	105	" Now Vincent Square . Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road . We are making for the Surrey side , apparently . Yes , I thought so . Now we are on the bridge . You can catch glimpses of the river . "
7751	7755	7757	7758	my companion	195	" Wordsworth Road , "
7760	7791	7757	7758	my companion	195	" Priory Road . Lark Hall Lane . Stockwell Place . Robert Street . Cold Harbor Lane . Our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions . "
7971	7977	7979	7979	he	275	" The Sahib awaits you , "
7997	8006	7984	7984	he	275	" Show them in to me , khitmutgar , "
8010	8018	7984	7984	he	275	" Show them straight in to me . "
8220	8227	8228	8228	he	279	" Your servant , Miss Morstan , "
8239	8277	8228	8228	he	279	" Your servant , gentlemen . Pray step into my little sanctum . A small place , miss , but furnished to my own liking . An oasis of art in the howling desert of South London . "
8442	8447	8449	8451	the little man	286	" Mr. Thaddeus Sholto , "
8458	8475	8449	8451	the little man	286	" That is my name . You are Miss Morstan , of course . And these gentlemen "
8476	8489	8575	8575	he	279	" This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes , and this is Dr. Watson . "
8490	8496	8498	8498	he	279	" A doctor , eh ? "
8503	8554	8498	8498	he	279	" Have you your stethoscope ? Might I ask you would you have the kindness ? I have grave doubts as to my mitral valve , if you would be so very good . The aortic I may rely upon , but I should value your opinion upon the mitral . "
8591	8598	8599	8599	I	0	" It appears to be normal , "
8602	8610	8599	8599	I	0	" You have no cause for uneasiness . "
8611	8621	8622	8622	he	279	" You will excuse my anxiety , Miss Morstan , "
8627	8678	8622	8622	he	279	" I am a great sufferer , and I have long had suspicions as to that valve . I am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted . Had your father , Miss Morstan , refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart , he might have been alive now . "
8721	8732	8734	8734	she	112	" I knew in my heart that he was dead , "
8736	8744	8746	8746	he	287	" I can give you every information , "
8748	8852	8746	8746	he	287	" and , what is more , I can do you justice ; and I will , too , whatever Brother Bartholomew may say . I am so glad to have your friends here , not only as an escort to you , but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say . The three of us can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew . But let us have no outsiders , no police or officials . We can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves , without any interference . Nothing would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity . "
8873	8878	8880	8880	Holmes	105	" For my part , "
8882	8894	8880	8880	Holmes	105	" whatever you may choose to say will go no further . "
8902	8911	8913	8913	he	287	" That is well ! That is well ! "
8915	8987	8988	8988	He	287	" May I offer you a glass of Chianti , Miss Morstan ? Or of Tokay ? I keep no other wines . Shall I open a flask ? No ? Well , then , I trust that you have no objection to tobacco - smoke , to the mild balsamic odour of the Eastern tobacco . I am a little nervous , and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative . "
9051	9063	9065	9065	he	287	" When I first determined to make this communication to you , "
9067	9275	9065	9065	he	287	" I might have given you my address , but I feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you . I took the liberty , therefore , of making an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first . I have complete confidence in his discretion , and he had orders , if he were dissatisfied , to proceed no further in the matter . You will excuse these precautions , but I am a man of somewhat retiring , and I might even say refined , tastes , and there is nothing more un sthetic than a policeman . I have a natural shrinking from all forms of rough materialism . I seldom come in contact with the rough crowd . I live , as you see , with some little atmosphere of elegance around me . I may call myself a patron of the arts . It is my weakness . The landscape is a genuine Corot , and , though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa , there can not be the least question about the Bouguereau . I am partial to the modern French school . "
9276	9285	9287	9288	Miss Morstan	112	" You will excuse me , Mr. Sholto , "
9290	9326	9287	9288	Miss Morstan	112	" but I am here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell me . It is very late , and I should desire the interview to be as short as possible . "
9327	9337	9338	9338	he	291	" At the best it must take some time , "
9341	9414	9338	9338	he	291	" for we shall certainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew . We shall all go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew . He is very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me . I had quite high words with him last night . You can not imagine what a terrible fellow he is when he is angry . "
9415	9434	9435	9435	I	0	" If we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at once , "
9449	9455	9456	9456	he	291	" That would hardly do , "
9459	9533	9456	9456	he	291	" I don t know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden way . No , I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each other . In the first place , I must tell you that there are several points in the story of which I am myself ignorant . I can only lay the facts before you as far as I know them myself .
9534	9630	9338	9338	he	291	" My father was , as you may have guessed , Major John Sholto , once of the Indian army . He retired some eleven years ago , and came to live at Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood . He had prospered in India , and brought back with him a considerable sum of money , a large collection of valuable curiosities , and a staff of native servants . With these advantages he bought himself a house , and lived in great luxury . My twin - brother Bartholomew and I were the only children .
9631	9724	9456	9456	he	291	" I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the disappearance of Captain Morstan . We read the details in the papers , and , knowing that he had been a friend of our father s , we discussed the case freely in his presence . He used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened . Never for an instant did we suspect that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast , that of all men he alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan .
9725	9881	9338	9338	he	291	" We did know , however , that some mystery some positive danger overhung our father . He was very fearful of going out alone , and he always employed two prize - fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge . Williams , who drove you to - night , was one of them . He was once light - weight champion of England . Our father would never tell us what it was he feared , but he had a most marked aversion to men with wooden legs . On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden - legged man , who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders . We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up . My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father s , but events have since led us to change our opinion .
9882	9997	9456	9456	he	291	" Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great shock to him . He nearly fainted at the breakfast - table when he opened it , and from that day he sickened to his death . What was in the letter we could never discover , but I could see as he held it that it was short and written in a scrawling hand . He had suffered for years from an enlarged spleen , but he now became rapidly worse , and towards the end of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope , and that he wished to make a last communication to us .
9998	10072	9338	9338	he	291	" When we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing heavily . He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side of the bed . Then , grasping our hands , he made a remarkable statement to us , in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain . I shall try and give it to you in his own very words .
10073	10252	9456	9456	he	291	" I have only one thing , he said , which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment . It is my treatment of poor Morstan s orphan . The cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her the treasure , half at least of which should have been hers . And yet I have made no use of it myself , so blind and foolish a thing is avarice . The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I could not bear to share it with another . See that chaplet dipped with pearls beside the quinine - bottle . Even that I could not bear to part with , although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her . You , my sons , will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure . But send her nothing not even the chaplet until I am gone . After all , men have been as bad as this and have recovered .
10253	10444	9338	9338	he	291	" I will tell you how Morstan died , he continued . He had suffered for years from a weak heart , but he concealed it from every one . I alone knew it . When in India , he and I , through a remarkable chain of circumstances , came into possession of a considerable treasure . I brought it over to England , and on the night of Morstan s arrival he came straight over here to claim his share . He walked over from the station , and was admitted by my faithful old Lal Chowdar , who is now dead . Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure , and we came to heated words . Morstan had sprung out of his chair in a paroxysm of anger , when he suddenly pressed his hand to his side , his face turned a dusky hue , and he fell backwards , cutting his head against the corner of the treasure - chest . When I stooped over him I found , to my horror , that he was dead .
10445	10570	10647	10647	him	293	" For a long time I sat half distracted , wondering what I should do . My first impulse was , of course , to call for assistance ; but I could not but recognise that there was every chance that I would be accused of his murder . His death at the moment of a quarrel , and the gash in his head , would be black against me . Again , an official inquiry could not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure , which I was particularly anxious to keep secret . He had told me that no soul upon earth knew where he had gone . There seemed to be no necessity why any soul ever should know .
10571	10607	10647	10647	him	293	" I was still pondering over the matter , when , looking up , I saw my servant , Lal Chowdar , in the doorway . He stole in and bolted the door behind him . "
10614	10618	10647	10647	him	293	" he said . "
10641	10642	10643	10643	I	0	" "
10649	10660	10661	10661	I	0	" said I. Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled . "
10668	10672	10673	10673	I	0	" said he . "
10704	10843	10698	10698	us	294	" That was enough to decide me . If my own servant could not believe my innocence , how could I hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury - box ? Lal Chowdar and I disposed of the body that night , and within a few days the London papers were full of the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan . You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter . My fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only the body , but also the treasure , and that I have clung to Morstan s share as well as to my own . I wish you , therefore , to make restitution . Put your ears down to my mouth . The treasure is hidden in
10844	10986	10673	10673	I	0	" At this instant a horrible change came over his expression ; his eyes stared wildly , his jaw dropped , and he yelled , in a voice which I can never forget , Keep him out ! For Christ s sake keep him out ! We both stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed . A face was looking in at us out of the darkness . We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass . It was a bearded , hairy face , with wild cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence . My brother and I rushed towards the window , but the man was gone . When we returned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat . "
10987	11184	10698	10698	us	294	" We searched the garden that night , but found no sign of the intruder , save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower - bed . But for that one trace , we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild , fierce face . We soon , however , had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us . The window of my father s room was found open in the morning , his cupboards and boxes had been rifled , and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper , with the words The sign of the four scrawled across it . What the phrase meant , or who our secret visitor may have been , we never knew . As far as we can judge , none of my father s property had been actually stolen , though everything had been turned out . My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life ; but it is still a complete mystery to us . "
11365	11371	11373	11373	he	105	" My brother and I , "
11375	11569	11373	11373	he	105	" were , as you may imagine , much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of . For weeks and for months we dug and delved in every part of the garden , without discovering its whereabouts . It was maddening to think that the hiding - place was on his very lips at the moment that he died . We could judge the splendour of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out . Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion . The pearls were evidently of great value , and he was averse to part with them , for , between friends , my brother was himself a little inclined to my father s fault . He thought , too , that if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble . It was all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan s address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals , so that at least she might never feel destitute . "
11570	11577	11579	11580	our companion	236	" It was a kindly thought , "
11584	11592	11579	11580	our companion	236	" It was extremely good of you . "
11601	11607	11608	11608	he	286	" We were your trustees , "
11611	11791	11608	11608	he	286	" That was the view which I took of it , though Brother Bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light . We had plenty of money ourselves . I desired no more . Besides , it would have been such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion . Le mauvais go t m ne au crime . The French have a very neat way of putting these things . Our difference of opinion on this subject went so far that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself : so I left Pondicherry Lodge , taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me . Yesterday , however , I learn that an event of extreme importance has occurred . The treasure has been discovered . I instantly communicated with Miss Morstan , and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood and demand our share . I explained my views last night to Brother Bartholomew : so we shall be expected , if not welcome , visitors . "
11834	11847	11849	11849	he	105	" You have done well , sir , from first to last , "
11851	11903	11849	11849	he	105	" It is possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you . But , as Miss Morstan remarked just now , it is late , and we had best put the matter through without delay . "
11985	11992	11993	11993	he	305	" My health is somewhat fragile , "
12005	12014	11993	11993	he	305	" I am compelled to be a valetudinarian . "
12059	12066	12068	12068	he	124	" Bartholomew is a clever fellow , "
12070	12286	12068	12068	he	124	" How do you think he found out where the treasure was ? He had come to the conclusion that it was somewhere indoors : so he worked out all the cubic space of the house , and made measurements everywhere , so that not one inch should be unaccounted for . Among other things , he found that the height of the building was seventy - four feet , but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms , and making every allowance for the space between , which he ascertained by borings , he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet . There were four feet unaccounted for . These could only be at the top of the building . He knocked a hole , therefore , in the lath - and - plaster ceiling of the highest room , and there , sure enough , he came upon another little garret above it , which had been sealed up and was known to no one . In the centre stood the treasure - chest , resting upon two rafters . He lowered it through the hole , and there it lies . He computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling . "
12524	12534	12536	12538	Mr. Thaddeus Sholto	124	" This , Miss Morstan , is Pondicherry Lodge , "
12704	12709	12711	12715	a gruff voice from within	323	" Who is there ? "
12717	12733	12711	12715	a gruff voice from within	323	" It is I , McMurdo . You surely know my knock by this time . "
12783	12806	12754	12760	a short , deep - chested man	324	" That you , Mr. Thaddeus ? But who are the others ? I had no orders about them from the master . "
12807	12829	12754	12760	a short , deep - chested man	324	" No , McMurdo ? You surprise me ! I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends . "
12830	12879	12754	12760	a short , deep - chested man	324	" He ain t been out o his room to - day , Mr. Thaddeus , and I have no orders . You know very well that I must stick to regulations . I can let you in , but your friends must just stop where they are . "
12898	12908	12909	12909	he	124	" This is too bad of you , McMurdo ! "
12912	12944	12909	12909	he	124	" If I guarantee them , that is enough for you . There is the young lady , too . She can not wait on the public road at this hour . "
12945	12952	12954	12955	the porter	325	" Very sorry , Mr. Thaddeus , "
12959	13000	12954	12955	the porter	325	" Folk may be friends o yours , and yet no friends o the master s. He pays me well to do my duty , and my duty I ll do . I don t know none o your friends . "
13001	13010	13012	13013	Sherlock Holmes	105	" Oh , yes you do , McMurdo , "
13017	13054	13012	13013	Sherlock Holmes	105	" I don t think you can have forgotten me . Don t you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison s rooms on the night of your benefit four years back ? "
13055	13061	13063	13066	the prize - fighter	326	" Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes ! "
13068	13141	13063	13066	the prize - fighter	326	" God s truth ! how could I have mistook you ? If instead o standin there so quiet you had just stepped up and given me that cross - hit of yours under the jaw , I d ha known you without a question . Ah , you re one that has wasted your gifts , you have ! You might have aimed high , if you had joined the fancy . "
13142	13165	13167	13167	Holmes	105	" You see , Watson , if all else fails me I have still one of the scientific professions open to me , "
13171	13188	13167	13167	Holmes	105	" Our friend won t keep us out in the cold now , I am sure . "
13189	13205	13206	13206	he	105	" In you come , sir , in you come , you and your friends , "
13209	13235	13206	13206	he	105	" Very sorry , Mr. Thaddeus , but orders are very strict . Had to be certain of your friends before I let them in . "
13315	13322	13323	13323	he	124	" I can not understand it , "
13326	13363	13323	13323	he	124	" There must be some mistake . I distinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here , and yet there is no light in his window . I do not know what to make of it . "
13364	13375	13377	13377	Holmes	105	" Does he always guard the premises in this way ? "
13379	13445	13323	13323	he	124	" Yes ; he has followed my father s custom . He was the favourite son , you know , and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me . That is Bartholomew s window up there where the moonshine strikes . It is quite bright , but there is no light from within , I think . "
13446	13449	13451	13451	Holmes	105	" None , "
13453	13470	13451	13451	Holmes	105	" But I see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door . "
13471	13538	13323	13323	he	124	" Ah , that is the housekeeper s room . That is where old Mrs. Bernstone sits . She can tell us all about it . But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two , for if we all go in together and she has no word of our coming she may be alarmed . But hush ! what is that ? "
13608	13614	13616	13616	Sholto	124	" It is Mrs. Bernstone , "
13618	13639	13616	13616	Sholto	124	" She is the only woman in the house . Wait here . I shall be back in a moment . "
13674	13703	13706	13706	her	334	" Oh , Mr. Thaddeus , sir , I am so glad you have come ! I am so glad you have come , Mr. Thaddeus , sir ! "
13900	13906	13907	13907	she	334	" What a strange place ! "
13913	13954	13907	13907	she	334	" It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it . I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat , where the prospectors had been at work . "
13955	13962	13964	13964	Holmes	105	" And from the same cause , "
13966	14001	13964	13964	Holmes	105	" These are the traces of the treasure - seekers . You must remember that they were six years looking for it . No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel - pit . "
14031	14039	14040	14040	he	124	" There is something amiss with Bartholomew ! "
14043	14055	14056	14056	He	124	" I am frightened ! My nerves can not stand it . "
14088	14094	14096	14096	Holmes	105	" Come into the house , "
14105	14110	14112	14113	Thaddeus Sholto	124	" Yes , do ! "
14115	14126	14112	14113	Thaddeus Sholto	124	" I really do not feel equal to giving directions . "
14181	14189	14190	14190	she	348	" God bless your sweet calm face ! "
14198	14218	14190	14190	she	348	" It does me good to see you . Oh , but I have been sorely tried this day ! "
14251	14263	14264	14264	she	348	" Master has locked himself in and will not answer me , "
14267	14356	14264	14264	she	348	" All day I have waited to hear from him , for he often likes to be alone ; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss , so I went up and peeped through the key - hole . You must go up , Mr. Thaddeus , you must go up and look for yourself . I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years , but I never saw him with such a face on him as that . "
14635	14645	14647	14647	he	105	" There is something devilish in this , Watson , "
14659	14667	14647	14647	he	105	" What do you make of it ? "
14838	14843	14844	14844	I	0	" This is terrible ! "
14849	14856	14844	14844	I	0	" What is to be done ? "
14857	14864	14865	14865	he	105	" The door must come down , "
15223	15227	15228	15228	he	105	" You see , "
15254	15261	15245	15245	I	0	" The sign of the four . "
15262	15274	15275	15275	I	0	" In God s name , what does it all mean ? "
15278	15283	15285	15285	he	105	" It means murder , "
15293	15303	15304	15304	He	105	" Ah , I expected it . Look here ! "
15324	15331	15333	15333	I.	0	" It looks like a thorn , "
15334	15355	15289	15291	the dead man	367	" It is a thorn . You may pick it out . But be careful , for it is poisoned . "
15394	15404	15406	15406	I.	0	" This is all an insoluble mystery to me , "
15407	15415	15406	15406	I.	0	" It grows darker instead of clearer . "
15416	15421	15422	15422	he	105	" On the contrary , "
15425	15445	15422	15422	he	105	" it clears every instant . I only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case . "
15496	15502	15503	15503	he	105	" The treasure is gone ! "
15506	15560	15503	15503	he	105	" They have robbed him of the treasure ! There is the hole through which we lowered it . I helped him to do it ! I was the last person who saw him ! I left him here last night , and I heard him lock the door as I came downstairs . "
15561	15567	15486	15486	he	105	" What time was that ? "
15568	15662	15503	15503	he	105	" It was ten o clock . And now he is dead , and the police will be called in , and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it . Oh , yes , I am sure I shall . But you don t think so , gentlemen ? Surely you don t think that it was I ? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I ? Oh , dear ! oh , dear ! I know that I shall go mad ! "
15678	15689	15691	15691	Holmes	105	" You have no reason for fear , Mr. Sholto , "
15702	15737	15691	15691	Holmes	105	" Take my advice , and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police . Offer to assist them in every way . We shall wait here until your return . "
15768	15773	15775	15775	Holmes	105	" Now , Watson , "
15781	15839	15775	15775	Holmes	105	" we have half an hour to ourselves . Let us make good use of it . My case is , as I have told you , almost complete ; but we must not err on the side of over - confidence . Simple as the case seems now , there may be something deeper underlying it . "
15840	15843	15844	15844	I	0	" Simple ! "
15847	15850	15852	15852	he	105	" Surely , "
15868	15920	15921	15921	He	105	" Just sit in the corner there , that your footprints may not complicate matters . Now to work ! In the first place , how did these folk come , and how did they go ? The door has not been opened since last night . How of the window ? "
15946	16046	15921	15921	He	105	" Window is snibbed on the inner side . Framework is solid . No hinges at the side . Let us open it . No water - pipe near . Roof quite out of reach . Yet a man has mounted by the window . It rained a little last night . Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill . And here is a circular muddy mark , and here again upon the floor , and here again by the table . See here , Watson ! This is really a very pretty demonstration . "
16059	16066	16068	16068	I.	0	" This is not a footmark , "
16069	16121	15921	15921	He	105	" It is something much more valuable to us . It is the impression of a wooden stump . You see here on the sill is the boot - mark , a heavy boot with the broad metal heel , and beside it is the mark of the timber - toe . "
16122	16131	16068	16068	I.	0	" It is the wooden - legged man . "
16132	16159	15921	15921	He	105	" Quite so . But there has been some one else , a very able and efficient ally . Could you scale that wall , doctor ? "
16215	16221	16222	16222	I	0	" It is absolutely impossible , "
16225	16346	16347	16347	he	377	" Without aid it is so . But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner , securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall . Then , I think , if you were an active man , You might swarm up , wooden leg and all . You would depart , of course , in the same fashion , and your ally would draw up the rope , untie it from the hook , shut the window , snib it on the inside , and get away in the way that he originally came . As a minor point it may be noted , "
16354	16418	16347	16347	he	377	" that our wooden - legged friend , though a fair climber , was not a professional sailor . His hands were far from horny . My lens discloses more than one blood - mark , especially towards the end of the rope , from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand . "
16419	16426	16428	16428	I	0	" This is all very well , "
16430	16453	16428	16428	I	0	" but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever . How about this mysterious ally ? How came he into the room ? "
16454	16460	16462	16462	Holmes	105	" Yes , the ally ! "
16466	16523	16462	16462	Holmes	105	" There are features of interest about this ally . He lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace . I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country , though parallel cases suggest themselves from India , and , if my memory serves me , from Senegambia . "
16524	16531	16532	16532	I	0	" How came he , then ? "
16535	16552	16532	16532	I	0	" The door is locked , the window is inaccessible . Was it through the chimney ? "
16553	16561	16562	16562	he	105	" The grate is much too small , "
16565	16573	16562	16562	he	105	" I had already considered that possibility . "
16574	16578	16579	16579	I	0	" How then ? "
16582	16590	16591	16591	he	105	" You will not apply my precept , "
16598	16673	16595	16595	his	105	" How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains , _ however improbable _ , must be the truth ? We know that he did not come through the door , the window , or the chimney . We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room , as there is no concealment possible . Whence , then , did he come ? "
16674	16684	16685	16685	I	0	" He came through the hole in the roof , "
16688	16734	16595	16595	his	105	" Of course he did . He must have done so . If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me , we shall now extend our researches to the room above , the secret room in which the treasure was found . "
16868	16876	16878	16879	Sherlock Holmes	105	" Here you are , you see , "
16889	16950	16878	16879	Sherlock Holmes	105	" This is a trap - door which leads out on to the roof . I can press it back , and here is the roof itself , sloping at a gentle angle . This , then , is the way by which Number One entered . Let us see if we can find any other traces of his individuality . "
17032	17035	17036	17036	I	0	" Holmes , "
17043	17052	17036	17036	I	0	" a child has done the horrid thing . "
17064	17072	17073	17073	he	105	" I was staggered for the moment , "
17076	17113	17073	17073	he	105	" but the thing is quite natural . My memory failed me , or I should have been able to foretell it . There is nothing more to be learned here . Let us go down . "
17114	17127	17128	17128	I	0	" What is your theory , then , as to those footmarks ? "
17143	17154	17156	17156	he	105	" My dear Watson , try a little analysis yourself , "
17164	17182	17156	17156	he	105	" You know my methods . Apply them , and it will be instructive to compare results . "
17183	17195	17196	17196	I	0	" I can not conceive anything which will cover the facts , "
17199	17209	17210	17210	he	105	" It will be clear enough to you soon , "
17220	17237	17210	17210	he	105	" I think that there is nothing else of importance here , but I will look . "
17371	17378	17380	17380	he	105	" We are certainly in luck , "
17382	17443	17380	17380	he	105	" We ought to have very little trouble now . Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the creosote . You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil - smelling mess . The carboy has been cracked , You see , and the stuff has leaked out . "
17444	17448	17449	17449	I	0	" What then ? "
17452	17464	17466	17466	he	105	" Why , we have got him , that s all , "
17468	17541	17466	17466	he	105	" I know a dog that would follow that scent to the world s end . If a pack can track a trailed herring across a shire , how far can a specially - trained hound follow so pungent a smell as this ? It sounds like a sum in the rule of three . The answer should give us the But halloa ! here are the accredited representatives of the law . "
17565	17570	17572	17572	Holmes	105	" Before they come , "
17574	17598	17572	17572	Holmes	105	" just put your hand here on this poor fellow s arm , and here on his leg . What do you feel ? "
17599	17609	17610	17610	I	0	" The muscles are as hard as a board , "
17613	17669	17466	17466	he	105	" Quite so . They are in a state of extreme contraction , far exceeding the usual _ rigor mortis _ . Coupled with this distortion of the face , this Hippocratic smile , or _ risus sardonicus _ , as the old writers called it , what conclusion would it suggest to your mind ? "
17670	17678	17679	17679	I	0	" Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid , "
17682	17693	17679	17679	I	0	" some strychnine - like substance which would produce tetanus . "
17694	17789	17466	17466	he	105	" That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face . On getting into the room I at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system . As you saw , I discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp . You observe that the part struck was that which would be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his chair . Now examine the thorn . "
17844	17851	17852	17852	he	105	" Is that an English thorn ? "
17855	17863	17913	17922	a very stout , portly man in a grey suit	388	" No , it certainly is not . "
17864	17894	17913	17922	a very stout , portly man in a grey suit	388	" With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference . But here are the regulars ; so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat . "
17976	17982	17983	17983	he	388	" Here s a business ! "
17993	18021	17983	17983	he	388	" Here s a pretty business ! But who are all these ? Why , the house seems to be as full as a rabbit - warren ! "
18022	18034	18036	18036	Holmes	105	" I think you must recollect me , Mr. Athelney Jones , "
18040	18048	18049	18049	he	388	" Why , of course I do ! "
18052	18113	18049	18049	he	388	" It s Mr. Sherlock Holmes , the theorist . Remember you ! I ll never forget how you lectured us all on causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case . It s true you set us on the right track ; but you ll own now that it was more by good luck than good guidance . "
18114	18124	17983	17983	he	388	" It was a piece of very simple reasoning . "
18125	18195	18049	18049	he	388	" Oh , come , now , come ! Never be ashamed to own up . But what is all this ? Bad business ! Bad business ! Stern facts here , no room for theories . How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case ! I was at the station when the message arrived . What d you think the man died of ? "
18196	18210	18212	18212	Holmes	105	" Oh , this is hardly a case for me to theorise over , "
18216	18258	17983	17983	he	388	" No , no . Still , we can t deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes . Dear me ! Door locked , I understand . Jewels worth half a million missing . How was the window ? "
18259	18270	18049	18049	he	388	" Fastened ; but there are steps on the sill . "
18271	18386	17983	17983	he	388	" Well , well , if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with the matter . That s common sense . Man might have died in a fit ; but then the jewels are missing . Ha ! I have a theory . These flashes come upon me at times . Just step outside , sergeant , and you , Mr. Sholto . Your friend can remain . What do you think of this , Holmes ? Sholto was , on his own confession , with his brother last night . The brother died in a fit , on which Sholto walked off with the treasure . How s that ? "
18387	18405	18049	18049	he	388	" On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside . "
18406	18520	17983	17983	he	388	" Hum ! There s a flaw there . Let us apply common sense to the matter . This Thaddeus Sholto _ was _ with his brother ; there _ was _ a quarrel ; so much we know . The brother is dead and the jewels are gone . So much also we know . No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him . His bed had not been slept in . Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind . His appearance is well , not attractive . You see that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus . The net begins to close upon him . "
18521	18533	18535	18535	Holmes	105	" You are not quite in possession of the facts yet , "
18537	18602	18535	18535	Holmes	105	" This splinter of wood , which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned , was in the man s scalp where you still see the mark ; this card , inscribed as you see it , was on the table ; and beside it lay this rather curious stone - headed instrument . How does all that fit into your theory ? "
18603	18610	18612	18614	the fat detective	391	" Confirms it in every respect , "
18618	18691	18612	18614	the fat detective	391	" House is full of Indian curiosities . Thaddeus brought this up , and if this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man . The card is some hocus - pocus , a blind , as like as not . The only question is , how did he depart ? Ah , of course , here is a hole in the roof . "
18730	18736	18738	18738	Holmes	105	" He can find something , "
18744	18771	18738	18738	Holmes	105	" He has occasional glimmerings of reason . _ Il n y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l esprit ! _ "
18772	18776	18778	18779	Athelney Jones	109	" You see ! "
18787	18823	18778	18779	Athelney Jones	109	" Facts are better than mere theories , after all . My view of the case is confirmed . There is a trap - door communicating with the roof , and it is partly open . "
18824	18832	18738	18738	Holmes	105	" It was I who opened it . "
18833	18845	18846	18846	He	392	" Oh , indeed ! You did notice it , then ? "
18855	18872	18846	18846	He	392	" Well , whoever noticed it , it shows how our gentleman got away . Inspector ! "
18873	18878	18738	18738	Holmes	105	" Yes , sir , "
18883	18932	18846	18846	He	392	" Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way . Mr. Sholto , it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you . I arrest you in the Queen s name as being concerned in the death of your brother . "
18933	18944	18946	18949	the poor little man	397	" There , now ! Didn t I tell you ! "
18966	18977	18979	18979	Holmes	105	" Don t trouble yourself about it , Mr. Sholto , "
18981	18995	18979	18979	Holmes	105	" I think that I can engage to clear you of the charge . "
18996	19012	19014	19015	the detective	400	" Don t promise too much , Mr. Theorist , don t promise too much ! "
19017	19029	19014	19015	the detective	400	" You may find it a harder matter than you think . "
19030	19185	18979	18979	Holmes	105	" Not only will I clear him , Mr. Jones , but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night . His name , I have every reason to believe , is Jonathan Small . He is a poorly - educated man , small , active , with his right leg off , and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side . His left boot has a coarse , square - toed sole , with an iron band round the heel . He is a middle - aged man , much sunburned , and has been a convict . These few indications may be of some assistance to you , coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand . The other man "
19186	19193	19195	19196	Athelney Jones	109	" Ah ! the other man ? "
19224	19231	19233	19234	Sherlock Holmes	105	" Is a rather curious person , "
19241	19266	19233	19234	Sherlock Holmes	105	" I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them . A word with you , Watson . "
19278	19283	19284	19284	he	105	" This unexpected occurrence , "
19287	19303	19284	19284	he	105	" has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey . "
19304	19312	19313	19313	I	0	" I have just been thinking so , "
19316	19331	19313	19313	I	0	" It is not right that Miss Morstan should remain in this stricken house . "
19332	19379	19284	19284	he	105	" No . You must escort her home . She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester , in Lower Camberwell : so it is not very far . I will wait for you here if you will drive out again . Or perhaps you are too tired ? "
19380	19456	19313	19313	I	0	" By no means . I don t think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business . I have seen something of the rough side of life , but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to - night has shaken my nerve completely . I should like , however , to see the matter through with you , now that I have got so far . "
19457	19468	19469	19469	he	402	" Your presence will be of great service to me , "
19472	19595	19469	19469	he	402	" We shall work the case out independently , and leave this fellow Jones to exult over any mare s - nest which he may choose to construct . When you have dropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No . 3 , Pinchin Lane , down near the water s edge at Lambeth . The third house on the right - hand side is a bird - stuffer s : Sherman is the name . You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window . Knock old Sherman up , and tell him , with my compliments , that I want Toby at once . You will bring Toby back in the cab with you . "
19596	19603	19313	19313	I	0	" A dog , I suppose . "
19604	19636	19469	19469	he	402	" Yes , a queer mongrel , with a most amazing power of scent . I would rather have Toby s help than that of the whole detective force of London . "
19637	19645	19647	19647	I.	403	" I shall bring him , then , "
19648	19670	19469	19469	he	402	" It is one now . I ought to be back before three , if I can get a fresh horse . "
19671	19675	19677	19677	Holmes	105	" And I , "
19679	19747	19677	19677	Holmes	105	" shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone , and from the Indian servant , who , Mr. Thaddeus tell me , sleeps in the next garret . Then I shall study the great Jones s methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms . _ Wir sind gewohnt das die Menschen verh hnen was sie nicht verstehen . _ Goethe is always pithy . "
20554	20562	20725	20726	Mr. Sherman	142	" Go on , you drunken vagabone , "
20567	20590	20725	20726	Mr. Sherman	142	" If you kick up any more row I ll open the kennels and let out forty - three dogs upon you . "
20591	20607	20609	20609	I.	0	" If you ll let one out it s just what I have come for , "
20610	20614	20725	20726	Mr. Sherman	142	" Go on ! "
20619	20648	20725	20726	Mr. Sherman	142	" So help me gracious , I have a wiper in the bag , an I ll drop it on your ead if you don t hook it . "
20649	20656	20657	20657	I	0	" But I want a dog , "
20660	20668	20670	20671	Mr. Sherman	142	" I won t be argued with ! "
20673	20689	20670	20671	Mr. Sherman	142	" Now stand clear , for when I say three , down goes the wiper . "
20690	20694	20695	20695	I	0	" Mr. Sherlock Holmes "
20749	20759	20761	20761	he	142	" A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome , "
20763	20794	20761	20761	he	142	" Step in , sir . Keep clear of the badger ; for he bites . Ah , naughty , naughty , would you take a nip at the gentleman ? "
20814	20905	20761	20761	he	142	" Don t mind that , sir : it s only a slow - worm . It hain t got no fangs , so I gives it the run o the room , for it keeps the beetles down . You must not mind my bein just a little short wi you at first , for I m guyed at by the children , and there s many a one just comes down this lane to knock me up . What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted , sir ? "
20906	20914	20761	20761	he	142	" He wanted a dog of yours . "
20915	20923	20761	20761	he	142	" Ah ! that would be Toby . "
20924	20932	20761	20761	he	142	" Yes , Toby was the name . "
20933	20945	20946	20946	He	431	" Toby lives at No . 7 on the left here . "
21195	21203	21205	21205	he	105	" Ah , you have him there ! "
21207	21272	21205	21205	he	105	" Good dog , then ! Atheney Jones has gone . We have had an immense display of energy since you left . He has arrested not only friend Thaddeus , but the gatekeeper , the housekeeper , and the Indian servant . We have the place to ourselves , but for a sergeant upstairs . Leave the dog here , and come up . "
21321	21332	21334	21335	my companion	195	" Lend me your bull s - eye , sergeant , "
21337	21414	21334	21335	my companion	195	" Now tie this bit of card round my neck , so as to hang it in front of me . Thank you . Now I must kick off my boots and stockings . Just you carry them down with you , Watson . I am going to do a little climbing . And dip my handkerchief into the creasote . That will do . Now come up into the garret with me for a moment . "
21435	21445	21446	21446	he	105	" I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks , "
21449	21458	21446	21446	he	105	" Do you observe anything noteworthy about them ? "
21459	21463	21464	21464	I	0	" They belong , "
21467	21476	21464	21464	I	0	" to a child or a small woman . "
21477	21490	21446	21446	he	105	" Apart from their size , though . Is there nothing else ? "
21491	21501	21464	21464	I	0	" They appear to be much as other footmarks . "
21502	21539	21446	21446	he	105	" Not at all . Look here ! This is the print of a right foot in the dust . Now I make one with my naked foot beside it . What is the chief difference ? "
21540	21557	21464	21464	I	0	" Your toes are all cramped together . The other print has each toe distinctly divided . "
21558	21608	21446	21446	he	105	" Quite so . That is the point . Bear that in mind . Now , would you kindly step over to that flap - window and smell the edge of the wood - work ? I shall stay here , as I have this handkerchief in my hand . "
21625	21669	21446	21446	he	105	" That is where he put his foot in getting out . If _ you _ can trace him , I should think that Toby will have no difficulty . Now run downstairs , loose the dog , and look out for Blondin . "
21749	21755	21756	21756	he	105	" That you , Watson ? "
21759	21762	21717	21717	he	105	" Yes . "
21763	21777	21717	21717	he	105	" This is the place . What is that black thing down there ? "
21778	21784	21717	21717	he	105	" A water - barrel . "
21785	21790	21717	21717	he	105	" Top on it ? "
21791	21794	21717	21717	he	105	" Yes . "
21795	21802	21717	21717	he	105	" No sign of a ladder ? "
21803	21806	21717	21717	he	105	" No . "
21807	21848	21717	21717	he	105	" Confound the fellow ! It s a most break - neck place . I ought to be able to come down where he could climb up . The water - pipe feels pretty firm . Here goes , anyhow . "
21889	21897	21898	21898	he	105	" It was easy to follow him , "
21908	21937	21898	21898	he	105	" Tiles were loosened the whole way along , and in his hurry he had dropped this . It confirms my diagnosis , as you doctors express it . "
22008	22014	22016	22016	he	105	" They are hellish things , "
22018	22085	22016	22016	he	105	" Look out that you don t prick yourself . I m delighted to have them , for the chances are that they are all he has . There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long . I would sooner face a Martini bullet , myself . Are you game for a six - mile trudge , Watson ? "
22086	22089	22090	22090	I	0	" Certainly , "
22093	22100	22016	22016	he	105	" Your leg will stand it ? "
22101	22106	22016	22016	he	105	" Oh , yes . "
22107	22126	22016	22016	he	105	" Here you are , doggy ! Good old Toby ! Smell it , Toby , smell it ! "
22446	22458	22459	22459	he	105	" There s the print of wooden - leg s hand , "
22469	22518	22459	22459	he	105	" You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster . What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday ! The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight - and - twenty hours start . "
22584	22589	22591	22591	Holmes	105	" Do not imagine , "
22593	22707	22591	22591	Holmes	105	" that I depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot in the chemical . I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways . This , however , is the readiest and , since fortune has put it into our hands , I should be culpable if I neglected it . It has , however , prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be . There might have been some credit to be gained out of it , but for this too palpable clue . "
22708	22717	22719	22719	I.	0	" There is credit , and to spare , "
22720	22783	22591	22591	Holmes	105	" I assure you , Holmes , that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case , even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder . The thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable . How , for example , could you describe with such confidence the wooden - legged man ? "
22784	22979	22719	22719	I.	0	" Pshaw , my dear boy ! it was simplicity itself . I don t wish to be theatrical . It is all patent and above - board . Two officers who are in command of a convict - guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure . A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan Small . You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain Morstan s possession . He had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates , the sign of the four , as he somewhat dramatically called it . Aided by this chart , the officers or one of them gets the treasure and brings it to England , leaving , we will suppose , some condition under which he received it unfulfilled . Now , then , why did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself ? The answer is obvious . The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with convicts . Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away . "
22980	22987	22989	22989	I.	461	" But that is mere speculation , "
22990	23053	22719	22719	I.	0	" It is more than that . It is the only hypothesis which covers the facts . Let us see how it fits in with the sequel . Major Sholto remains at peace for some years , happy in the possession of his treasure . Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright . What was that ? "
23054	23071	22989	22989	I.	461	" A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free . "
23072	23199	22719	22719	I.	0	" Or had escaped . That is much more likely , for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was . It would not have been a surprise to him . What does he do then ? He guards himself against a wooden - legged man , a white man , mark you , for he mistakes a white tradesman for him , and actually fires a pistol at him . Now , only one white man s name is on the chart . The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans . There is no other white man . Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden - legged man is identical with Jonathan Small . Does the reasoning strike you as being faulty ? "
23200	23209	22989	22989	I.	461	" No : it is clear and concise . "
23210	23536	22719	22719	I.	0	" Well , now , let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small . Let us look at it from his point of view . He comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him . He found out where Sholto lived , and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house . There is this butler , Lal Rao , whom we have not seen . Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character . Small could not find out , however , where the treasure was hid , for no one ever knew , save the major and one faithful servant who had died . Suddenly Small learns that the major is on his death - bed . In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him , he runs the gauntlet of the guards , makes his way to the dying man s window , and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons . Mad with hate , however , against the dead man , he enters the room that night , searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure , and finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card . He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder , but , from the point of view of the four associates , something in the nature of an act of justice . Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime , and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal . Do you follow all this ? "
23537	23541	22989	22989	I.	461	" Very clearly . "
23542	23675	22719	22719	I.	0	" Now , what could Jonathan Small do ? He could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure . Possibly he leaves England and only comes back at intervals . Then comes the discovery of the garret , and he is instantly informed of it . We again trace the presence of some confederate in the household . Jonathan , with his wooden leg , is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto . He takes with him , however , a rather curious associate , who gets over this difficulty , but dips his naked foot into creasote , whence comes Toby , and a six - mile limp for a half - pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis . "
23676	23692	22989	22989	I.	461	" But it was the associate , and not Jonathan , who committed the crime . "
23693	23895	22719	22719	I.	0	" Quite so . And rather to Jonathan s disgust , to judge by the way he stamped about when he got into the room . He bore no grudge against Bartholomew Sholto , and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged . He did not wish to put his head in a halter . There was no help for it , however : the savage instincts of his companion had broken out , and the poison had done its work : so Jonathan Small left his record , lowered the treasure - box to the ground , and followed it himself . That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them . Of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle - aged , and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the Andamans . His height is readily calculated from the length of his stride , and we know that he was bearded . His hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him at the window . I don t know that there is anything else . "
23896	23900	22989	22989	I.	461	" The associate ? "
23901	24019	22719	22719	I.	0	" Ah , well , there is no great mystery in that . But you will know all about it soon enough . How sweet the morning air is ! See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo . Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud - bank . It shines on a good many folk , but on none , I dare bet , who are on a stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature ! Are you well up in your Jean Paul ? "
24020	24032	22989	22989	I.	461	" Fairly so . I worked back to him through Carlyle . "
24033	24113	22719	22719	I.	0	" That was like following the brook to the parent lake . He makes one curious but profound remark . It is that the chief proof of man s real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness . It argues , you see , a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility . There is much food for thought in Richter . You have not a pistol , have you ? "
24114	24120	22989	22989	I.	461	" I have my stick . "
24121	24160	22719	22719	I.	0	" It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair . Jonathan I shall leave to you , but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead . "
24490	24501	24503	24503	Holmes	105	" What the deuce is the matter with the dog ? "
24505	24521	24503	24503	Holmes	105	" They surely would not take a cab , or go off in a balloon . "
24522	24531	24532	24532	I	0	" Perhaps they stood here for some time , "
24535	24548	24550	24551	my companion	195	" Ah ! it s all right . He s off again , "
24839	24843	24844	24844	I	0	" What now ? "
24847	24856	24844	24844	I	0	" Toby has lost his character for infallibility . "
24857	24865	24867	24867	Holmes	105	" He acted according to his lights , "
24885	24933	24867	24867	Holmes	105	" If you consider how much creasote is carted about London in one day , it is no great wonder that our trail should have been crossed . It is much used now , especially for the seasoning of wood . Poor Toby is not to blame . "
24934	24947	25015	25015	he	143	" We must get on the main scent again , I suppose . "
24948	25000	24867	24867	Holmes	105	" Yes . And , fortunately , we have no distance to go . Evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner of Knight s Place was that there were two different trails running in opposite directions . We took the wrong one . It only remains to follow the other . "
25037	25060	25061	25061	I	0	" We must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the creasote - barrel came from , "
25064	25099	25021	25021	he	143	" I had thought of that . But you notice that he keeps on the pavement , whereas the barrel passed down the roadway . No , we are on the true scent now . "
25165	25172	25174	25174	Holmes	105	" We are out of luck , "
25176	25185	25174	25174	Holmes	105	" They have taken to a boat here . "
25250	25253	25314	25314	his	105	" Mordecai Smith "
25266	25276	25314	25314	his	105	" Boats to hire by the hour or day . "
25321	25326	25328	25328	he	105	" This looks bad , "
25330	25358	25328	25328	he	105	" These fellows are sharper than I expected . They seem to have covered their tracks . There has , I fear , been preconcerted management here . "
25403	25413	25414	25414	she	505	" You come back and be washed , Jack , "
25417	25445	25414	25414	she	505	" Come back , you young imp ; for if your father comes home and finds you like that , he ll let us hear of it . "
25446	25451	25453	25453	Holmes	105	" Dear little chap ! "
25457	25477	25453	25453	Holmes	105	" What a rosy - cheeked young rascal ! Now , Jack , is there anything you would like ? "
25485	25492	25494	25494	he	506	" I d like a shillin , "
25496	25503	25414	25414	she	505	" Nothing you would like better ? "
25504	25512	25513	25514	the prodigy	507	" I d like two shillin better , "
25521	25537	25453	25453	Holmes	105	" Here you are , then ! Catch ! A fine child , Mrs. Smith ! "
25538	25574	25453	25453	Holmes	105	" Lor bless you , sir , he is that , and forward . He gets a most too much for me to manage , specially when my man is away days at a time . "
25575	25581	25583	25583	Holmes	105	" Away , is he ? "
25590	25606	25583	25583	Holmes	105	" I am sorry for that , for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith . "
25607	25650	25453	25453	Holmes	105	" He s been away since yesterday mornin , sir , and , truth to tell , I am beginnin to feel frightened about him . But if it was about a boat , sir , maybe I could serve as well . "
25651	25660	25583	25583	Holmes	105	" I wanted to hire his steam launch . "
25661	25758	25453	25453	Holmes	105	" Why , bless you , sir , it is in the steam launch that he has gone . That s what puzzles me ; for I know there ain t more coals in her than would take her to about Woolwich and back . If he d been away in the barge I d ha thought nothin ; for many a time a job has taken him as far as Gravesend , and then if there was much doin there he might ha stayed over . But what good is a steam launch without coals ? "
25759	25772	25583	25583	Holmes	105	" He might have bought some at a wharf down the river . "
25773	25836	25453	25453	Holmes	105	" He might , sir , but it weren t his way . Many a time I ve heard him call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags . Besides , I don t like that wooden - legged man , wi his ugly face and outlandish talk . What did he want always knockin about here for ? "
25837	25844	25846	25846	Holmes	105	" A wooden - legged man ? "
25852	25924	25453	25453	Holmes	105	" Yes , sir , a brown , monkey - faced chap that s called more n once for my old man . It was him that roused him up yesternight , and , what s more , my man knew he was comin , for he had steam up in the launch . I tell you straight , sir , I don t feel easy in my mind about it . "
25925	25933	25935	25935	Holmes	105	" But , my dear Mrs. Smith , "
25941	25980	25935	25935	Holmes	105	" You are frightening yourself about nothing . How could you possibly tell that it was the wooden - legged man who came in the night ? I don t quite understand how you can be so sure . "
25981	26064	25453	25453	Holmes	105	" His voice , sir . I knew his voice , which is kind o thick and foggy . He tapped at the winder , about three it would be . Show a leg , matey , says he : time to turn out guard . My old man woke up Jim , that s my eldest , and away they went , without so much as a word to me . I could hear the wooden leg clackin on the stones . "
26065	26075	25935	25935	Holmes	105	" And was this wooden - legged man alone ? "
26076	26095	25453	25453	Holmes	105	" Couldn t say , I am sure , sir . I didn t hear no one else . "
26096	26128	25935	25935	Holmes	105	" I am sorry , Mrs. Smith , for I wanted a steam launch , and I have heard good reports of the Let me see , what is her name ? "
26129	26137	25453	25453	Holmes	105	" The _ Aurora _ , sir . "
26138	26159	25935	25935	Holmes	105	" Ah ! She s not that old green launch with a yellow line , very broad in the beam ? "
26160	26190	25453	25453	Holmes	105	" No , indeed . She s as trim a little thing as any on the river . She s been fresh painted , black with two red streaks . "
26191	26240	25935	25935	Holmes	105	" Thanks . I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith . I am going down the river ; and if I should see anything of the _ Aurora _ I shall let him know that you are uneasy . A black funnel , you say ? "
26241	26252	25453	25453	Holmes	105	" No , sir . Black with a white band . "
26253	26294	25935	25935	Holmes	105	" Ah , of course . It was the sides which were black . Good - morning , Mrs. Smith . There is a boatman here with a wherry , Watson . We shall take it and cross the river . "
26295	26305	26307	26307	Holmes	105	" The main thing with people of that sort , "
26319	26373	26307	26307	Holmes	105	" is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you . If you do , they will instantly shut up like an oyster . If you listen to them under protest , as it were , you are very likely to get what you want . "
26374	26382	26384	26384	I.	509	" Our course now seems pretty clear , "
26385	26393	25935	25935	Holmes	105	" What would you do , then ? "
26394	26414	26384	26384	I.	509	" I would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the _ Aurora _ . "
26415	26478	25935	25935	Holmes	105	" My dear fellow , it would be a colossal task . She may have touched at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich . Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing - places for miles . It would take you days and days to exhaust them , if you set about it alone . "
26479	26486	26384	26384	I.	509	" Employ the police , then . "
26487	26542	25935	25935	Holmes	105	" No . I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment . He is not a bad fellow , and I should not like to do anything which would injure him professionally . But I have a fancy for working it out myself , now that we have gone so far . "
26543	26556	26384	26384	I.	509	" Could we advertise , then , asking for information from wharfingers ? "
26557	26655	25935	25935	Holmes	105	" Worse and worse ! Our men would know that the chase was hot at their heels , and they would be off out of the country . As it is , they are likely enough to leave , but as long as they think they are perfectly safe they will be in no hurry . Jones s energy will be of use to us there , for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily press , and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong scent . "
26656	26665	26384	26384	I.	509	" What are we to do , then ? "
26676	26735	26764	26764	he	105	" Take this hansom , drive home , have some breakfast , and get an hour s sleep . It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to - night again . Stop at a telegraph - office , cabby ! We will keep Toby , for he may be of use to us yet . "
26754	26763	26764	26764	he	105	" Whom do you think that is to ? "
26773	26782	26764	26764	he	105	" I am sure I don t know . "
26783	26804	26764	26764	he	105	" You remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force whom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case ? "
26805	26808	26810	26810	I	0	" Well , "
26814	26872	26764	26764	he	105	" This is just the case where they might be invaluable . If they fail , I have other resources ; but I shall try them first . That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant , Wiggins , and I expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast . "
27103	27108	27110	27110	he	138	" Here it is , "
27121	27153	27110	27110	he	138	" The energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them . But you have had enough of the case . Better have your ham and eggs first . "

27177	27185	27110	27110	he	138	" About twelve o clock last night , "
27192	27569	27110	27110	he	138	" Mr. Bartholomew Sholto , of Pondicherry Lodge , Upper Norwood , was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play . As far as we can learn , no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto s person , but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off . The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson , who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto , brother of the deceased . By a singular piece of good fortune , Mr. Athelney Jones , the well - known member of the detective police force , happened to be at the Norwood Police Station , and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm . His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals , with the gratifying result that the brother , Thaddeus Sholto , has already been arrested , together with the housekeeper , Mrs. Bernstone , an Indian butler named Lal Rao , and a porter , or gatekeeper , named McMurdo . It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house , for Mr. Jones s well - known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window , but must have made their way across the roof of the building , and so through a trap - door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found . This fact , which has been very clearly made out , proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary . The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind . We can not but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralised , and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate . "
27570	27576	27578	27578	Holmes	105	" Isn t it gorgeous ! "
27587	27595	27578	27578	Holmes	105	" What do you think of it ? "
27596	27614	27665	27665	her	113	" I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime . "
27615	27641	27578	27578	Holmes	105	" So do I. I wouldn t answer for our safety now , if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy . "
27675	27681	27682	27682	I	0	" By heaven , Holmes , "
27688	27698	27682	27682	I	0	" I believe that they are really after us . "
27699	27722	27665	27665	her	113	" No , it s not quite so bad as that . It is the unofficial force , the Baker Street irregulars . "
27818	27825	27827	27827	he	520	" Got your message , sir , "
27829	27844	27827	27827	he	520	" and brought em on sharp . Three bob and a tanner for tickets . "
27845	27850	27852	27852	Holmes	105	" Here you are , "
27858	27991	27852	27852	Holmes	105	" In future they can report to you , Wiggins , and you to me . I can not have the house invaded in this way . However , it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions . I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called the _ Aurora _ , owner Mordecai Smith , black with two red streaks , funnel black with a white band . She is down the river somewhere . I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith s landing - stage opposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back . You must divide it out among yourselves , and do both banks thoroughly . Let me know the moment you have news . Is that all clear ? "
27992	27998	28000	28000	Wiggins	159	" Yes , guv nor , "
28002	28032	28033	28033	He	159	" The old scale of pay , and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat . Here s a day in advance . Now off you go ! "
28060	28072	28074	28074	Holmes	105	" If the launch is above water they will find her , "
28087	28145	28077	28077	he	105	" They can go everywhere , see everything , overhear every one . I expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her . In the meanwhile , we can do nothing but await results . We can not pick up the broken trail until we find either the _ Aurora _ or Mr. Mordecai Smith . "
28146	28165	28035	28035	them	524	" Toby could eat these scraps , I dare say . Are you going to bed , Holmes ? "
28166	28253	28077	28077	he	105	" No ; I am not tired . I have a curious constitution . I never remember feeling tired by work , though idleness exhausts me completely . I am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us . If ever man had an easy task , this of ours ought to be . Wooden - legged men are not so common , but the other man must , I should think , be absolutely unique . "
28254	28260	28035	28035	them	524	" That other man again ! "
28261	28327	28077	28077	he	105	" I have no wish to make a mystery of him , to you , anyway . But you must have formed your own opinion . Now , do consider the data . Diminutive footmarks , toes never fettered by boots , naked feet , stone - headed wooden mace , great agility , small poisoned darts . What do you make of all this ? "
28328	28332	28333	28333	I	0	" A savage ! "
28336	28350	28333	28333	I	0	" Perhaps one of those Indians who were the associates of Jonathan Small . "
28351	28355	28357	28357	he	526	" Hardly that , "
28359	28477	28357	28357	he	526	" When first I saw signs of strange weapons I was inclined to think so ; but the remarkable character of the footmarks caused me to reconsider my views . Some of the inhabitants of the Indian Peninsula are small men , but none could have left such marks as that . The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet . The sandal - wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others , because the thong is commonly passed between . These little darts , too , could only be shot in one way . They are from a blow - pipe . Now , then , where are we to find our savage ? "
28478	28482	28483	28483	I	0	" South American , "
28502	28835	28486	28486	He	526	" This is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published . It may be looked upon as the very latest authority . What have we here ? Andaman Islands , situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra , in the Bay of Bengal . Hum ! hum ! What s all this ? Moist climate , coral reefs , sharks , Port Blair , convict - barracks , Rutland Island , cottonwoods Ah , here we are . The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth , though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa , the Digger Indians of America , and the Terra del Fuegians . The average height is rather below four feet , although many full - grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this . They are a fierce , morose , and intractable people , though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained . Mark that , Watson . Now , then , listen to this . They are naturally hideous , having large , misshapen heads , small , fierce eyes , and distorted features . Their feet and hands , however , are remarkably small . So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British official have failed to win them over in any degree . They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews , braining the survivors with their stone - headed clubs , or shooting them with their poisoned arrows . These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast . Nice , amiable people , Watson ! If this fellow had been left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn . I fancy that , even as it is , Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to have employed him . "
28836	28848	28963	28963	he	527	" But how came he to have so singular a companion ? "
28849	28928	28486	28486	He	526	" Ah , that is more than I can tell . Since , however , we had already determined that Small had come from the Andamans , it is not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him . No doubt we shall know all about it in time . Look here , Watson ; you look regularly done . Lie down there on the sofa , and see if I can put you to sleep . "
29096	29102	29103	29103	he	105	" You have slept soundly , "
29106	29116	29103	29103	he	105	" I feared that our talk would wake you . "
29117	29122	29123	29123	I	0	" I heard nothing , "
29126	29135	29123	29123	I	0	" Have you had fresh news , then ? "
29136	29191	29103	29103	he	105	" Unfortunately , no . I confess that I am surprised and disappointed . I expected something definite by this time . Wiggins has just been up to report . He says that no trace can be found of the launch . It is a provoking check , for every hour is of importance . "
29192	29213	29123	29123	I	0	" Can I do anything ? I am perfectly fresh now , and quite ready for another night s outing . "
29214	29259	29103	29103	he	105	" No , we can do nothing . We can only wait . If we go ourselves , the message might come in our absence , and delay be caused . You can do what you will , but I must remain on guard . "
29260	29282	29123	29123	I	0	" Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil Forrester . She asked me to , yesterday . "
29283	29289	29291	29291	Holmes	105	" On Mrs. Cecil Forrester ? "
29303	29320	29123	29123	I	0	" Well , of course Miss Morstan too . They were anxious to hear what happened . "
29321	29330	29332	29332	Holmes	105	" I would not tell them too much , "
29334	29349	29332	29332	Holmes	105	" Women are never to be entirely trusted , not the best of them . "
29361	29372	29373	29373	I	0	" I shall be back in an hour or two , "
29376	29421	29434	29437	a half - sovereign	530	" All right ! Good luck ! But , I say , if you are crossing the river you may as well return Toby , for I don t think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him now . "
29541	29547	29549	29550	Mrs. Forrester	114	" It is a romance ! "
29552	29586	29549	29550	Mrs. Forrester	114	" An injured lady , half a million in treasure , a black cannibal , and a wooden - legged ruffian . They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl . "
29587	29597	29599	29600	Miss Morstan	112	" And two knight - errants to the rescue , "
29609	29655	29549	29550	Mrs. Forrester	114	" Why , Mary , your fortune depends upon the issue of this search . I don t think that you are nearly excited enough . Just imagine what it must be to be so rich , and to have the world at your feet ! "
29705	29717	29718	29718	she	112	" It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious , "
29721	29756	29718	29718	she	112	" Nothing else is of any consequence ; but I think that he has behaved most kindly and honourably throughout . It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge . "
29807	29818	29819	29819	I	0	" I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out , "
29833	29853	29855	29855	her	113	" No , sir . He has gone to his room , sir . Do you know , sir , "
29862	29870	29855	29855	her	113	" I am afraid for his health ? "
29871	29878	29855	29855	her	113	" Why so , Mrs. Hudson ? "
29879	30021	29855	29855	her	113	" Well , he s that strange , sir . After you was gone he walked and he walked , up and down , and up and down , until I was weary of the sound of his footstep . Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering , and every time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead , with What is that , Mrs. Hudson ? And now he has slammed off to his room , but I can hear him walking away the same as ever . I hope he s not going to be ill , sir . I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine , but he turned on me , sir , with such a look that I don t know how ever I got out of the room . "
30022	30039	30040	30040	I	0	" I don t think that you have any cause to be uneasy , Mrs. Hudson , "
30043	30065	29855	29855	her	113	" I have seen him like this before . He has some small matter upon his mind which makes him restless . "
30135	30145	30146	30146	I	0	" You are knocking yourself up , old man , "
30149	30159	30146	30146	I	0	" I heard you marching about in the night . "
30160	30168	30169	30169	he	537	" No , I could not sleep , "
30172	30280	30169	30169	he	537	" This infernal problem is consuming me . It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle , when all else had been overcome . I know the men , the launch , everything ; and yet I can get no news . I have set other agencies at work , and used every means at my disposal . The whole river has been searched on either side , but there is no news , nor has Mrs. Smith heard of her husband . I shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft . But there are objections to that . "
30281	30294	30146	30146	I	0	" Or that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent . "
30295	30319	30169	30169	he	537	" No , I think that may be dismissed . I had inquiries made , and there is a launch of that description . "
30320	30329	30146	30146	I	0	" Could it have gone up the river ? "
30330	30391	30169	30169	he	537	" I have considered that possibility too , and there is a search - party who will work up as far as Richmond . If no news comes to - day , I shall start off myself to - morrow , and go for the men rather than the boat . But surely , surely , we shall hear something . "
30613	30623	30625	30625	he	105	" I am off down the river , Watson , "
30627	30658	30625	30625	he	105	" I have been turning it over in my mind , and I can see only one way out of it . It is worth trying , at all events . "
30659	30669	30671	30671	I.	0	" Surely I can come with you , then ? "
30672	30750	30625	30625	he	105	" No ; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative . I am loath to go , for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day , though Wiggins was despondent about it last night . I want you to open all notes and telegrams , and to act on your own judgment if any news should come . Can I rely upon you ? "
30751	30755	30671	30671	I.	0	" Most certainly . "
30756	30814	30625	30625	he	105	" I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me , for I can hardly tell yet where I may find myself . If I am in luck , however , I may not be gone so very long . I shall have news of some sort or other before I get back . "
30847	30856	30835	30835	I	0	" With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy , "
30860	30972	30835	30835	I	0	" we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed . Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter . He and the housekeeper , Mrs. Bernstone , were both released yesterday evening . It is believed , however , that the police have a clue as to the real culprits , and that it is being prosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones , of Scotland Yard , with all his well - known energy and sagacity . Further arrests may be expected at any moment . "
30973	30983	30985	30985	I.	0	" That is satisfactory so far as it goes , "
30986	31021	30835	30835	I	0	" Friend Sholto is safe , at any rate . I wonder what the fresh clue may be ; though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder . "
31051	31147	30835	30835	I	0	" Lost . Whereas Mordecai Smith , boatman , and his son , Jim , left Smith s Wharf at or about three o clock last Tuesday morning in the steam launch _ Aurora _ , black with two red stripes , funnel black with a white band , the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to Mrs. Smith , at Smith s Wharf , or at 221_b _ Baker Street , as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch _ Aurora _ . "
31535	31546	31548	31548	he	105	" Good - day , sir ; good - day , "
31550	31560	31548	31548	he	105	" Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out , I understand . "
31561	31594	31502	31509	the brusque and masterful professor of common sense	553	" Yes , and I can not be sure when he will be back . But perhaps you would care to wait . Take that chair and try one of these cigars . "
31595	31607	31609	31609	he	105	" Thank you ; I don t mind if I do , "
31620	31629	31502	31509	the brusque and masterful professor of common sense	553	" And a whiskey - and - soda ? "
31630	31669	31502	31509	the brusque and masterful professor of common sense	553	" Well , half a glass . It is very hot for the time of year ; and I have had a good deal to worry and try me . You know my theory about this Norwood case ? "
31670	31678	31502	31509	the brusque and masterful professor of common sense	553	" I remember that you expressed one . "
31679	31791	31502	31509	the brusque and masterful professor of common sense	553	" Well , I have been obliged to reconsider it . I had my net drawn tightly round Mr. Sholto , sir , when pop he went through a hole in the middle of it . He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken . From the time that he left his brother s room he was never out of sight of some one or other . So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trap - doors . It s a very dark case , and my professional credit is at stake . I should be very glad of a little assistance . "
31792	31799	31801	31801	I.	554	" We all need help sometimes , "
31802	31815	31817	31817	he	555	" Your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man , sir , "
31826	31940	31817	31817	he	555	" He s a man who is not to be beat . I have known that young man go into a good many cases , but I never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon . He is irregular in his methods , and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories , but , on the whole , I think he would have made a most promising officer , and I don t care who knows it . I have had a wire from him this morning , by which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business . Here is the message . "
31966	31974	31817	31817	he	555	" Go to Baker Street at once , "
31978	32018	31817	31817	he	555	" If I have not returned , wait for me . I am close on the track of the Sholto gang . You can come with us to - night if you want to be in at the finish . "
32019	32033	32035	32035	I.	0	" This sounds well . He has evidently picked up the scent again , "
32036	32047	32049	32049	Jones	109	" Ah , then he has been at fault too , "
32055	32109	32049	32049	Jones	109	" Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes . Of course this may prove to be a false alarm ; but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip . But there is some one at the door . Perhaps this is he . "
32297	32305	32306	32306	I	0	" What is it , my man ? "
32322	32329	32331	32331	he	556	" Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here ? "
32333	32354	32285	32295	a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty	559	" No ; but I am acting for him . You can tell me any message you have for him . "
32355	32367	32369	32369	he	556	" It was to him himself I was to tell it , "
32371	32391	32285	32295	a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty	559	" But I tell you that I am acting for him . Was it about Mordecai Smith s boat ? "
32392	32427	32461	32464	a very old man	560	" Yes . I knows well where it is . An I knows where the men he is after are . An I knows where the treasure is . I knows all about it . "
32428	32440	32285	32295	a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty	559	" Then tell me , and I shall let him know . "
32441	32452	32453	32453	he	556	" It was to him I was to tell it , "
32466	32475	32547	32547	him	556	" Well , you must wait for him . "
32476	32533	32547	32547	him	556	" No , no ; I ain t goin to lose a whole day to please no one . If Mr. Holmes ain t here , then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself . I don t care about the look of either of you , and I won t tell a word . "
32549	32557	32559	32559	he	109	" Wait a bit , my friend , "
32561	32590	32559	32559	he	109	" You have important information , and you must not walk off . We shall keep you , whether you like or not , until our friend returns . "
32622	32629	32630	32630	he	109	" Pretty sort o treatment this ! "
32637	32667	32630	32630	he	109	" I come here to see a gentleman , and you two , who I never saw in my life , seize me and treat me in this fashion ! "
32668	32676	32677	32677	I	0	" You will be none the worse , "
32680	32708	32677	32677	I	0	" We shall recompense you for the loss of your time . Sit over here on the sofa , and you will not have long to wait . "
32748	32760	32761	32761	he	105	" I think that you might offer me a cigar too , "
32785	32788	32789	32789	I	0	" Holmes ! "
32792	32803	32789	32789	I	0	" You here ! But where is the old man ? "
32804	32811	32813	32813	he	105	" Here is the old man , "
32823	32856	32813	32813	he	105	" Here he is , wig , whiskers , eyebrows , and all . I thought my disguise was pretty good , but I hardly expected that it would stand that test . "
32857	32863	32865	32865	Jones	109	" Ah , You rogue ! "
32870	32928	32865	32865	Jones	109	" You would have made an actor , and a rare one . You had the proper workhouse cough , and those weak legs of yours are worth ten pounds a week . I thought I knew the glint of your eye , though . You didn t get away from us so easily , You see . "
32929	32942	32944	32944	he	105	" I have been working in that get - up all day , "
32950	33001	32944	32944	he	105	" You see , a good many of the criminal classes begin to know me , especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my cases : so I can only go on the war - path under some simple disguise like this . You got my wire ? "
33002	33012	32813	32813	he	105	" Yes ; that was what brought me here . "
33013	33020	32944	32944	he	105	" How has your case prospered ? "
33021	33049	32813	32813	he	105	" It has all come to nothing . I have had to release two of my prisoners , and there is no evidence against the other two . "
33050	33100	32944	32944	he	105	" Never mind . We shall give you two others in the place of them . But you must put yourself under my orders . You are welcome to all the official credit , but you must act on the line that I point out . Is that agreed ? "
33101	33113	32813	32813	he	105	" Entirely , if you will help me to the men . "
33114	33145	32944	32944	he	105	" Well , then , in the first place I shall want a fast police - boat a steam launch to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o clock . "
33146	33172	32813	32813	he	105	" That is easily managed . There is always one about there ; but I can step across the road and telephone to make sure . "
33173	33187	32944	32944	he	105	" Then I shall want two stanch men , in case of resistance . "
33188	33202	32813	32813	he	105	" There will be two or three in the boat . What else ? "
33203	33257	32944	32944	he	105	" When we secure the men we shall get the treasure . I think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs . Let her be the first to open it . Eh , Watson ? "
33258	33268	32813	32813	he	105	" It would be a great pleasure to me . "
33269	33275	33277	33277	Jones	109	" Rather an irregular proceeding , "
33283	33317	33277	33277	Jones	109	" However , the whole thing is irregular , and I suppose we must wink at it . The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation . "
33318	33392	32813	32813	he	105	" Certainly . That is easily managed . One other point . I should much like to have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan Small himself . You know I like to work the detail of my cases out . There is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him , either here in my rooms or elsewhere , as long as he is efficiently guarded ? "
33393	33438	33277	33277	Jones	109	" Well , you are master of the situation . I have had no proof yet of the existence of this Jonathan Small . However , if you can catch him I don t see how I can refuse you an interview with him . "
33439	33446	32813	32813	he	105	" That is understood , then ? "
33447	33455	33277	33277	Jones	109	" Perfectly . Is there anything else ? "
33456	33507	32813	32813	he	105	" Only that I insist upon your dining with us . It will be ready in half an hour . I have oysters and a brace of grouse , with something a little choice in white wines . Watson , you have never yet recognised my merits as a housekeeper . "
33715	33719	33721	33721	he	105	" One bumper , "
33723	33749	33721	33721	he	105	" to the success of our little expedition . And now it is high time we were off . Have you a pistol , Watson ? "
33750	33762	33704	33704	his	105	" I have my old service - revolver in my desk . "
33763	33798	33721	33721	he	105	" You had best take it , then . It is well to be prepared . I see that the cab is at the door . I ordered it for half - past six . "
33824	33837	33821	33821	it	568	" Is there anything to mark it as a police - boat ? "
33838	33848	33821	33821	it	568	" Yes , that green lamp at the side . "
33849	33855	33821	33821	it	568	" Then take it off . "
33907	33911	33913	33913	Jones	109	" Where to ? "
33915	33929	33900	33904	two burly police - inspectors	571	" To the Tower . Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson s Yard . "
33970	33983	33984	33984	he	105	" We ought to be able to catch anything on the river , "
33987	34003	33900	33904	two burly police - inspectors	571	" Well , hardly that . But there are not many launches to beat us . "
34004	34051	33966	33966	her	574	" We shall have to catch the _ Aurora _ , and she has a name for being a clipper . I will tell you how the land lies , Watson . You recollect how annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing ? "
34052	34055	33900	33904	two burly police - inspectors	571	" Yes . "
34056	34287	33966	33966	her	574	" Well , I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis . One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest . So it is . When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at , I came back to our problem of the Sholtos , and thought the whole matter out again . My boys had been up the river and down the river without result . The launch was not at any landing - stage or wharf , nor had it returned . Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces , though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed . I knew this man Small had a certain degree of low cunning , but I did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse . That is usually a product of higher education . I then reflected that since he had certainly been in London some time as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge he could hardly leave at a moment s notice , but would need some little time , if it were only a day , to arrange his affairs . That was the balance of probability , at any rate . "
34288	34299	34301	34301	I.	575	" It seems to me to be a little weak , "
34302	34322	34301	34301	I.	575	" It is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition . "
34323	34578	34301	34301	I.	575	" No , I hardly think so . This lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it . But a second consideration struck me . Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion , however much he may have top - coated him , would give rise to gossip , and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy . He was quite sharp enough to see that . They had started from their head - quarters under cover of darkness , and he would wish to get back before it was broad light . Now , it was past three o clock , according to Mrs. Smith , when they got the boat . It would be quite bright , and people would be about in an hour or so . Therefore , I argued , they did not go very far . They paid Smith well to hold his tongue , reserved his launch for the final escape , and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure - box . In a couple of nights , when they had time to see what view the papers took , and whether there was any suspicion , they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs , where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies . "
34579	34594	34301	34301	I.	575	" But the launch ? They could not have taken that to their lodgings . "
34595	34770	34301	34301	I.	575	" Quite so . I argued that the launch must be no great way off , in spite of its invisibility . I then put myself in the place of Small , and looked at it as a man of his capacity would . He would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track . How , then , could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted ? I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes . I could only think of one way of doing it . I might land the launch over to some boat - builder or repairer , with directions to make a trifling change in her . She would then be removed to his shed or yard , and so be effectually concealed , while at the same time I could have her at a few hours notice . "
34771	34777	34301	34301	I.	575	" That seems simple enough . "
34778	35085	34301	34301	I.	575	" It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked . However , I determined to act on the idea . I started at once in this harmless seaman s rig and inquired at all the yards down the river . I drew blank at fifteen , but at the sixteenth Jacobson s I learned that the _ Aurora _ had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden - legged man , with some trivial directions as to her rudder . There ain t naught amiss with her rudder , said the foreman . There she lies , with the red streaks . At that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith , the missing owner ? He was rather the worse for liquor . I should not , of course , have known him , but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch . I want her to - night at eight o clock , said he , eight o clock sharp , mind , for I have two gentlemen who won t be kept waiting . They had evidently paid him well , for he was very flush of money , chucking shillings about to the men . I followed him some distance , but he subsided into an ale - house : so I went back to the yard , and , happening to pick up one of my boys on the way , I stationed him as a sentry over the launch . He is to stand at water s edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start . We shall be lying off in the stream , and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men , treasure , and all . "
35086	35104	35106	35106	Jones	109	" You have planned it all very neatly , whether they are the right men or not , "
35108	35138	35106	35106	Jones	109	" but if the affair were in my hands I should have had a body of police in Jacobson s Yard , and arrested them when they came down . "
35139	35175	34301	34301	I.	575	" Which would have been never . This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow . He would send a scout on ahead , and if anything made him suspicious lie snug for another week . "
35176	35196	35198	35198	I.	576	" But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith , and so been led to their hiding - place , "
35199	35265	35198	35198	I.	576	" In that case I should have wasted my day . I think that it is a hundred to one against Smith knowing where they live . As long as he has liquor and good pay , why should he ask questions ? They send him messages what to do . No , I thought over every possible course , and this is the best . "
35318	35325	35327	35327	Holmes	105	" That is Jacobson s Yard , "
35342	35357	35358	35358	He	105	" Cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters . "
35377	35386	35387	35387	he	105	" I see my sentry at his post , "
35390	35398	35387	35387	he	105	" but no sign of a handkerchief . "
35399	35416	35418	35418	Jones	109	" Suppose we go down - stream a short way and lie in wait for them , "
35448	35459	35460	35460	Holmes	105	" We have no right to take anything for granted , "
35463	35532	35460	35460	Holmes	105	" It is certainly ten to one that they go down - stream , but we can not be certain . From this point we can see the entrance of the yard , and they can hardly see us . It will be a clear night and plenty of light . We must stay where we are . See how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight . "
35533	35543	35387	35387	he	105	" They are coming from work in the yard . "
35544	35592	35460	35460	Holmes	105	" Dirty - looking rascals , but I suppose every one has some little immortal spark concealed about him . You would not think it , to look at them . There is no _ a priori _ probability about it . A strange enigma is man ! "
35593	35605	35606	35606	I	0	" Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal , "
35609	35618	35620	35620	Holmes	105	" Winwood Reade is good upon the subject , "
35622	35704	35620	35620	Holmes	105	" He remarks that , while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle , in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty . You can , for example , never foretell what any one man will do , but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to . Individuals vary , but percentages remain constant . So says the statistician . But do I see a handkerchief ? Surely there is a white flutter over yonder . "
35705	35713	35714	35714	I	0	" Yes , it is your boy , "
35717	35724	35714	35714	I	0	" I can see him plainly . "
35725	35734	35736	35736	Holmes	105	" And there is the _ Aurora _ , "
35738	35778	35736	35736	Holmes	105	" and going like the devil ! Full speed ahead , engineer . Make after that launch with the yellow light . By heaven , I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us ! "
35841	35847	35848	35848	he	109	" She is very fast , "
35851	35860	35848	35848	he	109	" I doubt if we shall catch her . "
35861	35869	35871	35871	Holmes	105	" We _ must _ catch her ! "
35877	35901	35871	35871	Holmes	105	" Heap it on , stokers ! Make her do all she can ! If we burn the boat we must have them ! "
36069	36080	36082	36082	Holmes	105	" Pile it on , men , pile it on ! "
36106	36115	36100	36100	his	105	" Get every pound of steam you can . "
36116	36124	36126	36126	Jones	109	" I think we gain a little , "
36137	36144	36146	36146	I.	599	" I am sure of it , "
36147	36160	36100	36100	his	105	" We shall be up with her in a very few minutes . "
36852	36860	36862	36862	Holmes	105	" Fire if he raises his hand , "
37413	37417	37419	37419	Holmes	105	" See here , "
37427	37437	37419	37419	Holmes	105	" We were hardly quick enough with our pistols . "
37733	37739	37741	37741	Holmes	105	" Well , Jonathan Small , "
37747	37758	37741	37741	Holmes	105	" I am sorry that it has come to this . "
37759	37767	37768	37768	he	105	" And so am I , sir , "
37773	37872	37768	37768	he	105	" I don t believe that I can swing over the job . I give you my word on the book that I never raised hand against Mr. Sholto . It was that little hell - hound Tonga who shot one of his cursed darts into him . I had no part in it , sir . I was as grieved as if it had been my blood - relation . I welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it , but it was done , and I could not undo it again . "
37873	37878	37880	37880	Holmes	105	" Have a cigar , "
37882	37929	37880	37880	Holmes	105	" and you had best take a pull out of my flask , for you are very wet . How could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while you were climbing the rope ? "
37930	38064	37768	37768	he	105	" You seem to know as much about it as if you were there , sir . The truth is that I hoped to find the room clear . I knew the habits of the house pretty well , and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to his supper . I shall make no secret of the business . The best defence that I can make is just the simple truth . Now , if it had been the old major I would have swung for him with a light heart . I would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar . But it s cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto , with whom I had no quarrel whatever . "
38065	38151	37880	37880	Holmes	105	" You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones , of Scotland Yard . He is going to bring you up to my rooms , and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter . You must make a clean breast of it , for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you . I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room . "
38152	38277	38278	38278	he	655	" That he was , sir . I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the window . It fairly shook me , sir . I d have half killed Tonga for it if he had not scrambled off . That was how he came to leave his club , and some of his darts too , as he tells me , which I dare say helped to put you on our track ; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell . I don t feel no malice against you for it . But it does seem a queer thing , "
38286	38394	38278	38278	he	655	" that I who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans , and am like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor . It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the Agra treasure , which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it . To him it brought murder , to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt , to me it has meant slavery for life . "
38412	38418	38419	38419	he	109	" Quite a family party , "
38422	38487	38419	38419	he	109	" I think I shall have a pull at that flask , Holmes . Well , I think we may all congratulate each other . Pity we didn t take the other alive ; but there was no choice . I say , Holmes , you must confess that you cut it rather fine . It was all we could do to overhaul her . "
38488	38496	38498	38498	Holmes	105	" All is well that ends well , "
38500	38517	38498	38498	Holmes	105	" But I certainly did not know that the _ Aurora _ was such a clipper . "
38518	38563	38419	38419	he	109	" Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river , and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her . He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business . "
38564	38569	38571	38572	our prisoner	658	" Neither he did , "
38574	38630	38571	38572	our prisoner	658	" not a word . I chose his launch because I heard that she was a flier . We told him nothing , but we paid him well , and he was to get something handsome if we reached our vessel , the _ Esmeralda _ , at Gravesend , outward bound for the Brazils . "
38631	38669	38676	38678	the consequential Jones	109	" Well , if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him . If we are pretty quick in catching our men , we are not so quick in condemning them . "
38718	38727	38729	38729	Jones	109	" We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently , "
38731	38811	38729	38729	Jones	109	" and shall land you , Dr. Watson , with the treasure - box . I need hardly tell you that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this . It is most irregular ; but of course an agreement is an agreement . I must , however , as a matter of duty , send an inspector with you , since you have so valuable a charge . You will drive , no doubt ? "
38812	38819	38937	38937	my	0	" Yes , I shall drive . "
38820	38854	38729	38729	Jones	109	" It is a pity there is no key , that we may make an inventory first . You will have to break it open . Where is the key , my man ? "
38855	38863	38865	38865	Small	659	" At the bottom of the river , "
38869	38929	38729	38729	Jones	109	" Hum ! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble . We have had work enough already through you . However , doctor , I need not warn you to be careful . Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street rooms . You will find us there , on our way to the station . "
39156	39164	39165	39165	she	112	" I heard a cab drive up , "
39168	39197	39165	39165	she	112	" I thought that Mrs. Forrester had come back very early , but I never dreamed that it might be you . What news have you brought me ? "
39198	39207	39209	39209	I	0	" I have brought something better than news , "
39232	39255	39230	39230	me	0	" I have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world . I have brought you a fortune . "
39263	39271	39272	39272	she	112	" Is that the treasure , then ? "
39278	39335	39350	39350	she	112	" Yes , this is the great Agra treasure . Half of it is yours and half is Thaddeus Sholto s. You will have a couple of hundred thousand each . Think of that ! An annuity of ten thousand pounds . There will be few richer young ladies in England . Is it not glorious ? "
39375	39381	39383	39383	she	112	" If I have it , "
39385	39392	39383	39383	she	112	" I owe it to you . "
39393	39398	39399	39399	I	0	" No , no , "
39402	39452	39399	39399	I	0	" not to me , but to my friend Sherlock Holmes . With all the will in the world , I could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius . As it was , we very nearly lost it at the last moment . "
39453	39467	39469	39469	she	112	" Pray sit down and tell me all about it , Dr. Watson , "
39561	39566	39567	39567	she	112	" It is nothing , "
39580	39606	39567	39567	she	112	" I am all right again . It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed my friends in such horrible peril . "
39607	39613	39614	39614	I	0	" That is all over , "
39617	39673	39614	39614	I	0	" It was nothing . I will tell you no more gloomy details . Let us turn to something brighter . There is the treasure . What could be brighter than that ? I got leave to bring it with me , thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it . "
39674	39685	39686	39686	she	112	" It would be of the greatest interest to me , "
39728	39734	39735	39735	she	112	" What a pretty box ! "
39742	39751	39735	39735	she	112	" This is Indian work , I suppose ? "
39752	39762	39694	39694	her	112	" Yes ; it is Benares metal - work . "
39763	39768	39769	39769	she	112	" And so heavy ! "
39777	39792	39769	39769	she	112	" The box alone must be of some value . Where is the key ? "
39793	39801	39802	39802	I	0	" Small threw it into the Thames , "
39805	39814	39694	39694	her	112	" I must borrow Mrs. Forrester s poker . "
39946	39952	39954	39955	Miss Morstan	112	" The treasure is lost , "
40029	40033	40034	40034	I	0	" Thank God ! "
40052	40059	40060	40060	she	112	" Why do you say that ? "
40063	40072	40073	40073	I	0	" Because you are within my reach again , "
40086	40138	40080	40080	She	112	" Because I love you , Mary , as truly as ever a man loved a woman . Because this treasure , these riches , sealed my lips . Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you . That is why I said , Thank God . "
40139	40149	40150	40150	she	112	" Then I say , Thank God , too , "
40219	40225	40227	40227	he	674	" There goes the reward ! "
40231	40265	40227	40227	he	674	" Where there is no money there is no pay . This night s work would have been worth a tenner each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there . "
40266	40275	40276	40276	I	0	" Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man , "
40279	40292	40276	40276	I	0	" He will see that you are rewarded , treasure or no . "
40302	40309	40310	40310	he	677	" It s a bad job , "
40313	40322	40310	40310	he	677	" and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think . "
40429	40437	40439	40440	Athelney Jones	109	" This is your doing , Small , "
40444	40461	40462	40462	he	195	" Yes , I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it , "
40467	40663	40462	40462	he	195	" It is my treasure ; and if I can t have the loot I ll take darned good care that no one else does . I tell you that no living man has any right to it , unless it is three men who are in the Andaman convict - barracks and myself . I know now that I can not have the use of it , and I know that they can not . I have acted all through for them as much as for myself . It s been the sign of four with us always . Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have done , and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of Sholto or of Morstan . It was not to make them rich that we did for Achmet . You ll find the treasure where the key is , and where little Tonga is . When I saw that your launch must catch us , I put the loot away in a safe place . There are no rupees for you this journey . "
40664	40672	40674	40675	Athelney Jones	109	" You are deceiving us , Small , "
40679	40705	40674	40675	Athelney Jones	109	" If you had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been easier for you to have thrown box and all . "
40706	40720	40721	40721	he	109	" Easier for me to throw , and easier for you to recover , "
40731	40832	40721	40721	he	109	" The man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river . Now that they are scattered over five miles or so , it may be a harder job . It went to my heart to do it , though . I was half mad when you came up with us . However , there s no good grieving over it . I ve had ups in my life , and I ve had downs , but I ve learned not to cry over spilled milk . "
40833	40843	40845	40846	the detective	400	" This is a very serious matter , Small , "
40848	40874	40845	40846	the detective	400	" If you had helped justice , instead of thwarting it in this way , you would have had a better chance at your trial . "
40875	40878	40880	40883	the ex - convict	684	" Justice ! "
40885	41067	41068	41068	Small	685	" A pretty justice ! Whose loot is this , if it is not ours ? Where is the justice that I should give it up to those who have never earned it ? Look how I have earned it ! Twenty long years in that fever - ridden swamp , all day at work under the mangrove - tree , all night chained up in the filthy convict - huts , bitten by mosquitoes , racked with ague , bullied by every cursed black - faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man . That was how I earned the Agra treasure ; and you talk to me of justice because I can not bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may enjoy it ! I would rather swing a score of times , or have one of Tonga s darts in my hide , than live in a convict s cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine . "
41148	41159	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" You forget that we know nothing of all this , "
41164	41188	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" We have not heard your story , and we can not tell how far justice may originally have been on your side . "
41189	41296	41119	41120	the man	287	" Well , sir , you have been very fair - spoken to me , though I can see that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists . Still , I bear no grudge for that . It is all fair and above - board . If you want to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back . What I say to you is God s truth , every word of it . Thank you ; you can put the glass beside me here , and I ll put my lips to it if I am dry .
41297	41457	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" I am a Worcestershire man myself , born near Pershore . I dare say you would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look . I have often thought of taking a look round there , but the truth is that I was never much of a credit to the family , and I doubt if they would be so very glad to see me . They were all steady , chapel - going folk , small farmers , well - known and respected over the country - side , while I was always a bit of a rover . At last , however , when I was about eighteen , I gave them no more trouble , for I got into a mess over a girl , and could only get out of it again by taking the Queen s shilling and joining the 3rd Buffs , which was just starting for India .
41458	41640	41119	41120	the man	287	" I wasn t destined to do much soldiering , however . I had just got past the goose - step , and learned to handle my musket , when I was fool enough to go swimming in the Ganges . Luckily for me , my company sergeant , John Holder , was in the water at the same time , and he was one of the finest swimmers in the service . A crocodile took me , just as I was half - way across , and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have done it , just above the knee . What with the shock and the loss of blood , I fainted , and should have drowned if Holder had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank . I was five months in hospital over it , and when at last I was able to limp out of it with this timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalided out of the army and unfitted for any active occupation .
41641	41889	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" I was , as you can imagine , pretty down on my luck at this time , for I was a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year . However , my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise . A man named Abel White , who had come out there as an indigo - planter , wanted an overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work . He happened to be a friend of our colonel s , who had taken an interest in me since the accident . To make a long story short , the colonel recommended me strongly for the post and , as the work was mostly to be done on horseback , my leg was no great obstacle , for I had enough knee left to keep good grip on the saddle . What I had to do was to ride over the plantation , to keep an eye on the men as they worked , and to report the idlers . The pay was fair , I had comfortable quarters , and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo - planting . Mr. Abel White was a kind man , and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me , for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home .
41890	42397	41119	41120	the man	287	" Well , I was never in luck s way long . Suddenly , without a note of warning , the great mutiny broke upon us . One month India lay as still and peaceful , to all appearance , as Surrey or Kent ; the next there were two hundred thousand black devils let loose , and the country was a perfect hell . Of course you know all about it , gentlemen , a deal more than I do , very like , since reading is not in my line . I only know what I saw with my own eyes . Our plantation was at a place called Muttra , near the border of the Northwest Provinces . Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows , and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children , on their way to Agra , where were the nearest troops . Mr. Abel White was an obstinate man . He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated , and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up . There he sat on his veranda , drinking whiskey - pegs and smoking cheroots , while the country was in a blaze about him . Of course we stuck by him , I and Dawson , who , with his wife , used to do the book - work and the managing . Well , one fine day the crash came . I had been away on a distant plantation , and was riding slowly home in the evening , when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah . I rode down to see what it was , and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson s wife , all cut into ribbons , and half eaten by jackals and native dogs . A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face , quite dead , with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying across each other in front of him . I reined up my horse , wondering which way I should turn , but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abel White s bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof . I knew then that I could do my employer no good , but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter . From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends , with their red coats still on their backs , dancing and howling round the burning house . Some of them pointed at me , and a couple of bullets sang past my head ; so I broke away across the paddy - fields , and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra .
42398	42590	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" As it proved , however , there was no great safety there , either . The whole country was up like a swarm of bees . Wherever the English could collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns commanded . Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives . It was a fight of the millions against the hundreds ; and the cruellest part of it was that these men that we fought against , foot , horse , and gunners , were our own picked troops , whom we had taught and trained , handling our own weapons , and blowing our own bugle - calls . At Agra there were the 3rd Bengal Fusiliers , some Sikhs , two troops of horse , and a battery of artillery . A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed , and this I joined , wooden leg and all . We went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July , and we beat them back for a time , but our powder gave out , and we had to fall back upon the city .
42591	42668	41119	41120	the man	287	" Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side , which is not to be wondered at , for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it . Lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles to the east , and Cawnpore about as far to the south . From every point on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage .
42669	42910	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" The city of Agra is a great place , swarming with fanatics and fierce devil - worshippers of all sorts . Our handful of men were lost among the narrow , winding streets . Our leader moved across the river , therefore , and took up his position in the old fort at Agra . I don t know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort . It is a very queer place , the queerest that ever I was in , and I have been in some rum corners , too . First of all , it is enormous in size . I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres . There is a modern part , which took all our garrison , women , children , stores , and everything else , with plenty of room over . But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter , where nobody goes , and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes . It is all full of great deserted halls , and winding passages , and long corridors twisting in and out , so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it . For this reason it was seldom that any one went into it , though now and again a party with torches might go exploring .
42911	43159	41119	41120	the man	287	" The river washes along the front of the old fort , and so protects it , but on the sides and behind there are many doors , and these had to be guarded , of course , in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops . We were short - handed , with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns . It was impossible for us , therefore , to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates . What we did was to organise a central guard - house in the middle of the fort , and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives . I was selected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door upon the southwest side of the building . Two Sikh troopers were placed under my command , and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket , when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard . As the guard was a good two hundred paces away , however , and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors , I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack .
43160	43360	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" Well , I was pretty proud at having this small command given me , since I was a raw recruit , and a game - legged one at that . For two nights I kept the watch with my Punjaubees . They were tall , fierce - looking chaps , Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name , both old fighting - men who had borne arms against us at Chilian - wallah . They could talk English pretty well , but I could get little out of them . They preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo . For myself , I used to stand outside the gateway , looking down on the broad , winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city . The beating of drums , the rattle of tomtoms , and the yells and howls of the rebels , drunk with opium and with bang , were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbours across the stream . Every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts , to make sure that all was well .
43361	43509	41119	41120	the man	287	" The third night of my watch was dark and dirty , with a small , driving rain . It was dreary work standing in the gateway hour after hour in such weather . I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk , but without much success . At two in the morning the rounds passed , and broke for a moment the weariness of the night . Finding that my companions would not be led into conversation , I took out my pipe , and laid down my musket to strike the match . In an instant the two Sikhs were upon me . One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my head , while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step .
43510	43732	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" My first thought was that these fellows were in league with the rebels , and that this was the beginning of an assault . If our door were in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall , and the women and children be treated as they were in Cawnpore . Maybe you gentlemen think that I am just making out a case for myself , but I give you my word that when I thought of that , though I felt the point of the knife at my throat , I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream , if it was my last one , which might alarm the main guard . The man who held me seemed to know my thoughts ; for , even as I braced myself to it , he whispered , Don t make a noise . The fort is safe enough . There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river . There was the ring of truth in what he said , and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man . I could read it in the fellow s brown eyes . I waited , therefore , in silence , to see what it was that they wanted from me .
43733	43867	41119	41120	the man	287	" Listen to me , Sahib , said the taller and fiercer of the pair , the one whom they called Abdullah Khan . You must either be with us now or you must be silenced forever . The thing is too great a one for us to hesitate . Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the cross of the Christians , or your body this night shall be thrown into the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army . There is no middle way . Which is it to be , death or life ? We can only give you three minutes to decide , for the time is passing , and all must be done before the rounds come again .
43868	43920	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" How can I decide ? said I. You have not told me what you want of me . But I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of the fort I will have no truck with it , so you can drive home your knife and welcome .
43921	44014	41119	41120	the man	287	" It is nothing against the fort , said he . We only ask you to do that which your countrymen come to this land for . We ask you to be rich . If you will be one of us this night , we will swear to you upon the naked knife , and by the threefold oath which no Sikh was ever known to break , that you shall have your fair share of the loot . A quarter of the treasure shall be yours . We can say no fairer .
44015	44050	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" But what is the treasure , then ? I asked . I am as ready to be rich as you can be , if you will but show me how it can be done .
44051	44097	41119	41120	the man	287	" You will swear , then , said he , by the bones of your father , by the honour of your mother , by the cross of your faith , to raise no hand and speak no word against us , either now or afterwards ?
44098	44114	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" I will swear it , I answered , provided that the fort is not endangered .
44115	44142	41119	41120	the man	287	" Then my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of the treasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us .
44143	44150	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" There are but three , said I.
44151	44282	41119	41120	the man	287	" No ; Dost Akbar must have his share . We can tell the tale to you while we await them . Do you stand at the gate , Mahomet Singh , and give notice of their coming . The thing stands thus , Sahib , and I tell it to you because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee , and that we may trust you . Had you been a lying Hindoo , though you had sworn by all the gods in their false temples , your blood would have been upon the knife , and your body in the water . But the Sikh knows the Englishman , and the Englishman knows the Sikh . Hearken , then , to what I have to say .
44283	44572	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth , though his lands are small . Much has come to him from his father , and more still he has set by himself , for he is of a low nature and hoards his gold rather than spend it . When the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger , with the Sepoy and with the Company s Raj . Soon , however , it seemed to him that the white men s day was come , for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow . Yet , being a careful man , he made such plans that , come what might , half at least of his treasure should be left to him . That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace , but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box , and sent it by a trusty servant who , under the guise of a merchant , should take it to the fort at Agra , there to lie until the land is at peace . Thus , if the rebels won he would have his money , but if the Company conquered his jewels would be saved to him . Having thus divided his hoard , he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys , since they were strong upon his borders . By doing this , mark you , Sahib , his property becomes the due of those who have been true to their salt .
44573	44713	41119	41120	the man	287	" This pretended merchant , who travels under the name of Achmet , is now in the city of Agra , and desires to gain his way into the fort . He has with him as travelling - companion my foster - brother Dost Akbar , who knows his secret . Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a side - postern of the fort , and has chosen this one for his purpose . Here he will come presently , and here he will find Mahomet Singh and myself awaiting him . The place is lonely , and none shall know of his coming . The world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more , but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us . What say you to it , Sahib ?
44714	44853	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing ; but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and you have been used to meeting death at every turn . Whether Achmet the merchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me , but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it , and I thought of what I might do in the old country with it , and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne er - do - well coming back with his pockets full of gold moidores . I had , therefore , already made up my mind . Abdullah Khan , however , thinking that I hesitated , pressed the matter more closely .
44854	44999	41119	41120	the man	287	" Consider , Sahib , said he , that if this man is taken by the commandant he will be hung or shot , and his jewels taken by the government , so that no man will be a rupee the better for them . Now , since we do the taking of him , why should we not do the rest as well ? The jewels will be as well with us as in the Company s coffers . There will be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs . No one can know about the matter , for here we are cut off from all men . What could be better for the purpose ? Say again , then , Sahib , whether you are with us , or if we must look upon you as an enemy .
45000	45010	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" I am with you heart and soul , said I.
45011	45057	41119	41120	the man	287	" It is well , he answered , handing me back my firelock . You see that we trust you , for your word , like ours , is not to be broken . We have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant .
45058	45074	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" Does your brother know , then , of what you will do ? I asked .
45075	45099	41119	41120	the man	287	" The plan is his . He has devised it . We will go to the gate and share the watch with Mahomet Singh .
45100	45193	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" The rain was still falling steadily , for it was just the beginning of the wet season . Brown , heavy clouds were drifting across the sky , and it was hard to see more than a stone - cast . A deep moat lay in front of our door , but the water was in places nearly dried up , and it could easily be crossed . It was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death .
45194	45230	41119	41120	the man	287	" Suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side of the moat . It vanished among the mound - heaps , and then appeared again coming slowly in our direction .
45231	45238	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" Here they are ! I exclaimed .
45239	45297	41119	41120	the man	287	" You will challenge him , Sahib , as usual , whispered Abdullah . Give him no cause for fear . Send us in with him , and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard . Have the lantern ready to uncover , that we may be sure that it is indeed the man .
45298	45354	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" The light had flickered onwards , now stopping and now advancing , until I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat . I let them scramble down the sloping bank , splash through the mire , and climb half - way up to the gate , before I challenged them .
45355	45367	41119	41120	the man	287	" Who goes there ? said I , in a subdued voice .
45368	45548	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" Friends , came the answer . I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them . The first was an enormous Sikh , with a black beard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund . Outside of a show I have never seen so tall a man . The other was a little , fat , round fellow , with a great yellow turban , and a bundle in his hand , done up in a shawl . He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear , for his hands twitched as if he had the ague , and his head kept turning to left and right with two bright little twinkling eyes , like a mouse when he ventures out from his hole . It gave me the chills to think of killing him , but I thought of the treasure , and my heart set as hard as a flint within me . When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy and came running up towards me .
45549	45620	41119	41120	the man	287	" Your protection , Sahib , he panted , your protection for the unhappy merchant Achmet . I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek the shelter of the fort at Agra . I have been robbed and beaten and abused because I have been the friend of the Company . It is a blessed night this when I am once more in safety , I and my poor possessions .
45621	45631	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" What have you in the bundle ? I asked .
45632	45695	41119	41120	the man	287	" An iron box , he answered , which contains one or two little family matters which are of no value to others , but which I should be sorry to lose . Yet I am not a beggar ; and I shall reward you , young Sahib , and your governor also , if he will give me the shelter I ask .
45696	45741	41161	41161	Holmes	105	" I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man . The more I looked at his fat , frightened face , the harder did it seem that we should slay him in cold blood . It was best to get it over .
45742	45749	41119	41120	the man	287	" Take him to the main guard "
45798	46091	46116	46116	myself	0	" I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors . Suddenly it ceased , and I heard voices , and a scuffle , with the sound of blows . A moment later there came , to my horror , a rush of footsteps coming in my direction , with the loud breathing of a running man . I turned my lantern down the long , straight passage , and there was the fat man , running like the wind , with a smear of blood across his face , and close at his heels , bounding like a tiger , the great black - bearded Sikh , with a knife flashing in his hand . I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant . He was gaining on the Sikh , and I could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet . My heart softened to him , but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter . I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past , and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit . Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him , and buried his knife twice in his side . The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle , but lay were he had fallen . I think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall . You see , gentlemen , that I am keeping my promise . I am telling you every work of the business just exactly as it happened , whether it is in my favour or not . "
46232	46242	46244	46244	he	693	" It was all very bad , no doubt , "
46246	46337	46244	46244	he	693	" I should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains . Besides , it was my life or his when once he was in the fort . If he had got out , the whole business would come to light , and I should have been court - martialled and shot as likely as not ; for people were not very lenient at a time like that . "
46338	46345	46347	46347	Holmes	105	" Go on with your story , "
46351	46473	46224	46224	his	693	" Well , we carried him in , Abdullah , Akbar , and I. A fine weight he was , too , for all that he was so short . Mahomet Singh was left to guard the door . We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared . It was some distance off , where a winding passage leads to a great empty hall , the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces . The earth floor had sunk in at one place , making a natural grave , so we left Achmet the merchant there , having first covered him over with loose bricks . This done , we all went back to the treasure .
46474	46742	46224	46224	his	693	" It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked . The box was the same which now lies open upon your table . A key was hung by a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top . We opened it , and the light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore . It was blinding to look upon them . When we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them . There were one hundred and forty - three diamonds of the first water , including one which has been called , I believe , the Great Mogul and is said to be the second largest stone in existence . Then there were ninety - seven very fine emeralds , and one hundred and seventy rubies , some of which , however , were small . There were forty carbuncles , two hundred and ten sapphires , sixty - one agates , and a great quantity of beryls , onyxes , cats -eyes , turquoises , and other stones , the very names of which I did not know at the time , though I have become more familiar with them since . Besides this , there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls , twelve of which were set in a gold coronet . By the way , these last had been taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it .
46743	46972	46224	46224	his	693	" After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gateway to show them to Mahomet Singh . Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret . We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again , and then to divide it equally among ourselves . There was no use dividing it at present , for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion , and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them . We carried the box , therefore , into the same hall where we had buried the body , and there , under certain bricks in the best - preserved wall , we made a hollow and put our treasure . We made careful note of the place , and next day I drew four plans , one for each of us , and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom , for we had sworn that we should each always act for all , so that none might take advantage . That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken .
46973	47096	46224	46224	his	693	" Well , there s no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian mutiny . After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the back of the business was broken . Fresh troops came pouring in , and Nana Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier . A flying column under Colonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away from it . Peace seemed to be settling upon the country , and we four were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off with our shares of the plunder . In a moment , however , our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet .
47097	47412	46224	46224	his	693	" It came about in this way . When the rajah put his jewels into the hands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man . They are suspicious folk in the East , however : so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first ? This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out of his sight , and he followed him like his shadow . He went after him that night and saw him pass through the doorway . Of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort , and applied for admission there himself next day , but could find no trace of Achmet . This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides , who brought it to the ears of the commandant . A thorough search was quickly made , and the body was discovered . Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder , three of us because we had held the gate that night , and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man . Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial , for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India : so no one had any particular interest in them . The murder , however , was clearly made out , and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it . The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life , and I was condemned to death , though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others .
47413	47554	46224	46224	his	693	" It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then . There we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of ever getting out again , while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it . It was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack - in - office , to have rice to eat and water to drink , when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside , just waiting to be picked up . It might have driven me mad ; but I was always a pretty stubborn one , so I just held on and bided my time .
47555	47794	46224	46224	his	693	" At last it seemed to me to have come . I was changed from Agra to Madras , and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans . There are very few white convicts at this settlement , and , as I had behaved well from the first , I soon found myself a sort of privileged person . I was given a hut in Hope Town , which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet , and I was left pretty much to myself . It is a dreary , fever - stricken place , and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives , who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance . There was digging , and ditching , and yam - planting , and a dozen other things to be done , so we were busy enough all day ; though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves . Among other things , I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon , and picked up a smattering of his knowledge . All the time I was on the lookout for a chance of escape ; but it is hundreds of miles from any other land , and there is little or no wind in those seas : so it was a terribly difficult job to get away .
47795	47969	46224	46224	his	693	" The surgeon , Dr. Somerton , was a fast , sporting young chap , and the other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play cards . The surgery , where I used to make up my drugs , was next to his sitting - room , with a small window between us . Often , if I felt lonesome , I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery , and then , standing there , I could hear their talk and watch their play . I am fond of a hand at cards myself , and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others . There was Major Sholto , Captain Morstan , and Lieutenant Bromley Brown , who were in command of the native troops , and there was the surgeon himself , and two or three prison - officials , crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game . A very snug little party they used to make .
47970	48169	46224	46224	his	693	" Well , there was one thing which very soon struck me , and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win . Mind , I don t say that there was anything unfair , but so it was . These prison - chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans , and they knew each other s game to a point , while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow . Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men , and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play . Major Sholto was the hardest hit . He used to pay in notes and gold at first , but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums . He sometimes would win for a few deals , just to give him heart , and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever . All day he would wander about as black as thunder , and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him .
48170	48222	46224	46224	his	693	" One night he lost even more heavily than usual . I was sitting in my hut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to their quarters . They were bosom friends , those two , and never far apart . The major was raving about his losses .
48223	48255	46224	46224	his	693	" It s all up , Morstan , he was saying , as they passed my hut . I shall have to send in my papers . I am a ruined man .
48256	48296	46224	46224	his	693	" Nonsense , old chap ! said the other , slapping him upon the shoulder . I ve had a nasty facer myself , but That was all I could hear , but it was enough to set me thinking .
48297	48320	46224	46224	his	693	" A couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach : so I took the chance of speaking to him .
48321	48332	46224	46224	his	693	" I wish to have your advice , major , said I.
48333	48351	46224	46224	his	693	" Well , Small , what is it ? he asked , taking his cheroot from his lips .
48352	48429	46224	46224	his	693	" I wanted to ask you , sir , said I , who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over . I know where half a million worth lies , and , as I can not use it myself , I thought perhaps the best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities , and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for me .
48430	48451	46224	46224	his	693	" Half a million , Small ? he gasped , looking hard at me to see if I was in earnest .
48452	48498	46224	46224	his	693	" Quite that , sir , in jewels and pearls . It lies there ready for any one . And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed and can not hold property , so that it belongs to the first comer .
48499	48531	46224	46224	his	693	" To government , Small , he stammered , to government . But he said it in a halting fashion , and I knew in my heart that I had got him .
48532	48556	46224	46224	his	693	" You think , then , sir , that I should give the information to the Governor - General ? said I , quietly .
48557	48588	46224	46224	his	693	" Well , well , you must not do anything rash , or that you might repent . Let me hear all about it , Small . Give me the facts .
48589	48640	46224	46224	his	693	" I told him the whole story , with small changes so that he could not identify the places . When I had finished he stood stock still and full of thought . I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a struggle going on within him .
48641	48676	46224	46224	his	693	" This is a very important matter , Small , he said , at last . You must not say a word to any one about it , and I shall see you again soon .
48677	48700	46224	46224	his	693	" Two nights later he and his friend Captain Morstan came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern .
48701	48722	46224	46224	his	693	" I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own lips , Small , said he .
48723	48733	46224	46224	his	693	" I repeated it as I had told it before .
48734	48751	46224	46224	his	693	" It rings true , eh ? said he . It s good enough to act upon ?
48752	48756	46224	46224	his	693	" Captain Morstan nodded .
48757	48883	46224	46224	his	693	" Look here , Small , said the major . We have been talking it over , my friend here and I , and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours is hardly a government matter , after all , but is a private concern of your own , which of course you have the power of disposing of as you think best . Now , the question is , what price would you ask for it ? We might be inclined to take it up , and at least look into it , if we could agree as to terms . He tried to speak in a cool , careless way , but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed .
48884	48962	46224	46224	his	693	" Why , as to that , gentlemen , I answered , trying also to be cool , but feeling as excited as he did , there is only one bargain which a man in my position can make . I shall want you to help me to my freedom , and to help my three companions to theirs . We shall then take you into partnership , and give you a fifth share to divide between you .
48963	48978	46224	46224	his	693	" Hum ! said he . A fifth share ! That is not very tempting .
48979	48989	46224	46224	his	693	" It would come to fifty thousand apiece , said I.
48990	49008	46224	46224	his	693	" But how can we gain your freedom ? You know very well that you ask an impossibility .
49009	49116	46224	46224	his	693	" Nothing of the sort , I answered . I have thought it all out to the last detail . The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit for the voyage , and no provisions to last us for so long a time . There are plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would serve our turn well . Do you bring one over . We shall engage to get aboard her by night , and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain .
49117	49126	46224	46224	his	693	" If there were only one , he said .
49127	49148	46224	46224	his	693	" None or all , I answered . We have sworn it . The four of us must always act together .
49149	49182	46224	46224	his	693	" You see , Morstan , said he , Small is a man of his word . He does not flinch from his friend . I think we may very well trust him .
49183	49207	46224	46224	his	693	" It s a dirty business , the other answered . Yet , as you say , the money would save our commissions handsomely .
49208	49273	46224	46224	his	693	" Well , Small , said the major , we must , I suppose , try and meet you . We must first , of course , test the truth of your story . Tell me where the box is hid , and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India in the monthly relief - boat to inquire into the affair .
49274	49310	46224	46224	his	693	" Not so fast , said I , growing colder as he got hot . I must have the consent of my three comrades . I tell you that it is four or none with us .
49311	49328	46224	46224	his	693	" Nonsense ! he broke in . What have three black fellows to do with our agreement ?
49329	49348	46224	46224	his	693	" Black or blue , said I , they are in with me , and we all go together .
49349	49583	46224	46224	his	693	" Well , the matter ended by a second meeting , at which Mahomet Singh , Abdullah Khan , and Dost Akbar were all present . We talked the matter over again , and at last we came to an arrangement . We were to provide both the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid . Major Sholto was to go to India to test our story . If he found the box he was to leave it there , to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage , which was to lie off Rutland Island , and to which we were to make our way , and finally to return to his duties . Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of absence , to meet us at Agra , and there we were to have a final division of the treasure , he taking the major s share as well as his own . All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter . I sat up all night with paper and ink , and by the morning I had the two charts all ready , signed with the sign of four , that is , of Abdullah , Akbar , Mahomet , and myself .
49584	49823	46224	46224	his	693	" Well , gentlemen , I weary you with my long story , and I know that my friend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey . I ll make it as short as I can . The villain Sholto went off to India , but he never came back again . Captain Morstan showed me his name among a list of passengers in one of the mail - boats very shortly afterwards . His uncle had died , leaving him a fortune , and he had left the army , yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us . Morstan went over to Agra shortly afterwards , and found , as we expected , that the treasure was indeed gone . The scoundrel had stolen it all , without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret . From that day I lived only for vengeance . I thought of it by day and I nursed it by night . It became an overpowering , absorbing passion with me . I cared nothing for the law , nothing for the gallows . To escape , to track down Sholto , to have my hand upon his throat , that was my one thought . Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slaying of Sholto .
49824	49992	46224	46224	his	693	" Well , I have set my mind on many things in this life , and never one which I did not carry out . But it was weary years before my time came . I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine . One day when Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was picked up by a convict - gang in the woods . He was sick to death , and had gone to a lonely place to die . I took him in hand , though he was as venomous as a young snake , and after a couple of months I got him all right and able to walk . He took a kind of fancy to me then , and would hardly go back to his woods , but was always hanging about my hut . I learned a little of his lingo from him , and this made him all the fonder of me .
49993	50099	46224	46224	his	693	" Tonga for that was his name was a fine boatman , and owned a big , roomy canoe of his own . When I found that he was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me , I saw my chance of escape . I talked it over with him . He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded , and there he was to pick me up . I gave him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams , cocoa - nuts , and sweet potatoes .
50100	50475	46224	46224	his	693	" He was stanch and true , was little Tonga . No man ever had a more faithful mate . At the night named he had his boat at the wharf . As it chanced , however , there was one of the convict - guard down there , a vile Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me . I had always vowed vengeance , and now I had my chance . It was as if fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island . He stood on the bank with his back to me , and his carbine on his shoulder . I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with , but none could I see . Then a queer thought came into my head and showed me where I could lay my hand on a weapon . I sat down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg . With three long hops I was on him . He put his carbine to his shoulder , but I struck him full , and knocked the whole front of his skull in . You can see the split in the wood now where I hit him . We both went down together , for I could not keep my balance , but when I got up I found him still lying quiet enough . I made for the boat , and in an hour we were well out at sea . Tonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him , his arms and his gods . Among other things , he had a long bamboo spear , and some Andaman cocoa - nut matting , with which I made a sort of sail . For ten days we were beating about , trusting to luck , and on the eleventh we were picked up by a trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay pilgrims . They were a rum crowd , and Tonga and I soon managed to settle down among them . They had one very good quality : they let you alone and asked no questions .
50476	50693	46224	46224	his	693	" Well , if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and I went through , you would not thank me , for I would have you here until the sun was shining . Here and there we drifted about the world , something always turning up to keep us from London . All the time , however , I never lost sight of my purpose . I would dream of Sholto at night . A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep . At last , however , some three or four years ago , we found ourselves in England . I had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived , and I set to work to discover whether he had realised the treasure , or if he still had it . I made friends with someone who could help me , I name no names , for I don t want to get any one else in a hole , and I soon found that he still had the jewels . Then I tried to get at him in many ways ; but he was pretty sly , and had always two prize - fighters , besides his sons and his khitmutgar , on guard over him .
50694	50924	46224	46224	his	693	" One day , however , I got word that he was dying . I hurried at once to the garden , mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that , and , looking through the window , I saw him lying in his bed , with his sons on each side of him . I d have come through and taken my chance with the three of them , only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped , and I knew that he was gone . I got into his room that same night , though , and I searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had hidden our jewels . There was not a line , however : so I came away , bitter and savage as a man could be . Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred ; so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us , as it had been on the chart , and I pinned it on his bosom . It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled . "
50925	51292	46224	46224	his	693	" We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal . He would eat raw meat and dance his war - dance : so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day s work . I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge , and for some years there was no news to hear , except that they were hunting for the treasure . At last , however , came what we had waited for so long . The treasure had been found . It was up at the top of the house , in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto s chemical laboratory . I came at once and had a look at the place , but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make my way up to it . I learned , however , about a trap - door in the roof , and also about Mr. Sholto s supper - hour . It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga . I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist . He could climb like a cat , and he soon made his way through the roof , but , as ill luck would have it , Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room , to his cost . Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him , for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock . Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope s end and cursed him for a little blood - thirsty imp . I took the treasure - box and let it down , and then slid down myself , having first left the sign of the four upon the table , to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them . Tonga then pulled up the rope , closed the window , and made off the way that he had come . "

I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of Smith s launch the _ Aurora _ , so I thought she would be a handy craft for our escape . I engaged with old Smith , and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship . He knew , no doubt , that there was some screw loose , but he was not in our secrets . All this is the truth , and if I tell it to you , gentlemen , it is not to amuse you , for you have not done me a very good turn , but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing , but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto , and how innocent I am of the death of his son . "
51465	51471	51473	51474	Sherlock Holmes	105	" A very remarkable account , "
51476	51545	51473	51474	Sherlock Holmes	105	" A fitting wind - up to an extremely interesting case . There is nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative , except that you brought your own rope . That I did not know . By the way , I had hoped that Tonga had lost all his darts ; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat . "
51546	51569	51756	51758	the wary Jones	109	" He had lost them all , sir , except the one which was in his blow - pipe at the time . "
51570	51576	51578	51578	Holmes	105	" Ah , of course , "
51580	51588	51578	51578	Holmes	105	" I had not thought of that . "
51589	51603	51605	51606	the convict	696	" Is there any other point which you would like to ask about ? "
51610	51618	51619	51620	my companion	195	" I think not , thank you , "
51623	51628	51630	51631	Athelney Jones	109	" Well , Holmes , "
51633	51734	51630	51631	Athelney Jones	109	" You are a man to be humoured , and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime , but duty is duty , and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me . I shall feel more at ease when we have our story - teller here safe under lock and key . The cab still waits , and there are two inspectors downstairs . I am much obliged to you both for your assistance . Of course you will be wanted at the trial . Good - night to you . "
51735	51743	51745	51746	Jonathan Small	118	" Good - night , gentlemen both , "
51748	51754	51756	51758	the wary Jones	109	" You first , Small , "
51765	51795	51756	51758	the wary Jones	109	" I ll take particular care that you don t club me with your wooden leg , whatever you may have done to the gentleman at the Andaman Isles . "
51796	51809	51810	51810	I	0	" Well , and there is the end of our little drama , "
51823	51861	51810	51810	I	0	" I fear that it may be the last investigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your methods . Miss Morstan has done me the honour to accept me as a husband in prospective . "
51869	51875	51877	51877	he	109	" I feared as much , "
51879	51887	51877	51877	he	109	" I really can not congratulate you . "
51894	51906	51907	51907	I	0	" Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my choice ? "
51910	52009	51810	51810	I	0	" Not at all . I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met , and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing . She had a decided genius that way : witness the way in which she preserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father . But love is an emotional thing , and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things . I should never marry myself , lest I bias my judgment . "
52010	52014	52016	52016	I	0	" I trust , "
52020	52034	52016	52016	I	0	" that my judgment may survive the ordeal . But you look weary . "
52035	52057	51810	51810	I	0	" Yes , the reaction is already upon me . I shall be as limp as a rag for a week . "
52058	52061	52063	52063	I	0	" Strange , "
52065	52087	52063	52063	I	0	" how terms of what in another man I should call laziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigour . "
52088	52091	52092	52092	he	701	" Yes , "
52095	52126	52092	52092	he	701	" there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer and also of a pretty spry sort of fellow . I often think of those lines of old Goethe ,
52152	52210	52063	52063	I	0	" By the way , _ propos _ of this Norwood business , you see that they had , as I surmised , a confederate in the house , who could be none other than Lal Rao , the butler : so Jones actually has the undivided honour of having caught one fish in his great haul . "
52211	52218	52219	52219	I	0	" The division seems rather unfair , "
52222	52252	52219	52219	I	0	" You have done all the work in this business . I get a wife out of it , Jones gets the credit , pray what remains for you ? "
52253	52257	52259	52260	Sherlock Holmes	105	" For me , "
52262	52271	52259	52260	Sherlock Holmes	105	" there still remains the cocaine - bottle . "
