54	64	66	66	Alice	40	" and what is the use of a book , "
67	73	66	66	Alice	40	" without pictures or conversations ? "
170	182	164	165	the Rabbit	20	" Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be late ! "
492	495	475	475	She	40	" ORANGE MARMALADE "
537	540	542	542	Alice	40	" Well ! "
546	594	542	542	Alice	40	" after such a fall as this , I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs ! How brave they 'll all think me at home ! Why , I would n't say anything about it , even if I fell off the top of the house ! "
620	633	634	634	she	40	" I wonder how many miles I 've fallen by this time ? "
638	665	634	634	she	40	" I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth . Let me see : that would be four thousand miles down , I think-- "
724	747	773	773	she	40	" --yes , that 's about the right distance -- but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I 've got to ? "
777	814	773	773	she	40	" I wonder if I shall fall right _ through _ the earth ! How funny it 'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward ! The Antipathies , I think-- "
842	872	773	773	she	40	" --but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is , you know . Please , Ma'am , is this New Zealand or Australia ? "
904	936	875	875	she	40	" And what an ignorant little girl she 'll think me for asking ! No , it 'll never do to ask : perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere . "
957	971	951	951	Alice	40	" Dinah'll miss me very much to - night , I should think ! "
979	1046	951	951	Alice	40	" I hope they 'll remember her saucer of milk at tea - time . Dinah my dear ! I wish you were down here with me ! There are no mice in the air , I 'm afraid , but you might catch a bat , and that 's very like a mouse , you know . But do cats eat bats , I wonder ? "
1070	1081	1061	1061	herself	40	" Do cats eat bats ? Do cats eat bats ? "
1085	1091	1061	1061	herself	40	" Do bats eat cats ? "
1147	1164	1131	1131	she	40	" Now , Dinah , tell me the truth : did you ever eat a bat ? "
1272	1285	1286	1286	She	40	" Oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! "
1585	1595	1597	1598	poor Alice	40	" and even if my head would go through , "
1600	1638	1597	1598	poor Alice	40	" it would be of very little use without my shoulders . Oh , how I wish I could shut up like a telescope ! I think I could , if I only knew how to begin . "
1730	1738	1740	1740	Alice	40	" which certainly was not here before , "
1758	1762	1740	1740	Alice	40	" DRINK ME , "
1778	1782	1784	1787	the wise little Alice	105	" Drink me , "
1800	1808	1809	1809	she	40	" No , I 'll look first , "
1812	1826	1809	1809	she	40	" and see whether it 's marked ' _ poison _ ' or not "
1924	1927	1910	1910	she	40	" poison , "
1950	1953	1910	1910	she	40	" poison , "
2028	2034	2036	2036	Alice	40	" What a curious feeling ! "
2038	2048	2036	2036	Alice	40	" I must be shutting up like a telescope . "
2118	2127	2129	2129	Alice	40	" for it might end , you know , "
2133	2153	2129	2129	Alice	40	" in my going out altogether , like a candle . I wonder what I should be like then ? "
2301	2313	2315	2315	Alice	40	" Come , there 's no use in crying like that ! "
2322	2332	2315	2315	Alice	40	" I advise you to leave off this minute ! "
2404	2412	2414	2415	poor Alice	40	" But it 's no use now , "
2417	2442	2414	2415	poor Alice	40	" to pretend to be two people ! Why , there 's hardly enough of me left to make _ one _ respectable person ! "
2476	2479	2459	2459	she	40	" EAT ME "
2486	2494	2496	2496	Alice	40	" Well , I 'll eat it , "
2498	2546	2496	2496	Alice	40	" and if it makes me grow larger , I can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller , I can creep under the door ; so either way I 'll get into the garden , and I do n't care which happens ! "
2559	2566	2547	2547	She	40	" Which way ? Which way ? "
2693	2698	2700	2700	Alice	40	" Curiouser and curiouser ! "
2722	2742	2700	2700	Alice	40	" now I 'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was ! Good - bye , feet ! "
2770	2835	2837	2837	Alice	40	" Oh , my poor little feet , I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now , dears ? I 'm sure _ I _ sha n't be able ! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you : you must manage the best way you can;--but I must be kind to them , "
2839	2869	2837	2837	Alice	40	" or perhaps they wo n't walk the way I want to go ! Let me see : I 'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas . "
2883	2891	2892	2892	she	40	" They must go by the carrier , "
2895	2918	2892	2892	she	40	" and how funny it 'll seem , sending presents to one 's own feet ! And how odd the directions will look !
2953	2953	2949	2949	I	0	"
3042	3051	3053	3053	Alice	40	" You ought to be ashamed of yourself , "
3055	3062	3053	3053	Alice	40	" a great girl like you , "
3071	3088	3090	3090	she	40	" to go on crying in this way ! Stop this moment , I tell you ! "
3193	3216	3177	3177	he	119	" Oh ! the Duchess , the Duchess ! Oh ! wo n't she be savage if I 've kept her waiting ! "
3251	3257	3241	3241	she	40	" If you please , sir-- "
3314	3403	3302	3302	she	40	" Dear , dear ! How queer everything is to - day ! And yesterday things went on just as usual . I wonder if I 've been changed in the night ? Let me think : was I the same when I got up this morning ? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different . But if I 'm not the same , the next question is , Who in the world am I ? Ah , _ that 's _ the great puzzle ! "
3436	3445	3446	3446	she	40	" I 'm sure I 'm not Ada , "
3449	3640	3446	3446	she	40	" for her hair goes in such long ringlets , and mine does n't go in ringlets at all ; and I 'm sure I ca n't be Mabel , for I know all sorts of things , and she , oh ! she knows such a very little ! Besides , _ she 's _ she , and _ I 'm _ I , and -- oh dear , how puzzling it all is ! I 'll try if I know all the things I used to know . Let me see : four times five is twelve , and four times six is thirteen , and four times seven is -- oh dear ! I shall never get to twenty at that rate ! However , the Multiplication Table does n't signify : let 's try Geography . London is the capital of Paris , and Paris is the capital of Rome , and Rome -- no , _ that 's _ all wrong , I 'm certain ! I must have been changed for Mabel ! I 'll try and say ' _ How doth the little_-- ' "
3683	3706	3663	3663	her	124	" How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail , And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale ! "
3707	3731	3756	3756	she	40	" How cheerfully he seems to grin , How neatly spread his claws , And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws ! "
3732	3743	3745	3746	poor Alice	40	" I 'm sure those are not the right words , "
3760	3894	3896	3896	Alice	40	" I must be Mabel after all , and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house , and have next to no toys to play with , and oh ! ever so many lessons to learn ! No , I 've made up my mind about it ; if I 'm Mabel , I 'll stay down here ! It 'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ' Come up again , dear ! ' I shall only look up and say ' Who am I then ? Tell me that first , and then , if I like being that person , I 'll come up : if not , I 'll stay down here till I 'm somebody else'--but , oh dear ! "
3905	3931	3896	3896	Alice	40	" I do wish they _ would _ put their heads down ! I am so _ very _ tired of being all alone here ! "
3967	3977	3978	3978	she	40	" How _ can _ I have done that ? "
3981	3989	3978	3978	she	40	" I must be growing small again . "
4061	4070	4072	4072	Alice	40	" That _ was _ a narrow escape ! "
4093	4100	4102	4102	she	40	" and now for the garden ! "
4138	4146	4148	4150	the poor child	125	" and things are worse than ever , "
4152	4177	4148	4150	the poor child	125	" for I never was so small as this before , never ! And I declare it 's too bad , that it is ! "
4217	4229	4230	4230	she	40	" and in that case I can go back by railway , "
4325	4335	4337	4337	Alice	40	" I wish I had n't cried so much ! "
4351	4393	4337	4337	Alice	40	" I shall be punished for it now , I suppose , by being drowned in my own tears ! That _ will _ be a queer thing , to be sure ! However , everything is queer to - day . "
4460	4470	4472	4472	Alice	40	" Would it be of any use , now , "
4474	4515	4517	4517	she	40	" to speak to this mouse ? Everything is so out - of - the - way down here , that I should think very likely it can talk : at any rate , there 's no harm in trying . "
4520	4546	4517	4517	she	40	" O Mouse , do you know the way out of this pool ? I am very tired of swimming about here , O Mouse ! "
4583	4601	4572	4572	she	40	" A mouse -- of a mouse -- to a mouse -- a mouse -- O mouse ! "
4629	4637	4639	4639	Alice	40	" Perhaps it does n't understand English , "
4641	4657	4639	4639	Alice	40	" I daresay it 's a French mouse , come over with William the Conqueror . "
4687	4694	4683	4683	she	40	" O ? est ma chatte ? "
4727	4735	4737	4737	Alice	40	" Oh , I beg your pardon ! "
4751	4761	4737	4737	Alice	40	" I quite forgot you did n't like cats . "
4762	4767	4769	4770	the Mouse	26	" Not like cats ! "
4779	4791	4769	4770	the Mouse	26	" Would _ you _ like cats if you were me ? "
4792	4798	4800	4800	Alice	40	" Well , perhaps not , "
4806	4850	4800	4800	Alice	40	" do n't be angry about it . And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah : I think you 'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her . She is such a dear quiet thing , "
4868	4916	4918	4918	Alice	40	" and she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her face -- and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse -- and she 's such a capital one for catching mice -- oh , I beg your pardon ! "
4941	4956	4932	4932	she	40	" We wo n't talk about her any more if you 'd rather not . "
4957	4961	4963	4964	the Mouse	139	" We indeed ! "
4977	5014	4963	4964	the Mouse	139	" As if _ I _ would talk on such a subject ! Our family always _ hated _ cats : nasty , low , vulgar things ! Do n't let me hear the name again ! "
5015	5021	5023	5023	Alice	40	" I wo n't indeed ! "
5036	5049	5050	5051	The Mouse	26	" Are you -- are you fond -- of -- of dogs ? "
5062	5171	5173	5173	Alice	40	" There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you ! A little bright - eyed terrier , you know , with oh , such long curly brown hair ! And it 'll fetch things when you throw them , and it 'll sit up and beg for its dinner , and all sorts of things -- I ca n't remember half of them -- and it belongs to a farmer , you know , and he says it 's so useful , it 's worth a hundred pounds ! He says it kills all the rats and -- oh dear ! "
5179	5189	5173	5173	Alice	40	" I 'm afraid I 've offended it again ! "
5224	5251	5218	5218	she	40	" Mouse dear ! Do come back again , and we wo n't talk about cats or dogs either , if you do n't like them ! "
5290	5320	5218	5218	she	40	" Let us get to the shore , and then I 'll tell you my history , and you 'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs . "
5503	5515	5482	5482	she	40	" I am older than you , and must know better ; "
5568	5591	5592	5592	They	145	" Sit down , all of you , and listen to me ! _ I 'll _ soon make you dry enough ! "
5639	5642	5644	5645	the Mouse	26	" Ahem ! "
5651	5721	5644	5645	the Mouse	26	" are you all ready ? This is the driest thing I know . Silence all round , if you please ! ' William the Conqueror , whose cause was favoured by the pope , was soon submitted to by the English , who wanted leaders , and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest . Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria-- ' "
5722	5725	5727	5728	the Lory	28	" Ugh ! "
5734	5740	5742	5743	the Mouse	26	" I beg your pardon ! "
5751	5756	5742	5743	the Mouse	26	" Did you speak ? "
5757	5761	5763	5764	the Lory	28	" Not I ! "
5767	5773	5775	5776	the Mouse	26	" I thought you did , "
5778	5812	5775	5776	the Mouse	26	" --I proceed . ' Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria , declared for him : and even Stigand , the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury , found it advisable-- ' "
5813	5819	5821	5822	the Duck	30	" Found _ what _ ? "
5824	5830	5831	5832	the Mouse	26	" Found _ it _ , "
5837	5848	5831	5832	the Mouse	26	" of course you know what ' it ' means . "
5849	5868	5870	5871	the Duck	30	" I know what ' it ' means well enough , when _ I _ find a thing , "
5873	5893	5870	5871	the Duck	30	" it 's generally a frog or a worm . The question is , what did the archbishop find ? "
5907	5951	5894	5895	The Mouse	26	" ' --found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown . William 's conduct at first was moderate . But the insolence of his Normans-- ' How are you getting on now , my dear ? "
5962	5968	5970	5970	Alice	40	" As wet as ever , "
5976	5987	5970	5970	Alice	40	" it does n't seem to dry me at all . "
5988	5993	5995	5996	the Dodo	32	" In that case , "
6004	6020	5995	5996	the Dodo	32	" I move that the meeting adjourn , for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies-- "
6021	6025	6027	6028	the Eaglet	33	" Speak English ! "
6030	6057	6027	6028	the Eaglet	33	" I do n't know the meaning of half those long words , and , what 's more , I do n't believe you do either ! "
6078	6086	6088	6089	the Dodo	32	" What I was going to say , "
6095	6113	6088	6089	the Dodo	32	" was , that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus - race . "
6114	6124	6126	6126	Alice	40	" What _ is _ a Caucus - race ? "
6163	6166	6168	6169	the Dodo	32	" Why , "
6171	6183	6168	6169	the Dodo	32	" the best way to explain it is to do it . "
6228	6236	6243	6245	all the party	156	" the exact shape does n't matter , "
6259	6269	6243	6245	all the party	156	" One , two , three , and away , "
6323	6329	6318	6319	the Dodo	32	" The race is over ! "
6342	6348	6331	6331	they	156	" But who has won ? "
6407	6420	6403	6404	the Dodo	32	" _ Everybody _ has won , and all must have prizes . "
6421	6430	6403	6404	the Dodo	32	" But who is to give the prizes ? "
6438	6448	6450	6451	the Dodo	32	" Why , _ she _ , of course , "
6477	6482	6461	6463	the whole party	145	" Prizes ! Prizes ! "
6540	6552	6554	6555	the Mouse	26	" But she must have a prize herself , you know , "
6557	6561	6562	6563	the Dodo	32	" Of course , "
6568	6578	6579	6579	he	159	" What else have you got in your pocket ? "
6587	6592	6594	6594	Alice	40	" Only a thimble , "
6597	6603	6605	6606	the Dodo	32	" Hand it over here , "
6626	6636	6618	6619	the Dodo	32	" We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble ; "
6770	6782	6784	6784	Alice	40	" You promised to tell me your history , you know , "
6786	6798	6799	6799	she	40	" and why it is you hate -- C and D , "
6814	6824	6826	6827	the Mouse	26	" Mine is a long and a sad tale ! "
6836	6847	6849	6849	Alice	40	" It _ is _ a long tail , certainly , "
6861	6870	6849	6849	Alice	40	" but why do you call it sad ? "
6895	7008	6849	6849	Alice	40	" Fury said to a mouse , That he met in the house , ' Let us both go to law : _ I _ will prosecute _ you_.--Come , I 'll take no denial ; We must have a trial : For really this morning I 've nothing to do . ' Said the mouse to the cur , ' Such a trial , dear sir , With no jury or judge , would be wasting our breath . ' ' I 'll be judge , I 'll be jury , ' Said cunning old Fury : ' I 'll try the whole cause , and condemn you to death . ' "
7009	7015	7017	7018	the Mouse	26	" You are not attending ! "
7023	7030	7017	7018	the Mouse	26	" What are you thinking of ? "
7031	7037	7039	7039	Alice	40	" I beg your pardon , "
7043	7055	7039	7039	Alice	40	" you had got to the fifth bend , I think ? "
7056	7063	7065	7066	the Mouse	26	" I had _ not ! _ "
7073	7077	7079	7079	Alice	40	" A knot ! "
7094	7105	7079	7079	Alice	40	" Oh , do let me help to undo it ! "
7106	7115	7117	7118	the Mouse	26	" I shall do nothing of the sort , "
7126	7135	7117	7118	the Mouse	26	" You insult me by talking such nonsense ! "
7136	7143	7146	7146	Alice	40	" I did n't mean it ! "
7148	7159	7146	7146	Alice	40	" But you 're so easily offended , you know ! "
7167	7176	7177	7177	Alice	162	" Please come back and finish your story ! "
7190	7196	7183	7184	the others	163	" Yes , please do ! "
7212	7221	7223	7224	the Lory	151	" What a pity it would n't stay ! "
7248	7269	7237	7239	an old Crab	165	" Ah , my dear ! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose _ your _ temper ! "
7270	7277	7279	7281	the young Crab	167	" Hold your tongue , Ma ! "
7287	7299	7279	7281	the young Crab	167	" You 're enough to try the patience of an oyster ! "
7300	7314	7316	7316	Alice	40	" I wish I had our Dinah here , I know I do ! "
7324	7332	7316	7316	Alice	40	" She 'd soon fetch it back ! "
7333	7348	7350	7351	the Lory	28	" And who is Dinah , if I might venture to ask the question ? "
7368	7417	7358	7358	she	40	" Dinah 's our cat . And she 's such a capital one for catching mice you ca n't think ! And oh , I wish you could see her after the birds ! Why , she 'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it ! "
7449	7467	7437	7439	one old Magpie	171	" I really must be getting home ; the night - air does n't suit my throat ! "
7481	7498	7437	7439	one old Magpie	171	" Come away , my dears ! It 's high time you were all in bed ! "
7514	7523	7524	7524	she	40	" I wish I had n't mentioned Dinah ! "
7533	7573	7524	7524	she	40	" Nobody seems to like her , down here , and I 'm sure she 's the best cat in the world ! Oh , my dear Dinah ! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more ! "
7680	7723	7724	7724	Alice	40	" The Duchess ! The Duchess ! Oh my dear paws ! Oh my fur and whiskers ! She 'll get me executed , as sure as ferrets are ferrets ! Where _ can _ I have dropped them , I wonder ? "
7817	7852	7802	7802	she	40	" Why , Mary Ann , what _ are _ you doing out here ? Run home this moment , and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan ! Quick , now ! "
7882	7890	7891	7891	she	40	" He took me for his housemaid , "
7899	7933	7935	7935	she	40	" How surprised he 'll be when he finds out who I am ! But I 'd better take him his fan and gloves -- that is , if I can find them . "
7960	7964	7935	7935	she	40	" W. RABBIT , "
8007	8013	8014	8014	Alice	40	" How queer it seems , "
8019	8038	8014	8014	Alice	40	" to be going messages for a rabbit ! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next ! "
8051	8097	8098	8098	Alice	40	" ' Miss Alice ! Come here directly , and get ready for your walk ! ' ' Coming in a minute , nurse ! But I 've got to see that the mouse does n't get out . ' Only I do n't think , "
8102	8121	8098	8098	Alice	40	" that they 'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that ! "
8210	8214	8217	8217	she	40	" DRINK ME , "
8227	8239	8240	8240	she	40	" I know _ something _ interesting is sure to happen , "
8245	8288	8240	8240	she	40	" whenever I eat or drink anything ; so I 'll just see what this bottle does . I do hope it 'll make me grow large again , for really I 'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing ! "
8341	8380	8340	8340	herself	40	" That 's quite enough -- I hope I sha n't grow any more -- As it is , I ca n't get out at the door -- I do wish I had n't drunk quite so much ! "
8478	8497	8458	8458	she	40	" Now I can do no more , whatever happens . What _ will _ become of me ? "
8552	8560	8563	8563	Alice	40	" It was much pleasanter at home , "
8565	8690	8691	8691	she	40	" when one was n't always growing larger and smaller , and being ordered about by mice and rabbits . I almost wish I had n't gone down that rabbit - hole -- and yet -- and yet -- it 's rather curious , you know , this sort of life ! I do wonder what _ can _ have happened to me ! When I used to read fairy - tales , I fancied that kind of thing never happened , and now here I am in the middle of one ! There ought to be a book written about me , that there ought ! And when I grow up , I 'll write one -- but I 'm grown up now , "
8698	8714	8691	8691	she	40	" at least there 's no room to grow up any more _ here _ . "
8715	8719	8721	8721	Alice	40	" But then , "
8723	8773	8721	8721	Alice	40	" shall I _ never _ get any older than I am now ? That 'll be a comfort , one way -- never to be an old woman -- but then -- always to have lessons to learn ! Oh , I should n't like _ that ! _ "
8774	8781	8782	8782	she	40	" Oh , you foolish Alice ! "
8786	8817	8782	8782	she	40	" How can you learn lessons in here ? Why , there 's hardly room for _ you _ , and no room at all for any lesson - books ! "
8858	8865	8867	8868	the voice	183	" Mary Ann ! Mary Ann ! "
8870	8878	8867	8868	the voice	183	" Fetch me my gloves this moment ! "
8982	8995	8981	8981	itself	184	" Then I 'll go round and get in at the window . "
8996	9004	9006	9006	Alice	40	" _ That _ you wo n't ! "
9095	9103	9066	9066	she	40	Rabbit's--"Pat ! Pat ! Where are you ? "
9114	9128	9066	9066	she	40	" Sure then I 'm here ! Digging for apples , yer honour ! "
9129	9136	9138	9139	the Rabbit	39	" Digging for apples , indeed ! "
9142	9155	9138	9139	the Rabbit	39	" Here ! Come and help me out of _ this ! _ "
9164	9178	9066	9066	she	40	" Now tell me , Pat , what 's that in the window ? "
9179	9190	9192	9192	He	39	" Sure , it 's an arm , yer honour ! "
9195	9198	9192	9192	He	39	" arrum . "
9200	9222	9066	9066	she	40	" An arm , you goose ! Who ever saw one that size ? Why , it fills the whole window ! "
9223	9241	9192	9192	He	39	" Sure , it does , yer honour : but it 's an arm for all that . "
9242	9262	9066	9066	she	40	" Well , it 's got no business there , at any rate : go and take it away ! "
9284	9302	9272	9272	Alice	40	" Sure , I do n't like it , yer honour , at all , at all ! "
9303	9313	9317	9317	she	40	" Do as I tell you , you coward ! "
9349	9361	9363	9363	Alice	40	" What a number of cucumber - frames there must be ! "
9365	9407	9363	9363	Alice	40	" I wonder what they 'll do next ! As for pulling me out of the window , I only wish they _ could ! _ I 'm sure _ I _ do n't want to stay in here any longer ! "
9445	9538	9439	9439	she	40	" Where 's the other ladder?--Why , I had n't to bring but one ; Bill 's got the other -- Bill ! fetch it here , lad!--Here , put 'em up at this corner -- No , tie 'em together first -- they do n't reach half high enough yet -- Oh ! they 'll do well enough ; do n't be particular -- Here , Bill ! catch hold of this rope -- Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate -- Oh , it 's coming down ! Heads below ! "
9542	9598	9439	9439	she	40	crash)--"Now , who did that?--It was Bill , I fancy -- Who 's to go down the chimney?--Nay , _ I _ sha n't ! _ You _ do it!--_That _ I wo n't , then!--Bill 's to go down -- Here , Bill ! the master says you 're to go down the chimney ! "
9599	9615	9617	9617	Alice	40	" Oh ! So Bill 's got to come down the chimney , has he ? "
9621	9665	9617	9617	Alice	40	" Shy , they seem to put everything upon Bill ! I would n't be in Bill 's place for a good deal : this fireplace is narrow , to be sure ; but I _ think _ I can kick a little ! "
9714	9719	9720	9720	she	40	" This is Bill , "
9745	9750	9753	9753	Rabbit	39	" There goes Bill ! "
9756	9764	9753	9753	Rabbit	39	along--"Catch him , you by the hedge ! "
9773	9803	9753	9753	Rabbit	39	voices--"Hold up his head -- Brandy now -- Don't choke him -- How was it , old fellow ? What happened to you ? Tell us all about it ! "
9814	9819	9821	9821	Alice	40	" That 's Bill , "
9824	9882	9753	9753	Rabbit	39	" Well , I hardly know -- No more , thank ye ; I 'm better now -- but I 'm a deal too flustered to tell you -- all I know is , something comes at me like a Jack - in - the - box , and up I goes like a sky - rocket ! "
9883	9891	9893	9894	the others	163	" So you did , old fellow ! "
9896	9904	9906	9907	the Rabbit	39	" We must burn the house down ! "
9921	9933	9912	9912	Alice	40	" If you do , I 'll set Dinah at you ! "
9947	9971	9942	9942	Alice	40	" I wonder what they _ will _ do next ! If they had any sense , they 'd take the roof off . "
9991	10001	9987	9988	the Rabbit	39	" A barrowful will do , to begin with . "
10002	10010	10012	10012	Alice	40	" A barrowful of _ what ? _ "
10048	10057	10058	10058	she	40	" I 'll put a stop to this , "
10067	10076	10058	10058	she	40	" You 'd better not do that again ! "
10113	10122	10123	10123	she	40	" If I eat one of these cakes , "
10126	10159	10123	10123	she	40	" it 's sure to make _ some _ change in my size ; and as it ca n't possibly make me larger , it must make me smaller , I suppose . "
10275	10285	10287	10287	Alice	40	" The first thing I 've got to do , "
10299	10332	10287	10287	Alice	40	" is to grow to my right size again ; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden . I think that will be the best plan . "
10420	10425	10427	10427	Alice	40	" Poor little thing ! "
10727	10738	10740	10740	Alice	40	" And yet what a dear little puppy it was ! "
10761	10835	10754	10754	herself	40	" I should have liked teaching it tricks very much , if -- if I 'd only been the right size to do it ! Oh dear ! I 'd nearly forgotten that I 've got to grow up again ! Let me see -- how _ is _ it to be managed ? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other ; but the great question is , what ? "
11032	11039	11041	11042	the Caterpillar	193	" Who are _ you ? _ "
11060	11102	11054	11054	Alice	40	" I -- I hardly know , sir , just at present -- at least I know who I _ was _ when I got up this morning , but I think I must have been changed several times since then . "
11103	11111	11113	11114	the Caterpillar	44	" What do you mean by that ? "
11117	11121	11113	11114	the Caterpillar	44	" Explain yourself ! "
11122	11137	11139	11139	Alice	40	" I ca n't explain _ myself _ , I 'm afraid , sir , "
11141	11151	11139	11139	Alice	40	" because I 'm not myself , you see . "
11152	11158	11160	11161	the Caterpillar	44	" I do n't see , "
11163	11175	11176	11176	Alice	40	" I 'm afraid I ca n't put it more clearly , "
11181	11206	11176	11176	Alice	40	" for I ca n't understand it myself to begin with ; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing . "
11207	11212	11214	11215	the Caterpillar	44	" It is n't , "
11217	11229	11231	11231	Alice	40	" Well , perhaps you have n't found it so yet , "
11233	11275	11231	11231	Alice	40	" but when you have to turn into a chrysalis -- you will some day , you know -- and then after that into a butterfly , I should think you 'll feel it a little queer , wo n't you ? "
11276	11281	11283	11284	the Caterpillar	44	" Not a bit , "
11286	11296	11298	11298	Alice	40	" Well , perhaps your feelings may be different , "
11300	11316	11298	11298	Alice	40	" all I know is , it would feel very queer to _ me _ . "
11317	11320	11322	11323	the Caterpillar	44	" You ! "
11326	11333	11322	11323	the Caterpillar	44	" Who are _ you ? _ "
11374	11391	11364	11364	she	40	" I think , you ought to tell me who _ you _ are , first . "
11392	11395	11397	11398	the Caterpillar	193	" Why ? "
11438	11442	11443	11444	the Caterpillar	193	" Come back ! "
11449	11457	11443	11444	the Caterpillar	193	" I 've something important to say ! "
11471	11476	11478	11479	the Caterpillar	193	" Keep your temper , "
11481	11486	11488	11488	Alice	40	" Is that all ? "
11500	11503	11505	11506	the Caterpillar	193	" No , "
11565	11576	11548	11548	it	193	" So you think you 're changed , do you ? "
11577	11586	11588	11588	Alice	40	" I 'm afraid I am , sir , "
11590	11613	11588	11588	Alice	40	" I ca n't remember things as I used -- and I do n't keep the same size for ten minutes together ! "
11614	11623	11625	11626	the Caterpillar	44	" Ca n't remember _ what _ things ? "
11628	11636	11639	11642	the little busy bee	201	" Well , I 've tried to say "
11644	11651	11652	11652	Alice	40	" but it all came different ! "
11660	11674	11676	11677	the Caterpillar	44	" Repeat , ' _ You are old , Father William _ , ' "
11686	11694	11695	11697	the young man	202	" You are old , Father William , "
11700	11729	11695	11697	the young man	202	" And your hair has become very white ; And yet you incessantly stand on your head-- Do you think , at your age , it is right ? "
11730	11735	11736	11737	Father William	45	" In my youth , "
11743	11773	11736	11737	Father William	45	" I feared it might injure the brain ; But , now that I 'm perfectly sure I have none , Why , I do it again and again . "
11774	11779	11781	11782	the youth	204	" You are old , "
11784	11817	11781	11782	the youth	204	" as I mentioned before , And have grown most uncommonly fat ; Yet you turned a back - somersault in at the door-- Pray , what is the reason of that ? "
11818	11823	11825	11826	the sage	205	" In my youth , "
11835	11862	11829	11829	he	205	" I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment -- one shilling the box-- Allow me to sell you a couple ? "
11863	11868	11870	11871	the youth	204	" You are old , "
11873	11908	11870	11871	the youth	204	" and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet ; Yet you finished the goose , with the bones and the beak-- Pray , how did you manage to do it ? "
11909	11914	11916	11917	his father	207	" In my youth , "
11919	11954	11916	11917	his father	207	" I took to the law , And argued each case with my wife ; And the muscular strength , which it gave to my jaw , Has lasted the rest of my life . "
11955	11960	11962	11963	the youth	204	" You are old , "
11965	11997	11962	11963	the youth	204	" one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever ; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose-- What made you so awfully clever ? "
11998	12010	12012	12013	his father	207	" I have answered three questions , and that is enough , "
12015	12045	12012	12013	his father	207	" do n't give yourself airs ! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff ? Be off , or I 'll kick you down stairs ! "
12046	12053	12055	12056	the Caterpillar	193	" That is not said right , "
12058	12069	12071	12071	Alice	40	" Not _ quite _ right , I 'm afraid , "
12075	12084	12071	12071	Alice	40	" some of the words have got altered . "
12085	12094	12096	12097	the Caterpillar	44	" It is wrong from beginning to end , "
12116	12125	12071	12071	Alice	40	" What size do you want to be ? "
12129	12140	12141	12141	Alice	40	" Oh , I 'm not particular as to size , "
12145	12158	12141	12141	Alice	40	" only one does n't like changing so often , you know . "
12159	12167	12169	12170	the Caterpillar	193	" I _ do n't _ know , "
12198	12204	12206	12207	the Caterpillar	193	" Are you content now ? "
12209	12231	12233	12233	Alice	40	" Well , I should like to be a _ little _ larger , sir , if you would n't mind , "
12235	12246	12233	12233	Alice	40	" three inches is such a wretched height to be . "
12247	12256	12258	12259	the Caterpillar	193	" It is a very good height indeed ! "
12277	12286	12289	12289	Alice	40	" But I 'm not used to it ! "
12301	12313	12296	12296	she	40	" I wish the creatures would n't be so easily offended ! "
12314	12324	12326	12327	the Caterpillar	44	" You 'll get used to it in time , "
12399	12418	12366	12366	its	193	" One side will make you grow taller , and the other side will make you grow shorter . "
12419	12435	12437	12437	Alice	40	" One side of _ what ? _ The other side of _ what ? _ "
12441	12446	12448	12449	the Caterpillar	44	" Of the mushroom , "
12537	12544	12545	12545	she	40	" And now which is which ? "
12686	12696	12698	12698	Alice	40	" Come , my head 's free at last ! "
12762	12773	12775	12775	Alice	40	" What _ can _ all that green stuff be ? "
12777	12804	12805	12805	She	40	" And where _ have _ my shoulders got to ? And oh , my poor hands , how is it I ca n't see you ? "
12949	12952	12954	12955	the Pigeon	46	" Serpent ! "
12957	12966	12968	12968	Alice	40	" I 'm _ not _ a serpent ! "
12971	12976	12968	12968	Alice	40	" Let me alone ! "
12977	12984	12986	12987	the Pigeon	215	" Serpent , I say again ! "
13004	13018	12986	12987	the Pigeon	215	" I 've tried every way , and nothing seems to suit them ! "
13019	13032	13034	13034	Alice	40	" I have n't the least idea what you 're talking about , "
13036	13057	13058	13059	the Pigeon	215	" I 've tried the roots of trees , and I 've tried banks , and I 've tried hedges , "
13068	13079	13058	13059	the Pigeon	215	" but those serpents ! There 's no pleasing them ! "
13104	13116	13118	13119	the Pigeon	215	" As if it was n't trouble enough hatching the eggs , "
13121	13151	13118	13119	the Pigeon	215	" but I must be on the look - out for serpents night and day ! Why , I have n't had a wink of sleep these three weeks ! "
13152	13162	13164	13164	Alice	40	" I 'm very sorry you 've been annoyed , "
13174	13188	13190	13191	the Pigeon	46	" And just as I 'd taken the highest tree in the wood , "
13200	13230	13190	13191	the Pigeon	46	" and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last , they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ! Ugh , Serpent ! "
13231	13245	13247	13247	Alice	40	" But I 'm _ not _ a serpent , I tell you ! "
13249	13256	13247	13247	Alice	40	" I 'm a -- I'm a-- "
13257	13266	13268	13269	the Pigeon	215	" Well ! _ What _ are you ? "
13271	13282	13268	13269	the Pigeon	215	" I can see you 're trying to invent something ! "
13283	13291	13293	13293	Alice	40	" I -- I'm a little girl , "
13312	13318	13320	13321	the Pigeon	215	" A likely story indeed ! "
13330	13387	13320	13321	the Pigeon	215	" I 've seen a good many little girls in my time , but never _ one _ with such a neck as that ! No , no ! You 're a serpent ; and there 's no use denying it . I suppose you 'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg ! "
13388	13398	13400	13400	Alice	40	" I _ have _ tasted eggs , certainly , "
13409	13425	13400	13400	Alice	40	" but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do , you know . "
13426	13433	13435	13436	the Pigeon	46	" I do n't believe it , "
13438	13460	13435	13436	the Pigeon	46	" but if they do , why then they 're a kind of serpent , that 's all I can say . "
13490	13522	13483	13484	the Pigeon	215	" You 're looking for eggs , I know _ that _ well enough ; and what does it matter to me whether you 're a little girl or a serpent ? "
13523	13534	13536	13536	Alice	40	" It matters a good deal to _ me _ , "
13539	13572	13536	13536	Alice	40	" but I 'm not looking for eggs , as it happens ; and if I was , I should n't want _ yours _ : I do n't like them raw . "
13573	13581	13583	13584	the Pigeon	46	" Well , be off , then ! "
13732	13802	13804	13804	she	40	" Come , there 's half my plan done now ! How puzzling all these changes are ! I 'm never sure what I 'm going to be , from one minute to another ! However , I 've got back to my right size : the next thing is , to get into that beautiful garden -- how _ is _ that to be done , I wonder ? "
13827	13832	13834	13834	Alice	40	" Whoever lives there , "
13836	13861	13863	13863	she	40	" it 'll never do to come upon them _ this _ size : why , I should frighten them out of their wits ! "
14064	14078	14050	14050	he	231	" For the Duchess . An invitation from the Queen to play croquet . "
14101	14115	14079	14082	The Frog - Footman	232	" From the Queen . An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet . "
14195	14205	14207	14208	the Footman	235	" There 's no sort of use in knocking , "
14210	14251	14207	14208	the Footman	235	" and that for two reasons . First , because I 'm on the same side of the door as you are ; secondly , because they 're making such a noise inside , no one could possibly hear you . "
14293	14298	14300	14300	Alice	40	" Please , then , "
14302	14310	14300	14300	Alice	40	" how am I to get in ? "
14311	14321	14322	14323	the Footman	235	" There might be some sense in your knocking , "
14331	14364	14322	14323	the Footman	235	" if we had the door between us . For instance , if you were _ inside _ , you might knock , and I could let you out , you know . "
14386	14395	14396	14396	she	40	" But perhaps he ca n't help it , "
14401	14431	14432	14432	she	40	" his eyes are so _ very _ nearly at the top of his head . But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in ? "
14437	14443	14444	14445	the Footman	235	" I shall sit here , "
14448	14451	14444	14445	the Footman	235	" till tomorrow-- "
14495	14502	14503	14504	the Footman	235	" --or next day , maybe , "
14518	14526	14528	14528	Alice	40	" How am I to get in ? "
14536	14547	14549	14550	the Footman	235	" _ Are _ you to get in at all ? "
14552	14562	14549	14550	the Footman	235	" That 's the first question , you know . "
14579	14585	14586	14586	she	40	" It 's really dreadful , "
14591	14607	14586	14586	she	40	" the way all the creatures argue . It 's enough to drive one crazy ! "
14625	14631	14632	14632	he	235	" I shall sit here , "
14635	14645	14632	14632	he	235	" on and off , for days and days . "
14646	14656	14658	14658	Alice	40	" But what am _ I _ to do ? "
14660	14665	14667	14668	the Footman	235	" Anything you like , "
14674	14686	14688	14688	Alice	40	" Oh , there 's no use in talking to him , "
14691	14697	14688	14688	Alice	40	" he 's perfectly idiotic ! "
14766	14777	14778	14778	Alice	40	" There 's certainly too much pepper in that soup ! "
14858	14865	14867	14867	Alice	40	" Please would you tell me , "
14890	14898	14874	14874	she	40	" why your cat grins like that ? "
14899	14906	14908	14909	the Duchess	741	" It 's a Cheshire cat , "
14911	14919	14908	14909	the Duchess	741	" and that 's why . Pig ! "
14962	14987	14954	14954	she	40	" I did n't know that Cheshire cats always grinned ; in fact , I did n't know that cats _ could _ grin . "
14988	14993	14995	14996	the Duchess	37	" They all can , "
14998	15005	14995	14996	the Duchess	37	" and most of 'em do . "
15006	15016	15017	15017	Alice	40	" I do n't know of any that do , "
15032	15039	15041	15042	the Duchess	741	" You do n't know much , "
15044	15051	15041	15042	the Duchess	741	" and that 's a fact . "
15173	15185	15187	15187	Alice	40	" Oh , _ please _ mind what you 're doing ! "
15199	15210	15187	15187	Alice	40	" Oh , there goes his _ precious _ nose ! "
15228	15236	15237	15238	the Duchess	741	" If everybody minded their own business , "
15245	15258	15237	15238	the Duchess	741	" the world would go round a deal faster than it does . "
15259	15269	15271	15271	Alice	40	" Which would _ not _ be an advantage , "
15290	15320	15271	15271	Alice	40	" Just think of what work it would make with the day and night ! You see the earth takes twenty - four hours to turn round on its axis-- "
15321	15326	15328	15329	the Duchess	741	" Talking of axes , "
15331	15337	15328	15329	the Duchess	741	" chop off her head ! "
15378	15395	15373	15373	she	40	" Twenty - four hours , I _ think _ ; or is it twelve ? I-- "
15396	15406	15408	15409	the Duchess	37	" Oh , do n't bother _ me _ , "
15411	15418	15408	15409	the Duchess	37	" I never could abide figures ! "
15454	15482	15437	15437	she	37	" Speak roughly to your little boy , And beat him when he sneezes : He only does it to annoy , Because he knows it teases . "
15495	15502	15504	15505	the Duchess	741	" Wow ! wow ! wow ! "
15539	15565	15504	15505	the Duchess	741	" I speak severely to my boy , I beat him when he sneezes ; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases ! "
15568	15575	15504	15505	the Duchess	741	" Wow ! wow ! wow ! "
15576	15590	15591	15592	the Duchess	741	" Here ! you may nurse it a bit , if you like ! "
15606	15620	15591	15592	the Duchess	741	" I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen , "
15678	15686	15688	15688	Alice	40	" just like a star - fish , "
15798	15810	15812	15812	Alice	40	" If I do n't take this child away with me , "
15814	15837	15812	15812	Alice	40	" they 're sure to kill it in a day or two : would n't it be murder to leave it behind ? "
15864	15869	15871	15871	Alice	40	" Do n't grunt , "
15873	15886	15871	15871	Alice	40	" that 's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself . "
15960	15968	15969	15969	she	40	" But perhaps it was only sobbing , "
15994	16008	16010	16010	Alice	40	" If you 're going to turn into a pig , my dear , "
16014	16028	16010	16010	Alice	40	" I 'll have nothing more to do with you . Mind now ! "
16066	16083	16057	16057	Alice	40	" Now , what am I to do with this creature when I get it home ? "
16163	16170	16171	16171	she	40	" If it had grown up , "
16176	16197	16171	16171	she	40	" it would have made a dreadfully ugly child : but it makes rather a handsome pig , I think . "
16223	16234	16236	16236	she	40	" if one only knew the right way to change them-- "
16302	16306	16307	16307	she	40	" Cheshire Puss , "
16336	16345	16347	16347	Alice	40	" Come , it 's pleased so far , "
16354	16371	16350	16350	she	40	" Would you tell me , please , which way I ought to go from here ? "
16372	16386	16388	16389	the Cat	283	" That depends a good deal on where you want to get to , "
16391	16398	16400	16400	Alice	40	" I do n't much care where-- "
16402	16413	16415	16416	the Cat	51	" Then it does n't matter which way you go , "
16418	16428	16429	16429	Alice	40	" --so long as I get _ somewhere _ , "
16435	16445	16447	16448	the Cat	283	" Oh , you 're sure to do that , "
16450	16458	16447	16448	the Cat	283	" if you only walk long enough . "
16474	16483	16469	16469	she	40	" What sort of people live about here ? "
16484	16491	16492	16493	the Cat	283	" In _ that _ direction , "
16502	16514	16492	16493	the Cat	283	" lives a Hatter : and in _ that _ direction , "
16520	16536	16492	16493	the Cat	283	" lives a March Hare . Visit either you like : they 're both mad . "
16537	16549	16550	16550	Alice	40	" But I do n't want to go among mad people , "
16553	16562	16564	16565	the Cat	283	" Oh , you ca n't help that , "
16567	16582	16564	16565	the Cat	283	" we 're all mad here . I 'm mad . You 're mad . "
16583	16592	16594	16594	Alice	40	" How do you know I 'm mad ? "
16596	16601	16603	16604	the Cat	51	" You must be , "
16606	16615	16603	16604	the Cat	51	" or you would n't have come here . "
16631	16642	16628	16628	she	40	" And how do you know that you 're mad ? "
16643	16648	16650	16651	the Cat	51	" To begin with , "
16653	16664	16650	16651	the Cat	51	" a dog 's not mad . You grant that ? "
16665	16670	16672	16672	Alice	40	" I suppose so , "
16674	16679	16680	16681	the Cat	51	" Well , then , "
16685	16730	16680	16681	the Cat	51	" you see , a dog growls when it 's angry , and wags its tail when it 's pleased . Now _ I _ growl when I 'm pleased , and wag my tail when I 'm angry . Therefore I 'm mad . "
16731	16742	16744	16744	Alice	40	" _ I _ call it purring , not growling , "
16746	16753	16755	16756	the Cat	283	" Call it what you like , "
16758	16770	16755	16756	the Cat	283	" Do you play croquet with the Queen to - day ? "
16771	16779	16781	16781	Alice	40	" I should like it very much , "
16783	16792	16781	16781	Alice	40	" but I have n't been invited yet . "
16793	16800	16802	16803	the Cat	283	" You 'll see me there , "
16843	16856	16858	16859	the Cat	283	" By - the - bye , what became of the baby ? "
16861	16869	16858	16859	the Cat	283	" I 'd nearly forgotten to ask . "
16870	16877	16878	16878	Alice	40	" It turned into a pig , "
16894	16900	16902	16903	the Cat	283	" I thought it would , "
16949	16956	16957	16957	she	40	" I 've seen hatters before , "
16962	16997	16999	16999	she	40	" the March Hare will be much the most interesting , and perhaps as this is May it wo n't be raving mad -- at least not so mad as it was in March . "
17022	17031	17033	17034	the Cat	51	" Did you say pig , or fig ? "
17036	17041	17043	17043	Alice	40	" I said pig , "
17045	17065	17043	17043	Alice	40	" and I wish you would n't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly : you make one quite giddy . "
17066	17070	17072	17073	the Cat	51	" All right , "
17109	17122	17124	17124	Alice	40	" Well ! I 've often seen a cat without a grin , "
17126	17147	17124	17124	Alice	40	" but a grin without a cat ! It 's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life ! "
17241	17263	17230	17230	she	40	" Suppose it should be raving mad after all ! I almost wish I 'd gone to see the Hatter instead ! "
17333	17340	17342	17342	Alice	40	" Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse , "
17344	17359	17342	17342	Alice	40	" only , as it 's asleep , I suppose it does n't mind . "
17380	17387	17388	17388	they	301	" No room ! No room ! "
17397	17406	17408	17408	Alice	40	" There 's _ plenty _ of room ! "
17428	17433	17434	17436	the March Hare	53	" Have some wine , "
17459	17467	17468	17468	she	40	" I do n't see any wine , "
17471	17477	17479	17481	the March Hare	53	" There is n't any , "
17483	17496	17498	17498	Alice	40	" Then it was n't very civil of you to offer it , "
17501	17516	17518	17520	the March Hare	53	" It was n't very civil of you to sit down without being invited , "
17522	17534	17536	17536	Alice	40	" I did n't know it was _ your _ table , "
17538	17550	17536	17536	Alice	40	" it 's laid for a great many more than three . "
17551	17557	17559	17560	the Hatter	54	" Your hair wants cutting , "
17582	17592	17593	17593	Alice	40	" You should learn not to make personal remarks , "
17599	17605	17593	17593	Alice	40	" it 's very rude . "
17625	17636	17619	17619	he	54	" Why is a raven like a writing - desk ? "
17637	17647	17649	17649	Alice	40	" Come , we shall have some fun now ! "
17651	17666	17667	17667	she	40	" I 'm glad they 've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that , "
17671	17687	17689	17691	the March Hare	53	" Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it ? "
17693	17697	17699	17699	Alice	40	" Exactly so , "
17701	17710	17711	17713	the March Hare	291	" Then you should say what you mean , "
17717	17721	17722	17722	Alice	40	" I do , "
17726	17747	17722	17722	Alice	40	" at least -- at least I mean what I say -- that 's the same thing , you know . "
17748	17756	17758	17759	the Hatter	54	" Not the same thing a bit ! "
17761	17789	17758	17759	the Hatter	54	" You might just as well say that ' I see what I eat ' is the same thing as ' I eat what I see ' ! "
17790	17798	17800	17802	the March Hare	53	" You might just as well say , "
17804	17826	17800	17802	the March Hare	53	" that ' I like what I get ' is the same thing as ' I get what I like ' ! "
17827	17835	17837	17838	the Dormouse	55	" You might just as well say , "
17849	17871	17837	17838	the Dormouse	55	" that ' I breathe when I sleep ' is the same thing as ' I sleep when I breathe ' ! "
17872	17883	17885	17886	the Hatter	54	" It _ is _ the same thing with you , "
17933	17942	17943	17943	he	54	" What day of the month is it ? "
17989	17993	17981	17981	Alice	40	" The fourth . "
17994	17999	18001	18002	the Hatter	54	" Two days wrong ! "
18004	18015	18016	18016	he	54	" I told you butter would n't suit the works ! "
18025	18034	18035	18037	the March Hare	291	" It was the _ best _ butter , "
18041	18054	18055	18056	the Hatter	876	" Yes , but some crumbs must have got in as well , "
18059	18073	18055	18056	the Hatter	876	" you should n't have put it in with the bread - knife . "
18116	18128	18103	18103	he	53	" It was the _ best _ butter , you know . "
18140	18146	18147	18147	she	40	" What a funny watch ! "
18150	18168	18147	18147	she	40	" It tells the day of the month , and does n't tell what o'clock it is ! "
18169	18174	18176	18177	the Hatter	876	" Why should it ? "
18179	18192	18176	18177	the Hatter	876	" Does _ your _ watch tell you what year it is ? "
18193	18198	18199	18199	Alice	40	" Of course not , "
18204	18221	18199	18199	Alice	40	" but that 's because it stays the same year for such a long time together . "
18222	18233	18235	18236	the Hatter	876	" Which is just the case with _ mine _ , "
18264	18272	18273	18273	she	40	" I do n't quite understand you , "
18282	18289	18291	18292	the Hatter	54	" The Dormouse is asleep again , "
18320	18336	18305	18306	The Dormouse	55	" Of course , of course ; just what I was going to remark myself . "
18337	18345	18346	18347	the Hatter	876	" Have you guessed the riddle yet ? "
18355	18363	18364	18364	Alice	40	" No , I give it up , "
18367	18373	18364	18364	Alice	40	" what 's the answer ? "
18374	18382	18384	18385	the Hatter	54	" I have n't the slightest idea , "
18387	18391	18393	18395	the March Hare	53	" Nor I , "
18401	18413	18414	18414	she	40	" I think you might do something better with the time , "
18417	18429	18414	18414	she	40	" than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers . "
18430	18441	18443	18444	the Hatter	54	" If you knew Time as well as I do , "
18446	18463	18443	18444	the Hatter	54	" you would n't talk about wasting _ it _ . It 's _ him _ . "
18464	18473	18475	18475	Alice	40	" I do n't know what you mean , "
18477	18484	18485	18486	the Hatter	876	" Of course you do n't ! "
18494	18505	18490	18490	his	876	" I dare say you never even spoke to Time ! "
18506	18510	18511	18511	Alice	40	" Perhaps not , "
18515	18529	18511	18511	Alice	40	" but I know I have to beat time when I learn music . "
18530	18538	18540	18541	the Hatter	54	" Ah ! that accounts for it , "
18543	18620	18540	18541	the Hatter	54	" He wo n't stand beating . Now , if you only kept on good terms with him , he 'd do almost anything you liked with the clock . For instance , suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning , just time to begin lessons : you 'd only have to whisper a hint to Time , and round goes the clock in a twinkling ! Half - past one , time for dinner ! "
18622	18629	18630	18632	the March Hare	291	" I only wish it was , "
18641	18649	18651	18651	Alice	40	" That would be grand , certainly , "
18654	18669	18651	18651	Alice	40	" but then -- I should n't be hungry for it , you know . "
18670	18677	18679	18680	the Hatter	54	" Not at first , perhaps , "
18682	18699	18679	18680	the Hatter	54	" but you could keep it to half - past one as long as you liked . "
18700	18710	18711	18711	Alice	40	" Is that the way _ you _ manage ? "
18721	18725	18726	18726	he	54	" Not I ! "
18729	18745	18749	18749	his	54	" We quarrelled last March -- just before _ he _ went mad , you know-- "
18758	18776	18749	18749	his	54	" --it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts , and I had to sing
18801	18801	18794	18794	You	291	"
18802	18810	18812	18812	Alice	40	" I 've heard something like it , "
18814	18822	18823	18824	the Hatter	876	" It goes on , you know , "
18827	18830	18823	18824	the Hatter	876	" in this way:--
18852	18852	18794	18794	You	291	"
18865	18874	18854	18855	the Dormouse	55	" _ Twinkle , twinkle , twinkle , twinkle_-- "
18891	18902	18904	18905	the Hatter	54	" Well , I 'd hardly finished the first verse , "
18907	18930	18904	18905	the Hatter	54	" when the Queen jumped up and bawled out , ' He 's murdering the time ! Off with his head ! ' "
18931	18936	18938	18938	Alice	40	" How dreadfully savage ! "
18940	18946	18947	18948	the Hatter	876	" And ever since that , "
18956	18973	18947	18948	the Hatter	876	" he wo n't do a thing I ask ! It 's always six o'clock now . "
18983	18998	18999	18999	she	40	" Is that the reason so many tea - things are put out here ? "
19002	19009	19011	19012	the Hatter	54	" Yes , that 's it , "
19017	19037	19011	19012	the Hatter	54	" it 's always tea - time , and we 've no time to wash the things between whiles . "
19038	19048	19050	19050	Alice	40	" Then you keep moving round , I suppose ? "
19052	19056	19058	19059	the Hatter	54	" Exactly so , "
19061	19069	19058	19059	the Hatter	54	" as the things get used up . "
19070	19082	19083	19083	Alice	40	" But what happens when you come to the beginning again ? "
19088	19095	19096	19098	the March Hare	53	" Suppose we change the subject , "
19103	19121	19096	19098	the March Hare	53	" I 'm getting tired of this . I vote the young lady tells us a story . "
19122	19132	19134	19134	Alice	40	" I 'm afraid I do n't know one , "
19142	19148	19149	19149	they	318	" Then the Dormouse shall ! "
19153	19159	19161	19161	they	318	" Wake up , Dormouse ! "
19177	19183	19184	19184	he	319	" I was n't asleep , "
19193	19203	19184	19184	he	319	" I heard every word you fellows were saying . "
19204	19210	19212	19214	the March Hare	53	" Tell us a story ! "
19216	19222	19224	19224	Alice	40	" Yes , please do ! "
19226	19233	19235	19236	the Hatter	54	" And be quick about it , "
19238	19250	19235	19236	the Hatter	54	" or you 'll be asleep again before it 's done . "
19251	19262	19263	19264	the Dormouse	55	" Once upon a time there were three little sisters , "
19271	19292	19263	19264	the Dormouse	55	" and their names were Elsie , Lacie , and Tillie ; and they lived at the bottom of a well-- "
19293	19300	19302	19302	Alice	40	" What did they live on ? "
19317	19323	19325	19326	the Dormouse	885	" They lived on treacle , "
19335	19346	19347	19347	Alice	40	" They could n't have done that , you know , "
19351	19358	19347	19347	Alice	40	" they 'd have been ill . "
19359	19364	19366	19367	the Dormouse	55	" So they were , "
19369	19375	19366	19367	the Dormouse	55	" _ very _ ill . "
19405	19418	19401	19401	she	40	" But why did they live at the bottom of a well ? "
19419	19425	19426	19428	the March Hare	291	" Take some more tea , "
19436	19443	19444	19444	Alice	40	" I 've had nothing yet , "
19451	19459	19444	19444	Alice	40	" so I ca n't take more . "
19460	19471	19473	19474	the Hatter	54	" You mean you ca n't take _ less _ , "
19476	19489	19473	19474	the Hatter	54	" it 's very easy to take _ more _ than nothing . "
19490	19498	19500	19500	Alice	40	" Nobody asked _ your _ opinion , "
19502	19510	19511	19512	the Hatter	54	" Who 's making personal remarks now ? "
19553	19565	19528	19528	she	40	" Why did they live at the bottom of a well ? "
19583	19591	19566	19567	The Dormouse	55	" It was a treacle - well . "
19592	19599	19600	19600	Alice	40	" There 's no such thing ! "
19614	19619	19621	19622	the Dormouse	885	" Sh ! sh ! "
19626	19643	19621	19622	the Dormouse	885	" If you ca n't be civil , you 'd better finish the story for yourself . "
19644	19651	19652	19652	Alice	40	" No , please go on ! "
19657	19674	19652	19652	Alice	40	" I wo n't interrupt again . I dare say there may be _ one _ . "
19675	19680	19682	19683	the Dormouse	55	" One , indeed ! "
19694	19710	19688	19688	he	885	" And so these three little sisters -- they were learning to draw , you know-- "
19711	19717	19719	19719	Alice	40	" What did they draw ? "
19726	19729	19731	19732	the Dormouse	55	" Treacle , "
19741	19748	19750	19751	the Hatter	876	" I want a clean cup , "
19753	19762	19750	19751	the Hatter	876	" let 's all move one place on . "
19854	19869	19849	19849	she	40	" But I do n't understand . Where did they draw the treacle from ? "
19870	19882	19884	19885	the Hatter	54	" You can draw water out of a water - well , "
19887	19907	19884	19885	the Hatter	54	" so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle - well -- eh , stupid ? "
19908	19918	19919	19919	Alice	40	" But they were _ in _ the well , "
19933	19939	19941	19942	the Dormouse	55	" Of course they were , "
19944	19948	19941	19942	the Dormouse	55	" --well in . "
19970	19977	19978	19979	the Dormouse	55	" They were learning to draw , "
19996	20011	19978	19979	the Dormouse	55	" and they drew all manner of things -- everything that begins with an M-- "
20012	20018	20020	20020	Alice	40	" Why with an M ? "
20022	20026	20028	20030	the March Hare	53	" Why not ? "
20076	20105	20040	20040	its	55	" --that begins with an M , such as mouse - traps , and the moon , and memory , and muchness -- you know you say things are "
20109	20123	20040	20040	its	55	muchness"--did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness ? "
20124	20132	20134	20134	Alice	40	" Really , now you ask me , "
20140	20145	20134	20134	Alice	40	" I do n't think-- "
20146	20153	20155	20156	the Hatter	54	" Then you should n't talk , "
20234	20247	20249	20249	Alice	40	" At any rate I 'll never go _ there _ again ! "
20259	20276	20249	20249	Alice	40	" It 's the stupidest tea - party I ever was at in all my life ! "
20298	20304	20305	20305	she	40	" That 's very curious ! "
20308	20326	20329	20329	she	40	" But everything 's curious today . I think I may as well go in at once . "
20350	20360	20361	20361	she	40	" Now , I 'll manage better this time , "
20519	20536	20516	20516	them	340	" Look out now , Five ! Do n't go splashing paint over me like that ! "
20537	20544	20546	20546	Five	342	" I could n't help it , "
20553	20559	20546	20546	Five	342	" Seven jogged my elbow . "
20568	20582	20562	20562	Seven	343	" That 's right , Five ! Always lay the blame on others ! "
20583	20592	20594	20594	Five	344	" _ You 'd _ better not talk ! "
20596	20610	20594	20594	Five	344	" I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded ! "
20611	20615	20617	20622	the one who had spoken first	345	" What for ? "
20624	20636	20638	20638	Seven	346	" That 's none of _ your _ business , Two ! "
20640	20650	20652	20652	Five	347	" Yes , it _ is _ his business ! "
20654	20674	20652	20652	Five	347	" and I 'll tell him -- it was for bringing the cook tulip - roots instead of onions . "
20685	20693	20715	20716	the others	163	" Well , of all the unjust things-- "
20728	20734	20736	20736	Alice	40	" Would you tell me , "
20742	20750	20736	20736	Alice	40	" why you are painting those roses ? "
20769	20843	20762	20762	Two	353	" Why the fact is , you see , Miss , this here ought to have been a _ red _ rose - tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the Queen was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know . So you see , Miss , we 're doing our best , afore she comes , to-- "
20860	20867	20869	20871	the three gardeners	355	" The Queen ! The Queen ! "
21098	21111	21113	21113	she	40	" and besides , what would be the use of a procession , "
21115	21135	21137	21137	she	40	" if people had all to lie down upon their faces , so that they could n't see it ? "
21168	21173	21164	21165	the Queen	843	" Who is this ? "
21191	21194	21196	21197	the Queen	843	" Idiot ! "
21214	21222	21210	21210	she	843	" What 's your name , child ? "
21223	21234	21236	21236	Alice	40	" My name is Alice , so please your Majesty , "
21247	21269	21241	21241	she	40	" Why , they 're only a pack of cards , after all . I need n't be afraid of them ! "
21270	21278	21280	21281	the Queen	843	" And who are _ these ? _ "
21348	21356	21358	21358	Alice	40	" How should _ I _ know ? "
21366	21376	21358	21358	Alice	40	" It 's no business of _ mine _ . "
21399	21406	21377	21378	The Queen	843	" Off with her head ! Off-- "
21407	21410	21412	21412	Alice	40	" Nonsense ! "
21437	21449	21428	21428	his	367	" Consider , my dear : she is only a child ! "
21463	21468	21450	21451	The Queen	843	" Turn them over ! "
21481	21485	21487	21488	the Queen	843	" Get up ! "
21523	21528	21530	21531	the Queen	843	" Leave off that ! "
21533	21539	21550	21550	she	843	" You make me giddy . "
21554	21564	21550	21550	she	843	" What _ have _ you been doing here ? "
21565	21572	21574	21574	Two	353	" May it please your Majesty , "
21591	21595	21574	21574	Two	353	" we were trying-- "
21596	21602	21604	21605	the Queen	843	" _ I _ see ! "
21615	21621	21623	21624	the procession	395	" Off with their heads ! "
21647	21654	21656	21656	Alice	40	" You sha n't be beheaded ! "
21696	21702	21704	21705	the Queen	843	" Are their heads off ? "
21707	21719	21720	21721	the soldiers	360	" Their heads are gone , if it please your Majesty ! "
21726	21731	21733	21734	the Queen	843	" That 's right ! "
21736	21742	21733	21734	the Queen	843	" Can you play croquet ? "
21762	21765	21767	21767	Alice	40	" Yes ! "
21769	21775	21777	21778	the Queen	843	" Come on , then ! "
21794	21804	21783	21784	the procession	395	" It's -- it 's a very fine day ! "
21829	21832	21834	21834	Alice	40	" Very , "
21836	21842	21834	21834	Alice	40	" --where 's the Duchess ? "
21843	21848	21850	21851	the Rabbit	184	" Hush ! Hush ! "
21886	21894	21877	21877	his	184	" She 's under sentence of execution . "
21895	21899	21901	21901	Alice	40	" What for ? "
21903	21914	21915	21916	the Rabbit	184	" Did you say ' What a pity ! ' ? "
21919	21926	21928	21928	Alice	40	" No , I did n't , "
21930	21949	21928	21928	Alice	40	" I do n't think it 's at all a pity . I said ' What for ? ' "
21950	21957	21958	21959	the Rabbit	184	" She boxed the Queen 's ears-- "
21970	21975	21962	21962	Alice	40	" Oh , hush ! "
21984	22003	21976	21977	the Rabbit	20	" The Queen will hear you ! You see , she came rather late , and the Queen said-- "
22004	22010	22012	22013	the Queen	843	" Get to your places ! "
22339	22345	22324	22325	the Queen	843	" Off with his head ! "
22347	22353	22324	22325	the Queen	843	" Off with her head ! "
22393	22397	22399	22399	she	40	" and then , "
22401	22430	22399	22399	she	40	" what would become of me ? They 're dreadfully fond of beheading people here ; the great wonder is , that there 's any one left alive ! "
22494	22510	22490	22490	she	40	" It 's the Cheshire Cat : now I shall have somebody to talk to . "
22511	22518	22520	22521	the Cat	51	" How are you getting on ? "
22547	22556	22557	22557	she	40	" It 's no use speaking to it , "
22560	22574	22557	22557	she	40	" till its ears have come , or at least one of them . "
22632	22643	22644	22644	Alice	40	" I do n't think they play at all fairly , "
22653	22752	22644	22644	Alice	40	" and they all quarrel so dreadfully one ca n't hear oneself speak -- and they do n't seem to have any rules in particular ; at least , if there are , nobody attends to them -- and you 've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive ; for instance , there 's the arch I 've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground -- and I should have croqueted the Queen 's hedgehog just now , only it ran away when it saw mine coming ! "
22753	22761	22763	22764	the Cat	51	" How do you like the Queen ? "
22770	22775	22777	22777	Alice	40	" Not at all , "
22779	22784	22777	22777	Alice	40	" she 's so extremely-- "
22804	22819	22800	22800	she	40	" --likely to win , that it 's hardly worth while finishing the game . "
22827	22836	22838	22839	the King	367	" Who _ are _ you talking to ? "
22857	22869	22871	22871	Alice	40	" It 's a friend of mine -- a Cheshire Cat , "
22873	22880	22871	22871	Alice	40	" allow me to introduce it . "
22881	22893	22895	22896	the King	367	" I do n't like the look of it at all , "
22898	22910	22895	22896	the King	367	" however , it may kiss my hand if it likes . "
22911	22917	22918	22919	the Cat	283	" I 'd rather not , "
22922	22928	22930	22931	the King	367	" Do n't be impertinent , "
22933	22943	22930	22931	the King	367	" and do n't look at me like that ! "
22952	22961	22963	22963	Alice	40	" A cat may look at a king , "
22965	22981	22963	22963	Alice	40	" I 've read that in some book , but I do n't remember where . "
22982	22990	22992	22993	the King	367	" Well , it must be removed , "
23010	23023	22998	22998	he	367	" My dear ! I wish you would have this cat removed ! "
23039	23045	23046	23046	she	843	" Off with his head ! "
23054	23062	23064	23065	the King	367	" I 'll fetch the executioner myself , "
23257	23265	23267	23267	Alice	40	" but it does n't matter much , "
23269	23283	23267	23267	Alice	40	" as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground . "
23552	23569	23543	23543	Alice	40	" It belongs to the Duchess : you 'd better ask _ her _ about it . "
23570	23576	23577	23578	the Queen	843	" She 's in prison , "
23584	23589	23577	23578	the Queen	843	" fetch her here . "
23665	23684	23686	23687	the Duchess	741	" You ca n't think how glad I am to see you again , you dear old thing ! "
23742	23751	23752	23752	she	741	" When _ I 'm _ a Duchess , "
23767	23800	23801	23801	she	741	" I wo n't have any pepper in my kitchen _ at all _ . Soup does very well without -- Maybe it 's always pepper that makes people hot - tempered , "
23818	23870	23801	23801	she	741	" and vinegar that makes them sour -- and camomile that makes them bitter -- and -- and barley - sugar and such things that make children sweet - tempered . I only wish people knew _ that _ : then they would n't be so stingy about it , you know-- "
23896	23937	23889	23889	her	741	" You 're thinking about something , my dear , and that makes you forget to talk . I ca n't tell you just now what the moral of that is , but I shall remember it in a bit . "
23938	23945	23946	23946	Alice	461	" Perhaps it has n't one , "
23951	23958	23960	23961	the Duchess	741	" Tut , tut , child ! "
23963	23977	23979	23979	she	741	" Everything 's got a moral , if only you can find it . "
24061	24071	24072	24072	she	40	" The game 's going on rather better now , "
24085	24090	24092	24093	the Duchess	741	" ' Tis so , "
24095	24119	24092	24093	the Duchess	741	" and the moral of that is--'Oh , ' tis love , ' tis love , that makes the world go round ! ' "
24120	24124	24125	24125	Alice	465	" Somebody said , "
24128	24140	24125	24125	Alice	465	" that it 's done by everybody minding their own business ! "
24141	24153	24155	24156	the Duchess	741	" Ah , well ! It means much the same thing , "
24171	24195	24168	24168	she	741	" and the moral of _ that _ is--'Take care of the sense , and the sounds will take care of themselves . ' "
24196	24207	24208	24208	Alice	40	" How fond she is of finding morals in things ! "
24213	24231	24232	24233	the Duchess	741	" I dare say you 're wondering why I do n't put my arm round your waist , "
24239	24261	24232	24233	the Duchess	741	" the reason is , that I 'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo . Shall I try the experiment ? "
24262	24267	24268	24268	Alice	40	" He might bite , "
24283	24287	24289	24290	the Duchess	741	" Very true , "
24292	24312	24289	24290	the Duchess	741	" flamingoes and mustard both bite . And the moral of that is--'Birds of a feather flock together . ' "
24313	24321	24322	24322	Alice	40	" Only mustard is n't a bird , "
24325	24331	24333	24334	the Duchess	741	" Right , as usual , "
24336	24347	24333	24334	the Duchess	741	" what a clear way you have of putting things ! "
24348	24359	24361	24361	Alice	40	" It 's a mineral , I _ think _ , "
24363	24369	24371	24372	the Duchess	741	" Of course it is , "
24385	24416	24371	24372	the Duchess	741	" there 's a large mustard - mine near here . And the moral of that is--'The more there is of mine , the less there is of yours . ' "
24417	24423	24425	24425	Alice	40	" Oh , I know ! "
24436	24453	24425	24425	Alice	40	" it 's a vegetable . It does n't look like one , but it is . "
24454	24461	24463	24464	the Duchess	741	" I quite agree with you , "
24466	24526	24463	24464	the Duchess	741	" and the moral of that is--'Be what you would seem to be'--or if you 'd like it put more simply--'Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise . ' "
24527	24536	24537	24537	Alice	40	" I think I should understand that better , "
24542	24562	24537	24537	Alice	40	" if I had it written down : but I ca n't quite follow it as you say it . "
24563	24576	24577	24578	the Duchess	741	" That 's nothing to what I could say if I chose , "
24586	24600	24602	24602	Alice	40	" Pray do n't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that , "
24604	24613	24615	24616	the Duchess	741	" Oh , do n't talk about trouble ! "
24618	24632	24615	24616	the Duchess	741	" I make you a present of everything I 've said as yet . "
24633	24640	24642	24642	Alice	40	" A cheap sort of present ! "
24644	24657	24642	24642	Alice	40	" I 'm glad they do n't give birthday presents like that ! "
24669	24673	24674	24675	the Duchess	741	" Thinking again ? "
24687	24695	24697	24697	Alice	40	" I 've a right to think , "
24710	24717	24719	24720	the Duchess	741	" Just about as much right , "
24722	24732	24719	24720	the Duchess	741	" as pigs have to fly ; and the m-- "
24797	24805	24806	24807	the Duchess	741	" A fine day , your Majesty ! "
24816	24825	24827	24828	the Queen	843	" Now , I give you fair warning , "
24838	24860	24827	24828	the Queen	843	" either you or your head must be off , and that in about half no time ! Take your choice ! "
24874	24883	24884	24885	the Queen	843	" Let 's go on with the game , "
24980	24986	24974	24976	the other players	487	" Off with his head ! "
24988	24994	24997	24997	she	843	" Off with her head ! "
25077	25086	25062	25063	the Queen	843	" Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet ? "
25087	25090	25092	25092	Alice	40	" No , "
25094	25106	25092	25092	Alice	40	" I do n't even know what a Mock Turtle is . "
25107	25119	25121	25122	the Queen	843	" It 's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from , "
25124	25135	25137	25137	Alice	40	" I never saw one , or heard of one , "
25139	25145	25147	25148	the Queen	843	" Come on , then , "
25150	25159	25147	25148	the Queen	843	" and he shall tell you his history , "
25181	25187	25168	25169	the King	367	" You are all pardoned . "
25188	25199	25200	25200	she	40	" Come , _ that 's _ a good thing ! "
25253	25259	25261	25262	the Queen	843	" Up , lazy thing ! "
25264	25295	25261	25262	the Queen	843	" and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle , and to hear his history . I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered ; "
25372	25376	25378	25379	the Gryphon	65	" What fun ! "
25389	25397	25399	25399	Alice	40	" What _ is _ the fun ? "
25401	25408	25410	25411	the Gryphon	65	" Why , _ she _ , "
25413	25433	25410	25411	the Gryphon	65	" It 's all her fancy , that : they never executes nobody , you know . Come on ! "
25434	25444	25446	25446	Alice	40	" Everybody says ' come on ! ' here , "
25455	25469	25449	25449	she	40	" I never was so ordered about in all my life , never ! "
25520	25526	25527	25527	she	40	" What is his sorrow ? "
25546	25568	25533	25534	the Gryphon	65	" It 's all his fancy , that : he has n't got no sorrow , you know . Come on ! "
25593	25599	25601	25602	the Gryphon	65	" This here young lady , "
25604	25616	25601	25602	the Gryphon	65	" she wants for to know your history , she do . "
25617	25624	25626	25628	the Mock Turtle	64	" I 'll tell it her , "
25636	25655	25626	25628	the Mock Turtle	64	" sit down , both of you , and do n't speak a word till I 've finished . "
25673	25692	25694	25694	she	40	" I do n't see how he can _ ever _ finish , if he does n't begin . "
25698	25701	25703	25705	the Mock Turtle	64	" Once , "
25714	25721	25703	25705	the Mock Turtle	64	" I was a real Turtle . "
25739	25742	25744	25745	the Gryphon	65	" Hjckrrh ! "
25766	25777	25757	25757	Alice	40	" Thank you , sir , for your interesting story , "
25801	25807	25808	25810	the Mock Turtle	64	" When we were little , "
25828	25850	25808	25810	the Mock Turtle	64	" we went to school in the sea . The master was an old Turtle -- we used to call him Tortoise-- "
25851	25865	25866	25866	Alice	40	" Why did you call him Tortoise , if he was n't one ? "
25869	25879	25881	25883	the Mock Turtle	64	" We called him Tortoise because he taught us , "
25886	25893	25881	25883	the Mock Turtle	64	" really you are very dull ! "
25894	25909	25911	25912	the Gryphon	65	" You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question , "
25945	25960	25937	25938	the Gryphon	65	" Drive on , old fellow ! Do n't be all day about it ! "
25969	25986	25962	25962	he	511	" Yes , we went to school in the sea , though you may n't believe it-- "
25987	25995	25997	25997	Alice	40	" I never said I did n't ! "
25999	26003	26005	26007	the Mock Turtle	64	" You did , "
26009	26014	26016	26017	the Gryphon	65	" Hold your tongue ! "
26031	26048	26025	26027	The Mock Turtle	64	" We had the best of educations -- in fact , we went to school every day-- "
26049	26063	26065	26065	Alice	40	" _ I 've _ been to a day - school , too , "
26067	26078	26065	26065	Alice	40	" you need n't be so proud as all that . "
26079	26083	26085	26087	the Mock Turtle	64	" With extras ? "
26092	26095	26097	26097	Alice	40	" Yes , "
26099	26106	26097	26097	Alice	40	" we learned French and music . "
26107	26111	26113	26115	the Mock Turtle	64	" And washing ? "
26117	26121	26123	26123	Alice	40	" Certainly not ! "
26126	26138	26140	26142	the Mock Turtle	64	" Ah ! then yours was n't a really good school , "
26150	26175	26140	26142	the Mock Turtle	64	" Now at _ ours _ they had at the end of the bill , ' French , music , _ and washing_--extra . ' "
26176	26185	26187	26187	Alice	40	" You could n't have wanted it much , "
26189	26198	26187	26187	Alice	40	" living at the bottom of the sea . "
26199	26208	26210	26212	the Mock Turtle	64	" I could n't afford to learn it . "
26217	26225	26210	26212	the Mock Turtle	64	" I only took the regular course . "
26226	26231	26233	26233	Alice	40	" What was that ? "
26235	26247	26248	26250	the Mock Turtle	64	" Reeling and Writhing , of course , to begin with , "
26253	26271	26248	26250	the Mock Turtle	64	" and then the different branches of Arithmetic -- Ambition , Distraction , Uglification , and Derision . "
26272	26281	26282	26282	Alice	40	" I never heard of ' Uglification , ' "
26287	26292	26282	26282	Alice	40	" What is it ? "
26303	26311	26293	26294	The Gryphon	65	" What ! Never heard of uglifying ! "
26315	26326	26293	26294	The Gryphon	65	" You know what to beautify is , I suppose ? "
26327	26330	26332	26332	Alice	40	" Yes , "
26335	26347	26332	26332	Alice	40	" it means -- to -- make -- anything -- prettier . "
26348	26353	26354	26355	the Gryphon	512	" Well , then , "
26359	26377	26354	26355	the Gryphon	512	" if you do n't know what to uglify is , you _ are _ a simpleton . "
26401	26409	26392	26392	she	40	" What else had you to learn ? "
26410	26417	26418	26420	the Mock Turtle	513	" Well , there was Mystery , "
26431	26477	26418	26420	the Mock Turtle	513	" --Mystery , ancient and modern , with Seaography : then Drawling -- the Drawling - master was an old conger - eel , that used to come once a week : _ he _ taught us Drawling , Stretching , and Fainting in Coils . "
26478	26486	26488	26488	Alice	40	" What was _ that _ like ? "
26490	26501	26502	26504	the Mock Turtle	64	" Well , I ca n't show it you myself , "
26507	26520	26502	26504	the Mock Turtle	64	" I 'm too stiff . And the Gryphon never learnt it . "
26521	26526	26528	26529	the Gryphon	65	" Had n't time , "
26531	26552	26528	26529	the Gryphon	65	" I went to the Classics master , though . He was an old crab , _ he _ was . "
26553	26560	26561	26563	the Mock Turtle	64	" I never went to him , "
26569	26581	26561	26563	the Mock Turtle	64	" he taught Laughing and Grief , they used to say . "
26582	26591	26593	26594	the Gryphon	65	" So he did , so he did , "
26611	26623	26625	26625	Alice	40	" And how many hours a day did you do lessons ? "
26635	26642	26644	26646	the Mock Turtle	64	" Ten hours the first day , "
26648	26657	26644	26646	the Mock Turtle	64	" nine the next , and so on . "
26658	26664	26666	26666	Alice	40	" What a curious plan ! "
26668	26678	26679	26680	the Gryphon	512	" That 's the reason they 're called lessons , "
26683	26692	26679	26680	the Gryphon	512	" because they lessen from day to day . "
26716	26727	26703	26703	she	40	" Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday ? "
26728	26734	26736	26738	the Mock Turtle	64	" Of course it was , "
26740	26750	26751	26751	Alice	40	" And how did you manage on the twelfth ? "
26756	26763	26764	26765	the Gryphon	512	" That 's enough about lessons , "
26773	26782	26764	26765	the Gryphon	512	" tell her something about the games now . "
26826	26838	26840	26841	the Gryphon	65	" Same as if he had a bone in his throat , "
26879	26889	26875	26875	he	64	" You may not have lived much under the sea-- "
26891	26896	26875	26875	he	64	" I have n't , "
26898	26908	26875	26875	he	64	Alice)--"and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster-- "
26914	26918	26910	26910	Alice	40	" I once tasted-- "
26926	26930	26921	26921	herself	40	" No , never "
26932	26948	26921	26921	herself	40	" --so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is ! "
26949	26954	26956	26956	Alice	40	" No , indeed , "
26958	26967	26956	26956	Alice	40	" What sort of a dance is it ? "
26968	26971	26973	26974	the Gryphon	65	" Why , "
26976	26988	26973	26974	the Gryphon	65	" you first form into a line along the sea - shore-- "
26989	26993	26995	26997	the Mock Turtle	64	" Two lines ! "
26999	27025	26995	26997	the Mock Turtle	64	" Seals , turtles , salmon , and so on ; then , when you 've cleared all the jelly - fish out of the way-- "
27026	27035	27037	27038	the Gryphon	65	" _ That _ generally takes some time , "
27040	27044	26995	26997	the Mock Turtle	64	" --you advance twice-- "
27045	27054	27056	27057	the Gryphon	65	" Each with a lobster as a partner ! "
27059	27063	27064	27066	the Mock Turtle	64	" Of course , "
27069	27076	27064	27066	the Mock Turtle	64	" advance twice , set to partners-- "
27077	27087	27089	27090	the Gryphon	65	" --change lobsters , and retire in same order , "
27092	27098	27099	27101	the Mock Turtle	64	" Then , you know , "
27105	27109	27099	27101	the Mock Turtle	64	" you throw the-- "
27110	27114	27116	27117	the Gryphon	512	" The lobsters ! "
27126	27135	27099	27101	the Mock Turtle	64	" --as far out to sea as you can-- "
27136	27141	27143	27144	the Gryphon	65	" Swim after them ! "
27146	27154	27156	27158	the Mock Turtle	64	" Turn a somersault in the sea ! "
27164	27169	27171	27172	the Gryphon	65	" Change lobsters again ! "
27180	27194	27196	27198	the Mock Turtle	64	" Back to land again , and that 's all the first figure , "
27235	27244	27246	27246	Alice	40	" It must be a very pretty dance , "
27249	27260	27262	27264	the Mock Turtle	64	" Would you like to see a little of it ? "
27266	27271	27273	27273	Alice	40	" Very much indeed , "
27275	27285	27287	27289	the Mock Turtle	64	" Come , let 's try the first figure ! "
27294	27308	27287	27289	the Mock Turtle	64	" We can do without lobsters , you know . Which shall sing ? "
27309	27317	27319	27320	the Gryphon	65	" Oh , _ you _ sing , "
27322	27329	27319	27320	the Gryphon	65	" I 've forgotten the words . "
27374	27382	27287	27289	the Mock Turtle	64	" Will you walk a little faster ? "
27390	27474	27287	27289	the Mock Turtle	64	" There 's a porpoise close behind us , and he 's treading on my tail . See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance ! They are waiting on the shingle -- will you come and join the dance ? Will you , wo n't you , will you , wo n't you , will you join the dance ? Will you , wo n't you , will you , wo n't you , wo n't you join the dance ? "
27475	27504	27364	27366	the Mock Turtle	64	" You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us , with the lobsters , out to sea ! "
27505	27510	27287	27289	the Mock Turtle	64	" But the snail replied "
27517	27574	27364	27366	the Mock Turtle	64	" and gave a look askance-- Said he thanked the whiting kindly , but he would not join the dance . Would not , could not , would not , could not , would not join the dance . Would not , could not , would not , could not , could not join the dance . "
27575	27584	27585	27587	his scaly friend	520	" What matters it how far we go ? "
27590	27670	27585	27587	his scaly friend	520	" There is another shore , you know , upon the other side . The further off from England the nearer is to France-- Then turn not pale , beloved snail , but come and join the dance . Will you , wo n't you , will you , wo n't you , will you join the dance ? Will you , wo n't you , will you , wo n't you , wo n't you join the dance ? "
27671	27684	27686	27686	Alice	40	" Thank you , it 's a very interesting dance to watch , "
27698	27711	27686	27686	Alice	40	" and I do so like that curious song about the whiting ! "
27712	27720	27722	27724	the Mock Turtle	64	" Oh , as to the whiting , "
27726	27736	27722	27724	the Mock Turtle	64	" they -- you've seen them , of course ? "
27737	27740	27742	27742	Alice	40	" Yes , "
27744	27752	27753	27753	she	40	" I 've often seen them at dinn-- "
27758	27768	27770	27772	the Mock Turtle	513	" I do n't know where Dinn may be , "
27774	27793	27770	27772	the Mock Turtle	513	" but if you 've seen them so often , of course you know what they 're like . "
27794	27799	27800	27800	Alice	40	" I believe so , "
27804	27820	27800	27800	Alice	40	" They have their tails in their mouths -- and they 're all over crumbs . "
27821	27829	27831	27833	the Mock Turtle	64	" You 're wrong about the crumbs , "
27835	27860	27831	27833	the Mock Turtle	64	" crumbs would all wash off in the sea . But they _ have _ their tails in their mouths ; and the reason is-- "
27869	27878	27879	27879	he	513	eyes.--"Tell her about the reason and all that , "
27885	27890	27892	27893	the Gryphon	512	" The reason is , "
27895	27949	27892	27893	the Gryphon	512	" that they _ would _ go with the lobsters to the dance . So they got thrown out to sea . So they had to fall a long way . So they got their tails fast in their mouths . So they could n't get them out again . That 's all . "
27950	27954	27956	27956	Alice	40	" Thank you , "
27958	27974	27956	27956	Alice	40	" it 's very interesting . I never knew so much about a whiting before . "
27975	27988	27990	27991	the Gryphon	65	" I can tell you more than that , if you like , "
27993	28004	27990	27991	the Gryphon	65	" Do you know why it 's called a whiting ? "
28005	28012	28014	28014	Alice	40	" I never thought about it , "
28016	28019	28014	28014	Alice	40	" Why ? "
28020	28030	28031	28032	the Gryphon	65	" _ It does the boots and shoes _ , "
28042	28049	28050	28050	she	40	" Does the boots and shoes ! "
28057	28069	28071	28072	the Gryphon	65	" Why , what are _ your _ shoes done with ? "
28074	28084	28071	28072	the Gryphon	65	" I mean , what makes them so shiny ? "
28101	28111	28085	28085	Alice	40	" They 're done with blacking , I believe . "
28112	28120	28121	28122	the Gryphon	65	" Boots and shoes under the sea , "
28130	28141	28121	28122	the Gryphon	65	" are done with a whiting . Now you know . "
28142	28150	28151	28151	Alice	40	" And what are they made of ? "
28160	28168	28169	28170	the Gryphon	512	" Soles and eels , of course , "
28175	28184	28169	28170	the Gryphon	512	" any shrimp could have told you that . "
28185	28193	28195	28195	Alice	40	" If I 'd been the whiting , "
28206	28232	28195	28195	Alice	40	" I 'd have said to the porpoise , ' Keep back , please : we do n't want _ you _ with us ! ' "
28233	28243	28244	28246	the Mock Turtle	64	" They were obliged to have him with them , "
28249	28260	28244	28246	the Mock Turtle	64	" no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise . "
28261	28267	28269	28269	Alice	40	" Would n't it really ? "
28277	28282	28284	28286	the Mock Turtle	64	" Of course not , "
28288	28318	28284	28286	the Mock Turtle	64	" why , if a fish came to _ me _ , and told me he was going a journey , I should say ' With what porpoise ? ' "
28319	28328	28330	28330	Alice	40	" Do n't you mean ' purpose ' ? "
28332	28339	28340	28342	the Mock Turtle	64	" I mean what I say , "
28353	28366	28350	28351	the Gryphon	65	" Come , let 's hear some of _ your _ adventures . "
28367	28380	28382	28382	Alice	40	" I could tell you my adventures -- beginning from this morning , "
28387	28406	28382	28382	Alice	40	" but it 's no use going back to yesterday , because I was a different person then . "
28407	28412	28414	28416	the Mock Turtle	64	" Explain all that , "
28418	28427	28429	28430	the Gryphon	65	" No , no ! The adventures first , "
28436	28444	28429	28430	the Gryphon	65	" explanations take such a dreadful time . "
28523	28533	28535	28536	the Caterpillar	193	" _ You are old , Father William _ , "
28557	28563	28547	28549	the Mock Turtle	64	" That 's very curious . "
28564	28576	28578	28579	the Gryphon	65	" It 's all about as curious as it can be , "
28581	28587	28588	28590	the Mock Turtle	64	" It all came different ! "
28594	28612	28613	28613	He	64	" I should like to hear her try and repeat something now . Tell her to begin . "
28631	28647	28649	28650	the Gryphon	65	" Stand up and repeat '' _ Tis the voice of the sluggard _ , ' "
28652	28666	28668	28668	Alice	40	" How the creatures order one about , and make one repeat lessons ! "
28670	28681	28668	28668	Alice	40	" I might as well be at school at once . "
28721	28735	28736	28736	You	530	" ' Tis the voice of the Lobster ; I heard him declare , "
28749	28775	28736	28736	You	530	" As a duck with its eyelids , so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons , and turns out his toes . "
28827	28845	28847	28848	the Gryphon	65	" That 's different from what _ I _ used to say when I was a child , "
28850	28859	28861	28863	the Mock Turtle	64	" Well , I never heard it before , "
28865	28872	28861	28863	the Mock Turtle	64	" but it sounds uncommon nonsense . "
28902	28911	28913	28915	the Mock Turtle	64	" I should like to have it explained , "
28917	28924	28926	28927	the Gryphon	65	" She ca n't explain it , "
28930	28938	28926	28927	the Gryphon	65	" Go on with the next verse . "
28939	28945	28946	28948	the Mock Turtle	64	" But about his toes ? "
28951	28967	28946	28948	the Mock Turtle	64	" How _ could _ he turn them out with his nose , you know ? "
28968	28977	28978	28978	Alice	40	" It 's the first position in dancing . "
28997	29005	29006	29007	the Gryphon	65	" Go on with the next verse , "
29011	29024	29006	29007	the Gryphon	65	" it begins ' _ I passed by his garden _ . ' "
29050	29074	29043	29043	she	40	" I passed by his garden , and marked , with one eye , How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie-- "
29145	29158	29159	29161	the Mock Turtle	64	" What _ is _ the use of repeating all that stuff , "
29164	29190	29159	29161	the Mock Turtle	64	" if you do n't explain it as you go on ? It 's by far the most confusing thing _ I _ ever heard ! "
29191	29202	29204	29205	the Gryphon	65	" Yes , I think you 'd better leave off , "
29217	29228	29229	29230	the Gryphon	65	" Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille ? "
29234	29248	29229	29230	the Gryphon	65	" Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song ? "
29249	29266	29267	29267	Alice	40	" Oh , a song , please , if the Mock Turtle would be so kind , "
29283	29306	29273	29274	the Gryphon	65	" Hm ! No accounting for tastes ! Sing her ' _ Turtle Soup _ , ' will you , old fellow ? "
29327	29396	29229	29230	the Gryphon	65	" Beautiful Soup , so rich and green , Waiting in a hot tureen ! Who for such dainties would not stoop ? Soup of the evening , beautiful Soup ! Soup of the evening , beautiful Soup ! Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop ! Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop ! Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening , Beautiful , beautiful Soup ! "
29397	29466	29307	29309	The Mock Turtle	64	" Beautiful Soup ! Who cares for fish , Game , or any other dish ? Who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful Soup ? Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup ? Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop ! Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop ! Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening , Beautiful , beauti -- FUL SOUP ! "
29467	29471	29473	29474	the Gryphon	65	" Chorus again ! "
29491	29497	29477	29479	the Mock Turtle	513	" The trial 's beginning ! "
29504	29508	29510	29511	the Gryphon	65	" Come on ! "
29534	29540	29541	29541	Alice	533	" What trial is it ? "
29552	29556	29548	29549	the Gryphon	512	" Come on ! "
29580	29597	29548	29549	the Gryphon	512	" Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening , Beautiful , beautiful Soup ! "
29725	29734	29735	29735	she	40	them--"I wish they 'd get the trial done , "
29738	29745	29735	29735	she	40	" and hand round the refreshments ! "
29808	29814	29815	29815	she	40	" That 's the judge , "
29820	29827	29815	29815	she	40	" because of his great wig . "
29880	29889	29891	29891	Alice	40	" And that 's the jury - box , "
29893	29899	29891	29891	Alice	40	" and those twelve creatures , "
29906	29909	29901	29901	she	40	" creatures , "
29926	29934	29935	29935	She	40	" I suppose they are the jurors . "
29980	29984	29935	29935	She	40	" jury - men "
30003	30009	30010	30010	Alice	548	" What are they doing ? "
30016	30033	30010	30010	Alice	548	" They ca n't have anything to put down yet , before the trial 's begun . "
30034	30042	30043	30044	the Gryphon	65	" They 're putting down their names , "
30049	30063	30043	30044	the Gryphon	65	" for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial . "
30064	30068	30069	30069	Alice	40	" Stupid things ! "
30090	30096	30084	30086	the White Rabbit	20	" Silence in the court ! "
30138	30142	30144	30144	their	550	" stupid things ! "
30163	30166	30169	30169	he	551	" stupid , "
30179	30193	30195	30195	Alice	40	" A nice muddle their slates'll be in before the trial 's over ! "
30311	30318	30320	30321	the King	367	" Herald , read the accusation ! "
30346	30379	30325	30327	the White Rabbit	20	" The Queen of Hearts , she made some tarts , All on a summer day : The Knave of Hearts , he stole those tarts , And took them quite away ! "
30380	30385	30386	30387	the King	367	" Consider your verdict , "
30393	30400	30401	30402	the Rabbit	184	" Not yet , not yet ! "
30406	30417	30401	30402	the Rabbit	184	" There 's a great deal to come before that ! "
30418	30424	30426	30427	the King	367	" Call the first witness , "
30444	30448	30430	30432	the White Rabbit	20	" First witness ! "
30478	30486	30487	30487	he	553	" I beg pardon , your Majesty , "
30490	30510	30487	30487	he	553	" for bringing these in : but I had n't quite finished my tea when I was sent for . "
30511	30518	30520	30521	the King	367	" You ought to have finished , "
30523	30529	30520	30521	the King	367	" When did you begin ? "
30555	30567	30568	30568	he	553	" Fourteenth of March , I _ think _ it was , "
30571	30574	30576	30578	the March Hare	53	" Fifteenth , "
30580	30583	30585	30586	the Dormouse	55	" Sixteenth , "
30588	30593	30594	30595	the King	367	" Write that down , "
30629	30635	30636	30637	the King	367	" Take off your hat , "
30643	30649	30651	30652	the Hatter	54	" It is n't mine , "
30654	30659	30660	30661	the King	367	" _ Stolen ! _ "
30678	30685	30686	30687	the Hatter	54	" I keep them to sell , "
30693	30706	30686	30687	the Hatter	54	" I 've none of my own . I 'm a hatter . "
30728	30733	30735	30736	the King	367	" Give your evidence , "
30738	30755	30735	30736	the King	367	" and do n't be nervous , or I 'll have you executed on the spot . "
30872	30881	30883	30884	the Dormouse	885	" I wish you would n't squeeze so . "
30893	30899	30883	30884	the Dormouse	885	" I can hardly breathe . "
30900	30907	30909	30909	Alice	40	" I ca n't help it , "
30913	30918	30909	30909	Alice	40	" I 'm growing . "
30919	30930	30932	30933	the Dormouse	55	" You 've no right to grow _ here _ , "
30935	30941	30943	30943	Alice	40	" Do n't talk nonsense , "
30947	30955	30943	30943	Alice	40	" you know you 're growing too . "
30956	30969	30971	30972	the Dormouse	55	" Yes , but _ I _ grow at a reasonable pace , "
30974	30981	30971	30972	the Dormouse	55	" not in that ridiculous fashion . "
31034	31047	31023	31023	she	843	" Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert ! "
31064	31069	31070	31071	the King	367	" Give your evidence , "
31075	31090	31070	31071	the King	367	" or I 'll have you executed , whether you 're nervous or not . "
31091	31101	31102	31103	the Hatter	876	" I 'm a poor man , your Majesty , "
31111	31146	31102	31103	the Hatter	876	" --and I had n't begun my tea -- not above a week or so -- and what with the bread - and - butter getting so thin -- and the twinkling of the tea-- "
31147	31156	31158	31159	the King	367	" The twinkling of the _ what ? _ "
31161	31170	31171	31172	the Hatter	54	" It _ began _ with the tea , "
31175	31184	31186	31187	the King	367	" Of course twinkling begins with a T ! "
31190	31202	31186	31187	the King	367	" Do you take me for a dunce ? Go on ! "
31203	31210	31211	31212	the Hatter	54	" I 'm a poor man , "
31216	31229	31211	31212	the Hatter	54	" and most things twinkled after that -- only the March Hare said-- "
31230	31235	31236	31238	the March Hare	291	" I did n't ! "
31245	31249	31251	31252	the Hatter	54	" You did ! "
31254	31259	31261	31263	the March Hare	53	" I deny it ! "
31265	31270	31272	31273	the King	367	" He denies it , "
31275	31281	31272	31273	the King	367	" leave out that part . "
31282	31292	31293	31294	the Hatter	876	" Well , at any rate , the Dormouse said-- "
31320	31324	31326	31327	the Hatter	54	" After that , "
31329	31339	31326	31327	the Hatter	54	" I cut some more bread - and - butter-- "
31340	31348	31349	31352	one of the jury	594	" But what did the Dormouse say ? "
31355	31362	31364	31365	the Hatter	54	" That I ca n't remember , "
31367	31374	31376	31377	the King	367	" You _ must _ remember , "
31379	31387	31376	31377	the King	367	" or I 'll have you executed . "
31408	31418	31419	31419	he	597	" I 'm a poor man , your Majesty , "
31422	31434	31436	31437	the King	367	" You 're a _ very _ poor _ speaker _ , "
31514	31524	31526	31526	Alice	40	" I 'm glad I 've seen that done , "
31528	31544	31526	31526	Alice	40	" I 've so often read in the newspapers , at the end of trials , "
31563	31574	31557	31561	the officers of the court	586	" and I never understood what it meant till now . "
31575	31590	31592	31593	the King	367	" If that 's all you know about it , you may stand down , "
31595	31603	31605	31606	the Hatter	876	" I ca n't go no lower , "
31608	31619	31605	31606	the Hatter	876	" I 'm on the floor , as it is . "
31620	31629	31630	31631	the King	367	" Then you may _ sit _ down , "
31646	31656	31658	31658	Alice	40	" Come , that finished the guinea - pigs ! "
31660	31668	31658	31658	Alice	40	" Now we shall get on better . "
31669	31677	31679	31680	the Hatter	54	" I 'd rather finish my tea , "
31698	31703	31705	31706	the King	367	" You may go , "
31725	31734	31735	31736	the Queen	843	" --and just take his head off outside , "
31760	31766	31768	31769	the King	367	" Call the next witness ! "
31819	31824	31826	31827	the King	367	" Give your evidence , "
31829	31833	31835	31836	the cook	247	" Sha n't , "
31854	31866	31838	31839	The King	367	" Your Majesty must cross - examine _ this _ witness . "
31867	31877	31878	31879	the King	367	" Well , if I must , I must , "
31914	31921	31907	31907	he	367	" What are tarts made of ? "
31922	31927	31929	31930	the cook	247	" Pepper , mostly , "
31932	31935	31907	31907	he	367	" Treacle , "
31943	31948	31949	31950	the Queen	843	" Collar that Dormouse , "
31954	31977	31949	31950	the Queen	843	" Behead that Dormouse ! Turn that Dormouse out of court ! Suppress him ! Pinch him ! Off with his whiskers ! "
32010	32014	32016	32017	the King	367	" Never mind ! "
32026	32032	32034	32034	he	367	" Call the next witness . "
32043	32067	32034	32034	he	367	" Really , my dear , _ you _ must cross - examine the next witness . It quite makes my forehead ache ! "
32093	32105	32106	32106	she	40	" --for they have n't got much evidence _ yet _ , "
32133	32136	32126	32126	his	119	" Alice ! "
32143	32146	32148	32148	Alice	40	" Here ! "
32229	32239	32240	32240	she	40	" Oh , I _ beg _ your pardon ! "
32302	32309	32311	32312	the King	367	" The trial can not proceed , "
32319	32332	32333	32333	he	367	" until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--_all _ , "
32406	32413	32414	32414	she	40	" not that it signifies much , "
32419	32442	32414	32414	she	40	" I should think it would be _ quite _ as much use in the trial one way up as the other . "
32517	32526	32527	32528	the King	367	" What do you know about this business ? "
32533	32536	32538	32538	Alice	40	" Nothing , "
32540	32546	32548	32549	the King	367	" Nothing _ whatever ? _ "
32551	32555	32557	32557	Alice	40	" Nothing whatever , "
32559	32565	32566	32567	the King	367	" That 's very important , "
32593	32604	32605	32605	he	20	" _ Un_important , your Majesty means , of course , "
32624	32634	32635	32636	the King	367	" _ Un_important , of course , I meant , "
32649	32657	32660	32660	he	367	" important -- unimportant -- unimportant -- important-- "
32675	32678	32670	32671	the jury	560	" important , "
32681	32684	32670	32671	the jury	560	" unimportant . "
32701	32710	32711	32711	she	40	" but it does n't matter a bit , "
32738	32741	32719	32720	the King	367	" Silence ! "
32749	32769	32719	32720	the King	367	" Rule Forty - two . _ All persons more than a mile high to leave the court _ . "
32775	32785	32787	32787	Alice	40	" _ I 'm _ not a mile high , "
32789	32793	32795	32796	the King	367	" You are , "
32798	32804	32806	32807	the Queen	843	" Nearly two miles high , "
32809	32821	32823	32823	Alice	40	" Well , I sha n't go , at any rate , "
32825	32841	32823	32823	Alice	40	" besides , that 's not a regular rule : you invented it just now . "
32842	32852	32854	32855	the King	367	" It 's the oldest rule in the book , "
32857	32866	32868	32868	Alice	40	" Then it ought to be Number One , "
32883	32888	32889	32889	he	367	" Consider your verdict , "
32902	32915	32917	32919	the White Rabbit	20	" There 's more evidence to come yet , please your Majesty , "
32928	32937	32917	32919	the White Rabbit	20	" this paper has just been picked up . "
32938	32944	32946	32947	the Queen	843	" What 's in it ? "
32949	32957	32959	32961	the White Rabbit	20	" I have n't opened it yet , "
32963	32981	32959	32961	the White Rabbit	20	" but it seems to be a letter , written by the prisoner to -- to somebody . "
32982	32989	32991	32992	the King	367	" It must have been that , "
32994	33010	32991	32992	the King	367	" unless it was written to nobody , which is n't usual , you know . "
33011	33018	33020	33023	one of the jurymen	659	" Who is it directed to ? "
33025	33033	33035	33037	the White Rabbit	20	" It is n't directed at all , "
33039	33053	33054	33054	He	367	" in fact , there 's nothing written on the _ outside _ . "
33064	33081	33054	33054	He	367	" It is n't a letter , after all : it 's a set of verses . "
33082	33091	33093	33096	another of the jurymen	661	" Are they in the prisoner 's handwriting ? "
33098	33105	33107	33109	the White Rabbit	119	" No , they 're not , "
33111	33121	33107	33109	the White Rabbit	119	" and that 's the queerest thing about it . "
33130	33140	33142	33143	the King	367	" He must have imitated somebody else 's hand , "
33154	33159	33161	33162	the Knave	63	" Please your Majesty , "
33164	33188	33161	33162	the Knave	63	" I did n't write it , and they ca n't prove I did : there 's no name signed at the end . "
33189	33197	33199	33200	the King	367	" If you did n't sign it , "
33202	33232	33199	33200	the King	367	" that only makes the matter worse . You _ must _ have meant some mischief , or else you 'd have signed your name like an honest man . "
33257	33265	33267	33268	the Queen	843	" That _ proves _ his guilt , "
33270	33278	33280	33280	Alice	40	" It proves nothing of the sort ! "
33282	33295	33280	33280	Alice	40	" Why , you do n't even know what they 're about ! "
33296	33300	33302	33303	the King	367	" Read them , "
33313	33323	33324	33324	he	367	" Where shall I begin , please your Majesty ? "
33327	33333	33334	33335	the King	367	" Begin at the beginning , "
33339	33353	33334	33335	the King	367	" and go on till you come to the end : then stop . "
33362	33391	33358	33360	the White Rabbit	20	" They told me you had been to her , And mentioned me to him : She gave me a good character , But said I could not swim .
33536	33536	33532	33532	yourself	675	"
33537	33551	33553	33554	the King	367	" That 's the most important piece of evidence we 've heard yet , "
33560	33566	33553	33554	the King	367	" so now let the jury-- "
33567	33577	33579	33579	Alice	40	" If any one of them can explain it , "
33604	33626	33553	33554	the King	367	" I 'll give him sixpence . _ I _ do n't believe there 's an atom of meaning in it . "
33636	33652	33627	33628	The jury	560	" _ She _ does n't believe there 's an atom of meaning in it , "
33663	33672	33674	33675	the King	367	" If there 's no meaning in it , "
33677	33704	33705	33705	he	367	" that saves a world of trouble , you know , as we need n't try to find any . And yet I do n't know , "
33725	33738	33705	33705	he	367	" I seem to see some meaning in them , after all . "
33744	33753	33754	33754	he	367	" you ca n't swim , can you ? "
33769	33776	33777	33777	he	63	" Do I look like it ? "
33796	33803	33805	33806	the King	367	" All right , so far , "
33819	33859	33809	33809	he	367	" ' _ We know it to be true_-- ' that 's the jury , of course--'_I gave her one , they gave him two_-- ' why , that must be what he did with the tarts , you know-- "
33860	33878	33880	33880	Alice	40	" But , it goes on ' _ they all returned from him to you _ , ' "
33882	33889	33891	33892	the King	367	" Why , there they are ! "
33903	33931	33932	33932	he	367	" Nothing can be clearer than _ that _ . Then again--'_before she had this fit_-- ' you never had fits , my dear , I think ? "
33938	33941	33943	33944	the Queen	843	" Never ! "
34006	34017	34019	34020	the King	367	" Then the words do n't _ fit _ you , "
34036	34042	34043	34044	the King	367	" It 's a pun ! "
34055	34063	34064	34065	the King	367	" Let the jury consider their verdict , "
34076	34081	34083	34084	the Queen	843	" No , no ! "
34086	34093	34083	34084	the Queen	843	" Sentence first -- verdict afterwards . "
34094	34099	34101	34101	Alice	40	" Stuff and nonsense ! "
34104	34113	34101	34101	Alice	40	" The idea of having the sentence first ! "
34114	34119	34121	34122	the Queen	843	" Hold your tongue ! "
34127	34132	34134	34134	Alice	40	" I wo n't ! "
34136	34142	34143	34144	the Queen	843	" Off with her head ! "
34156	34162	34164	34164	Alice	40	" Who cares for you ? "
34179	34189	34164	34164	Alice	40	" You 're nothing but a pack of cards ! "
34266	34273	34275	34276	her sister	78	" Wake up , Alice dear ! "
34278	34289	34275	34276	her sister	78	" Why , what a long sleep you 've had ! "
34290	34301	34303	34303	Alice	40	" Oh , I 've had such a curious dream ! "
34347	34373	34339	34340	her sister	78	" It _ was _ a curious dream , dear , certainly : but now run in to your tea ; it 's getting late . "
