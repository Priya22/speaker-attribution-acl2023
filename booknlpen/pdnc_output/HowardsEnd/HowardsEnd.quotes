26	29	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" Tuesday . "
30	34	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" Dearest Meg , "
35	178	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" It isn t going to be what we expected . It is old and little , and altogether delightful -- red brick . We can scarcely pack in as it is , and the dear knows what will happen when Paul ( younger son ) arrives to - morrow . From hall you go right or left into dining - room or drawing - room . Hall itself is practically a room . You open another door in it , and there are the stairs going up in a sort of tunnel to the first - floor . Three bed - rooms in a row there , and three attics in a row above . That isn t all the house really , but it s all that one notices -- nine windows as you look up from the front garden . "
179	337	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" Then there s a very big wych - elm -- to the left as you look up -- leaning a little over the house , and standing on the boundary between the garden and meadow . I quite love that tree already . Also ordinary elms , oaks -- no nastier than ordinary oaks -- pear - trees , apple - trees , and a vine . No silver birches , though . However , I must get on to my host and hostess . I only wanted to show that it isn t the least what we expected . Why did we settle that their house would be all gables and wiggles , and their garden all gamboge - coloured paths ? I believe simply because we associate them with expensive hotels -- Mrs. Wilcox trailing in beautiful dresses down long corridors , Mr. Wilcox bullying porters , etc . We females are that unjust . "
338	471	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" I shall be back Saturday ; will let you know train later . They are as angry as I am that you did not come too ; really Tibby is too tiresome , he starts a new mortal disease every month . How could he have got hay fever in London ? and even if he could , it seems hard that you should give up a visit to hear a schoolboy sneeze . Tell him that Charles Wilcox ( the son who is here ) has hay fever too , but he s brave , and gets quite cross when we inquire after it . Men like the Wilcoxes would do Tibby a power of good . But you won t agree , and I d better change the subject . "
472	814	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" This long letter is because I m writing before breakfast . Oh , the beautiful vine leaves ! The house is covered with a vine . I looked out earlier , and Mrs. Wilcox was already in the garden . She evidently loves it . No wonder she sometimes looks tired . She was watching the large red poppies come out . Then she walked off the lawn to the meadow , whose corner to the right I can just see . Trail , trail , went her long dress over the sopping grass , and she came back with her hands full of the hay that was cut yesterday -- I suppose for rabbits or something , as she kept on smelling it . The air here is delicious . Later on I heard the noise of croquet balls , and looked out again , and it was Charles Wilcox practising ; they are keen on all games . Presently he started sneezing and had to stop . Then I hear more clicketing , and it is Mr. Wilcox practising , and then , a - tissue , a - tissue : he has to stop too . Then Evie comes out , and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a green - gage - tree -- they put everything to use -- and then she says a - tissue , and in she goes . And finally Mrs. Wilcox reappears , trail , trail , still smelling hay and looking at the flowers . I inflict all this on you because once you said that life is sometimes life and sometimes only a drama , and one must learn to distinguish tother from which , and up to now I have always put that down as Meg s clever nonsense . But this morning , it really does seem not life but a play , and it did amuse me enormously to watch the W s. Now Mrs. Wilcox has come in . "
815	985	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" I am going to wear [ omission ] . Last night Mrs. Wilcox wore an [ omission ] , and Evie [ omission ] . So it isn t exactly a go - as - you - please place , and if you shut your eyes it still seems the wiggly hotel that we expected . Not if you open them . The dog - roses are too sweet . There is a great hedge of them over the lawn -- magnificently tall , so that they fall down in garlands , and nice and thin at the bottom , so that you can see ducks through it and a cow . These belong to the farm , which is the only house near us . There goes the breakfast gong . Much love . Modified love to Tibby . Love to Aunt Juley ; how good of her to come and keep you company , but what a bore . Burn this . Will write again Thursday . "

997	1001	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" Dearest Meg , "
1002	1405	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" I am having a glorious time . I like them all . Mrs. Wilcox , if quieter than in Germany , is sweeter than ever , and I never saw anything like her steady unselfishness , and the best of it is that the others do not take advantage of her . They are the very happiest , jolliest family that you can imagine . I do really feel that we are making friends . The fun of it is that they think me a noodle , and say so -- at least , Mr. Wilcox does -- and when that happens , and one doesn t mind , it s a pretty sure test , isn t it ? He says the most horrid things about woman s suffrage so nicely , and when I said I believed in equality he just folded his arms and gave me such a setting down as I ve never had . Meg , shall we ever learn to talk less ? I never felt so ashamed of myself in my life . I couldn t point to a time when men had been equal , nor even to a time when the wish to be equal had made them happier in other ways . I couldn t say a word . I had just picked up the notion that equality is good from some book -- probably from poetry , or you . Anyhow , it s been knocked into pieces , and , like all people who are really strong , Mr. Wilcox did it without hurting me . On the other hand , I laugh at them for catching hay fever . We live like fighting - cocks , and Charles takes us out every day in the motor -- a tomb with trees in it , a hermit s house , a wonderful road that was made by the Kings of Mercia -- tennis -- a cricket match -- bridge and at night we squeeze up in this lovely house . The whole clan s here now -- it s like a rabbit warren . Evie is a dear . They want me to stop over Sunday -- I suppose it won t matter if I do . Marvellous weather and the views marvellous -- views westward to the high ground . Thank you for your letter . Burn this . "

1419	1422	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" Sunday . "
1423	1452	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" Dearest , dearest Meg,--I do not know what you will say : Paul and I are in love -- the younger son who only came here Wednesday . "
1489	1540	1541	1541	She	255	" I can tell you nothing , Aunt Juley . I know no more than you do . We met -- we only met the father and mother abroad last spring . I know so little that I didn t even know their son s name . It s all so-- "
1550	1560	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" In that case it is far too sudden . "
1561	1571	1541	1541	She	255	" Who knows , Aunt Juley , who knows ? "
1572	1602	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" But , Margaret , dear , I mean , we mustn t be unpractical now that we ve come to facts . It is too sudden , surely . "
1603	1607	1541	1541	She	255	" Who knows ! "
1608	1614	1471	1472	her aunt	546	" But , Margaret , dear-- "
1615	1624	1626	1626	Margaret	255	" I ll go for her other letters , "
1628	1721	1626	1626	Margaret	255	" No , I won t , I ll finish my breakfast . In fact , I haven t them . We met the Wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from Heidelberg to Speyer . Helen and I had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at Speyer -- the Archbishop of Speyer was one of the seven electors -- you know-- Speyer , Maintz , and Koln . Those three sees once commanded the Rhine Valley and got it the name of Priest Street . "
1722	1734	1541	1541	She	255	" I still feel quite uneasy about this business , Margaret . "
1735	1947	1626	1626	Margaret	255	" The train crossed by a bridge of boats , and at first sight it looked quite fine . But oh , in five minutes we had seen the whole thing . The cathedral had been ruined , absolutely ruined , by restoration ; not an inch left of the original structure . We wasted a whole day , and came across the Wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens . They too , poor things , had been taken in -- they were actually stopping at Speyer -- and they rather liked Helen s insisting that they must fly with us to Heidelberg . As a matter of fact , they did come on next day . We all took some drives together . They knew us well enough to ask Helen to come and see them -- at least , I was asked too , but Tibby s illness prevented me , so last Monday she went alone . That s all . You know as much as I do now . It s a young man out of the unknown . She was to have come back Saturday , but put off till Monday , perhaps on account of -- I don t know . "
2171	2175	2176	2176	she	264	" The Germans , "
2179	2201	2176	2176	she	264	" are too thorough , and this is all very well sometimes , but at other times it does not do . "
2202	2205	2207	2207	Margaret	255	" Exactly , "
2209	2215	2207	2207	Margaret	255	" Germans are too thorough . "
2223	2233	2235	2236	Mrs. Munt	264	" Of course I regard you Schlegels as English , "
2237	2242	2176	2176	she	264	hastily--"English to the backbone . "
2251	2261	2176	2176	she	264	" And that reminds me -- Helen s letter . "
2262	2305	2243	2243	Margaret	255	" Oh yes , Aunt Juley , I am thinking all right about Helen s letter . I know -- I must go down and see her . I am thinking about her all right . I am meaning to go down . "
2306	2313	2315	2316	Mrs. Munt	264	" But go with some plan , "
2328	2437	2315	2316	Mrs. Munt	264	" Margaret , if I may interfere , don t be taken by surprise . What do you think of the Wilcoxes ? Are they our sort ? Are they likely people ? Could they appreciate Helen , who is to my mind a very special sort of person ? Do they care about Literature and Art ? That is most important when you come to think of it . Literature and Art . Most important . How old would the son be ? She says younger son . Would he be in a position to marry ? Is he likely to make Helen happy ? Did you gather-- "
2438	2443	2526	2526	she	546	" I gathered nothing . "
2451	2456	2526	2526	she	546	" Then in that case-- "
2457	2472	2526	2526	she	546	" In that case I can make no plans , don t you see . "
2473	2477	2526	2526	she	546	" On the contrary-- "
2478	2495	2526	2526	she	546	" I hate plans . I hate lines of action . Helen isn t a baby . "
2496	2509	2526	2526	she	546	" Then in that case , my dear , why go down ? "
2541	2560	2534	2534	She	546	" I love my dear sister ; I must be near her at this crisis of her life . "
2615	2622	2624	2625	Mrs. Munt	264	" I consider you odd girls , "
2627	2681	2682	2682	She	264	" and very wonderful girls , and in many ways far older than your years . But -- you won t be offended ? frankly , I feel you are not up to this business . It requires an older person . Dear , I have nothing to call me back to Swanage . "
2689	2712	2682	2682	She	264	" I am all at your disposal . Let me go down to this house whose name I forget instead of you . "
2713	2715	2607	2607	she	546	" Aunt Juley"--she
2720	2746	2607	2607	she	546	her--"I must , must go to Howards End myself . You don t exactly understand , though I can never thank you properly for offering . "
2747	2752	2754	2755	Mrs. Munt	264	" I do understand , "
2761	2832	2754	2755	Mrs. Munt	264	" I go down in no spirit of interference , but to make inquiries . Inquiries are necessary . Now , I am going to be rude . You would say the wrong thing ; to a certainty you would . In your anxiety for Helen s happiness you would offend the whole of these Wilcoxes by asking one of your impetuous questions -- not that one minds offending them . "
2833	2904	2607	2607	she	546	" I shall ask no questions . I have it in Helen s writing that she and a man are in love . There is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that . All the rest isn t worth a straw . A long engagement if you like , but inquiries , questions , plans , lines of action -- no , Aunt Juley , no . "
2952	2969	3042	3042	she	264	" If Helen had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a penniless clerk-- "
2970	2992	3049	3049	she	264	" Dear Margaret , do come into the library and shut the door . Your good maids are dusting the banisters . "
2993	3016	3042	3042	she	264	" --or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for Carter Paterson , I should have said the same . "
3052	3076	3049	3049	she	264	" Though in the case of Carter Paterson I should want it to be a very long engagement indeed , I must say . "
3077	3083	3085	3086	Mrs. Munt	264	" I should think so , "
3088	3163	3085	3086	Mrs. Munt	264	" and , indeed , I can scarcely follow you . Now , just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the Wilcoxes . I understand it , but most good people would think you mad . Imagine how disconcerting for Helen ! What is wanted is a person who will go slowly , slowly in this business , and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to . "
3170	3184	3049	3049	she	264	" But you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off . "
3185	3195	3049	3049	she	264	" I think probably it must ; but slowly . "
3196	3205	3049	3049	she	264	" Can you break an engagement off slowly ? "
3211	3265	3206	3206	Her	255	" What s an engagement made of , do you suppose ? I think it s made of some hard stuff that may snap , but can t break . It is different to the other ties of life . They stretch or bend . They admit of degree . They re different . "
3266	3320	3361	3361	his	576	" Exactly so . But won t you let me just run down to Howards House , and save you all the discomfort ? I will really not interfere , but I do so thoroughly understand the kind of thing you Schlegels want that one quiet look round will be enough for me . "
3523	3540	3520	3520	she	255	" Yes , I have changed my mind ; I do wish that you would go . "
3580	3641	3520	3520	she	255	" You will remember , Aunt Juley , not to be drawn into discussing the engagement . Give my letter to Helen , and say whatever you feel yourself , but do keep clear of the relatives . We have scarcely got their names straight yet , and , besides , that sort of thing is so uncivilised and wrong . "
3642	3646	3648	3649	Mrs. Munt	264	" So uncivilised ? "
3663	3686	3520	3520	she	255	" Oh , I used an affected word . I only meant would you please talk the thing over only with Helen . "
3687	3692	3520	3520	she	255	" Only with Helen . "
3693	3695	3520	3520	she	255	" Because-- "
4065	4067	4075	4077	the other babies	608	" seconds "
4108	4124	4092	4092	Margaret	255	" All over . Wish I had never written . Tell no one-- , HELEN . "
4265	4275	4254	4254	Margaret	255	" No , they could manage much better alone . "
4317	4326	4328	4329	Mrs. Munt	264	" I must not interfere a third time , "
4400	4409	4410	4410	Margaret	255	" Then we should be together , dear . "
4463	4490	4452	4453	Mrs. Munt	264	" I did manage that , at all events . When the smash comes poor Margaret will have a nest - egg to fall back upon . "
5060	5066	5067	5067	she	264	" I want a house , "
5074	5088	5067	5067	she	264	" Its name is Howards Lodge . Do you know where it is ? "
5089	5093	5094	5095	the boy	662	" Mr. Wilcox ! "
5108	5115	5067	5067	she	264	" She s wanting Howards End . "
5157	5173	5148	5148	she	264	" Excuse me asking , but are you the younger Mr. Wilcox or the elder ? "
5174	5185	5137	5138	the stranger	665	" The younger . Can I do anything for you ? "
5186	5189	5191	5191	herself	264	" Oh , well"--she
5195	5202	5203	5203	She	264	" Really . Are you ? I-- "
5216	5240	5213	5213	her	264	" I am Miss Schlegel s aunt . I ought to introduce myself , oughtn t I ? My name is Mrs. Munt . "
5254	5273	5245	5245	he	661	" Oh , rather ; Miss Schlegel is stopping with us . Did you want to see her ? "
5274	5277	5213	5213	her	264	" Possibly . "
5278	5291	5292	5292	He	661	" I ll call you a cab . No ; wait a mo-- "
5295	5309	5292	5292	He	661	" Our motor s here . I ll run you up in it . "
5310	5316	5213	5213	her	264	" That is very kind . "
5317	5340	5292	5292	He	661	" Not at all , if you ll just wait till they bring out a parcel from the office . This way . "
5341	5352	5213	5213	her	264	" My niece is not with you by any chance ? "
5353	5390	5292	5292	He	661	" No ; I came over with my father . He has gone on north in your train . You ll see Miss Schlegel at lunch . You re coming up to lunch , I hope ? "
5391	5399	5401	5402	Mrs. Munt	264	" I should like to come UP , "
5490	5508	5589	5589	he	668	" In front or behind ? Which do you prefer ? It may be windy in front . "
5509	5521	5589	5589	he	668	" In front if I may ; then we can talk . "
5522	5541	5542	5542	He	668	" But excuse me one moment -- I can t think what they re doing with that parcel . "
5557	5586	5542	5542	He	668	" Hi ! hi , you there ! Are you going to keep me waiting all day ? Parcel for Wilcox , Howards End . Just look sharp ! "
5595	5624	5587	5587	Emerging	671	" This station s abominably organised ; if I had my way , the whole lot of em should get the sack . May I help you in ? "
5625	5633	5635	5636	Mrs. Munt	264	" This is very good of you , "
5697	5702	5703	5703	she	264	" Very good indeed , "
5708	5718	5703	5703	she	264	" It is just what I should have wished . "
5719	5728	5729	5729	he	673	" Very good of you to say so , "
5752	5766	5729	5729	he	673	" I was just tooling my father over to catch the down train . "
5767	5778	5703	5703	she	264	" You see , we heard from Helen this morning . "
5831	5842	5843	5843	he	673	" The mater will be very glad to see you , "
5846	5865	5843	5843	he	673	" Hi ! I say . Parcel . Parcel for Howards End . Bring it out . Hi ! "
5895	5944	6024	6024	she	676	" Sign , must I ? Why the -- should I sign after all this bother ? Not even got a pencil on you ? Remember next time I report you to the station - master . My time s of value , though yours mayn t be . Here"--here
5949	5956	6024	6024	she	676	" Extremely sorry , Mrs. Munt . "
5957	5965	6024	6024	she	676	" Not at all , Mr. Wilcox . "
5966	5992	6024	6024	she	676	" And do you object to going through the village ? It is rather a longer spin , but I have one or two commissions . "
5993	6014	6024	6024	she	676	" I should love going through the village . Naturally I am very anxious to talk things over with you . "
6056	6060	6065	6067	the young man	679	" uncivilised or wrong "
6154	6160	6161	6161	she	255	" You can well imagine , "
6164	6175	6161	6161	she	255	" that the news was a great shock to us . "
6176	6180	6150	6150	she	255	" What news ? "
6181	6185	6186	6186	she	255	" Mr. Wilcox , "
6190	6206	6186	6186	she	255	" Margaret has told me everything -- everything . I have seen Helen s letter . "
6250	6261	6239	6239	he	679	" I beg your pardon ; I didn t catch . "
6262	6318	6239	6239	he	679	" About Helen . Helen , of course . Helen is a very exceptional person -- I am sure you will let me say this , feeling towards her as you do -- indeed , all the Schlegels are exceptional . I come in no spirit of interference , but it was a great shock . "
6405	6418	6420	6420	his	679	" I wonder when they ll learn wisdom and tar the roads , "
6444	6471	6424	6425	a man	569	" Margaret could not come herself , on account of poor Tibby , so I am here to represent her and to have a good talk . "
6472	6481	6483	6485	the young man	679	" I m sorry to be so dense , "
6494	6503	6483	6485	the young man	679	" But I still haven t quite understood . "
6504	6515	6424	6425	a man	569	" Helen , Mr. Wilcox -- my niece and you . "
6562	6568	6569	6569	he	679	" Miss Schlegel and myself ? "
6576	6585	6587	6588	Mrs. Munt	264	" I trust there has been no misunderstanding , "
6590	6598	6587	6588	Mrs. Munt	264	" Her letter certainly read that way . "
6599	6603	6569	6569	he	679	" What way ? "
6604	6609	6610	6610	She	697	" That you and she-- "
6618	6626	6627	6627	he	679	" I think I catch your meaning , "
6631	6637	6627	6627	he	679	" What an extraordinary mistake ! "
6638	6645	6646	6646	she	697	" Then you didn t the least-- "
6665	6677	6627	6627	he	679	" Scarcely , as I am already engaged to another lady . "
6695	6712	6687	6687	he	679	" Oh , good God ! Don t tell me it s some silliness of Paul s. "
6713	6719	6689	6689	his	679	" But you are Paul . "
6720	6725	6687	6687	he	679	" I m not . "
6726	6737	6689	6689	his	679	" Then why did you say so at the station ? "
6738	6746	6687	6687	he	679	" I said nothing of the sort . "
6747	6756	6689	6689	his	679	" I beg your pardon , you did . "
6757	6772	6687	6687	he	679	" I beg your pardon , I did not . My name is Charles . "
6773	6775	6689	6689	his	679	" Younger "
6818	6827	6840	6840	he	699	" Do you mean to tell me that Paul-- "
6864	6876	6840	6840	he	699	" Do you mean to tell me that Paul and your niece-- "
6906	6918	6919	6919	she	702	" Yes , they care for one another very much indeed , "
6922	6943	6919	6919	she	702	" I dare say they will tell you about it by - and - by . We heard this morning . "
6952	6963	6944	6945	And Charles	258	" The idiot , the idiot , the little fool ! "
6974	6989	6964	6965	Mrs. Munt	264	" If that is your attitude , Mr. Wilcox , I prefer to walk . "
6990	7024	6944	6945	And Charles	258	" I beg you will do no such thing . I take you up this moment to the house . Let me tell you the thing s impossible , and must be stopped . "
7055	7105	7051	7051	she	264	" I quite agree , sir . The thing is impossible , and I will come up and stop it . My niece is a very exceptional person , and I am not inclined to sit still while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her . "
7111	7133	7051	7051	she	264	" Considering she has only known your brother since Wednesday , and only met your father and mother at a stray hotel-- "
7134	7147	7108	7108	his	258	" Could you possibly lower your voice ? The shopman will overhear . "
7193	7197	7108	7108	his	258	" Right behind ? "
7198	7203	7108	7108	his	258	" Yes , sir . "
7215	7230	7108	7108	his	258	" I warn you : Paul hasn t a penny ; it s useless . "
7231	7277	7108	7108	his	258	" No need to warn us , Mr. Wilcox , I assure you . The warning is all the other way . My niece has been very foolish , and I shall give her a good scolding and take her back to London with me . "
7278	7349	7108	7108	his	258	" He has to make his way out in Nigeria . He couldn t think of marrying for years , and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the climate , and is in other ways -- Why hasn t he told us ? Of course he s ashamed . He knows he s been a fool . And so he has -- a downright fool . "
7354	7367	7108	7108	his	258	" Whereas Miss Schlegel has lost no time in publishing the news . "
7368	7425	7474	7474	his	258	" If I were a man , Mr. Wilcox , for that last remark I d box your ears . You re not fit to clean my niece s boots , to sit in the same room with her , and you dare -- you actually dare -- I decline to argue with such a person . "
7426	7449	7108	7108	his	258	" All I know is , she s spread the thing and he hasn t , and my father s away and I-- "
7450	7457	7474	7474	his	258	" And all that I know is-- "
7458	7467	7108	7108	his	258	" Might I finish my sentence , please ? "
7468	7471	7474	7474	his	258	" No . "
7622	7652	7738	7741	A very young man	721	" Aunt Juley , I have just had a telegram from Margaret ; I -- I meant to stop your coming . It isn t -- it s over . "
7667	7697	7662	7662	She	264	" Aunt Juley dear , don t. Don t let them know I ve been so silly . It wasn t anything . Do bear up for my sake . "
7698	7701	7703	7704	Charles Wilcox	258	" Paul , "
7711	7724	7662	7662	She	264	" Don t let them know . They are never to know . "
7725	7731	7662	7662	She	264	" Oh , my darling Helen-- "
7732	7737	7662	7662	She	264	" Paul ! Paul ! "
7748	7758	7738	7741	A very young man	721	" Paul , is there any truth in this ? "
7759	7767	7738	7741	A very young man	721	" I didn t -- I don t-- "
7768	7787	7738	7741	A very young man	721	" Yes or no , man ; plain question , plain answer . Did or didn t Miss Schlegel-- "
7788	7793	7738	7741	A very young man	721	" Charles , dear , "
7801	7820	7738	7741	A very young man	721	" Charles , dear Charles , one doesn t ask plain questions . There aren t such things . "
7963	7980	7982	7982	she	257	" Separate those human beings who will hurt each other most . The rest can wait . "
8010	8060	8007	8007	She	257	" Miss Schlegel , would you take your aunt up to your room or to my room , whichever you think best . Paul , do find Evie , and tell her lunch for six , but I m not sure whether we shall all be downstairs for it . "
8106	8109	8110	8110	he	735	" Mother , "
8113	8126	8110	8110	he	735	" are you aware that Paul has been playing the fool again ? "
8127	8142	8088	8088	him	735	" It is all right , dear . They have broken off the engagement . "
8143	8146	8110	8110	he	735	" Engagement-- ! "
8147	8163	8165	8166	Mrs. Wilcox	257	" They do not love any longer , if you prefer it put that way , "
8250	8260	8246	8246	she	264	" Thank goodness , poor Margaret is saved this ! "
8270	8281	8246	8246	she	264	" It had to be gone through by some one , "
8292	8309	8246	8246	she	264	" The one time I really did help Emily s girls was over the Wilcox business . "
8569	8583	8566	8566	Charles	258	" Why be so polite to servants ? they don t understand it , "
8593	8604	8607	8607	she	254	" If they don t understand it , I do . "
8620	8628	8629	8629	she	254	" I am swathed in ca nt , "
8632	8645	8629	8629	she	254	" and it is good for me to be stripped of it . "
8859	8877	8855	8855	him	256	" This girl would let you kiss her ; you might not have such a chance again . "
8880	8885	8855	8855	him	256	" how it happened , "
8974	8978	8954	8956	the insular cynic	761	" passing emotion , "
9140	9144	9137	9137	he	769	" I love you "
9182	9186	9188	9188	Margaret--	774	" I understand , "
9189	9215	9188	9188	Margaret--	774	" at least , I understand as much as ever is understood of these things . Tell me now what happened on the Monday morning . "
9216	9223	9161	9161	he	769	" It was over at once . "
9224	9229	9188	9188	Margaret--	774	" How , Helen ? "
9230	9286	9161	9161	he	769	" I was still happy while I dressed , but as I came downstairs I got nervous , and when I went into the dining - room I knew it was no good . There was Evie -- I can t explain -- managing the tea - urn , and Mr. Wilcox reading the Times . "
9287	9292	9188	9188	Margaret--	774	" Was Paul there ? "
9293	9312	9161	9161	he	769	" Yes ; and Charles was talking to him about stocks and shares , and he looked frightened . "
9343	9452	9334	9334	Helen	254	" Somehow , when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful . It is all right for us to be frightened , or for men of another sort -- father , for instance ; but for men like that ! When I saw all the others so placid , and Paul mad with terror in case I said the wrong thing , I felt for a moment that the whole Wilcox family was a fraud , just a wall of newspapers and motor - cars and golf - clubs , and that if it fell I should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness . "
9453	9473	9161	9161	he	769	" I don t think that . The Wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people , particularly the wife . "
9474	9853	9334	9334	Helen	254	" No , I don t really think that . But Paul was so broad - shouldered ; all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse , and I knew that it would never do -- never . I said to him after breakfast , when the others were practising strokes , We rather lost our heads , and he looked better at once , though frightfully ashamed . He began a speech about having no money to marry on , but it hurt him to make it , and I stopped him . Then he said , I must beg your pardon over this , Miss Schlegel ; I can t think what came over me last night . And I said , Nor what over me ; never mind . And then we parted -- at least , until I remembered that I had written straight off to tell you the night before , and that frightened him again . I asked him to send a telegram for me , for he knew you would be coming or something ; and he tried to get hold of the motor , but Charles and Mr. Wilcox wanted it to go to the station ; and Charles offered to send the telegram for me , and then I had to say that the telegram was of no consequence , for Paul said Charles might read it , and though I wrote it out several times , he always said people would suspect something . He took it himself at last , pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges , and , what with one thing and the other , it was not handed in at the post - office until too late . It was the most terrible morning . Paul disliked me more and more , and Evie talked cricket averages till I nearly screamed . I can not think how I stood her all the other days . At last Charles and his father started for the station , and then came your telegram warning me that Aunt Juley was coming by that train , and Paul -- oh , rather horrible -- said that I had muddled it . But Mrs. Wilcox knew . "
9854	9858	9161	9161	he	769	" Knew what ? "
9859	9882	9334	9334	Helen	254	" Everything ; though we neither of us told her a word , and she had known all along , I think . "
9883	9892	9161	9161	he	769	" Oh , she must have overheard you . "
9893	9942	9943	9943	She	776	" I suppose so , but it seemed wonderful . When Charles and Aunt Juley drove up , calling each other names , Mrs. Wilcox stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible . Ugh ! but it has been a disgusting business . To think that-- "
9946	9970	9972	9972	Margaret	255	" To think that because you and a young man meet for a moment , there must be all these telegrams and anger , "
9977	10096	9974	9974	Helen	254	" I ve often thought about it , Helen . It s one of the most interesting things in the world . The truth is that there is a great outer life that you and I have never touched -- a life in which telegrams and anger count . Personal relations , that we think supreme , are not supreme there . There love means marriage settlements , death , death duties . So far I m clear . But here my difficulty . This outer life , though obviously horrid ; often seems the real one -- there s grit in it . It does breed character . Do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end ? "
10097	10131	10229	10229	they	775	" Oh , Meg-- , that s what I felt , only not so clearly , when the Wilcoxes were so competent , and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes . "
10132	10140	9974	9974	Helen	254	" Don t you feel it now ? "
10141	10148	10150	10150	Helen	254	" I remember Paul at breakfast , "
10153	10183	10150	10150	Helen	254	" I shall never forget him . He had nothing to fall back upon . I know that personal relations are the real life , for ever and ever . "
10184	10187	9974	9974	Helen	254	" Amen ! "
10390	10398	10387	10387	They	775	" English to the back - bone , "
10416	10423	10413	10413	they	775	" Germans of the dreadful sort . "
10785	10798	10800	10804	a haughty and magnificent nephew	812	" Do you imply that we Germans are stupid , Uncle Ernst ? "
10810	10833	10806	10807	Uncle Ernst	281	" To my mind . You use the intellect , but you no longer care about it . That I call stupidity . "
10845	10884	10842	10842	he	281	" You only care about the things that you can use , and therefore arrange them in the following order : Money , supremely useful ; intellect , rather useful ; imagination , of no use at all . No"--for
10888	11067	10842	10842	he	281	protested--"your Pan - Germanism is no more imaginative than is our Imperialism over here . It is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness , to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile , and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven . That is not imagination . No , it kills it . When their poets over here try to celebrate bigness they are dead at once , and naturally . Your poets too are dying , your philosophers , your musicians , to whom Europe has listened for two hundred years . Gone . Gone with the little courts that nurtured them -- gone with Esterhazy and Weimar . What ? What s that ? Your universities ? Oh yes , you have learned men , who collect more facts than do the learned men of England . They collect facts , and facts , and empires of facts . But which of them will rekindle the light within ? "
11192	11195	11196	11196	she	255	" Papa , "
11204	11214	11196	11196	she	255	child--"why will they not discuss this most clear question ? "
11241	11276	11237	11237	Margaret	255	" To me one of two things is very clear ; either God does not know his own mind about England and Germany , or else these do not know the mind of God . "
11777	11784	11786	11787	Mrs. Munt	264	" Whom is Margaret talking to ? "
11827	11843	11809	11809	Helen	254	" Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in ? "
11844	11849	11850	11850	Helen	254	" I expect so , "
11882	11900	11809	11809	Helen	254	" You girls are so wonderful in always having -- Oh dear ! one mustn t talk . "
12018	12029	12031	12031	Helen	254	" How awful to marry a man like those Cupids ! "
12166	12169	12155	12155	Beethoven	284	" Heigho , "
12184	12186	12191	12193	the German contingent	863	" wunderschoning "
12210	12230	12204	12204	Helen	254	" Now comes the wonderful movement : first of all the goblins , and then a trio of elephants dancing "
12249	12256	12235	12236	the company	832	" On the what , dear ? "
12257	12265	12235	12236	the company	832	" On the drum , Aunt Juley . "
12266	12288	12290	12290	Helen	254	" No ; look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins and they come back , "
12896	12899	12901	12902	Mrs. Munt	264	" Margaret , "
12904	12910	12901	12902	Mrs. Munt	264	" is Helen all right ? "
12911	12915	12892	12892	she	254	" Oh yes . "
12916	12929	12931	12931	Tibby	259	" She is always going away in the middle of a programme , "
12933	12942	12944	12945	Fraulein Mosebach	285	" The music has evidently moved her deeply , "
12947	12951	12953	12953	Margaret	255	" Excuse me , "
12968	12981	12953	12956	Margaret s young man	895	" but that lady has , quite inadvertently , taken my umbrella . "
12982	12998	12931	12931	Tibby	259	" Oh , good gracious me!--I am so sorry . Tibby , run after Helen . "
12999	13011	12953	12956	Margaret s young man	895	" I shall miss the Four Serious Songs if I do . "
13012	13021	12931	12931	Tibby	259	" Tibby , love , you must go . "
13022	13030	13032	13034	the young man	679	" It isn t of any consequence , "
13045	13056	12931	12931	Tibby	259	" But of course it is . Tibby ! Tibby ! "
13101	13104	13144	13146	the young man	679	" too late "
13126	13133	13135	13135	Margaret	255	" My sister is so careless , "
13137	13142	13144	13146	the young man	679	" Not at all , "
13156	13164	13149	13149	his	679	" If you would give me your address-- "
13165	13176	13178	13178	he	679	" Oh , not at all , not at all ; "
13328	13365	13320	13320	she	255	" That is where we live ; if you preferred , you could call for the umbrella after the concert , but I didn t like to trouble you when it has all been our fault . "
13422	13435	13417	13417	he	289	" It s a fine programme this afternoon , is it not ? "
13453	13459	13461	13461	Margaret	255	" The Beethoven s fine , "
13473	13502	13461	13461	Margaret	255	" I don t like the Brahms , though , nor the Mendelssohn that came first and ugh ! I don t like this Elgar that s coming . "
13503	13508	13510	13511	Herr Liesecke	288	" What , what ? "
13515	13525	13510	13511	Herr Liesecke	288	" The Pomp and Circumstance will not be fine ? "
13526	13535	13537	13538	her aunt	546	" Oh , Margaret , you tiresome girl ! "
13540	13589	13461	13461	Margaret	255	" Here have I been persuading Herr Liesecke to stop for Pomp and Circumstance , and you are undoing all my work . I am so anxious for him to hear what WE are doing in music . Oh,--you musn t run down our English composers , Margaret . "
13590	13603	13605	13606	Fraulein Mosebach	285	" For my part , I have heard the composition at Stettin , "
13608	13620	13605	13606	Fraulein Mosebach	285	" on two occasions . It is dramatic , a little . "
13621	13660	13667	13668	each other	3998	" Frieda , you despise English music . You know you do . And English art . And English literature , except Shakespeare , and he s a German . Very well , Frieda , you may go . "
13684	13689	13676	13676	they	705	" Pomp and Circumstance . "
13690	13705	13707	13708	Herr Liesecke	288	" We have this call to pay in Finsbury Circus , it is true , "
13725	13727	13731	13732	Aunt Juley	263	" Margaret-- "
13734	13753	13778	13778	her	287	" Margaret , Margaret ! Fraulein Mosebach has left her beautiful little bag behind her on the seat . "
13781	13798	13778	13778	her	287	" Oh , what a bother -- what a family we are ! Fr -- frieda ! "
13799	13802	13804	13809	all those who thought the music	914	" Hush ! "
13812	13824	13778	13778	her	287	" But it s the number they want in Finsbury Circus . "
13825	13832	13834	13837	the suspicious young man	915	" Might I -- couldn t I-- "
13844	13853	13778	13778	her	287	" Oh , I would be so grateful . "
13943	13945	13939	13939	he	915	" had "

14039	14065	14066	14066	he	915	" We live quite near ; I am going there now . Could you walk round with me , and we ll find your umbrella ? "
14069	14073	14066	14066	he	915	" Thank you , "
14162	14170	14171	14171	she	255	" How tired one gets after music ! "
14174	14186	14127	14127	him	915	" Do you find the atmosphere of Queen s Hall oppressive ? "
14187	14192	14127	14127	him	915	" Yes , horribly . "
14193	14206	14127	14127	him	915	" But surely the atmosphere of Covent Garden is even more oppressive . "
14207	14214	14127	14127	him	915	" Do you go there much ? "
14215	14230	14127	14127	him	915	" When my work permits , I attend the gallery for the Royal Opera . "
14236	14245	14231	14231	Helen	254	" So do I. I love the gallery , "
14270	14275	14263	14263	Margaret	255	" drawing people out , "
14277	14282	14283	14283	She	255	" making things go . "

14395	14464	14383	14384	Mrs. Munt	264	" I do in a WAY remember the passage , Tibby , but when every instrument is so beautiful , it is difficult to pick out one thing rather than another . I am sure that you and Helen take me to the very nicest concerts . Not a dull note from beginning to end . I only wish that our German friends had stayed till it finished . "
14465	14484	14486	14486	Tibby	259	" But surely you haven t forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low C , Aunt Juley ? "
14490	14499	14486	14486	Tibby	259	" No one could . It s unmistakable . "
14500	14506	14508	14509	Mrs. Munt	264	" A specially loud part ? "
14511	14523	14524	14524	she	264	" Of course I do not go in for being musical , "
14531	14684	14524	14524	she	264	" I only care for music -- a very different thing . But still I will say this for myself -- I do know when I like a thing and when I don t. Some people are the same about pictures . They can go into a picture gallery -- Miss Conder can -- and say straight off what they feel , all round the wall . I never could do that . But music is so different from pictures , to my mind . When it comes to music I am as safe as houses , and I assure you , Tibby , I am by no means pleased by everything . There was a thing -- something about a faun in French -- which Helen went into ecstasies over , but I thought it most tinkling and superficial , and said so , and I held to my opinion too . "
14685	14690	14692	14692	Margaret	255	" Do you agree ? "
14694	14705	14692	14692	Margaret	255	" Do you think music is so different from pictures ? "
14706	14718	14719	14719	he	930	" I -- I should have thought so , kind of , "
14722	14756	14761	14761	she	255	" So should I. Now , my sister declares they re just the same . We have great arguments over it . She says I m dense ; I say she s sloppy . "
14764	14886	14761	14761	she	255	" Now , doesn t it seem absurd to you ? What is the good of the Arts if they re interchangeable ? What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye ? Helen s one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting , and pictures into the language of music . It s very ingenious , and she says several pretty things in the process , but what s gained , I d like to know ? Oh , it s all rubbish , radically false . If Monet s really Debussy , and Debussy s really Monet , neither gentleman is worth his salt -- that s my opinion . "
14892	14988	14989	14991	An unhappy family	932	" Now , this very symphony that we ve just been having -- she won t let it alone . She labels it with meanings from start to finish ; turns it into literature . I wonder if the day will ever return when music will be treated as music . Yet I don t know . There s my brother -- behind us . He treats music as music , and oh , my goodness ! He makes me angrier than any one , simply furious . With him I daren t even argue . "
14996	15128	15134	15136	the young man	679	" But , of course , the real villain is Wagner . He has done more than any man in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of the arts . I do feel that music is in a very serious state just now , though extraordinarily interesting . Every now and then in history there do come these terrible geniuses , like Wagner , who stir up all the wells of thought at once . For a moment it s splendid . Such a splash as never was . But afterwards -- such a lot of mud ; and the wells -- as it were , they communicate with each other too easily now , and not one of them will run quite clear . That s what Wagner s done . "
15264	15267	15268	15268	he	679	" tell , "
15303	15313	15314	15314	he	679	" I suppose my umbrella will be all right , "
15318	15343	15314	15314	he	679	" I don t really mind about it . I will think about music instead . I suppose my umbrella will be all right . "
15371	15381	15367	15367	he	679	" Shall I try to do without a programme ? "
15435	15449	15428	15428	Margaret	255	" Don t you think so ? don t you feel the same ? "
15458	15465	15452	15452	she	255	" Oh , do interrupt me ! "
15547	15578	15542	15542	she	255	" I do hope that you ll come in and have some tea . We should be so glad . I have dragged you so far out of your way . "
15681	15688	15667	15667	she	255	" Helen ! Let us in ! "
15689	15693	15667	15667	she	255	" All right , "
15698	15708	15667	15667	she	255	" You ve been taking this gentleman s umbrella . "
15709	15714	15716	15716	Helen	254	" Taken a what ? "
15722	15738	15716	15716	Helen	254	" Oh , what s that ? Do come in ! How do you do ? "
15739	15773	15667	15667	she	255	" Helen , you must not be so ramshackly . You took this gentleman s umbrella away from Queen s Hall , and he has had the trouble of coming round for it . "
15774	15782	15784	15784	Helen	254	" Oh , I am so sorry ! "
15815	15857	15806	15806	herself	254	" I do nothing but steal umbrellas . I am so very sorry ! Do come in and choose one . Is yours a hooky or a nobbly ? Mine s a nobbly -- at least , I THINK it is . "
15889	15990	15991	15991	She	254	" Don t you talk , Meg ! You stole an old gentleman s silk top - hat . Yes , she did , Aunt Juley . It is a positive fact . She thought it was a muff . Oh , heavens ! I ve knocked the In - and - Out card down . Where s Frieda ? Tibby , why don t you ever -- No , I can t remember what I was going to say . That wasn t it , but do tell the maids to hurry tea up . What about this umbrella ? "
15995	16017	15991	15991	She	254	" No , it s all gone along the seams . It s an appalling umbrella . It must be mine . "
16048	16054	16056	16056	Margaret	255	" But if you will stop-- "
16058	16069	16056	16056	Margaret	255	" Now , Helen , how stupid you ve been ! "
16070	16076	15991	15991	She	254	" Whatever have I done ? "
16077	16130	16132	16132	Helen	254	" Don t you see that you ve frightened him away ? I meant him to stop to tea . You oughtn t to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella . I saw his nice eyes getting so miserable . No , it s not a bit of good now . "
16142	16148	16132	16132	Helen	254	" Oh , do stop ! "
16149	16160	16162	16163	Mrs. Munt	264	" I dare say it is all for the best , "
16165	16189	16162	16163	Mrs. Munt	264	" We know nothing about the young man , Margaret , and your drawing - room is full of very tempting little things . "
16194	16247	16191	16191	Helen	254	" Aunt Juley , how can you ! You make me more and more ashamed . I d rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that I -- Well , I must shut the front - door , I suppose . One more failure for Helen . "
16248	16262	16264	16264	Margaret	255	" Yes , I think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent , "
16277	16355	16274	16274	she	255	" You remember rent ? It was one of father s words -- Rent to the ideal , to his own faith in human nature . You remember how he would trust strangers , and if they fooled him he would say , It s better to be fooled than to be suspicious --that the confidence trick is the work of man , but the want - of - confidence trick is the work of the devil . "
16356	16365	16367	16368	Mrs. Munt	264	" I remember something of the sort now , "
16379	16392	16374	16374	she	264	" It was lucky that your father married a wife with money . "
16404	16418	16399	16399	she	264	" Why , he might have stolen the little Ricketts picture as well . "
16419	16425	16427	16427	Helen	254	" Better that he had , "
16430	16439	16441	16441	Margaret	255	" No , I agree with Aunt Juley , "
16443	16459	16441	16441	Margaret	255	" I d rather mistrust people than lose my little Ricketts . There are limits . "
16533	16540	16542	16542	Helen	254	" All right , Auntie Tibby , "
16552	16585	16545	16545	Margaret	255	" In a way , I wish we had a real boy in the house -- the kind of boy who cares for men . It would make entertaining so much easier . "
16586	16591	16593	16594	her sister	544	" So do I , "
16596	16606	16612	16612	she	255	" Tibby only cares for cultured females singing Brahms . "
16617	16664	16612	16612	she	255	" Why didn t you make that young man welcome , Tibby ? You must do the host a little , you know . You ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping , instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women . "
16679	16695	16612	16612	she	255	" Oh , it s no good looking superior . I mean what I say . "
16696	16701	16703	16703	Margaret	255	" Leave Tibby alone ! "
16715	16726	16728	16728	Helen	254	" Here s the house a regular hen - coop ! "
16730	16736	16738	16739	Mrs. Munt	264	" Oh , my dear ! "
16741	16774	16738	16739	Mrs. Munt	264	" How can you say such dreadful things ! The number of men you get here has always astonished me . If there is any danger it s the other way round . "
16775	16790	16709	16710	her brother	576	" Yes , but it s the wrong sort of men , Helen means . "
16791	16798	16800	16800	Helen	254	" No , I don t , "
16802	16845	16800	16800	Helen	254	" We get the right sort of man , but the wrong side of him , and I say that s Tibby s fault . There ought to be a something about the house -- an -- I don t know what . "
16846	16856	16709	16710	her brother	576	" A touch of the W s , perhaps ? "
16863	16870	16872	16872	Tibby	259	" Who are the W s ? "
16874	16896	16709	16710	her brother	576	" The W s are things I and Meg and Aunt Juley know about and you don t , so there ! "
16897	16907	16909	16909	Margaret	255	" I suppose that ours is a female house , "
16911	17103	16909	16909	Margaret	255	" and one must just accept it . No , Aunt Juley , I don t mean that this house is full of women . I am trying to say something much more clever . I mean that it was irrevocably feminine , even in father s time . Now I m sure you understand ! Well , I ll give you another example . It ll shock you , but I don t care . Suppose Queen Victoria gave a dinner - party , and that the guests had been Leighton , Millais , Swinburne , Rossetti , Meredith , Fitzgerald , etc . Do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic ? Heavens , no ! The very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that . So with our house -- it must be feminine , and all we can do is to see that it isn t effeminate . Just as another house that I can mention , but won t , sounded irrevocably masculine , and all its inmates can do is to see that it isn t brutal . "
17104	17116	17118	17118	Tibby	259	" That house being the W s house , I presume , "
17120	17136	17137	17137	Helen	254	" You re not going to be told about the W s , my child , "
17140	17185	17137	17137	Helen	254	" so don t you think it . And on the other hand , I don t the least mind if you find out , so don t you think you ve done anything clever , in either case . Give me a cigarette . "
17186	17196	17198	17198	Margaret	255	" You do what you can for the house , "
17200	17209	17198	17198	Margaret	255	" The drawing - room reeks of smoke . "
17210	17268	17309	17309	Margaret	255	" If you smoked too , the house might suddenly turn masculine . Atmosphere is probably a question of touch and go . Even at Queen Victoria s dinner - party -- if something had been just a little Different -- perhaps if she d worn a clinging Liberty tea - gown instead of a magenta satin . "
17269	17277	17198	17198	Margaret	255	" With an India shawl over her shoulders-- "
17278	17289	17309	17309	Margaret	255	" Fastened at the bosom with a Cairngorm - pin . "
17313	17327	17309	17309	Margaret	255	" How inconceivable it would be if the Royal Family cared about Art . "
17401	17450	17370	17370	them	963	" That reminds me , Margaret . We might have taken that young man into the dining - room , at all events . Only the majolica plate -- and that is so firmly set in the wall . I am really distressed that he had no tea . "
17770	17788	17791	17791	he	662	" All men are equal -- all men , that is to say , who possess umbrellas , "
17952	17958	17949	17950	a fool	3951	" Evening , Mr. Bast . "
17959	17965	17949	17950	a fool	3951	" Evening , Mr. Dealtry . "
17966	17970	17949	17950	a fool	3951	" Nice evening . "
17971	17974	17949	17950	a fool	3951	" Evening . "
18316	18322	18368	18369	Mr. Cunningham	315	" Evening , Mr. Bast . "
18323	18329	18387	18387	him	315	" Evening , Mr. Cunningham . "
18330	18344	18368	18369	Mr. Cunningham	315	" Very serious thing this decline of the birth - rate in Manchester . "
18345	18351	18387	18387	him	315	" I beg your pardon ? "
18352	18366	18368	18369	Mr. Cunningham	315	" Very serious thing this decline of the birth - rate in Manchester , "
18389	18394	18396	18396	Leonard	311	" Ah , yes , "
18414	18432	18387	18387	him	315	" If this kind of thing goes on the population of England will be stationary in 1960 . "
18433	18440	18504	18505	other men	1018	" You don t say so . "
18441	18452	18387	18387	him	315	" I call it a very serious thing , eh ? "
18453	18461	18504	18505	other men	1018	" Good - evening , Mr. Cunningham . "
18462	18470	18387	18387	him	315	" Good - evening , Mr. Bast . "
18518	18521	18510	18510	He	311	" Hullo ! "
18535	18538	18539	18539	he	311	" Hullo ! "
18980	18987	18988	18988	he	311	" Damn , damn , damnation ! "
19015	19021	19005	19005	he	311	" Oh , damn it all-- "
19082	19090	19060	19060	he	311	" Seven miles to the north of Venice-- "
19119	19176	19108	19110	The rich man	1034	" Seven miles to the north of Venice the banks of sand which nearer the city rise little above low - water mark attain by degrees a higher level , and knit themselves at last into fields of salt morass , raised here and there into shapeless mounds , and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea . "
19210	19248	19108	19110	The rich man	1034	" Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession , and first ( for of the shafts enough has been said already ) , what is very peculiar to this church -- its luminousness . "
19297	19337	19340	19340	him	311	" Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession , and first ( for of the absence of ventilation enough has been said already ) , what is very peculiar to this flat -- its obscurity . "
19364	19374	19380	19380	him	311	" My flat is dark as well as stuffy . "
19563	19567	19649	19649	he	311	" bit of luck "
19577	19641	19642	19642	Leonard	311	" If only I had a bit of luck , the whole thing would come straight ... He s got a most magnificent place down at Streatham and a 20 h.p . Fiat , but then , mind you , he s had luck ... I m sorry the wife s so late , but she never has any luck over catching trains . "
20020	20024	20026	20026	Leonard	311	" What ho ! "
20051	20055	20043	20043	Jacky	318	" What ho ! "
20056	20060	20061	20061	he	318	" Been out ? "
20082	20085	20078	20079	the lady	1050	" No , "
20088	20096	20078	20079	the lady	1050	" Oh , I am so tired . "
20097	20101	20043	20043	Jacky	318	" You tired ? "
20102	20105	20078	20079	the lady	1050	" Eh ? "
20106	20111	20113	20113	he	318	" I m tired , "
20120	20130	20078	20079	the lady	1050	" Oh , Len , I am so tired . "
20131	20144	20146	20146	Leonard	311	" I ve been to that classical concert I told you about , "
20148	20153	20078	20079	the lady	1050	" What s that ? "
20154	20165	20078	20079	the lady	1050	" I came back as soon as it was over . "
20166	20175	20177	20177	Jacky	318	" Any one been round to our place ? "
20179	20199	20078	20079	the lady	1050	" Not that I ve seen . I met Mr. Cunningham outside , and we passed a few remarks . "
20200	20207	20078	20079	the lady	1050	" What , not Mr. Cunningham ? "
20208	20211	20078	20079	the lady	1050	" Yes . "
20212	20220	20078	20079	the lady	1050	" Oh , you mean Mr. Cunningham . "
20221	20227	20078	20079	the lady	1050	" Yes . Mr. Cunningham . "
20228	20240	20078	20079	the lady	1050	" I ve been out to tea at a lady friend s. "
20307	20326	20305	20305	she	1051	" On the shelf , On the shelf , Boys , boys , I m on the shelf , "
20406	20415	20403	20403	she	1051	" Is that a book you re reading ? "
20420	20426	20417	20417	he	311	" That s a book , "
20452	20455	20449	20449	he	311	" Bookmarker . "
20456	20458	20417	20417	he	311	" Len-- "
20459	20464	20465	20465	he	311	" What is it ? "
20487	20493	20449	20449	he	311	" You do love me ? "
20494	20510	20449	20449	he	311	" Jacky , you know that I do . How can you ask such questions ! "
20511	20524	20449	20449	he	311	" But you do love me , Len , don t you ? "
20525	20531	20449	20449	he	311	" Of course I do . "
20542	20544	20449	20449	he	311	" Len-- "
20545	20552	20449	20449	he	311	" Well ? What is it ? "
20553	20563	20449	20449	he	311	" Len , you will make it all right ? "
20564	20575	20577	20578	the boy	662	" I can t have you ask me that again , "
20587	20699	20577	20578	the boy	662	" I ve promised to marry you when I m of age , and that s enough . My word s my word . I ve promised to marry you as soon as ever I m twenty - one , and I can t keep on being worried . I ve worries enough . It isn t likely I d throw you over , let alone my word , when I ve spent all this money . Besides , I m an Englishman , and I never go back on my word . Jacky , do be reasonable . Of course I ll marry you . Only do stop badgering me . "
20700	20708	20449	20449	he	311	" When s your birthday , Len ? "
20709	20741	20577	20578	the boy	662	" I ve told you again and again , the eleventh of November next . Now get off my knee a bit ; some one must get supper , I suppose . "
20827	20922	20923	20923	He	311	" It really is too bad when a fellow isn t trusted . It makes one feel so wild , when I ve pretended to the people here that you re my wife -- all right , all right , you SHALL be my wife -- and I ve bought you the ring to wear , and I ve taken this flat furnished , and it s far more than I can afford , and yet you aren t content , and I ve also not told the truth when I ve written home . "
20928	20934	20947	20947	he	311	" He d stop it . "
20950	20966	20947	20947	he	311	" My brother d stop it . I m going against the whole world , Jacky .
20967	21042	21142	21142	she	1063	" That s what I am , Jacky . I don t take any heed of what any one says . I just go straight forward , I do . That s always been my way . I m not one of your weak knock - kneed chaps . If a woman s in trouble , I don t leave her in the lurch . That s not my street . No , thank you .
21043	21123	20947	20947	he	311	" I ll tell you another thing too . I care a good deal about improving myself by means of Literature and Art , and so getting a wider outlook . For instance , when you came in I was reading Ruskin s Stones of Venice . I don t say this to boast , but just to show you the kind of man I am . I can tell you , I enjoyed that classical concert this afternoon . "
21150	21161	21142	21142	she	1063	" But you do love me , don t you ? "
21296	21298	21295	21295	her	1063	" likeness "
21372	21383	21358	21367	the family in the flat on the ground - floor	1069	" Hark , my soul , it is the Lord . "
21384	21393	21395	21395	Leonard	311	" That tune fairly gives me the hump , "
21416	21435	21395	21395	Leonard	311	" No ; I ll play you something lovely . Get up , dear , for a minute . "
21663	21666	21686	21686	she	1082	" Len ? "
21667	21672	21673	21673	he	662	" You in bed ? "
21680	21684	21686	21686	she	1082	" All right . "
21691	21702	21703	21703	he	662	" I must clean my boots ready for the morning , "
21712	21722	21686	21686	she	1082	" I rather want to get this chapter done . "
21723	21726	21709	21709	him	662	" What ? "
21734	21739	21709	21709	him	662	" What s that ? "
21740	21754	21774	21774	him	662	" All right , Jacky , nothing ; I m reading a book . "
21755	21758	21709	21709	him	662	" What ? "
21759	21762	21763	21763	he	662	" What ? "
21837	21842	21844	21845	her aunt	546	" Oh , Margaret , "
21849	21865	21844	21845	her aunt	546	" such a most unfortunate thing has happened . I could not get you alone . "
21893	21909	21844	21845	her aunt	546	" coming up , no doubt , in the hope of getting into London society . "
22048	22065	22067	22067	they	1096	" What ! a hundred and twenty for a basement ? You ll never get it ! "
22071	22079	22067	22067	they	1096	" One can but try , madam . "
22145	22158	22159	22159	she	255	" Oh , but Helen isn t a girl with no interests , "
22162	22203	22159	22159	she	255	" She has plenty of other things and other people to think about . She made a false start with the Wilcoxes , and she ll be as willing as we are to have nothing more to do with them . "
22204	22255	22141	22141	Helen	254	" For a clever girl , dear , how very oddly you do talk . Helen ll HAVE to have something more to do with them , now that they re all opposite . She may meet that Paul in the street . She can not very well not bow . "
22256	22391	22159	22159	she	255	" Of course she must bow . But look here ; let s do the flowers . I was going to say , the will to be interested in him has died , and what else matters ? I look on that disastrous episode ( over which you were so kind ) as the killing of a nerve in Helen . It s dead , and she ll never be troubled with it again . The only things that matter are the things that interest one . Bowing , even calling and leaving cards , even a dinner - party -- we can do all those things to the Wilcoxes , if they find it agreeable ; but the other thing , the one important thing -- never again . Don t you see ? "
22422	22489	22159	22159	she	255	" I also have the honour to inform you that the Wilcoxes are bored with us . I didn t tell you at the time -- it might have made you angry , and you had enough to worry you -- but I wrote a letter to Mrs. W , and apologised for the trouble that Helen had given them . She didn t answer it . "
22490	22495	22561	22561	she	264	" How very rude ! "
22496	22505	22159	22159	she	255	" I wonder . Or was it sensible ? "
22506	22514	22561	22561	she	264	" No , Margaret , most rude . "
22515	22526	22159	22159	she	255	" In either case one can class it as reassuring . "
22625	22636	22637	22637	she	264	" But you will be careful , won t you ? "
22640	22648	22612	22612	his	258	" Oh , certainly . Fiendishly careful . "
22649	22658	22612	22612	his	258	" And Helen must be careful , too . "
22659	22664	22666	22666	Helen	254	" Careful over what ? "
22679	22681	22683	22683	Margaret	255	" Nothing "
22691	22699	22612	22612	his	258	" Careful over what , Aunt Juley ? "
22707	22753	22700	22701	Mrs. Munt	264	" It is only that a certain family , whom we know by name but do not mention , as you said yourself last night after the concert , have taken the flat opposite from the Mathesons -- where the plants are in the balcony . "
22777	22792	22774	22774	she	264	" What , Helen , you don t mind them coming , do you ? "
22800	22808	22810	22810	Helen	254	" Of course I don t mind , "
22815	22841	22810	22810	Helen	254	" It is that you and Meg are both so absurdly grave about it , when there s nothing to be grave about at all . "
22842	22848	22850	22850	Margaret	255	" I m not grave , "
22859	22872	22810	22810	Helen	254	" Well , you look grave ; doesn t she , Frieda ? "
22873	22896	22810	22810	Helen	254	" I don t feel grave , that s all I can say ; you re going quite on the wrong tack . "
22897	22906	22908	22909	Mrs. Munt	264	" No , she does not feel grave , "
22911	22921	22908	22909	Mrs. Munt	264	" I can bear witness to that . She disagrees-- "
22922	22925	22927	22928	Fraulein Mosebach	285	" Hark ! "
22930	22938	22927	22928	Fraulein Mosebach	285	" I hear Bruno entering the hall . "
23034	23066	23026	23026	she	287	" Did you say the Mathesons flat , Aunt Juley ? How wonderful you are ! I never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was Matheson . "
23067	23072	23074	23075	her cousin	860	" Come , Helen , "
23077	23082	23084	23085	her aunt	546	" Go , Helen , "
23097	23108	23084	23085	her aunt	546	" Helen can not deceive me . She does mind . "
23109	23114	23116	23116	Margaret	255	" Oh , hush ! "
23118	23131	23116	23116	Margaret	255	" Frieda ll hear you , and she can be so tiresome . "
23132	23136	23138	23139	Mrs. Munt	264	" She minds , "
23157	23296	23084	23085	her aunt	546	" I knew she d mind -- and I m sure a girl ought to ! Such an experience ! Such awful coarse - grained people ! I know more about them than you do , which you forget , and if Charles had taken you that motor drive -- well , you d have reached the house a perfect wreck . Oh , Margaret , you don t know what you are in for ! They re all bottled up against the drawing - room window . There s Mrs. Wilcox -- I ve seen her . There s Paul . There s Evie , who is a minx . There s Charles -- I saw him to start with . And who would an elderly man with a moustache and a copper - coloured face be ? "
23297	23303	23385	23385	her	264	" Mr. Wilcox , possibly . "
23304	23315	23084	23085	her aunt	546	" I knew it . And there s Mr. Wilcox . "
23316	23328	23330	23330	Margaret	255	" It s a shame to call his face copper colour , "
23332	23346	23330	23330	Margaret	255	" He has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age . "
23387	23417	23373	23374	her nieces	565	" Helen did not take the news quite as I expected , but the Wilcox nerve is dead in her really , so there s no need for plans . "
23418	23427	23385	23385	her	264	" It s as well to be prepared . "
23428	23440	23373	23374	her nieces	565	" No -- it s as well not to be prepared . "
23441	23444	23385	23385	her	264	" Why ? "
23445	23447	23373	23374	her nieces	565	" Because-- "
23527	23535	23537	23537	her	264	" Because I d sooner risk it , "
23541	23547	23549	23550	her aunt	546	" But imagine the evenings , "
23564	23666	23549	23550	her aunt	546	" Turn the electric light on here or there , and it s almost the same room . One evening they may forget to draw their blinds down , and you ll see them ; and the next , you yours , and they ll see you . Impossible to sit out on the balconies . Impossible to water the plants , or even speak . Imagine going out of the front - door , and they come out opposite at the same moment . And yet you tell me that plans are unnecessary , and you d rather risk it . "
23667	23677	23775	23778	those that are portable	1113	" I hope to risk things all my life . "
23678	23686	23549	23550	her aunt	546	" Oh , Margaret , most dangerous . "
23687	23692	23693	23693	she	546	" But after all , "
23699	23713	23693	23693	she	546	" there s never any great risk as long as you have money . "
23714	23724	23775	23778	those that are portable	1113	" Oh , shame ! What a shocking speech ! "
23725	23733	23735	23736	Miss Schlegel	254	" Money pads the edges of things , "
23738	23746	23735	23736	Miss Schlegel	254	" God help those who have none . "
23747	23755	23757	23758	Mrs. Munt	264	" But this is something quite new ! "
23780	23886	23775	23778	those that are portable	1113	" New for me ; sensible people have acknowledged it for years . You and I and the Wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands . It is so firm beneath our feet that we forget its very existence . It s only when we see some one near us tottering that we realise all that an independent income means . Last night , when we were talking up here round the fire , I began to think that the very soul of the world is economic , and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of love , but the absence of coin . "
23887	23894	23775	23778	those that are portable	1113	" I call that rather cynical . "
23895	24000	23775	23778	those that are portable	1113	" So do I. But Helen and I , we ought to remember , when we are tempted to criticise others , that we are standing on these islands , and that most of the others are down below the surface of the sea . The poor can not always reach those whom they want to love , and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer . We rich can . Imagine the tragedy last June , if Helen and Paul Wilcox had been poor people , and couldn t invoke railways and motor - cars to part them . "
24001	24008	24010	24011	Mrs. Munt	264	" That s more like Socialism , "
24014	24179	23775	23778	those that are portable	1113	" Call it what you like . I call it going through life with one s hand spread open on the table . I m tired of these rich people who pretend to be poor , and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their feet above the waves . I stand each year upon six hundred pounds , and Helen upon the same , and Tibby will stand upon eight , and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed -- from the sea , yes , from the sea . And all our thoughts are the thoughts of six - hundred - pounders , and all our speeches ; and because we don t want to steal umbrellas ourselves , we forget that below the sea people do want to steal them and do steal them sometimes , and that what s a joke up here is down there reality . "
24180	24201	24455	24455	their	1114	" There they go -- there goes Fraulein Mosebach . Really , for a German she does dress charmingly . Oh!-- "
24202	24207	23775	23778	those that are portable	1113	" What is it ? "
24208	24218	24455	24455	their	1114	" Helen was looking up at the Wilcoxes flat . "
24219	24225	23775	23778	those that are portable	1113	" Why shouldn t she ? "
24226	24245	24455	24455	their	1114	" I beg your pardon , I interrupted you . What was it you were saying about reality ? "
24246	24257	24259	24259	Margaret	255	" I had worked round to myself , as usual , "
24267	24287	24330	24330	her	264	" Do tell me this , at all events . Are you for the rich or for the poor ? "
24288	24311	24330	24330	her	264	" Too difficult . Ask me another . Am I for poverty or for riches ? For riches . Hurrah for riches ! "
24312	24316	24318	24319	Mrs. Munt	264	" For riches ! "
24333	24343	24330	24330	her	264	" Yes . For riches . Money for ever ! "
24344	24374	24330	24330	her	264	" So am I , and so , I am afraid , are most of my acquaintances at Swanage , but I am surprised that you agree with us . "
24375	24396	24330	24330	her	264	" Thank you so much , Aunt Juley . While I have talked theories , you have done the flowers . "
24397	24417	24330	24330	her	264	" Not at all , dear . I wish you would let me help you in more important things . "
24418	24453	24330	24330	her	264	" Well , would you be very kind ? Would you come round with me to the registry office ? There s a housemaid who won t say yes but doesn t say no . "
24473	24478	24467	24467	Evie	262	" staring most rudely , "
24556	24568	24543	24543	Frieda	287	" You love one of the young gentlemen opposite , yes ? "
24595	24604	24543	24543	Frieda	287	" England and Germany are bound to fight , "
24768	24771	24775	24783	genuine housemaids on the ground of her numerous stairs	1124	" temporary , "
24828	24841	24805	24805	she	254	" Helen , you must tell me whether this thing worries you . "
24842	24846	24848	24848	Helen	254	" If what ? "
24858	24863	24805	24805	she	254	" The Ws coming . "
24864	24871	24805	24805	she	254	" No , of course not . "
24872	24875	24805	24805	she	254	" Really ? "
24876	24879	24805	24805	she	254	" Really . "
24922	24950	24895	24895	she	254	" I shan t mind if Paul points at our house and says , There lives the girl who tried to catch me . But she might . "
24951	24994	24895	24895	she	254	" If even that worries you , we could arrange something . There s no reason we should be near people who displease us or whom we displease , thanks to our money . We might even go away for a little . "
24995	25050	24895	24895	she	254	" Well , I am going away . Frieda s just asked me to Stettin , and I shan t be back till after the New Year . Will that do ? Or must I fly the country altogether ? Really , Meg , what has come over you to make such a fuss ? "
25051	25088	25090	25090	her	1129	" Oh , I m getting an old maid , I suppose . I thought I minded nothing , but really I -- I should be bored if you fell in love with the same man twice and"--she
25091	25116	24895	24895	she	254	throat--"you did go red , you know , when Aunt Juley attacked you this morning . I shouldn t have referred to it otherwise . "
25318	25321	25323	25324	Fraulein Mosebach	285	" Helen ! "
25336	25342	25329	25329	she	285	confidence)--"his mother has forgiven you ! "
25382	25388	25390	25390	Margaret	255	" Bother the whole family ! "
25392	25416	25390	25390	Margaret	255	" Helen , stop giggling and pirouetting , and go and finish your packing . Why can t the woman leave us alone ? "
25417	25429	25430	25430	Helen	254	" I don t know what I shall do with Meg , "
25438	25479	25430	25430	Helen	254	" She s got Wilcox and Box upon the brain . Meg , Meg , I don t love the young gentleman ; I don t love the young gentleman , Meg , Meg . Can a body speak plainer ? "
25480	25488	25490	25491	Fraulein Mosebach	285	" Most certainly her love has died , "
25493	25519	25430	25430	Helen	254	" Most certainly it has , Frieda , but that will not prevent me from being bored with the Wilcoxes if I return the call . "
25539	25573	25526	25527	Fraulein Mosebach	285	" Oh , boo hoo ! boo hoo hoo ! Meg s going to return the call , and I can t. Cos why ? Cos I m going to German - eye . "
25574	25601	25645	25646	A male	1140	" If you are going to Germany , go and pack ; if you aren t , go and call on the Wilcoxes instead of me . "
25602	25644	25526	25527	Fraulein Mosebach	285	" But , Meg , Meg , I don t love the young gentleman ; I don t love the young -- O lud , who s that coming down the stairs ? I vow tis my brother . O crimini ! "
25715	25719	25711	25711	she	254	" the Wilcox ideal "
25823	25845	25807	25808	Fraulein Mosebach	285	" It is all right -- she does not love the young man -- he has not been worthy of her . "
25846	25856	25887	25887	him	259	" Yes , I know ; thanks very much . "
25857	25867	25807	25808	Fraulein Mosebach	285	" I thought I did right to tell you . "
25868	25874	25887	25887	him	259	" Ever so many thanks . "
25875	25880	25882	25882	Tibby	259	" What s that ? "
26095	26101	26051	26051	she	255	" DEAR MRS . WILCOX , "
26102	26198	26051	26051	she	255	" I have to write something discourteous . It would be better if we did not meet . Both my sister and my aunt have given displeasure to your family , and , in my sister s case , the grounds for displeasure might recur . So far as I know she no longer occupies her thoughts with your son . But it would not be fair , either to her or to you , if they met , and it is therefore right that our acquaintance , which began so pleasantly , should end . "
26199	26278	26372	26373	the youth	889	" I fear that you will not agree with this ; indeed , I know that you will not , since you have been good enough to call on us . It is only an instinct on my part , and no doubt the instinct is wrong . My sister would , undoubtedly , say that it is wrong . I write without her knowledge , and I hope that you will not associate her with my discourtesy . "
26279	26283	26051	26051	she	255	" Believe me , "
26284	26288	26372	26373	the youth	889	" Yours truly , "
26289	26294	26051	26051	she	255	" M. J. SCHLEGEL . "
26314	26319	26306	26306	she	255	" DEAR MISS SCHLEGEL , "
26320	26342	26306	26306	she	255	" You should not have written me such a letter . I called to tell you that Paul has gone abroad . "
26343	26347	26306	26306	she	255	" RUTH WILCOX . "
26536	26562	26511	26511	she	255	" Oh , Mrs. Wilcox , I have made the baddest blunder . I am more , more ashamed and sorry than I can say . "
26646	26661	26963	26963	She	255	" I knew he was going to India in November , but I forgot . "
26662	26674	26606	26606	her	512	" He sailed on the 17th for Nigeria , in Africa . "
26675	26696	26963	26963	She	255	" I knew -- I know . I have been too absurd all through . I am very much ashamed . "
26703	26722	26606	26606	her	512	" I am more sorry than I can say , and I hope that you will forgive me . "
26723	26744	26606	26606	her	512	" It doesn t matter , Miss Schlegel . It is good of you to have come round so promptly . "
26745	26750	26752	26752	Margaret	255	" It does matter , "
26754	26779	26752	26752	Margaret	255	" I have been rude to you ; and my sister is not even at home , so there was not even that excuse . "
26780	26783	26963	26963	She	255	" Indeed ? "
26784	26792	26752	26752	Margaret	255	" She has just gone to Germany . "
26793	26799	26801	26802	the other	814	" She gone as well , "
26804	26820	26801	26802	the other	814	" Yes , certainly , it is quite safe -- safe , absolutely , now . "
26821	26828	26830	26830	Margaret	255	" You ve been worrying too ! "
26845	26870	26830	26830	Margaret	255	" How perfectly extraordinary ! I can see that you have . You felt as I do ; Helen mustn t meet him again . "
26871	26878	26752	26752	Margaret	255	" I did think it best . "
26879	26883	26830	26830	Margaret	255	" Now why ? "
26884	26892	26894	26895	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" That s a most difficult question , "
26908	26929	26894	26895	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" I think you put it best in your letter -- it was an instinct , which may be wrong . "
26930	26938	26830	26830	Margaret	255	" It wasn t that your son still-- "
26939	26955	26894	26895	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" Oh no ; he often -- my Paul is very young , you see . "
26956	26962	26830	26830	Margaret	255	" Then what was it ? "
26966	26974	26963	26963	She	255	" An instinct which may be wrong . "
26975	27020	26894	26895	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" In other words , they belong to types that can fall in love , but couldn t live together . That s dreadfully probable . I m afraid that in nine cases out of ten Nature pulls one way and human nature another . "
27021	27028	27030	27031	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" These are indeed other words , "
27033	27058	27030	27031	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" I had nothing so coherent in my head . I was merely alarmed when I knew that my boy cared for your sister . "
27059	27099	26894	26895	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" Ah , I have always been wanting to ask you . How DID you know ? Helen was so surprised when our aunt drove up , and you stepped forward and arranged things . Did Paul tell you ? "
27100	27111	27113	27114	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" There is nothing to be gained by discussing that , "
27121	27146	26894	26895	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" Mrs. Wilcox , were you very angry with us last June ? I wrote you a letter and you didn t answer it . "
27147	27166	26894	26895	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" I was certainly against taking Mrs. Matheson s flat . I knew it was opposite your house . "
27167	27175	26894	26895	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" But it s all right now ? "
27176	27181	26894	26895	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" I think so . "
27182	27201	26894	26895	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" You only think ? You aren t sure ? I do love these little muddles tidied up ? "
27202	27210	27212	27213	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" Oh yes , I m sure , "
27222	27237	27212	27213	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" I always sound uncertain over things . It is my way of speaking . "
27238	27251	26894	26895	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" That s all right , and I m sure , too . "
27280	27295	27253	27254	the maid	1169	" I must say good - bye now -- you will be getting up . "
27296	27319	27253	27254	the maid	1169	" No -- please stop a little longer -- I am taking a day in bed . Now and then I do . "
27320	27332	27253	27254	the maid	1169	" I thought of you as one of the early risers . "
27333	27350	27253	27254	the maid	1169	" At Howards End -- yes ; there is nothing to get up for in London . "
27351	27358	27360	27362	the scandalised Margaret	255	" Nothing to get up for ? "
27364	27385	27360	27362	the scandalised Margaret	255	" When there are all the autumn exhibitions , and Ysaye playing in the afternoon ! Not to mention people . "
27386	27422	27253	27254	the maid	1169	" The truth is , I am a little tired . First came the wedding , and then Paul went off , and , instead of resting yesterday , I paid a round of calls . "
27423	27427	27360	27362	the scandalised Margaret	255	" A wedding ? "
27428	27440	27253	27254	the maid	1169	" Yes ; Charles , my elder son , is married . "
27441	27444	27360	27362	the scandalised Margaret	255	" Indeed ! "
27445	27509	27253	27254	the maid	1169	" We took the flat chiefly on that account , and also that Paul could get his African outfit . The flat belongs to a cousin of my husband s , and she most kindly offered it to us . So before the day came we were able to make the acquaintance of Dolly s people , which we had not yet done . "
27518	27543	27513	27515	Dolly s people	4258	" Fussell . The father is in the Indian army -- retired ; the brother is in the army . The mother is dead . "
27549	27553	27548	27562	the " chinless sunburnt men " whom Helen had espied one afternoon through the window	1173	" chinless sunburnt men "
27660	27785	27639	27639	people	3992	" Charles and Albert Fussell have known one another some time . They belong to the same club , and are both devoted to golf . Dolly plays golf too , though I believe not so well ; and they first met in a mixed foursome . We all like her , and are very much pleased . They were married on the 11th , a few days before Paul sailed . Charles was very anxious to have his brother as best man , so he made a great point of having it on the 11th . The Fussells would have preferred it after Christmas , but they were very nice about it . There is Dolly s photograph -- in that double frame . "
27786	27800	27819	27819	Dolly	1176	" Are you quite certain that I m not interrupting , Mrs. Wilcox ? "
27801	27806	27639	27639	people	3992	" Yes , quite . "
27807	27818	27819	27819	Dolly	1176	" Then I will stay . I m enjoying this . "
27829	27834	27639	27639	people	3992	" For dear Mims , "
27840	27854	27836	27837	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" the name she and Charles had settled that she should call me . "
27920	27930	27907	27907	them	1179	" They have gone to Naples for their honeymoon . "
27931	27935	27907	27907	them	1179	" Lucky people ! "
27936	27945	27907	27907	them	1179	" I can hardly imagine Charles in Italy . "
27946	27954	27907	27907	them	1179	" Doesn t he care for travelling ? "
27955	28019	27907	27907	them	1179	" He likes travel , but he does see through foreigners so . What he enjoys most is a motor tour in England , and I think that would have carried the day if the weather had not been so abominable . His father gave him a car for a wedding present , which for the present is being stored at Howards End . "
28020	28029	27907	27907	them	1179	" I suppose you have a garage there ? "
28030	28069	27907	27907	them	1179	" Yes . My husband built a little one only last month , to the west of the house , not far from the wych - elm , in what used to be the paddock for the pony . "
28080	28087	28089	28089	Margaret	255	" Where s the pony gone ? "
28094	28107	27907	27907	them	1179	" The pony ? Oh , dead , ever so long ago . "
28108	28126	27907	27907	them	1179	" The wych - elm I remember . Helen spoke of it as a very splendid tree . "
28127	28147	27907	27907	them	1179	" It is the finest wych - elm in Hertfordshire . Did your sister tell you about the teeth ? "
28148	28151	27907	27907	them	1179	" No . "
28152	28220	27907	27907	them	1179	" Oh , it might interest you . There are pigs teeth stuck into the trunk , about four feet from the ground . The country people put them in long ago , and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark , it will cure the toothache . The teeth are almost grown over now , and no one comes to the tree . "
28221	28233	27907	27907	them	1179	" I should . I love folklore and all festering superstitions . "
28234	28252	27907	27907	them	1179	" Do you think that the tree really did cure toothache , if one believed in it ? "
28253	28266	27907	27907	them	1179	" Of course it did . It would cure anything -- once . "
28267	28294	27907	27907	them	1179	" Certainly I remember cases -- you see I lived at Howards End long , long before Mr. Wilcox knew it . I was born there . "
28437	28460	28419	28419	she	255	" Good - bye , Miss Schlegel , good - bye . Thank you for coming . You have cheered me up . "
28461	28467	28419	28419	she	255	" I m so glad ! "
28468	28480	28419	28419	she	255	" I -- I wonder whether you ever think about yourself ? "
28481	28488	28490	28490	Margaret	255	" I think of nothing else , "
28505	28514	28591	28591	Margaret	255	" I wonder . I wondered at Heidelberg . "
28515	28520	28419	28419	she	255	" I M sure ! "
28521	28525	28591	28591	Margaret	255	" I almost think-- "
28526	28529	28531	28531	Margaret	255	" Yes ? "
28579	28590	28591	28591	Margaret	255	" I almost think you forget you re a girl . "
28599	28606	28607	28607	she	255	" I m twenty - nine , "
28610	28618	28591	28591	Margaret	255	" That s not so wildly girlish . "
28623	28641	28591	28591	Margaret	255	" What makes you say that ? Do you mean that I have been gauche and rude ? "
28648	28683	28591	28591	Margaret	255	" I only meant that I am fifty - one , and that to me both of you -- Read it all in some book or other ; I can not put things clearly . "
28684	28712	28619	28620	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" Oh , I ve got it -- inexperience . I m no better than Helen , you mean , and yet I presume to advise her . "
28713	28726	28591	28591	Margaret	255	" Yes . You have got it . Inexperience is the word . "
28727	28730	28732	28732	Margaret	255	" Inexperience , "
28740	28877	28591	28591	Margaret	255	" Of course , I have everything to learn -- absolutely everything -- just as much as Helen . Life s very difficult and full of surprises . At all events , I ve got as far as that . To be humble and kind , to go straight ahead , to love people rather than pity them , to remember the submerged -- well , one can t do all these things at once , worse luck , because they re so contradictory . It s then that proportion comes in -- to live by proportion . Don t BEGIN with proportion . Only prigs do that . Let proportion come in as a last resource , when the better things have failed , and a deadlock -- Gracious me , I ve started preaching ! "
28878	28889	28891	28892	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" Indeed , you put the difficulties of life splendidly , "
28902	28917	28891	28892	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" It is just what I should have liked to say about them myself . "
29034	29040	29033	29047	the " one or two delightful people " who had been asked to meet her	1193	" one or two delightful people "
29270	29283	29284	29284	Margaret	255	" I hope that your sister is safe in Germany by now . "
29290	29301	29284	29284	Margaret	255	" Yes , thank you ; I heard on Tuesday . "
29320	29343	29284	29284	Margaret	255	" Only on Tuesday , for they live right away at Stettin . Did you ever know any one living at Stettin ? "
29344	29347	29349	29350	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" Never , "
29393	29487	29284	29284	Margaret	255	" People at Stettin drop things into boats out of overhanging warehouses . At least , our cousins do , but aren t particularly rich . The town isn t interesting , except for a clock that rolls its eyes , and the view of the Oder , which truly is something special . Oh , Mrs. Wilcox , you would love the Oder ! The river , or rather rivers -- there seem to be dozens of them -- are intense blue , and the plain they run through an intensest green . "
29488	29502	29357	29365	a young man low down in the Education Office	1204	" Indeed ! That sounds like a most beautiful view , Miss Schlegel . "
29503	29608	29284	29284	Margaret	255	" So I say , but Helen , who will muddle things , says no , it s like music . The course of the Oder is to be like music . It s obliged to remind her of a symphonic poem . The part by the landing - stage is in B minor , if I remember rightly , but lower down things get extremely mixed . There is a slodgy theme in several keys at once , meaning mud - banks , and another for the navigable canal , and the exit into the Baltic is in C sharp major , pianissimo . "
29609	29619	29621	29622	the man	717	" What do the overhanging warehouses make of that ? "
29626	29635	29637	29637	Margaret	255	" They make a great deal of it , "
29647	29728	29637	29637	Margaret	255	" I think it s affectation to compare the Oder to music , and so do you , but the overhanging warehouses of Stettin take beauty seriously , which we don t , and the average Englishman doesn t , and despises all who do . Now don t say Germans have no taste , or I shall scream . They haven t. But -- but -- such a tremendous but!--they take poetry seriously . They do take poetry seriously . "
29729	29736	29284	29284	Margaret	255	" Is anything gained by that ? "
29737	29935	29637	29637	Margaret	255	" Yes , yes . The German is always on the lookout for beauty . He may miss it through stupidity , or misinterpret it , but he is always asking beauty to enter his life , and I believe that in the end it will come . At Heidelberg I met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry . So easy for me to laugh -- I , who never repeat poetry , good or bad , and can not remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with . My blood boils -- well , I m half German , so put it down to patriotism -- when I listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things Teutonic , whether they re Bocklin or my veterinary surgeon . Oh , Bocklin , they say ; he strains after beauty , he peoples Nature with gods too consciously . Of course Bocklin strains , because he wants something -- beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world . So his landscapes don t come off , and Leader s do . "
29936	29948	29950	29950	he	1207	" I am not sure that I agree . Do you ? "
29960	29969	29957	29957	She	512	" I think Miss Schlegel puts everything splendidly ; "
29978	30003	29957	29957	She	512	" Oh , Mrs. Wilcox , say something nicer than that . It s such a snub to be told you put things splendidly . "
30004	30046	29957	29957	She	512	" I do not mean it as a snub . Your last speech interested me so much . Generally people do not seem quite to like Germany . I have long wanted to hear what is said on the other side . "
30047	30066	29957	29957	She	512	" The other side ? Then you do disagree . Oh , good ! Give us your side . "
30067	30075	29957	29957	She	512	" I have no side . But my husband"--her
30081	30098	29957	29957	She	512	increased--"has very little faith in the Continent , and our children have all taken after him . "
30099	30115	29957	29957	She	512	" On what grounds ? Do they feel that the Continent is in bad form ? "
30258	30390	30588	30590	a girl opposite	1210	" You will admit , though , that the Continent -- it seems silly to speak of the Continent , but really it is all more like itself than any part of it is like England . England is unique . Do have another jelly first . I was going to say that the Continent , for good or for evil , is interested in ideas . Its Literature and Art have what one might call the kink of the unseen about them , and this persists even through decadence and affectation . There is more liberty of action in England , but for liberty of thought go to bureaucratic Prussia . People will there discuss with humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch with tongs . "
30391	30401	30403	30404	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" I do not want to go to Prussia , "
30405	30436	30588	30590	a girl opposite	1210	" not even to see that interesting view that you were describing . And for discussing with humility I am too old . We never discuss anything at Howards End . "
30437	30443	30445	30445	Margaret	255	" Then you ought to ! "
30447	30464	30445	30445	Margaret	255	" Discussion keeps a house alive . It can not stand by bricks and mortar alone . "
30465	30473	30475	30476	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" It can not stand without them , "
30506	30538	30502	30504	the delightful people	1195	" It can not stand without them , and I sometimes think -- But I can not expect your generation to agree , for even my daughter disagrees with me here . "
30539	30549	30502	30504	the delightful people	1195	" Never mind us or her . Do say ! "
30550	30566	30502	30504	the delightful people	1195	" I sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and discussion to men . "
30573	30586	30588	30590	a girl opposite	1210	" One admits that the arguments against the suffrage ARE extraordinarily strong , "
30599	30621	30502	30504	the delightful people	1195	" Are they ? I never follow any arguments . I am only too thankful not to have a vote myself . "
30622	30635	30637	30637	Margaret	255	" We didn t mean the vote , though , did we ? "
30639	30700	30637	30637	Margaret	255	" Aren t we differing on something much wider , Mrs. Wilcox ? Whether women are to remain what they have been since the dawn of history ; or whether , since men have moved forward so far , they too may move forward a little now . I say they may . I would even admit a biological change . "
30701	30712	30502	30504	the delightful people	1195	" I don t know , I don t know . "
30713	30724	30726	30727	the man	717	" I must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse , "
30729	30736	30726	30727	the man	717	" They ve turned disgracefully strict . "
30742	30789	30502	30504	the delightful people	1195	" Oh , but come upstairs for a little . Miss Quested plays . Do you like MacDowell ? Do you mind his only having two noises ? If you must really go , I ll see you out . Won t you even have coffee ? "
30814	30825	30811	30811	she	512	" What an interesting life you all lead in London ! "
30826	30833	30835	30835	Margaret	255	" No , we don t , "
30842	30903	30835	30835	Margaret	255	" We lead the lives of gibbering monkeys . Mrs. Wilcox -- really -- We have something quiet and stable at the bottom . We really have . All my friends have . Don t pretend you enjoyed lunch , for you loathed it , but forgive me by coming again , alone , or by asking me to you . "
30904	30912	30914	30915	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" I am used to young people , "
30931	31046	30921	30921	she	512	" I hear a great deal of chatter at home , for we , like you , entertain a great deal . With us it is more sport and politics , but -- I enjoyed my lunch very much , Miss Schlegel , dear , and am not pretending , and only wish I could have joined in more . For one thing , I m not particularly well just to - day . For another , you younger people move so quickly that it dazes me . Charles is the same , Dolly the same . But we are all in the same boat , old and young . I never forget that . "
31419	31424	31426	31426	Margaret	255	" First of all , "
31428	31461	31426	31426	Margaret	255	" we must make a list and tick off the people s names . My aunt always does , and this fog may thicken up any moment . Have you any ideas ? "
31462	31475	31477	31478	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" I thought we would go to Harrods or the Haymarket Stores , "
31482	31535	31477	31478	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" Everything is sure to be there . I am not a good shopper . The din is so confusing , and your aunt is quite right -- one ought to make a list . Take my notebook , then , and write your own name at the top of the page . "
31536	31541	31543	31543	Margaret	255	" Oh , hooray ! "
31548	31559	31561	31561	she	255	" How very kind of you to start with me ! "
31649	31669	31646	31646	she	255	" I don t really want a Yuletide gift , though . In fact , I d rather not . "
31670	31673	31646	31646	she	255	" Why ? "
31674	31702	31646	31646	she	255	" Because I ve odd ideas about Christmas . Because I have all that money can buy . I want more people , but no more things . "
31703	31756	31646	31646	she	255	" I should like to give you something worth your acquaintance , Miss Schlegel , in memory of your kindness to me during my lonely fortnight . It has so happened that I have been left alone , and you have stopped me from brooding . I am too apt to brood . "
31757	31763	31765	31765	Margaret	255	" If that is so , "
31767	31795	31765	31765	Margaret	255	" if I have happened to be of use to you , which I didn t know , you can not pay me back with anything tangible . "
31796	31818	31646	31646	she	255	" I suppose not , but one would like to . Perhaps I shall think of something as we go about . "
31907	31915	31897	31900	the rector s wife	1239	" We always give the servants money . "
31916	31927	31929	31929	Margaret	255	" Yes , do you , yes , much easier , "

32220	32231	32232	32232	she	255	" No , I do like Christmas on the whole , "
32235	32257	32232	32232	she	255	" In its clumsy way , it does approach Peace and Goodwill . But oh , it is clumsier every year . "
32258	32270	32529	32536	a friend , bent on the same errand	1260	" Is it ? I am only used to country Christmases . "
32271	32409	32232	32232	she	255	" We are usually in London , and play the game with vigour -- carols at the Abbey , clumsy midday meal , clumsy dinner for the maids , followed by Christmas - tree and dancing of poor children , with songs from Helen . The drawing - room does very well for that . We put the tree in the powder - closet , and draw a curtain when the candles are lighted , and with the looking - glass behind it looks quite pretty . I wish we might have a powder - closet in our next house . Of course , the tree has to be very small , and the presents don t hang on it . No ; the presents reside in a sort of rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper . "
32410	32428	32529	32536	a friend , bent on the same errand	1260	" You spoke of your next house , Miss Schlegel . Then are you leaving Wickham Place ? "
32429	32446	32232	32232	she	255	" Yes , in two or three years , when the lease expires . We must . "
32447	32454	32529	32536	a friend , bent on the same errand	1260	" Have you been there long ? "
32455	32460	32232	32232	she	255	" All our lives . "
32461	32471	32529	32536	a friend , bent on the same errand	1260	" You will be very sorry to leave it . "
32472	32485	32232	32232	she	255	" I suppose so . We scarcely realise it yet . My father-- "
32513	32520	32521	32521	she	1255	" If possible , something distinctive , "
32548	32557	32521	32521	she	1255	" My husband and our daughter are motoring . "
32558	32571	32521	32521	she	1255	" Bertha , too ? Oh , fancy , what a coincidence ! "
32649	32688	32646	32646	she	512	" Do you know , I ll wait . On second thoughts , I ll wait . There s plenty of time still , isn t there , and I shall be able to get Evie s opinion . "
32706	32715	32703	32703	she	512	" But couldn t you get it renewed ? "
32716	32722	32724	32724	Margaret	255	" I beg your pardon ? "
32726	32733	32703	32703	she	512	" The lease , I mean . "
32734	32756	32703	32703	she	512	" Oh , the lease ! Have you been thinking of that all the time ? How very kind of you ! "
32757	32764	32703	32703	she	512	" Surely something could be done . "
32765	32788	32703	32703	she	512	" No ; values have risen too enormously . They mean to pull down Wickham Place , and build flats like yours . "
32789	32794	32703	32703	she	512	" But how horrible ! "
32795	32800	32703	32703	she	512	" Landlords are horrible . "
32806	32906	32802	32802	she	512	" It is monstrous , Miss Schlegel ; it isn t right . I had no idea that this was hanging over you . I do pity you from the bottom of my heart . To be parted from your house , your father s house -- it oughtn t to be allowed . It is worse than dying . I would rather die than -- Oh , poor girls ! Can what they call civilisation be right , if people mayn t die in the room where they were born ? My dear , I am so sorry . "
32930	32945	32802	32802	she	512	" Howards End was nearly pulled down once . It would have killed me . "
32946	32991	32802	32802	she	512	" I -- Howards End must be a very different house to ours . We are fond of ours , but there is nothing distinctive about it . As you saw , it is an ordinary London house . We shall easily find another . "
32992	32997	32802	32802	she	512	" So you think . "
32998	33008	33010	33010	Margaret	255	" Again my lack of experience , I suppose ! "
33018	33066	33010	33010	Margaret	255	" I can t say anything when you take up that line , Mrs. Wilcox . I wish I could see myself as you see me -- foreshortened into a backfisch . Quite the ingenue . Very charming -- wonderfully well read for my age , but incapable-- "
33074	33084	33085	33085	she	512	" Come down with me to Howards End now , "
33093	33125	33085	33085	she	512	" I want you to see it . You have never seen it . I want to hear what you say about it , for you do put things so wonderfully . "
33142	33150	33151	33151	she	512	" Later on I should love it , "
33154	33185	33151	33151	she	512	" but it s hardly the weather for such an expedition , and we ought to start when we re fresh . Isn t the house shut up , too ? "
33198	33206	33151	33151	she	512	" Might I come some other day ? "
33216	33224	33207	33208	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" Back to Wickham Place , please ! "
33237	33250	33207	33208	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" A thousand thanks , Miss Schlegel , for all your help . "
33251	33256	33207	33208	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" Not at all . "
33257	33283	33207	33208	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" It is such a comfort to get the presents off my mind -- the Christmas - cards especially . I do admire your choice . "
33300	33399	33207	33208	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" My husband and Evie will be back the day after to - morrow . That is why I dragged you out shopping to - day . I stayed in town chiefly to shop , but got through nothing , and now he writes that they must cut their tour short , the weather is so bad , and the police - traps have been so bad -- nearly as bad as in Surrey . Ours is such a careful chauffeur , and my husband feels it particularly hard that they should be treated like road - hogs . "
33400	33403	33207	33208	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" Why ? "
33404	33418	33207	33208	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" Well , naturally he -- he isn t a road - hog . "
33419	33441	33207	33208	Mrs. Wilcox	512	" He was exceeding the speed - limit , I conclude . He must expect to suffer with the lower animals . "
33645	33653	33654	33654	Her	255	" Might I come some other day ? "
33900	33903	33908	33909	a fool	3951	" another day "
33911	33914	33908	33909	a fool	3951	" Another day "
34173	34182	34184	34184	Margaret	255	" I will come if I still may , "
34189	34231	34320	34324	a heavy - browed girl	1301	" You are coming to sleep , dear , too . It is in the morning that my house is most beautiful . You are coming to stop . I can not show you my meadow properly except at sunrise . These fogs"--she
34236	34260	34320	34324	a heavy - browed girl	1301	roof--"never spread far . I dare say they are sitting in the sun in Hertfordshire , and you will never repent joining them . "
34261	34269	34320	34324	a heavy - browed girl	1301	" I shall never repent joining you . "
34270	34276	34320	34324	a heavy - browed girl	1301	" It is the same . "
34313	34318	34320	34324	a heavy - browed girl	1301	" Mother ! mother ! "
34340	34343	34344	34344	she	1301	" Evie ! "
34345	34349	34320	34324	a heavy - browed girl	1301	gasped--"Evie , my pet-- "
34354	34365	34350	34351	The girl	877	" Father ! I say ! look who s here . "
34366	34379	34320	34324	a heavy - browed girl	1301	" Evie , dearest girl , why aren t you in Yorkshire ? "
34380	34393	34350	34351	The girl	877	" No -- motor smash -- changed plans -- father s coming . "
34394	34399	34401	34402	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Why , Ruth ! "
34407	34424	34401	34402	Mr. Wilcox	258	" what in the name of all that s wonderful are you doing here , Ruth ? "
34431	34454	34350	34351	The girl	877	" Oh , Henry dear!--here s a lovely surprise -- but let me introduce -- but I think you know Miss Schlegel . "
34455	34459	34460	34460	he	258	" Oh yes , "
34467	34475	34460	34460	he	258	" But how s yourself , Ruth ? "
34476	34482	34483	34483	she	512	" Fit as a fiddle , "
34487	34519	34350	34351	The girl	877	" So are we , and so was our car , which ran A1 as far as Ripon , but there a wretched horse and cart which a fool of a driver-- "
34520	34533	34350	34351	The girl	877	" Miss Schlegel , our little outing must be for another day . "
34534	34551	34350	34351	The girl	877	" I was saying that this fool of a driver , as the policeman himself admits . "
34552	34562	34350	34351	The girl	877	" Another day , Mrs. Wilcox . Of course . "
34563	34580	34350	34351	The girl	877	" --But as we ve insured against third party risks , it won t so much matter-- "
34581	34590	34350	34351	The girl	877	" --Cart and car being practically at right angles-- "
35215	35227	35228	35228	he	1344	" They didn t ought to have coloured flowers at buryings , "
35370	35388	35356	35366	The wood - cutter , returning after a night of joy	1353	" They lilies , they chrysants ; it s a pity I didn t take them all . "
35597	35612	35594	35594	Her	354	business--"Henry , why do people who have enough money try to get more money ? "
35616	35636	35637	35637	Her	354	politics--"I am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet , there would be no more wars , "
35697	35703	35691	35691	she	354	" a more inward light , "
35706	35715	35717	35717	Charles	359	" not so much for myself as for baby "
35785	35797	35798	35798	he	788	" Why didn t you tell me you knew of it ? "
35809	35830	35798	35798	he	788	" I didn t want to , Henry -- I might have been wrong -- and every one hates illnesses . "
36119	36127	36129	36129	Evie	262	" The post s come , father , "
36132	36139	36159	36159	him	788	" Thanks . Put it down . "
36140	36148	36159	36159	him	788	" Has the breakfast been all right ? "
36149	36154	36159	36159	him	788	" Yes , thanks . "
36174	36183	36155	36156	The girl	877	" Charles says do you want the Times ? "
36184	36193	36155	36156	The girl	877	" No , I ll read it later . "
36194	36207	36155	36156	The girl	877	" Ring if you want anything , father , won t you ? "
36208	36215	36155	36156	The girl	877	" I ve all I want . "
36233	36239	36240	36240	she	877	" Father s eaten nothing , "
36274	36286	36263	36263	he	788	" Look here father , you must eat , you know ; "
36302	36315	36316	36316	he	788	" He s going to read his letters first , I think , "
36320	36333	36335	36335	he	788	" I dare say he will go on with his breakfast afterwards . "
36504	36516	36517	36517	he	1389	" They had no business to be pollarding those elms yesterday , "
36523	36528	36517	36517	he	1389	" No , indeed . "
36529	36538	36539	36539	he	1389	" I must make a note of that , "
36542	36552	36539	36539	he	1389	" I am surprised that the rector allowed it . "
36553	36564	36517	36517	he	1389	" Perhaps it may not be the rector s affair . "
36565	36572	36539	36539	he	1389	" Whose else could it be ? "
36573	36580	36517	36517	he	1389	" The lord of the manor . "
36581	36584	36539	36539	he	1389	" Impossible . "
36585	36590	36517	36517	he	1389	" Butter , Dolly ? "
36591	36599	36539	36539	he	1389	" Thank you , Evie dear . Charles-- "
36600	36605	36517	36517	he	1389	" Yes , dear ? "
36606	36623	36539	36539	he	1389	" I didn t know one could pollard elms . I thought one only pollarded willows . "
36624	36633	36517	36517	he	1389	" Oh no , one can pollard elms . "
36634	36648	36649	36649	Charles	359	" Then why oughtn t the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded ? "
36661	36671	36517	36517	he	1389	" Another point . I must speak to Chalkeley . "
36672	36683	36517	36517	he	1389	" Yes , rather ; you must complain to Chalkeley . "
36684	36703	36517	36517	he	1389	" It s no good his saying he is not responsible for those men . He is responsible . "
36704	36709	36517	36517	he	1389	" Yes , rather . "
37368	37370	37374	37375	the man	717	" Morning "
37387	37397	37374	37375	the man	717	" Hullo ! my new car s been driven ! "
37398	37404	37374	37375	the man	717	" Has it , sir ? "
37405	37408	37410	37410	Charles	258	" Yes , "
37416	37440	37410	37410	Charles	258	" and whoever s driven it hasn t cleaned it properly , for there s mud on the axle . Take it off . "
37494	37496	37497	37498	His bride	1437	" Charles-- "
37526	37548	37514	37514	her	1437	" One minute , I m busy . Well , Crane , who s been driving it , do you suppose ? "
37549	37591	37514	37514	her	1437	" Don t know , I m sure , sir . No one s driven it since I ve been back , but , of course , there s the fortnight I ve been away with the other car in Yorkshire . "
37598	37623	37514	37514	her	1437	" Charles , your father s down . Something s happened . He wants you in the house at once . Oh , Charles ! "
37624	37647	37514	37514	her	1437	" Wait , dear , wait a minute . Who had the key of the garage while you were away , Crane ? "
37648	37654	37514	37514	her	1437	" The gardener , sir . "
37655	37670	37514	37514	her	1437	" Do you mean to tell me that old Penny can drive a motor ? "
37671	37686	37514	37514	her	1437	" No , sir ; no one s had the motor out , sir . "
37687	37700	37514	37514	her	1437	" Then how do you account for the mud on the axle ? "
37701	37726	37514	37514	her	1437	" I can t , of course , say for the time I ve been in Yorkshire . No more mud now , sir . "
37800	37819	37821	37821	people	3992	" Now , Dolly , I can attend to you . Miss Schlegel ? What does she want ? "
37856	37862	37852	37853	his wife	1358	" She wants Howards End . "
37863	37882	37918	37918	his	258	" Howards End ? Now , Crane , just don t forget to put on the Stepney wheel . "
37883	37888	37852	37853	his wife	1358	" No , sir . "
37889	37906	37918	37918	his	258	" Now , mind you don t forget , for I -- Come , little woman . "
37949	37958	37918	37918	his	258	" But you haven t listened , Charles . "
37959	37964	37940	37940	he	258	" What s wrong ? "
37965	37981	37918	37918	his	258	" I keep on telling you -- Howards End . Miss Schlegel s got it . "
37982	37986	37988	37988	Charles	258	" Got what ? "
37993	38002	37988	37988	Charles	258	" What the dickens are you talking about ? "
38003	38015	37918	37918	his	258	" Now , Charles , you promised not to say those naughty-- "
38016	38036	37988	37988	Charles	258	" Look here , I m in no mood for foolery . It s no morning for it either . "
38037	38073	37918	37918	his	258	" I tell you -- I keep on telling you -- Miss Schlegel -- she s got it -- your mother s left it to her -- and you ve all got to move out ! "
38074	38078	37988	37988	Charles	258	" HOWARDS END ? "
38079	38083	38084	38084	she	1358	" HOWARDS END ! "
38103	38119	38121	38121	herself	1358	" Dolly , go back at once ! My father s much annoyed with you . Charles"--she
38122	38139	38092	38092	she	1358	wildly--"come in at once to father . He s had a letter that s too awful . "
38173	38177	38170	38170	He	258	" Schlegels again ! "
38188	38204	38185	38185	Dolly	1448	" Oh no , the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her . "
38205	38214	38216	38217	his father	3994	" Come in , all three of you ! "
38223	38232	38185	38185	Dolly	1448	" Dolly , why have you disobeyed me ? "
38233	38238	38185	38185	Dolly	1448	" Oh , Mr. Wilcox-- "
38239	38270	38185	38185	Dolly	1448	" I told you not to go out to the garage . I ve heard you all shouting in the garden . I won t have it . Come in . "
38284	38324	38185	38185	Dolly	1448	" Into the dining - room , every one of you . We can t discuss private matters in the middle of all the servants . Here , Charles , here ; read these . See what you make . "
38381	38399	38377	38377	She	1325	" To my husband : I should like Miss Schlegel ( Margaret ) to have Howards End . "
38400	38413	38414	38414	he	258	" I suppose we re going to have a talk about this ? "
38420	38431	38377	38377	She	1325	" Certainly . I was coming out to you when Dolly-- "
38432	38440	38377	38377	She	1325	" Well , let s sit down . "
38441	38455	38377	38377	She	1325	" Come , Evie , don t waste time , sit -- down . "
38517	38571	38504	38504	Charles	258	" A note in my mother s handwriting , in an envelope addressed to my father , sealed . Inside : I should like Miss Schlegel ( Margaret ) to have Howards End . No date , no signature . Forwarded through the matron of that nursing home . Now , the question is-- "
38576	38599	38572	38572	Dolly	1454	" But I say that note isn t legal . Houses ought to be done by a lawyer , Charles , surely . "
38649	38654	38637	38637	Charles	258	" Give it her . "
38664	38681	38655	38655	She	1454	" Why , it s only in pencil ! I said so . Pencil never counts . "
38682	38694	38696	38697	Mr. Wilcox	258	" We know that it is not legally binding , Dolly , "
38706	38762	38696	38697	Mr. Wilcox	258	" We are aware of that . Legally , I should be justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire . Of course , my dear , we consider you as one of the family , but it will be better if you do not interfere with what you do not understand . "
38777	38781	38763	38763	Charles	258	" The question is-- "
38807	38826	38827	38827	He	258	" The question is whether Miss Schlegel , during the fortnight we were all away , whether she unduly-- "
38830	38837	38839	38840	his father	3994	" I don t think that , "
38850	38856	38763	38763	Charles	258	" Don t think what ? "
38857	38892	38839	38840	his father	3994	" That she would have -- that it is a case of undue influence . No , to my mind the question is the -- the invalid s condition at the time she wrote . "
38893	38917	38763	38763	Charles	258	" My dear father , consult an expert if you like , but I don t admit it is my mother s writing . "
38918	38927	38929	38929	Dolly	1462	" Why , you just said it was ! "
38931	38938	38939	38939	he	3994	" Never mind if I did , "
38943	38949	38939	38939	he	3994	" and hold your tongue . "
39558	39562	39564	39564	they	1466	" Do this , "
39567	39572	39564	39564	they	1466	" We will not . "
39598	39619	39594	39594	they	1466	" She was a dear mother , a true wife ; in our absence she neglected her health and died . "
39626	39640	39623	39623	they	1466	" She was not as true , as dear , as we supposed . "
39669	39672	39665	39665	they	1466	" Treachery . "
39834	39839	39841	39842	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Ah , well ! "
39849	39858	39841	39842	Mr. Wilcox	258	" I shouldn t have thought it possible . "
39859	39867	39869	39869	Evie	262	" Mother couldn t have meant it , "
39874	39884	39827	39832	the woman who had written it	1486	" No , my girl , of course not . "
39885	39910	39827	39832	the woman who had written it	1486	" Mother believed so in ancestors too -- it isn t like her to leave anything to an outsider , who d never appreciate . "
39911	39919	39920	39920	he	258	" The whole thing is unlike her , "
39923	39970	39920	39920	he	258	" If Miss Schlegel had been poor , if she had wanted a house , I could understand it a little . But she has a house of her own . Why should she want another ? She wouldn t have any use for Howards End . "
39971	39977	39979	39979	Charles	258	" That time may prove , "
39981	39984	39986	39987	his sister	1391	" How ? "
39989	40017	40051	40051	her	1488	" Presumably she knows -- mother will have told her . She got twice or three times into the nursing home . Presumably she is awaiting developments . "
40018	40024	40026	40026	Dolly	1488	" What a horrid woman ! "
40034	40048	40026	40026	Dolly	1488	" Why , she may be coming down to turn us out now ! "
40054	40060	40061	40061	he	258	" I wish she would , "
40065	40073	40061	40061	he	258	" I could then deal with her . "
40074	40079	40081	40082	his father	3994	" So could I , "
40131	40158	40127	40127	chairman	1491	" I could deal with her , if she comes , but she won t come . You re all a bit hard on Miss Schlegel . "
40159	40169	40127	40127	chairman	1491	" That Paul business was pretty scandalous , though . "
40170	40288	40289	40289	He	1492	" I want no more of the Paul business , Charles , as I said at the time , and besides , it is quite apart from this business . Margaret Schlegel has been officious and tiresome during this terrible week , and we have all suffered under her , but upon my soul she s honest . She s NOT in collusion with the matron . I m absolutely certain of it . Nor was she with the doctor , I m equally certain of that . She did not hide anything from us , for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are . She , like ourselves , was a dupe-- "
40295	40367	40289	40289	He	1492	" You see , Charles , in her terrible pain your mother put us all in false positions . Paul would not have left England , you would not have gone to Italy , nor Evie and I into Yorkshire , if only we had known . Well , Miss Schlegel s position has been equally false . Take all in all , she has not come out of it badly . "
40371	40375	40368	40368	Evie	262	" But those chrysanthemums-- "
40376	40385	40387	40387	Dolly	1493	" Or coming down to the funeral at all-- "
40389	40451	40368	40368	Evie	262	" Why shouldn t she come down ? She had the right to , and she stood far back among the Hilton women . The flowers -- certainly we should not have sent such flowers , but they may have seemed the right thing to her , Evie , and for all you know they may be the custom in Germany . "
40452	40463	40465	40465	Evie	262	" Oh , I forget she isn t really English , "
40467	40474	40465	40465	Evie	262	" That would explain a lot . "
40475	40481	40483	40483	Charles	258	" She s a cosmopolitan , "
40490	40571	40483	40483	Charles	258	" I admit I m rather down on cosmopolitans . My fault , doubtless . I can not stand them , and a German cosmopolitan is the limit . I think that s about all , isn t it ? I want to run down and see Chalkeley . A bicycle will do . And , by the way , I wish you d speak to Crane some time . I m certain he s had my new car out . "
40572	40580	40621	40622	one another	3933	" Has he done it any harm ? "
40581	40584	40483	40483	Charles	258	" No . "
40585	40604	40621	40622	one another	3933	" In that case I shall let it pass . It s not worth while having a row . "
41112	41116	41111	41111	she	255	" loved superstition . "
41245	41249	41250	41250	they	260	" her sort , "
41361	41366	41333	41333	they	260	" telegrams and anger , "
41476	41483	41484	41484	she	255	" Don t brood too much , "
41489	41526	41484	41484	she	255	" on the superiority of the unseen to the seen . It s true , but to brood on it is medieval . Our business is not to contrast the two , but to reconcile them . "
41683	41699	41703	41703	she	254	" It isn t size that counts so much as the way things are arranged . "
41946	41959	41942	41942	She	254	" Oh , how lovely ! That s the place for me ! "
41970	41979	41985	41985	she	287	" I have a message , dear Helen , "
42044	42055	42057	42057	Helen	254	" And there will even be some one for Tibby , "
42059	42119	42057	42057	Helen	254	" There now , Tibby , think of that ; Frieda is saving up a little girl for you , in pig - tails and white worsted stockings but the feet of the stockings are pink as if the little girl had trodden in strawberries . I ve talked too much . My head aches . Now you talk . "
42399	42414	42382	42382	them	1556	" Helen , I told you about poor Mrs. Wilcox ; that sad business ? "
42415	42418	42382	42382	them	1556	" Yes . "
42419	42487	42382	42382	them	1556	" I have had a correspondence with her son . He was winding up the estate , and wrote to ask me whether his mother had wanted me to have anything . I thought it good of him , considering I knew her so little . I said that she had once spoken of giving me a Christmas present , but we both forgot about it afterwards . "
42488	42496	42382	42382	them	1556	" I hope Charles took the hint . "
42497	42648	42382	42382	them	1556	" Yes -- that is to say , her husband wrote later on , and thanked me for being a little kind to her , and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette . Don t you think that is extraordinarily generous ? It has made me like him very much . He hopes that this will not be the end of our acquaintance , but that you and I will go and stop with Evie some time in the future . I like Mr. Wilcox . He is taking up his work -- rubber -- it is a big business . I gather he is launching out rather . Charles is in it , too . Charles is married -- a pretty little creature , but she doesn t seem wise . They took on the flat , but now they have gone off to a house of their own . "
43762	43778	43759	43759	she	255	" I was thinking of Mr. Vyse . He never strikes me as particularly happy . "
43779	43784	43786	43786	Tibby	259	" Ye -- es . "
43883	43911	43873	43873	her	254	" But Mr. Vyse is rather a wretched , weedy man , don t you think ? Then there s Guy . That was a pitiful business . Besides"--shifting
43914	43924	43873	43873	her	254	general--"every one is the better for some regular work . "
43927	43934	43935	43935	she	254	" I shall stick to it , "
43940	44030	43935	43935	she	254	" I am not saying it to educate you ; it is what I really think . I believe that in the last century men have developed the desire for work , and they must not starve it . It s a new desire . It goes with a great deal that s bad , but in itself it s good , and I hope that for women , too , not to work will soon become as shocking as not to be married was a hundred years ago . "
44031	44045	44047	44047	Tibby	259	" I have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude , "
44049	44094	44118	44118	he	259	" Then we ll leave the subject till you do . I m not going to rattle you round . Take your time . Only do think over the lives of the men you like most , and see how they ve arranged them . "
44095	44104	44106	44106	Tibby	259	" I like Guy and Mr. Vyse most , "
44129	44171	44172	44172	She	1613	" And don t think I m not serious because I don t use the traditional arguments -- making money , a sphere awaiting you , and so on -- all of which are , for various reasons , ca nt . "
44176	44212	44118	44118	he	259	" I m only your sister . I haven t any authority over you , and I don t want to have any . Just to put before you what I think the Truth . You see"--she
44224	44253	44118	44118	he	259	taken--"in a few years we shall be the same age practically , and I shall want you to help me . Men are so much nicer than women . "
44254	44267	44118	44118	he	259	" Labouring under such a delusion , why do you not marry ? "
44268	44282	44118	44118	he	259	" I sometimes jolly well think I would if I got the chance . "
44283	44289	44118	44118	he	259	" Has nobody arst you ? "
44290	44294	44118	44118	he	259	" Only ninnies . "
44295	44301	44118	44118	he	259	" Do people ask Helen ? "
44302	44305	44118	44118	he	259	" Plentifully . "
44306	44312	44118	44118	he	259	" Tell me about them . "
44313	44316	44118	44118	he	259	" No . "
44317	44326	44118	44118	he	259	" Tell me about your ninnies , then . "
44327	44338	44340	44341	his sister	1391	" They were men who had nothing better to do , "
44353	44445	44345	44345	she	1391	" So take warning ; you must work , or else you must pretend to work , which is what I do . Work , work , work if you d save your soul and your body . It is honestly a necessity , dear boy . Look at the Wilcoxes , look at Mr. Pembroke . With all their defects of temper and understanding , such men give me more pleasure than many who are better equipped , and I think it is because they have worked regularly and honestly . "
44446	44452	44453	44453	he	1614	" Spare me the Wilcoxes , "
44456	44467	44345	44345	she	1391	" I shall not . They are the right sort . "
44468	44476	44477	44477	he	1614	" Oh , goodness me , Meg-- ! "
44500	44515	44345	44345	she	1391	" Well , they re as near the right sort as you can imagine . "
44516	44525	44345	44345	she	1391	" No , no -- oh , no ! "
44526	44569	44345	44345	she	1391	" I was thinking of the younger son , whom I once classed as a ninny , but who came back so ill from Nigeria . He s gone out there again , Evie Wilcox tells me -- out to his duty . "
44570	44572	44345	44345	she	1391	" Duty "
44578	44635	44345	44345	she	1391	" He doesn t want the money , it is work he wants , though it is beastly work -- dull country , dishonest natives , an eternal fidget over fresh water and food ... A nation that can produce men of that sort may well be proud . No wonder England has become an Empire . "
44636	44639	44345	44345	she	1391	" EMPIRE ! "
44640	44648	44650	44650	Margaret	255	" I can t bother over results , "
44656	44706	44650	44650	Margaret	255	" They are too difficult for me . I can only look at the men . An Empire bores me , so far , but I can appreciate the heroism that builds it up . London bores me , but what thousands of splendid people are labouring to make London-- "
44707	44712	44713	44713	he	1616	" What it is , "
44716	44745	44345	44345	she	1391	" What it is , worse luck . I want activity without civilisation . How paradoxical ! Yet I expect that is what we shall find in heaven . "
44746	44750	44752	44752	Tibby	259	" And I , "
44754	44775	44752	44752	Tibby	259	" want civilisation without activity , which , I expect , is what we shall find in the other place . "
44776	44802	44345	44345	she	1391	" You needn t go as far as the other place , Tibbikins , if you want that . You can find it at Oxford . "
44803	44805	44752	44752	Tibby	259	" Stupid-- "
44806	44866	44345	44345	she	1391	" If I m stupid , get me back to the house - hunting . I ll even live in Oxford if you like -- North Oxford . I ll live anywhere except Bournemouth , Torquay , and Cheltenham . Oh yes , or Ilfracombe and Swanage and Tunbridge Wells and Surbiton and Bedford . There on no account . "
44867	44872	44752	44752	Tibby	259	" London , then . "
44873	44957	44345	44345	she	1391	" I agree , but Helen rather wants to get away from London . However , there s no reason we shouldn t have a house in the country and also a flat in town , provided we all stick together and contribute . Though of course -- Oh , how one does maunder on and to think , to think of the people who are really poor . How do they live ? Not to move about the world would kill me . "
44979	45009	45052	45062	an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots	1618	" Oh , my dears , what do you think ? You ll never guess . A woman s been here asking me for her husband . Her WHAT ? "
45021	45034	45052	45062	an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots	1618	" Yes , for her husband , and it really is so . "
45035	45043	45045	45045	Margaret	255	" Not anything to do with Bracknell ? "
45064	45139	45052	45062	an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots	1618	" I offered Bracknell , and he was rejected . So was Tibby . ( Cheer up , Tibby ! ) It s no one we know . I said , Hunt , my good woman ; have a good look round , hunt under the tables , poke up the chimney , shake out the antimacassars . Husband ? husband ? Oh , and she so magnificently dressed and tinkling like a chandelier . "
45140	45150	45052	45062	an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots	1618	" Now , Helen , what did really happen ? "
45151	45250	45052	45062	an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots	1618	" What I say . I was , as it were , orating my speech . Annie opens the door like a fool , and shows a female straight in on me , with my mouth open . Then we began -- very civilly . I want my husband , what I have reason to believe is here . No -- how unjust one is . She said whom , not what . She got it perfectly . So I said , Name , please ? and she said , Lan , Miss , and there we were . "
45251	45254	45052	45062	an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots	1618	" Lan ? "
45255	45270	45052	45062	an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots	1618	" Lan or Len . We were not nice about our vowels . Lanoline . "
45271	45276	45052	45062	an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots	1618	" But what an extraordinary-- "
45277	45321	45052	45062	an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots	1618	" I said , My good Mrs. Lanoline , we have some grave misunderstanding here . Beautiful as I am , my modesty is even more remarkable than my beauty , and never , never has Mr. Lanoline rested his eyes on mine . "
45322	45329	45331	45331	Tibby	259	" I hope you were pleased , "
45333	45337	45338	45338	Helen	254	" Of course , "
45341	45428	45338	45338	Helen	254	" A perfectly delightful experience . Oh , Mrs. Lanoline s a dear -- she asked for a husband as if he were an umbrella . She mislaid him Saturday afternoon -- and for a long time suffered no inconvenience . But all night , and all this morning her apprehensions grew . Breakfast didn t seem the same -- no , no more did lunch , and so she strolled up to 2 Wickham Place as being the most likely place for the missing article . "
45429	45434	45052	45062	an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots	1618	" But how on earth-- "
45435	45599	45338	45338	Helen	254	" Don t begin how on earthing . I know what I know , she kept repeating , not uncivilly , but with extreme gloom . In vain I asked her what she did know . Some knew what others knew , and others didn t , and then others again had better be careful . Oh dear , she was incompetent ! She had a face like a silkworm , and the dining - room reeks of orris - root . We chatted pleasantly a little about husbands , and I wondered where hers was too , and advised her to go to the police . She thanked me . We agreed that Mr. Lanoline s a notty , notty man , and hasn t no business to go on the lardy - da . But I think she suspected me up to the last . Bags I writing to Aunt Juley about this . Now , Meg , remember -- bags I. "
45600	45607	45609	45609	Margaret	255	" Bag it by all means , "
45616	45641	45609	45609	Margaret	255	" I m not sure that this is so funny , Helen . It means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere , doesn t it ? "
45642	45664	45720	45720	their	1620	" I don t think so -- she doesn t really mind . The admirable creature isn t capable of tragedy . "
45665	45673	45675	45675	Margaret	255	" Her husband may be , though , "
45682	45700	45720	45720	their	1620	" Oh no , not likely . No one capable of tragedy could have married Mrs. Lanoline . "
45701	45706	45720	45720	their	1620	" Was she pretty ? "
45707	45716	45720	45720	their	1620	" Her figure may have been good once . "
45780	45795	45796	45796	she	255	" Tibby and I have again been wondering where we ll live next September , "
45801	45812	45814	45814	Helen	254	" Tibby had better first wonder what he ll do , "
45951	45957	45948	45948	He	313	" about the lady yesterday . "
45973	45978	45980	45980	Helen	254	" Cheers , children ! "
45982	45988	45980	45980	Helen	254	" It s Mrs. Lanoline . "
46253	46265	46267	46267	he	1627	" You wouldn t remember giving me this , Miss Schlegel ? "
46272	46282	46234	46234	he	1627	" No ; I can t say I do . "
46283	46295	46234	46234	he	1627	" Well , that was how it happened , you see . "
46296	46313	46234	46234	he	1627	" Where did we meet , Mr. Bast ? For the minute I don t remember . "
46314	46331	46234	46234	he	1627	" It was a concert at the Queen s Hall . I think you will recollect , "
46336	46353	46332	46332	he	1627	" when I tell you that it included a performance of the Fifth Symphony of Beethoven . "
46354	46378	46234	46234	he	1627	" We hear the Fifth practically every time it s done , so I m not sure -- do you remember , Helen ? "
46379	46392	46332	46332	he	1627	" Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade ? "
46397	46414	46234	46234	he	1627	" Then I don t remember . That s the only Beethoven I ever remember specially . "
46415	46434	46332	46332	he	1627	" And you , if I may say so , took away my umbrella , inadvertently of course . "
46435	46439	46440	46440	Helen	254	" Likely enough , "
46443	46461	46440	46440	Helen	254	" for I steal umbrellas even oftener than I hear Beethoven . Did you get it back ? "
46462	46471	46332	46332	he	1627	" Yes , thank you , Miss Schlegel . "
46472	46484	46486	46486	Margaret	255	" The mistake arose out of my card , did it ? "
46488	46500	46332	46332	he	1627	" Yes , the mistake arose -- it was a mistake . "
46501	46522	46523	46523	she	254	" The lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too , and that she could find you ? "
46546	46557	46533	46533	he	1627	" That s so , calling too -- a mistake . "
46558	46562	46564	46564	Helen	254	" Then why-- ? "
46575	46582	46583	46583	he	1627	" I said to my wife , "
46587	46669	46533	46533	he	1627	" I said to Mrs. Bast , I have to pay a call on some friends , and Mrs. Bast said to me , Do go . While I was gone , however , she wanted me on important business , and thought I had come here , owing to the card , and so came after me , and I beg to tender my apologies , and hers as well , for any inconvenience we may have inadvertently caused you . "
46670	46674	46676	46676	Helen	254	" No inconvenience , "
46678	46686	46676	46676	Helen	254	" but I still don t understand . "
46731	46747	46728	46728	she	254	" I still don t understand . When did you say you paid this call ? "
46748	46754	46756	46756	he	313	" Call ? What call ? "
46779	46784	46728	46728	she	254	" This afternoon call . "
46785	46793	46794	46794	he	313	" In the afternoon , of course ! "
46816	46823	46809	46809	Tibby	259	" Saturday afternoon or Sunday afternoon ? "
46824	46829	46728	46728	she	254	" S -- Saturday . "
46830	46833	46835	46835	Helen	254	" Really ! "
46837	46856	46835	46835	Helen	254	" and you were still calling on Sunday , when your wife came here . A long visit . "
46857	46865	46867	46868	Mr. Bast	313	" I don t call that fair , "
46882	46895	46879	46879	his	313	" I know what you mean , and it isn t so . "
46896	46905	46907	46907	Margaret	255	" Oh , don t let us mind , "
46917	46923	46924	46924	he	313	" It was something else , "
46933	46946	46927	46927	his	313	" I was somewhere else to what you think , so there ! "
46947	46958	46959	46959	she	255	" It was good of you to come and explain , "
46962	46972	46959	46959	she	255	" The rest is naturally no concern of ours . "
46973	46993	46927	46927	his	313	" Yes , but I want -- I wanted -- have you ever read The Ordeal of Richard Feverel ? "
46997	47035	46927	46927	his	313	" It s a beautiful book . I wanted to get back to the earth , don t you see , like Richard does in the end . Or have you ever read Stevenson s Prince Otto ? "
47042	47060	47061	47061	He	259	" That s another beautiful book . You get back to the earth in that . I wanted-- "
47082	47090	47092	47092	Leonard	311	" I walked all the Saturday night , "
47094	47098	47092	47092	Leonard	311	" I walked . "
47131	47149	47129	47129	Helen	254	" No doubt it s another beautiful book , but I d rather hear about your road . "
47150	47156	47105	47106	the sisters	775	" Oh , I walked . "
47157	47161	47129	47129	Helen	254	" How far ? "
47162	47182	47105	47106	the sisters	775	" I don t know , nor for how long . It got too dark to see my watch . "
47183	47193	47129	47129	Helen	254	" Were you walking alone , may I ask ? "
47194	47197	47198	47198	he	311	" Yes , "
47204	47262	47198	47198	he	311	" but we d been talking it over at the office . There s been a lot of talk at the office lately about these things . The fellows there said one steers by the Pole Star , and I looked it up in the celestial atlas , but once out of doors everything gets so mixed . "
47263	47274	47276	47276	Helen	254	" Don t talk to me about the Pole Star , "
47283	47303	47276	47276	Helen	254	" I know its little ways . It goes round and round , and you go round after it . "
47304	47330	47347	47348	this fellow	1641	" Well , I lost it entirely . First of all the street lamps , then the trees , and towards morning it got cloudy . "
47389	47396	47398	47398	Margaret	255	" Where did you start from ? "
47400	47406	47398	47398	Margaret	255	" Do tell us more . "
47407	47463	47379	47379	his	954	" I took the Underground to Wimbledon . As I came out of the office I said to myself , I must have a walk once in a way . If I don t take this walk now , I shall never take it . I had a bit of dinner at Wimbledon , and then-- "
47464	47474	47398	47398	Margaret	255	" But not good country there , is it ? "
47475	47510	47379	47379	his	954	" It was gas - lamps for hours . Still , I had all the night , and being out was the great thing . I did get into woods , too , presently . "
47511	47517	47519	47519	Helen	254	" Yes , go on , "
47521	47536	47379	47379	his	954	" You ve no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it s dark . "
47537	47546	47379	47379	his	954	" Did you actually go off the roads ? "
47547	47577	47379	47379	his	954	" Oh yes . I always meant to go off the roads , but the worst of it is that it s more difficult to find one s way . "
47578	47588	47590	47590	Margaret	255	" Mr. Bast , you re a born adventurer , "
47592	47624	47590	47590	Margaret	255	" No professional athlete would have attempted what you ve done . It s a wonder your walk didn t end in a broken neck . Whatever did your wife say ? "
47625	47635	47637	47637	Helen	254	" Professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses , "
47639	47654	47637	47637	Helen	254	" Besides , they can t walk . It tires them . Go on . "
47655	47669	47379	47379	his	954	" I felt like R. L. S. You probably remember how in Virginibus . "
47670	47689	47637	47637	Helen	254	" Yes , but the wood . This ere wood . How did you get out of it ? "
47690	47786	47379	47379	his	954	" I managed one wood , and found a road the other side which went a good bit uphill . I rather fancy it was those North Downs , for the road went off into grass , and I got into another wood . That was awful , with gorse bushes . I did wish I d never come , but suddenly it got light -- just while I seemed going under one tree . Then I found a road down to a station , and took the first train I could back to London . "
47787	47794	47796	47796	Helen	254	" But was the dawn wonderful ? "
47804	47807	47801	47801	he	1644	" No . "
47840	47845	47801	47801	he	1644	" love of the earth "
47879	47892	48167	48168	a lady	922	" The dawn was only grey , it was nothing to mention . "
47893	47905	48167	48168	a lady	922	" Just a grey evening turned upside down . I know . "
47906	48143	48167	48168	a lady	922	" --and I was too tired to lift up my head to look at it , and so cold too . I m glad I did it , and yet at the time it bored me more than I can say . And besides -- you can believe me or not as you choose -- I was very hungry . That dinner at Wimbledon -- I meant it to last me all night like other dinners . I never thought that walking would make such a difference . Why , when you re walking you want , as it were , a breakfast and luncheon and tea during the night as well , and I d nothing but a packet of Woodbines . Lord , I did feel bad ! Looking back , it wasn t what you may call enjoyment . It was more a case of sticking to it . I did stick . I -- I was determined . Oh , hang it all ! what s the good -- I mean , the good of living in a room for ever ? There one goes on day after day , same old game , same up and down to town , until you forget there is any other game . You ought to see once in a way what s going on outside , if it s only nothing particular after all . "
48144	48152	48154	48154	Helen	254	" I should just think you ought , "
48180	48194	48177	48177	he	1647	" Curious it should all come about from reading something of Richard Jefferies . "
48195	48218	48177	48177	he	1647	" Excuse me , Mr. Bast , but you re wrong there . It didn t. It came from something far greater . "
48398	48408	48409	48409	he	311	" Then you don t think I was foolish ? "
48426	48431	48433	48433	Margaret	255	" Heavens , no ! "
48435	48443	48445	48445	Helen	254	" Heaven help us if we do ! "
48447	48471	48413	48424	the naive and sweet - tempered boy for whom Nature intended him	1651	" I m very glad you say that . Now , my wife would never understand -- not if I explained for days . "
48472	48480	48482	48482	Helen	254	" No , it wasn t foolish ! "
48488	48503	48484	48484	her	254	" You ve pushed back the boundaries ; I think it splendid of you . "
48504	48515	48413	48424	the naive and sweet - tempered boy for whom Nature intended him	1651	" You ve not been content to dream as we have-- "
48516	48523	48484	48484	her	254	" Though we have walked , too-- "
48524	48532	48413	48424	the naive and sweet - tempered boy for whom Nature intended him	1651	" I must show you a picture upstairs-- "
48552	48583	48484	48484	her	254	" Oh , bother , not to say dash -- I had forgotten we were dining out ; but do , do , come round again and have a talk . "
48584	48592	48594	48594	Margaret	255	" Yes , you must -- do , "
48604	48617	48596	48596	Leonard	311	" No , I shall not . It s better like this . "
48618	48622	48624	48624	Margaret	255	" Why better ? "
48626	48685	48596	48596	Leonard	311	" No , it is better not to risk a second interview . I shall always look back on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life . Really . I mean this . We can never repeat . It has done me real good , and there we had better leave it . "
48686	48698	48596	48596	Leonard	311	" That s rather a sad view of life , surely . "
48699	48706	48596	48596	Leonard	311	" Things so often get spoiled . "
48707	48711	48713	48713	Helen	254	" I know , "
48715	48720	48713	48713	Helen	254	" but people don t. "
48811	48830	48808	48808	Helen	254	" Go , then ; perhaps you know best ; but never forget you re better than Jefferies . "
49148	49153	49155	49155	he	311	" coffee after hall , "
49318	49321	49309	49309	her	1358	" that card "
49348	49356	49340	49340	Jacky	318	" What s that card , eh ? "
49357	49371	49340	49340	Jacky	318	" Yes , don t you wish you knew what that card was ? "
49372	49380	49340	49340	Jacky	318	" Len , who s Miss Schlegel ? "
49456	49474	49452	49452	he	311	" A lady took my umbrella , another gave me this that I might call for my umbrella "
49521	49542	49515	49515	he	311	" Well , at all events , she doesn t know about that card . Yah ! done her there ! "
49691	49694	49695	49695	he	311	" Well ? "
49706	49724	49695	49695	he	311	" I know where you ve been , but you don t know where I ve been . "
49730	49740	49725	49725	Jacky	318	" Len , I do think you might explain , "

50724	50732	50734	50738	the reader of the paper	1714	" Order , order , Miss Schlegel ! "
50740	50799	50734	50738	the reader of the paper	1714	" You are here , I understand , to advise me in the interests of the Society for the Preservation of Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty . I can not have you speaking out of your role . It makes my poor head go round , and I think you forget that I am very ill . "
50800	50816	50818	50818	Margaret	255	" Your head won t go round if only you ll listen to my argument , "
50820	50840	50818	50818	Margaret	255	" Why not give him the money itself ? You re supposed to have about thirty thousand a year . "
50841	50852	50734	50738	the reader of the paper	1714	" Have I ? I thought I had a million . "
50853	50901	50818	50818	Margaret	255	" Wasn t a million your capital ? Dear me ! we ought to have settled that . Still , it doesn t matter . Whatever you ve got , I order you to give as many poor men as you can three hundred a year each . "
50902	50910	50912	50914	an earnest girl	1715	" But that would be pauperising them , "
50930	50979	50818	50818	Margaret	255	" Not if you gave them so much . A big windfall would not pauperise a man . It is these little driblets , distributed among too many , that do the harm . Money s educational . It s far more educational than the things it buys . "
50985	50990	50992	50992	Margaret	255	" In a sense , "
50999	51021	50992	50992	Margaret	255	" Well , isn t the most civilized thing going , the man who has learnt to wear his income properly ? "
51022	51032	50818	50818	Margaret	255	" Exactly what your Mr. Basts won t do . "
51033	51213	50992	50992	Margaret	255	" Give them a chance . Give them money . Don t dole them out poetry - books and railway - tickets like babies . Give them the wherewithal to buy these things . When your Socialism comes it may be different , and we may think in terms of commodities instead of cash . Till it comes give people cash , for it is the warp of civilisation , whatever the woof may be . The imagination ought to play upon money and realise it vividly , for it s the -- the second most important thing in the world . It is so slurred over and hushed up , there is so little clear thinking -- oh , political economy , of course , but so few of us think clearly about our own private incomes , and admit that independent thoughts are in nine cases out of ten the result of independent means . Money : give Mr. Bast money , and don t bother about his ideals . He ll pick up those for himself . "
51286	51306	51308	51308	they	1717	" Nothing , but he would not gain his soul until he had gained a little of the world . "
51311	51320	51308	51308	they	1717	" No , we do not believe it , "

51881	51884	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" Cold ? "
51885	51888	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" No . "
51889	51892	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" Tired ? "
51893	51898	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" Doesn t matter . "
51910	51915	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" I say , Helen-- "
51916	51919	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" Well ? "
51920	51931	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" Are we really going to follow up Mr. Bast ? "
51932	51938	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" I don t know . "
51939	51945	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" I think we won t. "
51946	51951	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" As you like . "
51952	52010	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" It s no good , I think , unless you really mean to know people . The discussion brought that home to me . We got on well enough with him in a spirit of excitement , but think of rational intercourse . We mustn t play at friendship . No , it s no good . "
52011	52019	52020	52020	Helen	254	" There s Mrs. Lanoline , too , "
52023	52027	52020	52020	Helen	254	" So dull . "
52028	52038	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" Just so , and possibly worse than dull . "
52039	52053	52020	52020	Helen	254	" I should like to know how he got hold of your card . "
52054	52067	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" But he said -- something about a concert and an umbrella . "
52068	52076	52020	52020	Helen	254	" Then did the card see the wife-- "
52077	52084	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" Helen , come to bed . "
52085	52115	52020	52020	Helen	254	" No , just a little longer , it is so beautiful . Tell me ; oh yes ; did you say money is the warp of the world ? "
52116	52119	51899	51901	The earnest girl	1731	" Yes . "
52120	52127	52020	52020	Helen	254	" Then what s the woof ? "
52128	52135	52137	52137	Margaret	255	" Very much what one chooses , "
52139	52154	52137	52137	Margaret	255	" It s something that isn t money -- one can t say more . "
52155	52160	52020	52020	Helen	254	" Walking at night ? "
52161	52164	52137	52137	Margaret	255	" Probably . "
52165	52171	52020	52020	Helen	254	" For Tibby , Oxford ? "
52172	52177	52137	52137	Margaret	255	" It seems so . "
52178	52182	52020	52020	Helen	254	" For you ? "
52183	52210	52137	52137	Margaret	255	" Now that we have to leave Wickham Place , I begin to think it s that . For Mrs. Wilcox it was certainly Howards End . "
52247	52263	52265	52265	Margaret	255	" It is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than people , "
52267	52301	52137	52137	Margaret	255	" Why , Meg ? They re so much nicer generally . I d rather think of that forester s house in Pomerania than of the fat Herr Forstmeister who lived in it . "
52302	52353	52396	52396	His	258	" I believe we shall come to care about people less and less , Helen . The more people one knows the easier it becomes to replace them . It s one of the curses of London . I quite expect to end my life caring most for a place . "
52369	52375	52376	52376	he	258	" How do you do ? "
52379	52395	52376	52376	he	258	" I thought I recognised your voices . Whatever are you both doing down here ? "
52435	52471	52414	52416	a male escort	1760	" What an age it is since I ve seen you , Mr. Wilcox . I met Evie in the Tube , though , lately . I hope you have good news of your son . "
52472	52475	52477	52478	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Paul ? "
52490	52514	52477	52478	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Oh , Paul s all right . We had a line from Madeira . He ll be at work again by now . "
52515	52517	52519	52519	Helen	254	" Ugh-- "
52526	52532	52414	52416	a male escort	1760	" I beg your pardon ? "
52533	52543	52414	52416	a male escort	1760	" Isn t the climate of Nigeria too horrible ? "
52544	52552	52553	52553	he	258	" Some one s got to go , "
52557	52595	52553	52553	he	258	" England will never keep her trade overseas unless she is prepared to make sacrifices . Unless we get firm in West Africa , Ger -- untold complications may follow . Now tell me all your news . "
52596	52606	52608	52608	Helen	254	" Oh , we ve had a splendid evening , "
52621	52682	52608	52608	Helen	254	" We belong to a kind of club that reads papers , Margaret and I -- all women , but there is a discussion after . This evening it was on how one ought to leave one s money -- whether to one s family , or to the poor , and if so how -- oh , most interesting . "
52836	52843	52844	52844	he	1764	" Sounds a most original entertainment ! "
52854	52885	52844	52844	he	1764	" I wish Evie would go to that sort of thing . But she hasn t the time . She s taken to breeding Aberdeen terriers -- jolly little dogs . "
52886	52899	52931	52931	she	254	" I expect we d better be doing the same , really . "
52900	52911	52913	52913	Helen	254	" We pretend we re improving ourselves , you see , "
52953	52986	52931	52931	she	254	" We suppose it a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate , but , as my sister says , it may be better to breed dogs . "
52987	53034	53090	53099	a man who was old enough to be their father	1772	" Not at all . I don t agree with your sister . There s nothing like a debate to teach one quickness . I often wish I had gone in for them when I was a youngster . It would have helped me no end . "
53035	53038	52931	52931	she	254	" Quickness-- ? "
53039	53078	53090	53099	a man who was old enough to be their father	1772	" Yes . Quickness in argument . Time after time I ve missed scoring a point because the other man has had the gift of the gab and I haven t. Oh , I believe in these discussions . "
53163	53177	53179	53179	he	258	" Oh yes , it doesn t much matter what subject you take , "
53186	53200	53181	53181	Margaret	255	" But this is going to be far better than the debate itself . "
53208	53217	53218	53218	she	254	" No , I won t go on , "
53221	53233	53218	53218	she	254	" I ll just put our special case to Mr. Wilcox . "
53234	53253	53158	53158	she	254	" About Mr. Bast ? Yes , do . He ll be more lenient to a special case . "
53254	53289	53218	53218	she	254	" But , Mr. Wilcox , do first light another cigarette . It s this . We ve just come across a young fellow , who s evidently very poor , and who seems interest-- "
53290	53296	53158	53158	she	254	" What s his profession ? "
53297	53300	53218	53218	she	254	" Clerk . "
53301	53305	53158	53158	she	254	" What in ? "
53306	53313	53218	53218	she	254	" Do you remember , Margaret ? "
53314	53320	53158	53158	she	254	" Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company . "
53321	53597	53218	53218	she	254	" Oh yes ; the nice people who gave Aunt Juley a new hearth rug . He seems interesting , in some ways very , and one wishes one could help him . He is married to a wife whom he doesn t seem to care for much . He likes books , and what one may roughly call adventure , and if he had a chance -- But he is so poor . He lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense and clothes . One is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong for him and that he will sink . Well , he got mixed up in our debate . He wasn t the subject of it , but it seemed to bear on his point . Suppose a millionaire died , and desired to leave money to help such a man . How should he be helped ? Should he be given three hundred pounds a year direct , which was Margaret s plan ? Most of them thought this would pauperise him . Should he and those like him be given free libraries ? I said No ! He doesn t want more books to read , but to read books rightly . My suggestion was he should be given something every year towards a summer holiday , but then there is his wife , and they said she would have to go too . Nothing seemed quite right ! Now what do you think ? Imagine that you were a millionaire , and wanted to help the poor . What would you do ? "
53616	53676	53598	53599	Mr. Wilcox	258	" My dear Miss Schlegel , I will not rush in where your sex has been unable to tread . I will not add another plan to the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested . My only contribution is this : let your young friend clear out of the Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company with all possible speed . "
53677	53680	53682	53682	Margaret	255	" Why ? "
53689	53710	53711	53711	he	258	" This is between friends . It ll be in the Receiver s hands before Christmas . It ll smash , "
53721	53740	53598	53599	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Dear me , Helen , listen to that . And he ll have to get another place ! "
53741	53760	53598	53599	Mr. Wilcox	258	" WILL have ? Let him leave the ship before it sinks . Let him get one now . "
53761	53770	53598	53599	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Rather than wait , to make sure ? "
53771	53774	53598	53599	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Decidedly . "
53775	53780	53598	53599	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Why s that ? "
53791	53852	53783	53783	Olympian	1774	" Naturally the man who s in a situation when he applies stands a better chance , is in a stronger position , that the man who isn t. It looks as if he s worth something . I know by myself--(this is letting you into the State secrets)--it affects an employer greatly . Human nature , I m afraid . "
53853	53861	53863	53863	Margaret	255	" I hadn t thought of that , "
53869	53896	53866	53866	Helen	254	" Our human nature appears to be the other way round . We employ people because they re unemployed . The boot man , for instance . "
53897	53906	53783	53783	Olympian	1774	" And how does he clean the boots ? "
53907	53911	53913	53913	Margaret	255	" Not well , "
53915	53920	53783	53783	Olympian	1774	" There you are ! "
53921	53933	53783	53783	Olympian	1774	" Then do you really advise us to tell this youth-- ? "
53934	53939	53940	53940	he	1775	" I advise nothing , "
53958	54005	53940	53940	he	1775	" I oughtn t to have spoken -- but I happen to know , being more or less behind the scenes . The Porphyrion s a bad , bad concern -- Now , don t say I said so . It s outside the Tariff Ring . "
54006	54024	53783	53783	Olympian	1774	" Certainly I won t say . In fact , I don t know what that means . "
54025	54034	54036	54036	Helen	254	" I thought an insurance company never smashed , "
54040	54052	54036	54036	Helen	254	" Don t the others always run in and save them ? "
54053	54060	54062	54063	Mr. Wilcox	258	" You re thinking of reinsurance , "
54066	54118	54062	54063	Mr. Wilcox	258	" It is exactly there that the Porphyrion is weak . It has tried to undercut , has been badly hit by a long series of small fires , and it hasn t been able to reinsure . I m afraid that public companies don t save one another for love . "
54119	54126	54128	54128	Helen	254	" Human nature , I suppose , "
54167	54172	54164	54164	he	258	" Yes , extremely , "
54205	54213	54215	54215	Margaret	255	" And how s Howards End looking ? "
54243	54248	54193	54197	hundreds of applicants for it	1781	" It s let . "
54249	54268	54193	54197	hundreds of applicants for it	1781	" Really . And you wandering homeless in longhaired Chelsea ? How strange are the ways of Fate ! "
54269	54281	54193	54197	hundreds of applicants for it	1781	" No ; it s let unfurnished . We ve moved . "
54282	54301	54193	54197	hundreds of applicants for it	1781	" Why , I thought of you both as anchored there for ever . Evie never told me . "
54302	54367	54193	54197	hundreds of applicants for it	1781	" I dare say when you met Evie the thing wasn t settled . We only moved a week ago . Paul has rather a feeling for the old place , and we held on for him to have his holiday there ; but , really , it is impossibly small . Endless drawbacks . I forget whether you ve been up to it ? "
54368	54377	54193	54197	hundreds of applicants for it	1781	" As far as the house , never . "
54378	54519	54520	54520	He	1783	" Well , Howards End is one of those converted farms . They don t really do , spend what you will on them . We messed away with a garage all among the wych - elm roots , and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a rockery . Evie got rather keen on Alpine plants . But it didn t do -- no , it didn t do . You remember , your sister will remember , the farm with those abominable guinea - fowls , and the hedge that the old woman never would cut properly , so that it all went thin at the bottom . And , inside the house , the beams -- and the staircase through a door -- picturesque enough , but not a place to live in . "
54527	54603	54520	54520	He	1783	" Full tide . And the position wasn t right either . The neighbourhood s getting suburban . Either be in London or out of it , I say ; so we ve taken a house in Ducie Street , close to Sloane Street , and a place right down in Shropshire -- Oniton Grange . Ever heard of Oniton ? Do come and see us -- right away from everywhere , up towards Wales . "
54604	54609	54611	54611	Margaret	255	" What a change ! "
54628	54640	54618	54618	her	255	" I can t imagine Howards End or Hilton without you . "
54641	54648	54649	54649	he	1785	" Hilton isn t without us , "
54652	54658	54649	54649	he	1785	" Charles is there still . "
54659	54662	54664	54664	Margaret	255	" Still ? "
54675	54715	54618	54618	her	255	" But I thought he was still at Epsom . They were furnishing that Christmas -- one Christmas . How everything alters ! I used to admire Mrs. Charles from our windows very often . Wasn t it Epsom ? "
54716	54730	54618	54618	her	255	" Yes , but they moved eighteen months ago . Charles , the good chap"--his
54732	54792	54618	54618	her	255	dropped--"thought I should be lonely . I didn t want him to move , but he would , and took a house at the other end of Hilton , down by the Six Hills . He had a motor , too . There they all are , a very jolly party -- he and she and the two grandchildren . "
54793	54809	54811	54811	Margaret	255	" I manage other people s affairs so much better than they manage them themselves , "
54817	54848	54811	54811	Margaret	255	" When you moved out of Howards End , I should have moved Mr. Charles Wilcox into it . I should have kept so remarkable a place in the family . "
54849	54854	54855	54855	he	1787	" So it is , "
54858	54871	54855	54855	he	1787	" I haven t sold it , and don t mean to . "
54872	54882	54811	54811	Margaret	255	" No ; but none of you are there . "
54883	54957	54855	54855	he	1787	" Oh , we ve got a splendid tenant -- Hamar Bryce , an invalid . If Charles ever wanted it -- but he won t. Dolly is so dependent on modern conveniences . No , we have all decided against Howards End . We like it in a way , but now we feel that it is neither one thing nor the other . One must have one thing or the other . "
54958	54981	54811	54811	Margaret	255	" And some people are lucky enough to have both . You re doing yourself proud , Mr. Wilcox . My congratulations . "
54982	54986	54988	54988	Helen	254	" And mine , "
54990	55012	54811	54811	Margaret	255	" Do remind Evie to come and see us--2 Wickham Place . We shan t be there very long , either . "
55013	55022	54811	54811	Margaret	255	" You , too , on the move ? "
55023	55027	55028	55028	Margaret	255	" Next September , "
55031	55040	54811	54811	Margaret	255	" Every one moving ! Good - bye . "
55105	55161	55099	55099	Helen	254	" What a prosperous vulgarian Mr. Wilcox has grown ! I have very little use for him in these days . However , he did tell us about the Porphyrion . Let us write to Mr. Bast as soon as ever we get home , and tell him to clear out of it at once . "
55162	55175	55188	55188	he	311	" Do ; yes , that s worth doing . Let us . "
55199	55202	55204	55204	Margaret	255	" Sugar ? "
55206	55209	55211	55211	Helen	254	" Cake ? "
55213	55259	55211	55211	Helen	254	" The big cake or the little deadlies ? I m afraid you thought my letter rather odd , but we ll explain -- we aren t odd , really -- nor affected , really . We re over - expressive -- that s all . "
55319	55331	55313	55313	Helen	254	" The more a lady has to say , the better , "
55335	55339	55340	55340	she	254	" Oh yes , "
55343	55346	55313	55313	Helen	254	" Ladies brighten-- "
55347	55366	55313	55313	Helen	254	" Yes , I know . The darlings are regular sunbeams . Let me give you a plate . "
55367	55375	55377	55377	Margaret	255	" How do you like your work ? "
55463	55469	55470	55470	he	311	" Oh , well enough , "
55473	55484	55421	55425	people bathing upon its walls	1796	" Your company is the Porphyrion , isn t it ? "
55485	55492	55421	55425	people bathing upon its walls	1796	" Yes , that s so . "--becoming
55496	55505	55421	55425	people bathing upon its walls	1796	" It s funny how things get round . "
55506	55510	55512	55512	Helen	254	" Why funny ? "
55524	55552	55512	55512	Helen	254	" It was written as large as life on your card , and considering we wrote to you there , and that you replied on the stamped paper-- "
55553	55566	55568	55568	Margaret	255	" Would you call the Porphyrion one of the big Insurance Companies ? "
55570	55579	55512	55512	Helen	254	" It depends on what you call big . "
55580	55604	55512	55512	Helen	254	" I mean by big , a solid , well - established concern , that offers a reasonably good career to its employes . "
55605	55621	55623	55624	the employee	1798	" I couldn t say -- some would tell you one thing and others another , "
55627	55631	55633	55633	his	311	" For my own part"--he
55634	55672	55512	55512	Helen	254	head--"I only believe half I hear . Not that even ; it s safer . Those clever ones come to the worse grief , I ve often noticed . Ah , you can t be too careful . "
55712	55737	55780	55780	him	311	" I quite agree , and that s why I was curious to know ; is it a solid , well - established concern ? "
55977	55987	55989	55989	Helen	254	" We were told the Porphyrion s no go , "
55991	56004	55989	55989	Helen	254	" We wanted to tell you ; that s why we wrote . "
56005	56018	56020	56020	Margaret	255	" A friend of ours did think that it is insufficiently reinsured , "
56034	56041	56042	56042	he	311	" You can tell your friend , "
56045	56052	56042	56042	he	311	" that he s quite wrong . "
56053	56058	56067	56067	his	311	" Oh , good ! "
56102	56109	56110	56110	he	311	" Wrong , so to speak , "
56113	56119	56159	56160	every one	4407	" How so to speak ? "
56120	56132	56159	56160	every one	4407	" I mean I wouldn t say he s right altogether . "
56139	56146	56148	56150	the elder woman	1224	" Then he is right partly , "
56171	56203	56148	56150	the elder woman	1224	" Mr. Bast , I don t understand business , and I dare say my questions are stupid , but can you tell me what makes a concern right or wrong ? "
56211	56230	56159	56160	every one	4407	" Our friend , who is also a business man , was so positive . He said before Christmas-- "
56231	56241	56243	56243	Helen	254	" And advised you to clear out of it , "
56245	56260	56243	56243	Helen	254	" But I don t see why he should know better than you do . "
56374	56378	56365	56365	One	3797	" the Miss Schlegels "
56400	56406	56407	56407	he	311	" One can but see , "
56412	56420	56407	56407	he	311	" as Ibsen says , things happen . "
56533	56551	56555	56555	women	743	" How much exactly have you , and how much do you expect to have next June ? "
56663	56668	56660	56660	Margaret	255	" So YOU like Carlyle "
56676	56682	56660	56660	Margaret	255	" Mr. Wilcox , Miss Wilcox "
56691	56706	56708	56708	Helen	254	" Oh , the dears ! Oh , Evie , how too impossibly sweet ! "
56717	56725	56727	56728	Mr. Wilcox	258	" We brought the little fellows round , "
56730	56736	56660	56660	Margaret	255	" I bred em myself . "
56737	56751	56798	56805	the less successful characters of Old Testament history	1829	" Oh , really ! Mr. Bast , come and play with puppies . "
56752	56761	56763	56763	Leonard	311	" I ve got to be going now , "
56766	56775	56798	56805	the less successful characters of Old Testament history	1829	" But play with puppies a little first . "
56776	56785	56787	56787	Evie	262	" This is Ahab , that s Jezebel , "
56807	56815	56798	56805	the less successful characters of Old Testament history	1829	" I ve got to be going . "
56827	56843	56798	56805	the less successful characters of Old Testament history	1829	" Mr. Wilcox , Mr. Ba -- Must you be really ? Good - bye ! "
56844	56848	56850	56850	Helen	254	" Come again , "
56878	56893	56874	56874	He	311	" No , I shan t ; I knew it would be a failure . "
56902	56915	56894	56895	Most people	753	" A little mistake . We tried knowing another class -- impossible . "
56940	56961	56937	56937	Helen	254	" I call that a very rude remark . What do you want to turn on me like that for ? "
56976	56986	56937	56937	Helen	254	" You ask me why I turn on you ? "
56987	56990	56937	56937	Helen	254	" Yes . "
56991	57002	56937	56937	Helen	254	" What do you want to have me here for ? "
57003	57012	57014	57014	Helen	254	" To help you , you silly boy ! "
57016	57022	57014	57014	Helen	254	" And don t shout . "
57023	57052	57053	57053	He	1833	" I don t want your patronage . I don t want your tea . I was quite happy . What do you want to unsettle me for ? "
57059	57081	57053	57053	He	1833	" I put it to this gentleman . I ask you , sir , am I to have my brain picked ? "
57100	57120	57082	57083	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Are we intruding , Miss Schlegel ? Can we be of any use , or shall we go ? "
57126	57151	57153	57153	he	1833	" I m connected with a leading insurance company , sir . I receive what I take to be an invitation from these -- ladies "
57159	57180	57153	57153	he	1833	" I come , and it s to have my brain picked . I ask you , is it fair ? "
57181	57185	57187	57188	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Highly unfair , "
57205	57223	57153	57153	he	1833	" There , you hear that ? Most unfair , the gentleman says . There ! Not content with"--pointing
57225	57231	57232	57232	His	1833	Margaret--"you can t deny it . "
57248	57313	57236	57236	he	1833	" But as soon as I m useful it s a very different thing . Oh yes , send for him . Cross - question him . Pick his brains . Oh yes . Now , take me on the whole , I m a quiet fellow : I m law - abiding , I don t wish any unpleasantness ; but I -- I-- "
57314	57317	57199	57200	her father	822	" You , "
57319	57322	57236	57236	he	1833	Margaret--"you -- you-- "
57331	57345	57236	57236	he	1833	" You are the man who tried to walk by the Pole Star . "
57349	57355	57236	57236	he	1833	" You saw the sunrise . "
57358	57390	57236	57236	he	1833	" You tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all -- away past books and houses to the truth . You were looking for a real home . "
57391	57399	57401	57401	Leonard	311	" I fail to see the connection , "
57408	57412	57236	57236	he	1833	" So do I. "
57418	57579	57236	57236	he	1833	" You were that last Sunday -- you are this to - day . Mr. Bast ! I and my sister have talked you over . We wanted to help you ; we also supposed you might help us . We did not have you here out of charity -- which bores us -- but because we hoped there would be a connection between last Sunday and other days . What is the good of your stars and trees , your sunrise and the wind , if they do not enter into our daily lives ? They have never entered into mine , but into yours , we thought -- Haven t we all to struggle against life s daily greyness , against pettiness , against mechanical cheerfulness , against suspicion ? I struggle by remembering my friends ; others I have known by remembering some place -- some beloved place or tree -- we thought you one of these . "
57580	57591	57593	57593	Leonard	311	" Of course , if there s been any misunderstanding , "
57595	57609	57610	57610	He	311	" all I can do is to go . But I beg to state-- "
57626	57642	57643	57643	He	311	" You were picking my brain for official information -- I can prove it -- I-- "
57651	57658	57660	57661	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Can I help you now ? "
57667	57680	57660	57661	Mr. Wilcox	258	" May I have one quiet word with him in the hall ? "
57681	57699	57719	57719	she	254	" Helen , go after him -- do anything -- anything -- to make the noodle understand . "
57703	57706	57708	57709	their visitor	1836	" But really-- "
57711	57716	57708	57709	their visitor	1836	" Ought she to ? "
57725	57779	57722	57722	He	311	" I would have chimed in , but I felt that you could polish him off for yourselves -- I didn t interfere . You were splendid , Miss Schlegel -- absolutely splendid . You can take my word for it , but there are very few women who could have managed him . "
57780	57784	57786	57786	Margaret	255	" Oh yes , "
57789	57802	57804	57804	Evie	262	" Bowling him over with those long sentences was what fetched me , "
57806	57811	57813	57814	her father	822	" Yes , indeed , "
57816	57827	57813	57814	her father	822	" all that part about mechanical cheerfulness --oh , fine ! "
57828	57834	57836	57836	Margaret	255	" I m very sorry , "
57841	57866	57839	57839	herself	255	" He s a nice creature really . I can not think what set him off . It has been most unpleasant for you . "
57867	57875	57877	57877	he	822	" Oh , I didn t mind . "
57900	57910	57882	57882	He	822	" Oughtn t you really to be more careful ? "
57922	57933	57934	57934	she	255	" Do you realise that it s all your fault ? "
57937	57942	57934	57934	she	255	" You re responsible . "
57943	57946	57882	57882	He	822	" I ? "
57947	57970	57934	57934	she	255	" This is the young man whom we were to warn against the Porphyrion . We warn him , and -- look ! "
57976	57985	57986	57986	he	258	" I hardly consider that a fair deduction , "
57989	57993	57995	57995	Margaret	255	" Obviously unfair , "
57997	58018	57995	57995	Margaret	255	" I was only thinking how tangled things are . It s our fault mostly -- neither yours nor his . "
58019	58023	57882	57882	He	822	" Not his ? "
58024	58027	57995	57995	Margaret	255	" No . "
58028	58037	57882	57882	He	822	" Miss Schlegel , you are too kind . "
58038	58043	58045	58045	Evie	262	" Yes , indeed , "
58051	58127	57995	57995	Margaret	255	" You behave much too well to people , and then they impose on you . I know the world and that type of man , and as soon as I entered the room I saw you had not been treating him properly . You must keep that type at a distance . Otherwise they forget themselves . Sad , but true . They aren t our sort , and one must face the fact . "
58128	58133	58186	58186	her	255	" Ye -- es . "
58134	58151	57995	57995	Margaret	255	" Do admit that we should never have had the outburst if he was a gentleman . "
58152	58158	58160	58160	Margaret	255	" I admit it willingly , "
58171	58182	58160	58160	Margaret	255	" A gentleman would have kept his suspicions to himself . "
58192	58200	57995	57995	Margaret	255	" What did he suspect you of ? "
58201	58211	57995	57995	Margaret	255	" Of wanting to make money out of him . "
58212	58223	57995	57995	Margaret	255	" Intolerable brute ! But how were you to benefit ? "
58224	58260	57995	57995	Margaret	255	" Exactly . How indeed ! Just horrible , corroding suspicion . One touch of thought or of goodwill would have brushed it away . Just the senseless fear that does make men intolerable brutes . "
58261	58293	57995	57995	Margaret	255	" I come back to my original point . You ought to be more careful , Miss Schlegel . Your servants ought to have orders not to let such people in . "
58300	58318	58294	58294	She	255	" Let me explain exactly why we like this man , and want to see him again . "
58319	58336	57995	57995	Margaret	255	" That s your clever way of talking . I shall never believe you like him . "
58337	58390	58294	58294	She	255	" I do . Firstly , because he cares for physical adventure , just as you do . Yes , you go motoring and shooting ; he would like to go camping out . Secondly , he cares for something special IN adventure . It is quickest to call that special something poetry-- "
58391	58402	57995	57995	Margaret	255	" Oh , he s one of that writer sort . "
58403	58474	58294	58294	She	255	" No -- oh no ! I mean he may be , but it would be loathsome stuff . His brain is filled with the husks of books , culture -- horrible ; we want him to wash out his brain and go to the real thing . We want to show him how he may get upsides with life . As I said , either friends or the country , some"--she
58475	58510	57995	57995	Margaret	255	hesitated--"either some very dear person or some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life s daily grey , and to show that it is grey . If possible , one should have both . "
58535	58580	58513	58513	her	1840	" Your mistake is this , and it is a very common mistake . This young bounder has a life of his own . What right have you to conclude it is an unsuccessful life , or , as you call it , grey ? "
58581	58583	58513	58513	her	1840	" Because-- "
58584	58617	58513	58513	her	1840	" One minute . You know nothing about him . He probably has his own joys and interests -- wife , children , snug little home . That s where we practical fellows "
58619	58769	58513	58513	her	1840	smiled--"are more tolerant than you intellectuals . We live and let live , and assume that things are jogging on fairly well elsewhere , and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to look after his own affairs . I quite grant -- I look at the faces of the clerks in my own office , and observe them to be dull , but I don t know what s going on beneath . So , by the way , with London . I have heard you rail against London , Miss Schlegel , and it seems a funny thing to say but I was very angry with you . What do you know about London ? You only see civilisation from the outside . I don t say in your case , but in too many cases that attitude leads to morbidity , discontent , and Socialism . "
58806	58808	58803	58803	she	1843	" second line"--to
58816	58824	58825	58825	she	1843	" His wife is an old bore , "
58829	58852	58825	58825	she	1843	" He never came home last Saturday night because he wanted to be alone , and she thought he was with us . "
58853	58857	58803	58803	she	1843	" With YOU ? "
58858	58861	58862	58862	Evie	262	" Yes . "
58865	58882	58862	58862	Evie	262	" He hasn t got the cosy home that you assumed . He needs outside interests . "
58883	58888	58890	58891	the girl	877	" Naughty young man ! "
58893	58896	58898	58898	Margaret	255	" Naughty ? "
58907	58922	58898	58898	Margaret	255	" When you re married Miss Wilcox , won t you want outside interests ? "
58923	58930	58933	58934	Mr. Wilcox	258	" He has apparently got them , "
58937	58944	58898	58898	Margaret	255	" Yes , indeed , father . "
58945	58957	58959	58959	Margaret	255	" He was tramping in Surrey , if you mean that , "
58966	58973	58898	58898	Margaret	255	" Oh , I dare say ! "
58974	58981	58898	58898	Margaret	255	" Miss Wilcox , he was ! "
58982	58991	58993	58994	Mr. Wilcox	258	" M -- m -- m -- m ! "
59028	59043	58993	58994	Mr. Wilcox	258	" He said so , and about such a thing he wouldn t lie . "
59050	59076	58993	58994	Mr. Wilcox	258	" That s where I differ from you . Men lie about their positions and prospects , but not about a thing of that sort . "
59082	59095	59079	59079	his	258	" Miss Schlegel , excuse me , but I know the type . "
59096	59166	59189	59191	the real man	1851	" I said before -- he isn t a type . He cares about adventures rightly . He s certain that our smug existence isn t all . He s vulgar and hysterical and bookish , but don t think that sums him up . There s manhood in him as well . Yes , that s what I m trying to say . He s a real man . "
59328	59357	59297	59297	she	255	" Miss Schlegel , you re a pair of dear creatures , but you really MUST be careful in this uncharitable world . What does your brother say ? "
59358	59362	59297	59297	she	255	" I forget . "
59363	59370	59297	59297	she	255	" Surely he has some opinion ? "
59371	59380	59297	59297	she	255	" He laughs , if I remember correctly . "
59381	59391	59393	59393	Evie	262	" He s very clever , isn t he ? "
59404	59418	59297	59297	she	255	" Yes , pretty well -- but I wonder what Helen s doing . "
59419	59431	59433	59434	Mr. Wilcox	258	" She is very young to undertake this sort of thing , "
59459	59462	59463	59463	she	255	" Helen ! "
59466	59469	59449	59450	Mr. Bast	313	" Yes ! "
59477	59482	59449	59450	Mr. Bast	313	" You in there ? "
59483	59492	59449	59450	Mr. Bast	313	" Yes -- he s gone some time . "
59498	59506	59507	59507	she	255	" Why , you re all alone , "
59510	59524	59449	59450	Mr. Bast	313	" Yes -- it s all right , Meg . Poor , poor creature-- "
59525	59545	59449	59450	Mr. Bast	313	" Come back to the Wilcoxes and tell me later -- Mr. W much concerned , and slightly titillated . "
59546	59596	59449	59450	Mr. Bast	313	" Oh , I ve no patience with him . I hate him . Poor dear Mr. Bast ! he wanted to talk literature , and we would talk business . Such a muddle of a man , and yet so worth pulling through . I like him extraordinarily . "
59597	59601	59603	59603	Margaret	255	" Well done , "
59608	59635	59603	59603	Margaret	255	" but come into the drawing - room now , and don t talk about him to the Wilcoxes . Make light of the whole thing . "
59658	59666	59667	59667	she	254	" He s gone with my blessing , "
59670	59676	59667	59667	she	254	" and now for puppies . "
59689	59778	59682	59683	Mr. Wilcox	258	" I am really concerned at the way those girls go on . They are as clever as you make em , but unpractical -- God bless me ! One of these days they ll go too far . Girls like that oughtn t to live alone in London . Until they marry , they ought to have some one to look after them . We must look in more often -- we re better than no one . You like them , don t you , Evie ? "
59782	59808	59779	59779	Evie	262	" Helen s right enough , but I can t stand the toothy one . And I shouldn t have called either of them girls . "
60574	60578	60579	60579	she	255	" simply must , "
60792	60805	60811	60811	she	255	" Father might be of the party -- yes , father was . "
60825	60836	60838	60838	he	410	" I thought I d get round if I could , "
60840	60911	60838	60838	he	410	" Evie told me of her little plan , so I just slipped in and secured a table . Always secure a table first . Evie , don t pretend you want to sit by your old father , because you don t. Miss Schlegel , come in my side , out of pity . My goodness , but you look tired ! Been worrying round after your young clerks ? "
60912	60918	60920	60920	Margaret	255	" No , after houses , "
60929	60943	60920	60920	Margaret	255	" I m hungry , not tired ; I want to eat heaps . "
60944	60954	60838	60838	he	410	" That s good . What ll you have ? "
60955	60959	60961	60961	she	255	" Fish pie , "
60970	60994	60838	60838	he	410	" Fish pie ! Fancy coming for fish pie to Simpson s. It s not a bit the thing to go for here . "
60995	61004	61006	61006	Margaret	255	" Go for something for me , then , "
61029	61034	61036	61036	he	410	" Saddle of mutton , "
61041	61080	61036	61036	he	410	" and cider to drink . That s the type of thing . I like this place , for a joke , once in a way . It is so thoroughly Old English . Don t you agree ? "
61081	61084	61086	61086	Margaret	255	" Yes , "
61152	61163	61172	61177	those who are engaged in it	1922	" No , I didn t ; yes , you did "
61188	61205	61172	61177	those who are engaged in it	1922	" It s a golden rule to tip the carver . Tip everywhere s my motto . "
61206	61215	61172	61177	those who are engaged in it	1922	" Perhaps it does make life more human . "
61216	61245	61172	61177	those who are engaged in it	1922	" Then the fellows know one again . Especially in the East , if you tip , they remember you from year s end to year s end . "
61246	61254	61172	61177	those who are engaged in it	1922	" Have you been in the East ? "
61255	61322	61172	61177	those who are engaged in it	1922	" Oh , Greece and the Levant . I used to go out for sport and business to Cyprus ; some military society of a sort there . A few piastres , properly distributed , help to keep one s memory green . But you , of course , think this shockingly cynical . How s your discussion society getting on ? Any new Utopias lately ? "
61323	61350	61172	61177	those who are engaged in it	1922	" No , I m house - hunting , Mr. Wilcox , as I ve already told you once . Do you know of any houses ? "
61351	61356	61172	61177	those who are engaged in it	1922	" Afraid I don t. "
61357	61393	61172	61177	those who are engaged in it	1922	" Well , what s the point of being practical if you can t find two distressed females a house ? We merely want a small house with large rooms , and plenty of them . "
61394	61413	61172	61177	those who are engaged in it	1922	" Evie , I like that ! Miss Schlegel expects me to turn house - agent for her ! "
61414	61421	61172	61177	those who are engaged in it	1922	" What s that , father ? "
61422	61441	61172	61177	those who are engaged in it	1922	" I want a new home in September , and some one must find it . I can t. "
61442	61451	61172	61177	those who are engaged in it	1922	" Percy , do you know of anything ? "
61452	61460	61462	61463	Mr. Cahill	410	" I can t say I do , "
61465	61476	61541	61541	her	255	" How like you ! You re never any good . "
61477	61495	61548	61548	her	255	" Never any good . Just listen to her ! Never any good . Oh , come ! "
61496	61508	61541	61541	her	255	" Well , you aren t. Miss Schlegel , is he ? "
61637	61651	61607	61615	the guests whom it was nourishing for imperial purposes	1927	" Right you are ! I ll cable out to Uganda this evening , "
61658	61671	61676	61677	a clergyman	1928	" Their Emperor wants war ; well , let him have it , "
61685	61689	61690	61690	she	255	" Next time , "
61696	61709	61690	61690	she	255	" you shall come to lunch with me at Mr. Eustace Miles s. "
61710	61714	61676	61677	a clergyman	1928	" With pleasure . "
61715	61723	61724	61724	she	255	" No , you d hate it , "
61737	61765	61724	61724	she	255	" It s all proteids and body buildings , and people come up to you and beg your pardon , but you have such a beautiful aura . "
61766	61770	61676	61677	a clergyman	1928	" A what ? "
61771	61798	61724	61724	she	255	" Never heard of an aura ? Oh , happy , happy man ! I scrub at mine for hours . Nor of an astral plane ? "
61810	61849	61724	61724	she	255	" Just so . Luckily it was Helen s aura , not mine , and she had to chaperone it and do the politenesses . I just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth till the man went . "
61850	61883	61724	61724	she	255	" Funny experiences seem to come to you two girls . No one s ever asked me about my -- what d ye call it ? Perhaps I ve not got one . "
61884	61907	61724	61724	she	255	" You re bound to have one , but it may be such a terrible colour that no one dares mention it . "
61908	61928	61724	61724	she	255	" Tell me , though , Miss Schlegel , do you really believe in the supernatural and all that ? "
61929	61935	61724	61724	she	255	" Too difficult a question . "
61936	61945	61724	61724	she	255	" Why s that ? Gruyere or Stilton ? "
61946	61951	61724	61724	she	255	" Gruyere , please . "
61952	61957	61724	61724	she	255	" Better have Stilton . "
61958	61980	61724	61724	she	255	" Stilton . Because , though I don t believe in auras , and think Theosophy s only a halfway - house-- "
61981	61993	61994	61994	he	1929	" --Yet there may be something in it all the same , "
62001	62044	61724	61724	she	255	" Not even that . It may be halfway in the wrong direction . I can t explain . I don t believe in all these fads , and yet I don t like saying that I don t believe in them . "
62052	62076	62045	62045	He	1929	" So you wouldn t give me your word that you DON T hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it ? "
62077	62081	62083	62083	Margaret	255	" I could , "
62096	62126	62045	62045	He	1929	" Indeed , I will . When I talked about scrubbing my aura , I was only trying to be funny . But why do you want this settled ? "
62127	62133	62045	62045	He	1929	" I don t know . "
62134	62144	62045	62045	He	1929	" Now , Mr. Wilcox , you do know . "
62145	62151	62045	62045	He	1929	" Yes , I am , "
62152	62159	62045	62045	He	1929	" No , you re not , "
62179	62185	62045	62045	He	1929	" How s your house ? "
62186	62198	62045	62045	He	1929	" Much the same as when you honoured it last week . "
62199	62213	62045	62045	He	1929	" I don t mean Ducie Street . Howards End , of course . "
62214	62219	62045	62045	He	1929	" Why of course ? "
62220	62239	62045	62045	He	1929	" Can t you turn out your tenant and let it to us ? We re nearly demented . "
62240	62318	62045	62045	He	1929	" Let me think . I wish I could help you . But I thought you wanted to be in town . One bit of advice : fix your district , then fix your price , and then don t budge . That s how I got both Ducie Street and Oniton . I said to myself , I mean to be exactly here , and I was , and Oniton s a place in a thousand . "
62319	62371	62045	62045	He	1929	" But I do budge . Gentlemen seem to mesmerise houses -- cow them with an eye , and up they come , trembling . Ladies can t. It s the houses that are mesmerising me . I ve no control over the saucy things . Houses are alive . No ? "
62372	62380	62381	62381	he	1930	" I m out of my depth , "
62387	62400	62381	62381	he	1930	" Didn t you talk rather like that to your office boy ? "
62401	62425	62045	62045	He	1929	" Did I?--I mean I did , more or less . I talk the same way to every one -- or try to . "
62426	62443	62381	62381	he	1930	" Yes , I know . And how much of it do you suppose he understood ? "
62444	62558	62045	62045	He	1929	" That s his lookout . I don t believe in suiting my conversation to my company . One can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to do well enough , but it s no more like the real thing than money is like food . There s no nourishment in it . You pass it to the lower classes , and they pass it back to you , and this you call social intercourse or mutual endeavour , when it s mutual priggishness if it s anything . Our friends at Chelsea don t see this . They say one ought to be at all costs intelligible , and sacrifice-- "
62559	62563	62565	62566	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Lower classes , "
62578	62595	62565	62566	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Well , you do admit that there are rich and poor . That s something . "
62617	62663	62565	62566	Mr. Wilcox	258	" You do admit that , if wealth was divided up equally , in a few years there would be rich and poor again just the same . The hard - working man would come to the top , the wastrel sink to the bottom . "
62664	62670	62730	62730	she	1931	" Every one admits that . "
62671	62676	62565	62566	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Your Socialists don t. "
62677	62723	62730	62730	she	1931	" My Socialists do . Yours mayn t ; but I strongly suspect yours of being not Socialists , but ninepins , which you have constructed for your own amusement . I can t imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so easily . "
62760	62782	62751	62751	he	258	" I don t care . You ve made two damaging admissions , and I m heartily with you in both . "
63026	63029	63031	63031	his	258	" important change "
63211	63222	63192	63192	She	255	" Rubbish , you re a self - conscious fool ! "
63297	63303	63305	63306	her hostess	1181	" You needn t go though-- "
63308	63365	63261	63261	she	255	" I needn t , but hadn t I better ? It s really getting rather serious . We let chance after chance slip , and the end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage into the street . We don t know what we WANT , that s the mischief with us-- "
63366	63375	63377	63377	Helen	254	" No , we have no real ties , "
63384	63441	63261	63261	she	255	" Shan t I go up to town to - day , take the house if it s the least possible , and then come down by the afternoon train to - morrow , and start enjoying myself . I shall be no fun to myself or to others until this business is off my mind . "
63442	63453	63489	63489	her	1953	" But you won t do anything rash , Margaret ? "
63454	63462	63261	63261	she	255	" There s nothing rash to do . "
63463	63469	63471	63471	Tibby	259	" Who ARE the Wilcoxes ? "
63498	63515	63492	63492	she	1953	" I don t MANAGE the Wilcoxes ; I don t see where they come IN . "
63516	63522	63524	63524	Helen	254	" No more do I , "
63526	63578	63524	63524	Helen	254	" It s funny that we just don t lose sight of them . Out of all our hotel acquaintances , Mr. Wilcox is the only one who has stuck . It is now over three years , and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time . "
63579	63588	63492	63492	she	1953	" Interesting people don t get one houses . "
63589	63610	63524	63524	Helen	254	" Meg , if you start in your honest - English vein , I shall throw the treacle at you . "
63611	63621	63623	63623	Margaret	255	" It s a better vein than the cosmopolitan , "
63628	63670	63623	63623	Margaret	255	" Now , children , which is it to be ? You know the Ducie Street house . Shall I say yes or shall I say no ? Tibby love -- which ? I m specially anxious to pin you both . "
63671	63684	63524	63524	Helen	254	" It all depends on what meaning you attach to the word possible "
63685	63697	63623	63623	Margaret	255	" It depends on nothing of the sort . Say yes . "
63698	63702	63524	63524	Helen	254	" Say no . "
63709	63713	63714	63714	she	255	" I think , "
63717	63747	63714	63714	she	255	" that our race is degenerating . We can not settle even this little thing ; what will it be like when we have to settle a big one ? "
63748	63757	63759	63759	Helen	254	" It will be as easy as eating , "
63761	63847	63714	63714	she	255	" I was thinking of father . How could he settle to leave Germany as he did , when he had fought for it as a young man , and all his feelings and friends were Prussian ? How could he break loose with Patriotism and begin aiming at something else ? It would have killed me . When he was nearly forty he could change countries and ideals -- and we , at our age , can t change houses . It s humiliating . "
63848	63859	63861	63862	Mrs. Munt	264	" Your father may have been able to change countries , "
63866	63909	63861	63862	Mrs. Munt	264	" and that may or may not be a good thing . But he could change houses no better than you can , in fact , much worse . Never shall I forget what poor Emily suffered in the move from Manchester . "
63910	63915	63917	63917	Helen	254	" I knew it , "
63919	63945	63917	63917	Helen	254	" I told you so . It is the little things one bungles at . The big , real ones are nothing when they come . "
63946	64045	63861	63862	Mrs. Munt	264	" Bungle , my dear ! You are too little to recollect -- in fact , you weren t there . But the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move before the lease for Wickham Place was signed , and Emily took train with baby -- who was Margaret then -- and the smaller luggage for London , without so much as knowing where her new home would be . Getting away from that house may be hard , but it is nothing to the misery that we all went through getting you into it . "
64055	64090	64046	64046	Helen	254	" And that s the man who beat the Austrians , and the Danes , and the French , and who beat the Germans that were inside himself . And we re like him . "
64091	64096	64098	64098	Tibby	259	" Speak for yourself , "
64100	64109	64098	64098	Tibby	259	" Remember that I am cosmopolitan , please . "
64110	64116	64046	64046	Helen	254	" Helen may be right . "
64117	64124	64126	64126	Helen	254	" Of course she s right , "
64228	64230	64227	64227	she	255	" waved "
64343	64379	64332	64332	she	255	" I may have been deceived by the curate , my dear , but the young fellow who brings the midday post really is fond of me , and has , as a matter of fact-- "
64441	64449	64450	64450	she	255	" This is awfully kind of you , "
64453	64477	64450	64450	she	255	" but I m afraid it s not going to do . The house has not been built that suits the Schlegel family . "
64478	64490	64438	64438	she	255	" What ! Have you come up determined not to deal ? "
64491	64495	64450	64450	she	255	" Not exactly . "
64496	64508	64438	64438	she	255	" Not exactly ? In that case let s be starting . "
64540	64547	64548	64548	she	255	" Presumably it s very beautiful , "
64551	64560	64548	64548	she	255	" How do you like it , Crane ? "
64561	64569	64571	64572	her host	1964	" Come , let s be starting , "
64574	64588	64571	64572	her host	1964	" How on earth did you know that my chauffeur was called Crane ? "
64589	64624	64548	64548	she	255	" Why , I know Crane ; I ve been for a drive with Evie once . I know that you ve got a parlourmaid called Milton . I know all sorts of things . "
64625	64628	64629	64629	he	1964	" Evie ! "
64635	64703	64629	64629	he	1964	" You won t see her . She s gone out with Cahill . It s no fun , I can tell you , being left so much alone . I ve got my work all day -- indeed , a great deal too much of it -- but when I come home in the evening , I tell you , I can t stand the house . "
64704	64715	64716	64716	Margaret	255	" In my absurd way , I m lonely too , "
64719	64750	64716	64716	Margaret	255	" It s heart - breaking to leave one s old home . I scarcely remember anything before Wickham Place , and Helen and Tibby were born there . Helen says-- "
64751	64759	64548	64548	she	255	" You , too , feel lonely ? "
64760	64769	64716	64716	Margaret	255	" Horribly . Hullo , Parliament s back ! "
64786	64794	64796	64796	he	258	" Yes , they are talking again , "
64798	64805	64796	64796	he	258	" But you were going to say-- "
64806	64853	64548	64548	she	255	" Only some rubbish about furniture . Helen says it alone endures while men and houses perish , and that in the end the world will be a desert of chairs and sofas -- just imagine it!--rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon them . "
64854	64863	64796	64796	he	258	" Your sister always likes her little joke . "
64864	64893	64548	64548	she	255	" She says Yes , my brother says ` No , to Ducie Street . It s no fun helping us , Mr. Wilcox , I assure you . "
64894	64910	64796	64796	he	258	" You are not as unpractical as you pretend . I shall never believe it . "
65174	65185	65186	65186	he	258	" At all events you responded to my telegram promptly , "
65189	65203	65151	65151	his	258	" Oh , even I know a good thing when I see it . "
65204	65218	65151	65151	his	258	" I m glad you don t despise the goods of this world . "
65219	65231	65151	65151	his	258	" Heavens , no ! Only idiots and prigs do that . "
65232	65240	65241	65241	he	258	" I am glad , very glad , "
65259	65321	65241	65241	he	258	" There is so much ca nt talked in would - be intellectual circles . I am glad you don t share it . Self - denial is all very well as a means of strengthening the character . But I can t stand those people who run down comforts . They have usually some axe to grind . Can you ? "
65322	65329	65331	65331	Margaret	255	" Comforts are of two kinds , "
65338	65369	65336	65336	herself	255	hand--"those we can share with others , like fire , weather , or music ; and those we can t -- food , food , for instance . It depends . "
65370	65387	65388	65388	He	258	" I mean reasonable comforts , of course . I shouldn t like to think that you-- "
65531	65541	65542	65542	she	255	" I want to go over the whole house , "
65548	65585	65542	65542	she	255	" As soon as I get back to Swanage , which will be to - morrow afternoon , I ll talk it over once more with Helen and Tibby , and wire you yes or no . "
65586	65594	65596	65596	they	1977	" Right . The dining - room . "
65777	65784	65832	65832	them	1992	" Now the entrance - hall . "
65792	65798	65832	65832	them	1992	" Here we fellows smoke . "
65819	65824	65826	65826	Margaret	255	" Oh , jolly ! "
65834	65840	65841	65841	he	1993	" You do like it ? "
65860	65874	65841	65841	he	1993	" It s all rubbish not making oneself comfortable . Isn t it ? "
65875	65888	65832	65832	them	1992	" Ye -- es . Semi - rubbish . Are those Cruikshanks ? "
65889	65898	65841	65841	he	1993	" Gillrays . Shall we go on upstairs ? "
65899	65909	65832	65832	them	1992	" Does all this furniture come from Howards End ? "
65910	65921	65841	65841	he	1993	" The Howards End furniture has all gone to Oniton . "
65922	65946	65832	65832	them	1992	" Does -- However , I m concerned with the house , not the furniture . How big is this smoking - room ? "
65947	65963	65841	65841	he	1993	" Thirty by fifteen . No , wait a minute . Fifteen and a half . "
65964	65991	65832	65832	them	1992	" Ah , well . Mr. Wilcox , aren t you ever amused at the solemnity with which we middle classes approach the subject of houses ? "
66098	66100	66071	66071	she	255	" Miss Schlegel"--his
66103	66126	66071	66071	she	255	firm--"I have had you up on false pretences . I want to speak about a much more serious matter than a house . "
66131	66134	66127	66127	Margaret	255	" I know-- "
66135	66147	66071	66071	she	255	" Could you be induced to share my -- is it probable-- "
66148	66154	66155	66155	she	255	" Oh , Mr. Wilcox ! "
66168	66185	66155	66155	she	255	" I see , I see . I will write to you afterwards if I may . "
66191	66201	66186	66186	He	2003	" Miss Schlegel -- Margaret you don t understand . "
66202	66210	66212	66212	Margaret	255	" Oh yes ! Indeed , yes ! "
66214	66224	66234	66234	he	2003	" I am asking you to be my wife . "
66237	66247	66234	66234	he	2003	" I am asking you to be my wife , "
66342	66351	66332	66332	she	255	" You aren t offended , Miss Schlegel ? "
66352	66359	66332	66332	she	255	" How could I be offended ? "
66440	66445	66446	66446	she	255	" Good - bye , "
66449	66468	66446	66446	she	255	" You will have a letter from me -- I am going back to Swanage to - morrow . "
66469	66473	66410	66410	them	2005	" Thank you . "
66474	66486	66446	66446	she	255	" Good - bye , and it s you I thank . "
66487	66499	66410	66410	them	2005	" I may order the motor round , mayn t I ? "
66500	66507	66446	66446	she	255	" That would be most kind . "
66508	66521	66410	66410	them	2005	" I wish I had written . Ought I to have written ? "
66522	66527	66446	66446	she	255	" Not at all . "
66528	66534	66410	66410	them	2005	" There s just one question-- "
66607	66608	66603	66604	the others	3989	" ninnies"--young
66751	66763	66748	66748	she	255	" But I ve been through this sort of thing before . "
66814	66822	66827	66827	her	255	" Oh , sir , this is so sudden"--that
67551	67566	67502	67502	her	287	" And your English lakes -- Vindermere , Grasmere they , then , unhealthy ? "
67567	67615	67502	67502	her	287	" No , Frau Liesecke ; but that is because they are fresh water , and different . Salt water ought to have tides , and go up and down a great deal , or else it smells . Look , for instance , at an aquarium . "
67616	67653	67502	67502	her	287	" An aquarium ! Oh , MEESIS Munt , you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums stink less than salt ? Why , then Victor , my brother - in - law , collected many tadpoles-- "
67654	67662	67664	67664	Helen	254	" You are not to say stink , "
67666	67688	67664	67664	Helen	254	" at least , you may say it , but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it . "
67689	67717	67502	67502	her	287	" Then smell . And the mud of your Pool down there -- does it not smell , or may I say stink , ha , ha ? "
67718	67728	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" There always has been mud in Poole Harbour , "
67738	67756	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" The rivers bring it down , and a most valuable oyster - fishery depends upon it . "
67757	67764	67766	67766	Frieda	287	" Yes , that is so , "
67775	67779	67781	67782	their hostess	2054	" Bournemouth is , "
67794	67851	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" Bournemouth is , Poole was , and Swanage is to be the most important town of all and biggest of the three . Now , Frau Liesecke , I have shown you Bournemouth , and I have shown you Poole , so let us walk backward a little , and look down again at Swanage . "
67852	67864	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" Aunt Juley , wouldn t that be Meg s train ? "
67890	67905	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" Oh , dearest Margaret , I do hope she won t be overtired . "
67906	67923	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" Oh , I do wonder -- I do wonder whether she s taken the house . "
67924	67933	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" I hope she hasn t been hasty . "
67934	67944	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" So do I -- oh , SO do I. "
67945	67955	67956	67956	Frieda	287	" Will it be as beautiful as Wickham Place ? "
67959	68020	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" I should think it would . Trust Mr. Wilcox for doing himself proud . All those Ducie Street houses are beautiful in their modern way , and I can t think why he doesn t keep on with it . But it s really for Evie that he went there , and now that Evie s going to be married-- "
68021	68024	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" Ah ! "
68025	68041	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" You ve never seen Miss Wilcox , Frieda . How absurdly matrimonial you are ! "
68042	68049	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" But sister to that Paul ? "
68050	68053	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" Yes . "
68054	68060	68062	68063	Mrs. Munt	264	" And to that Charles , "
68067	68080	68062	68063	Mrs. Munt	264	" Oh , Helen , Helen , what a time that was ! "
68084	68110	68081	68081	Helen	254	" Meg and I haven t got such tender hearts . If there s a chance of a cheap house , we go for it . "
68111	68190	67730	67731	Mrs. Munt	264	" Now look , Frau Liesecke , at my niece s train . You see , it is coming towards us -- coming , coming ; and , when it gets to Corfe , it will actually go THROUGH the downs , on which we are standing , so that , if we walk over , as I suggested , and look down on Swanage , we shall see it coming on the other side . Shall we ? "
68311	68315	68317	68317	Helen	254	" You see , "
68322	68442	68317	68317	Helen	254	" the Wilcoxes collect houses as your Victor collects tadpoles . They have , one , Ducie Street ; two , Howards End , where my great rumpus was ; three , a country seat in Shropshire ; four , Charles has a house in Hilton ; and five , another near Epsom ; and six , Evie will have a house when she marries , and probably a pied - a - terre in the country -- which makes seven . Oh yes , and Paul a hut in Africa makes eight . I wish we could get Howards End . That was something like a dear little house ! Didn t you think so , Aunt Juley ? "
68443	68458	68460	68461	Mrs. Munt	264	" I had too much to do , dear , to look at it , "
68468	68505	68460	68461	Mrs. Munt	264	" I had everything to settle and explain , and Charles Wilcox to keep in his place besides . It isn t likely I should remember much . I just remember having lunch in your bedroom . "
68506	68561	68317	68317	Helen	254	" Yes , so do I. But , oh dear , dear , how dreadful it all seems ! And in the autumn there began that anti - Pauline movement -- you , and Frieda , and Meg , and Mrs. Wilcox , all obsessed with the idea that I might yet marry Paul . "
68562	68567	68569	68569	Frieda	287	" You yet may , "
68577	68597	68572	68572	Helen	254	" The Great Wilcox Peril will never return . If I m certain of anything it s of that . "
68598	68613	68628	68629	her cousin	860	" One is certain of nothing but the truth of one s own emotions . "
68757	68760	68762	68763	Aunt Juley	263	" Look ! "
68777	68801	68762	68763	Aunt Juley	263	" Stand where I stand , and you will see the pony - cart coming . I see the pony - cart coming . "
68844	68851	68852	68852	they	2073	" Have you got the house ? "
68891	68898	68852	68852	they	2073	" Have you got the house ? "
68904	68918	68852	68852	they	2073	" Oh , what a nuisance ! So we re as we were ? "
68919	68923	68901	68901	her	255	" Not exactly . "
68931	68935	68937	68937	Tibby	259	" Some mystery , "
68939	68947	68937	68937	Tibby	259	" We are to be enlightened presently . "
68990	68998	68999	68999	she	255	" It s just like a widower , "
69002	69021	68999	68999	she	255	" They ve cheek enough for anything , and invariably select one of their first wife s friends . "
69028	69031	69032	69032	She	255	" That type-- "
69039	69048	69032	69032	She	255	" Meg , not anything wrong with you ? "
69049	69054	69056	69056	Margaret	255	" Wait one minute , "
69061	69071	69072	69072	She	255	" But you ve never conceivably -- you ve never-- "
69077	69124	69072	69072	She	255	" Tibby , hurry up through ; I can t hold this gate indefinitely . Aunt Juley ! I say , Aunt Juley , make the tea , will you , and Frieda ; we ve got to talk houses , and will come on afterwards . "
69150	69154	69145	69145	She	255	" Oh , really-- "
69165	69169	69171	69171	Helen	254	" Don t , "
69173	69185	69186	69186	She	254	" don t , don t , Meg , don t ! "
69218	69244	69198	69198	herself	255	" Don t , don t do such a thing ! I tell you not to -- don t ! I know -- don t ! "
69245	69251	69198	69198	herself	255	" What do you know ? "
69252	69257	69259	69259	Helen	254	" Panic and emptiness , "
69261	69265	69259	69259	Helen	254	" Don t ! "
69270	69293	69294	69294	She	255	" Helen is a little selfish . I have never behaved like this when there has seemed a chance of her marrying . "
69297	69311	69294	69294	She	255	" But we would still see each other very -- often , and you-- "
69312	69321	69323	69323	Helen	254	" It s not a thing like that , "
69344	69351	69353	69353	Margaret	255	" What s happened to you ? "
69370	69376	69353	69353	Margaret	255	" But it s stupid ! "
69395	69408	69410	69410	Margaret	255	" I don t know what s happened to either of us , "
69416	69424	69410	69410	Margaret	255	" We must both have gone mad . "
69437	69444	69381	69381	her	254	" Look here , sit down . "
69445	69459	69381	69381	her	254	" All right ; I ll sit down if you ll sit down . "
69460	69477	69381	69381	her	254	" There . ( One kiss . ) Now , whatever , whatever is the matter ? "
69478	69494	69381	69381	her	254	" I do mean what I said . Don t ; it wouldn t do . "
69495	69537	69381	69381	her	254	" Oh , Helen , stop saying don t ! It s ignorant . It s as if your head wasn t out of the slime . Don t is probably what Mrs. Bast says all the day to Mr. Bast . "
69542	69545	69381	69381	her	254	" Well ? "
69546	69567	69381	69381	her	254	" Tell me about it first , and meanwhile perhaps I ll have got my head out of the slime . "
69568	69750	69381	69381	her	254	" That s better . Well , where shall I begin ? When I arrived at Waterloo -- no , I ll go back before that , because I m anxious you should know everything from the first . The first was about ten days ago . It was the day Mr. Bast came to tea and lost his temper . I was defending him , and Mr. Wilcox became jealous about me , however slightly . I thought it was the involuntary thing , which men can t help any more than we can . You know -- at least , I know in my own case -- when a man has said to me , So - and - so s a pretty girl , I am seized with a momentary sourness against So - and - so , and long to tweak her ear . It s a tiresome feeling , but not an important one , and one easily manages it . But it wasn t only this in Mr. Wilcox s case , I gather now . "
69751	69757	69381	69381	her	254	" Then you love him ? "
69761	69774	69775	69775	she	255	" It is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for you , "
69778	69802	69775	69775	she	255	" The mere fact of that grows more tremendous . Remember , I ve known and liked him steadily for nearly three years . "
69803	69808	69381	69381	her	254	" But loved him ? "
69871	69874	69864	69864	she	255	" No . "
69875	69880	69864	69864	she	255	" But you will ? "
69881	69884	69886	69886	Margaret	255	" Yes , "
69888	69907	69886	69886	Margaret	255	" of that I m pretty sure . Indeed , I began the moment he spoke to me . "
69908	69916	69864	69864	she	255	" And have settled to marry him ? "
69917	69945	69886	69886	Margaret	255	" I had , but am wanting a long talk about it now . What is it against him , Helen ? You must try and say . "
69955	69962	69963	69963	she	254	" It is ever since Paul , "
69967	69978	69864	69864	she	255	" But what has Mr. Wilcox to do with Paul ? "
69979	70047	69886	69886	Margaret	255	" But he was there , they were all there that morning when I came down to breakfast , and saw that Paul was frightened -- the man who loved me frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen , so that I knew it was impossible , because personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever , and not this outer life of telegrams and anger . "
70074	70193	69864	69864	she	255	" That s foolish . In the first place , I disagree about the outer life . Well , we ve often argued that . The real point is that there is the widest gulf between my love - making and yours . Yours was romance ; mine will be prose . I m not running it down -- a very good kind of prose , but well considered , well thought out . For instance , I know all Mr. Wilcox s faults . He s afraid of emotion . He cares too much about success , too little about the past . His sympathy lacks poetry , and so isn t sympathy really . I d even say"--she
70198	70217	69864	69864	she	255	lagoons--"that , spiritually , he s not as honest as I am . Doesn t that satisfy you ? "
70218	70225	70227	70227	Helen	254	" No , it doesn t , "
70229	70243	70227	70227	Helen	254	" It makes me feel worse and worse . You must be mad . "
70251	70294	69864	69864	she	255	" I don t intend him , or any man or any woman , to be all my life -- good heavens , no ! There are heaps of things in me that he doesn t , and shall never , understand . "
70399	70404	70405	70405	she	255	" So with him , "
70408	70446	70405	70405	she	255	" There are heaps of things in him -- more especially things that he does that will always be hidden from me . He has all those public qualities which you so despise and which enable all this-- "
70459	70555	70447	70447	She	255	" If Wilcoxes hadn t worked and died in England for thousands of years , you and I couldn t sit here without having our throats cut . There would be no trains , no ships to carry us literary people about in , no fields even . Just savagery . No -- perhaps not even that . Without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm . More and more do I refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it . There are times when it seems to me-- "
70556	70571	70405	70405	she	255	" And to me , and to all women . So one kissed Paul . "
70572	70577	70579	70579	Margaret	255	" That s brutal , "
70581	70595	70579	70579	Margaret	255	" Mine is an absolutely different case . I ve thought things out . "
70596	70611	70405	70405	she	255	" It makes no difference thinking things out . They come to the same . "
70612	70615	70405	70405	she	255	" Rubbish ! "
70631	70637	70639	70639	Helen	254	" One would lose something , "
71005	71010	71011	71011	they	2114	" Men did produce this "
71428	71445	71425	71425	she	255	" Do you remember the Embankment at Chelsea ? It can t be ten days ago . "
71446	71449	71450	71450	he	355	" Yes , "
71455	71474	71450	71450	he	355	" And you and your sister were head and ears deep in some Quixotic scheme . Ah well ! "
71475	71486	71425	71425	she	255	" I little thought then , certainly . Did you ? "
71487	71502	71450	71450	he	355	" I don t know about that ; I shouldn t like to say . "
71503	71510	71511	71511	she	255	" Why , was it earlier ? "
71514	71533	71511	71511	she	255	" Did you think of me this way earlier ! How extraordinarily interesting , Henry ! Tell me . "
71569	71572	71564	71564	He	355	" interesting , "
71590	71598	71599	71599	she	255	" I didn t think of it , "
71602	71677	71599	71599	she	255	" No ; when you spoke to me in the drawing - room , that was practically the first . It was all so different from what it s supposed to be . On the stage , or in books , a proposal is -- how shall I put it?--a full - blown affair , a kind of bouquet ; it loses its literal meaning . But in life a proposal really is a proposal-- "
71678	71682	71562	71562	them	2138	" By the way-- "
71683	71690	71691	71691	she	255	" --a suggestion , a seed , "
71702	71733	71599	71599	she	255	" I was thinking , if you didn t mind , that we ought to spend this evening in a business talk ; there will be so much to settle . "
71734	71756	71599	71599	she	255	" I think so too . Tell me , in the first place , how did you get on with Tibby ? "
71757	71762	71599	71599	she	255	" With your brother ? "
71763	71769	71599	71599	she	255	" Yes , during cigarettes . "
71770	71776	71599	71599	she	255	" Oh , very well . "
71777	71783	71784	71784	she	255	" I am so glad , "
71791	71802	71784	71784	she	255	" What did you talk about ? Me , presumably . "
71803	71808	71599	71599	she	255	" About Greece too . "
71809	71840	71784	71784	she	255	" Greece was a very good card , Henry . Tibby s only a boy still , and one has to pick and choose subjects a little . Well done . "
71841	71857	71599	71599	she	255	" I was telling him I have shares in a currant - farm near Calamata . "
71858	71877	71784	71784	she	255	" What a delightful thing to have shares in ! Can t we go there for our honeymoon ? "
71878	71883	71599	71599	she	255	" What to do ? "
71884	71897	71784	71784	she	255	" To eat the currants . And isn t there marvellous scenery ? "
71898	71918	71599	71599	she	255	" Moderately , but it s not the kind of place one could possibly go to with a lady . "
71919	71923	71784	71784	she	255	" Why not ? "
71924	71928	71599	71599	she	255	" No hotels . "
71929	71957	71784	71784	she	255	" Some ladies do without hotels . Are you aware that Helen and I have walked alone over the Apennines , with our luggage on our backs ? "
71958	71981	71599	71599	she	255	" I wasn t aware , and , if I can manage it , you will never do such a thing again . "
71987	72003	71982	71982	She	2139	" You haven t found time for a talk with Helen yet , I suppose ? "
72004	72007	71784	71784	she	255	" No . "
72008	72025	71982	71982	She	2139	" Do , before you go . I am so anxious you two should be friends . "
72026	72037	72038	72038	he	2139	" Your sister and I have always hit it off , "
72042	72070	72038	72038	he	2139	" But we re drifting away from our business . Let me begin at the beginning . You know that Evie is going to marry Percy Cahill . "
72071	72076	71599	71599	she	255	" Dolly s uncle . "
72077	72164	72038	72038	he	2139	" Exactly . The girl s madly in love with him . A very good sort of fellow , but he demands -- and rightly -- a suitable provision with her . And in the second place you will naturally understand , there is Charles . Before leaving town , I wrote Charles a very careful letter . You see , he has an increasing family and increasing expenses , and the I. and W. A. is nothing particular just now , though capable of development . "
72165	72169	72171	72171	Margaret	255	" Poor fellow ! "
72182	72214	72038	72038	he	2139	" Charles being the elder son , some day Charles will have Howards End ; but I am anxious , in my own happiness , not to be unjust to others . "
72215	72220	72221	72221	she	255	" Of course not , "
72231	72245	72038	72038	he	2139	" you mean money . How stupid I am ! Of course not ! "
72257	72296	72249	72249	he	2141	" Yes , Money , since you put it so frankly . I am determined to be just to all -- just to you , just to them . I am determined that my children shall have me . "
72297	72303	72304	72304	she	255	" Be generous to them , "
72308	72312	72304	72304	she	255	" Bother justice ! "
72313	72327	72249	72249	he	2141	" I am determined -- and have already written to Charles to that effect-- "
72328	72336	72304	72304	she	255	" But how much have you got ? "
72337	72340	72249	72249	he	2141	" What ? "
72341	72354	72304	72304	she	255	" How much have you a year ? I ve six hundred . "
72355	72359	72249	72249	he	2141	" My income ? "
72360	72393	72304	72304	she	255	" Yes . We must begin with how much you have , before we can settle how much you can give Charles . Justice , and even generosity , depend on that . "
72394	72405	72406	72406	he	2142	" I must say you re a downright young woman , "
72417	72427	72406	72406	he	2142	" What a question to spring on a fellow ! "
72428	72446	72304	72304	she	255	" Don t you know your income ? Or don t you want to tell it me ? "
72447	72449	72406	72406	he	2142	" I-- "
72450	72454	72455	72455	she	255	" That s all right"--now
72457	72506	72304	72304	she	255	him--"don t tell me . I don t want to know . I can do the sum just as well by proportion . Divide your income into ten parts . How many parts would you give to Evie , how many to Charles , how many to Paul ? "
72507	72563	72410	72410	her	255	" The fact is , my dear , I hadn t any intention of bothering you with details . I only wanted to let you know that -- well , that something must be done for the others , and you ve understood me perfectly , so let s pass on to the next point . "
72564	72572	72574	72574	Margaret	255	" Yes , we ve settled that , "
72582	72616	72574	72574	Margaret	255	" Go ahead ; give away all you can , bearing in mind that I ve a clear six hundred . What a mercy it is to have all this money about one . "
72617	72635	72410	72410	her	255	" We ve none too much , I assure you ; you re marrying a poor man . "
72636	72645	72646	72646	she	255	" Helen wouldn t agree with me here , "
72649	72743	72646	72646	she	255	" Helen daren t slang the rich , being rich herself , but she would like to . There s an odd notion , that I haven t yet got hold of , running about at the back of her brain , that poverty is somehow real . She dislikes all organisation , and probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth . Sovereigns in a stocking wouldn t bother her ; cheques do . Helen is too relentless . One can t deal in her high - handed manner with the world . "
72744	72778	72809	72818	some youths , who were also taking the evening air	2144	" There s this other point , and then I must go back to my hotel and write some letters . What s to be done now about the house in Ducie Street ? "
72779	72798	72646	72646	she	255	" Keep it on -- at least , it depends . When do you want to marry me ? "
72823	72831	72833	72833	one	3797	" Getting a bit hot , eh ? "
72845	72849	72835	72836	Mr. Wilcox	258	" I say ! "
72854	72866	72867	72867	They	2144	" Take care I don t report you to the police . "
72909	72927	72906	72906	he	258	" Evie will probably be married in September . We could scarcely think of anything before then . "
72928	72951	72906	72906	he	258	" The earlier the nicer , Henry . Females are not supposed to say such things , but the earlier the nicer . "
72952	72960	72961	72961	he	258	" How about September for us too ? "
72967	73034	72906	72906	he	258	" Right . Shall we go into Ducie Street ourselves in September ? Or shall we try to bounce Helen and Tibby into it ? That s rather an idea . They are so unbusinesslike , we could make them do anything by judicious management . Look here -- yes . We ll do that . And we ourselves could live at Howards End or Shropshire . "
73041	73143	73035	73035	He	258	" Heavens ! how you women do fly round ! My head s in a whirl . Point by point , Margaret . Howards End s impossible . I let it to Hamar Bryce on a three years agreement last March . Don t you remember ? Oniton . Well , that is much , much too far away to rely on entirely . You will be able to be down there entertaining a certain amount , but we must have a house within easy reach of Town . Only Ducie Street has huge drawbacks . There s a mews behind . "
73328	73377	73506	73506	they	2155	" Yes , in summer especially , the mews is a serious nuisance . The smoking - room , too , is an abominable little den . The house opposite has been taken by operatic people . Ducie Street s going down , it s my private opinion . "
73378	73395	73506	73506	they	2155	" How sad ! It s only a few years since they built those pretty houses . "
73396	73406	73506	73506	they	2155	" Shows things are moving . Good for trade . "
73407	73469	73506	73506	they	2155	" I hate this continual flux of London . It is an epitome of us at our worst -- eternal formlessness ; all the qualities , good , bad , and indifferent , streaming away -- streaming , streaming for ever . That s why I dread it so . I mistrust rivers , even in scenery . Now , the sea-- "
73470	73476	73506	73506	they	2155	" High tide , yes . "
73477	73479	73480	73482	the promenading youths	2154	" Hoy toid"--from
73484	73497	73499	73500	Mr. Wilcox	258	" And these are the men to whom we give the vote , "
73530	73546	73506	73506	they	2155	" However , they have their own lives and interests . Let s get on . "
73602	73616	73722	73724	A younger woman	2162	" A nice beginning , if your aunt saw you slip in alone ! "
73617	73657	73580	73580	her	2159	" But I always do go about alone . Considering I ve walked over the Apennines , it s common sense . You will make me so angry . I don t the least take it as a compliment . "
73666	73699	73658	73658	He	258	" It isn t meant as a compliment , my dear . I just won t have you going about in the dark . Such people about too ! It s dangerous . "
73700	73711	73762	73762	she	255	" Can t I look after myself ? I do wish-- "
73712	73721	73658	73658	He	258	" Come along , Margaret ; no wheedling . "
73819	73827	73818	73818	her	255	" as clever as they make them , "
73925	73927	73916	73917	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Margaret "
74136	74182	74088	74088	she	255	" You ve waked the baby . I knew you would . ( Rum - ti - foo , Rackety - tackety - Tompkin ! ) I m not responsible for what Uncle Percy does , nor for anybody else or anything , so there ! "
74183	74212	74118	74118	her	2173	" Who asked him while I was away ? Who asked my sister down to meet him ? Who sent them out in the motor day after day ? "
74213	74223	74088	74088	she	255	" Charles , that reminds me of some poem . "
74224	74250	74118	74118	her	2173	" Does it indeed ? We shall all be dancing to a very different music presently . Miss Schlegel has fairly got us on toast . "
74251	74273	74088	74088	she	255	" I could simply scratch that woman s eyes out , and to say it s my fault is most unfair . "
74274	74288	74118	74118	her	2173	" It s your fault , and five months ago you admitted it . "
74289	74293	74088	74088	she	255	" I didn t. "
74294	74298	74118	74118	her	2173	" You did . "
74299	74309	74311	74311	Dolly	2174	" Tootle , tootle , playing on the pootle ! "
74320	74366	74088	74088	she	255	" It s all very well to turn the conversation , but father would never have dreamt of marrying as long as Evie was there to make him comfortable . But you must needs start match - making . Besides , Cahill s too old . "
74367	74382	74317	74318	the child	2175	" Of course , if you re going to be rude to Uncle Percy . "
74383	74406	74088	74088	she	255	" Miss Schlegel always meant to get hold of Howards End , and , thanks to you , she s got it . "
74407	74442	74317	74318	the child	2175	" I call the way you twist things round and make them hang together most unfair . You couldn t have been nastier if you d caught me flirting . Could he , diddums ? "
74443	74572	74088	74088	she	255	" We re in a bad hole , and must make the best of it . I shall answer the pater s letter civilly . He s evidently anxious to do the decent thing . But I do not intend to forget these Schlegels in a hurry . As long as they re on their best behaviour -- Dolly , are you listening?--we ll behave , too . But if I find them giving themselves airs or monopolising my father , or at all ill - treating him , or worrying him with their artistic beastliness , I intend to put my foot down , yes , firmly . Taking my mother s place ! Heaven knows what poor old Paul will say when the news reaches him . "
74798	74811	74813	74813	he	2184	" I am not a fellow who bothers about my own inside . "
75088	75091	75055	75066	the monk , robbed of the isolation that is life to either	2200	" talking . "
75223	75244	75213	75213	He	355	" My motto is Concentrate . I ve no intention of frittering away my strength on that sort of thing . "
75245	75254	75255	75255	she	255	" It isn t frittering away the strength , "
75258	75271	75272	75272	He	355	" It s enlarging the space in which you may be strong . "
75275	75289	75272	75272	He	355	" You re a clever little woman , but my motto s Concentrate . "
75340	75346	75347	75347	she	255	" Here we all are ! "
75365	75376	75347	75347	she	255	" Here we are . Good - morning , Helen . "
75380	75388	75377	75377	Helen	254	" Good - morning , Mr. Wilcox . "
75389	75426	75459	75459	she	255	" Henry , she has had such a nice letter from the queer , cross boy . Do you remember him ? He had a sad moustache , but the back of his head was young . "
75427	75448	75377	75377	Helen	254	" I have had a letter too . Not a nice one -- I want to talk it over with you "
75475	75489	75463	75463	her	255	" Thanks to your hint , he s clearing out of the Porphyrion . "
75490	75498	75499	75499	he	355	" Not a bad business that Porphyrion , "
75514	75518	75519	75519	she	255	" Not a BAD-- "
75526	75532	75519	75519	she	255	" Surely , on Chelsea Embankment-- "
75533	75568	75463	75463	her	255	" Here s our hostess . Good - morning , Mrs. Munt . Fine rhododendrons . Good - morning , Frau Liesecke ; we manage to grow flowers in England , don t we ? "
75569	75575	75519	75519	she	255	" Not a BAD business ? "
75576	75660	75463	75463	her	255	" No . My letter s about Howards End . Bryce has been ordered abroad , and wants to sublet it -- I am far from sure that I shall give him permission . There was no clause in the agreement . In my opinion , subletting is a mistake . If he can find me another tenant , whom I consider suitable , I may cancel the agreement . Morning , Schlegel . Don t you think that s better than subletting ? "
75744	75754	76341	76341	he	2214	" When there is a sublet I find that damage-- "
75755	75779	76341	76341	he	2214	" Do excuse me , but about the Porphyrion . I don t feel easy -- might I just bother you , Henry ? "
75799	75846	76341	76341	he	2214	" You said on Chelsea Embankment , surely , that it was a bad concern , so we advised this clerk to clear out . He writes this morning that he s taken our advice , and now you say it s not a bad concern . "
75847	75881	76341	76341	he	2214	" A clerk who clears out of any concern , good or bad , without securing a berth somewhere else first , is a fool , and I ve no pity for him . "
75882	75926	76341	76341	he	2214	" He has not done that . He s going into a bank in Camden Town , he says . The salary s much lower , but he hopes to manage -- a branch of Dempster s Bank . Is that all right ? "
75927	75936	76341	76341	he	2214	" Dempster ! Why goodness me , yes . "
75937	75944	76341	76341	he	2214	" More right than the Porphyrion ? "
75945	75958	76341	76341	he	2214	" Yes , yes , yes ; safe as houses -- safer . "
75959	75972	76341	76341	he	2214	" Very many thanks . I m sorry -- if you sublet-- ? "
75973	76063	76341	76341	he	2214	" If he sublets , I shan t have the same control . In theory there should be no more damage done at Howards End ; in practice there will be . Things may be done for which no money can compensate . For instance , I shouldn t want that fine wych - elm spoilt . It hangs -- Margaret , we must go and see the old place some time . It s pretty in its way . We ll motor down and have lunch with Charles . "
76064	76070	76072	76072	Margaret	255	" I should enjoy that , "
76075	76081	76341	76341	he	2214	" What about next Wednesday ? "
76082	76106	76341	76341	he	2214	" Wednesday ? No , I couldn t well do that . Aunt Juley expects us to stop here another week at least . "
76107	76116	76341	76341	he	2214	" But you can give that up now . "
76117	76122	76124	76124	Margaret	255	" Er -- no , "
76132	76147	76341	76341	he	2214	" Oh , that ll be all right . I ll speak to her . "
76148	76215	76341	76341	he	2214	" This visit is a high solemnity . My aunt counts on it year after year . She turns the house upside down for us ; she invites our special friends -- she scarcely knows Frieda , and we can t leave her on her hands . I missed one day , and she would be so hurt if I didn t stay the full ten . "
76216	76231	76341	76341	he	2214	" But I ll say a word to her . Don t you bother . "
76232	76245	76341	76341	he	2214	" Henry , I won t go . Don t bully me . "
76246	76256	76341	76341	he	2214	" You want to see the house , though ? "
76257	76286	76341	76341	he	2214	" Very much -- I ve heard so much about it , one way or the other . Aren t there pigs teeth in the wych - elm ? "
76287	76291	76341	76341	he	2214	" PIGS TEETH ? "
76292	76301	76341	76341	he	2214	" And you chew the bark for toothache . "
76302	76312	76341	76341	he	2214	" What a rum notion ! Of course not ! "
76313	76339	76341	76341	he	2214	" Perhaps I have confused it with some other tree . There are still a great number of sacred trees in England , it seems . "
76365	76374	76375	76375	she	2215	" Oh . Mr. Wilcox , about the Porphyrion-- "
76385	76391	76393	76393	Margaret	255	" It s all right , "
76399	76406	76393	76393	Margaret	255	" Dempster s Bank s better . "
76407	76425	76382	76382	her	2215	" But I think you told us the Porphyrion was bad , and would smash before Christmas . "
76426	76455	76393	76393	Margaret	255	" Did I ? It was still outside the Tariff Ring , and had to take rotten policies . Lately it came in -- safe as houses now . "
76456	76469	76382	76382	her	2215	" In other words , Mr. Bast need never have left it . "
76470	76477	76393	76393	Margaret	255	" No , the fellow needn t. "
76478	76492	76382	76382	her	2215	" --and needn t have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced salary . "
76493	76499	76501	76501	Margaret	255	" He only says reduced , "
76507	76527	76382	76382	her	2215	" With a man so poor , every reduction must be great . I consider it a deplorable misfortune . "
76552	76567	76549	76549	him	258	" What ? What s that ? Do you mean that I m responsible ? "
76568	76575	76382	76382	her	2215	" You re ridiculous , Helen . "
76576	76581	76582	76582	He	258	" You seem to think-- "
76588	76683	76582	76582	He	258	" Let me explain the point to you . It is like this . You seem to assume , when a business concern is conducting a delicate negotiation , it ought to keep the public informed stage by stage . The Porphyrion , according to you , was bound to say , I am trying all I can to get into the Tariff Ring . I am not sure that I shall succeed , but it is the only thing that will save me from insolvency , and I am trying . My dear Helen-- "
76684	76703	76382	76382	her	2215	" Is that your point ? A man who had little money has less -- that s mine . "
76704	76731	76582	76582	He	258	" I am grieved for your clerk . But it is all in the day s work . It s part of the battle of life . "
76732	76739	76740	76740	she	2217	" A man who had little money-- "
76743	76764	76740	76740	she	2217	" has less , owing to us . Under these circumstances I consider the battle of life a happy expression . "
76765	76771	76772	76772	he	2218	" Oh come , come ! "
76776	76789	76772	76772	he	2218	" you re not to blame . No one s to blame . "
76790	76799	76582	76582	He	258	" Is no one to blame for anything ? "
76800	76821	76772	76772	he	2218	" I wouldn t say that , but you re taking it far too seriously . Who is this fellow ? "
76822	76833	76835	76835	Helen	254	" We have told you about the fellow twice already , "
76837	76891	76835	76835	Helen	254	" You have even met the fellow . He is very poor and his wife is an extravagant imbecile . He is capable of better things . We -- we , the upper classes -- thought we would help him from the height of our superior knowledge -- and here s the result ! "
76897	76905	76894	76894	his	2219	" Now , a word of advice . "
76906	76913	76772	76772	he	2218	" I require no more advice . "
76914	77039	76894	76894	his	2219	" A word of advice . Don t take up that sentimental attitude over the poor . See that she doesn t , Margaret . The poor are poor , and one s sorry for them , but there it is . As civilisation moves forward , the shoe is bound to pinch in places , and it s absurd to pretend that any one is responsible personally . Neither you , nor I , nor my informant , nor the man who informed him , nor the directors of the Porphyrion , are to blame for this clerk s loss of salary . It s just the shoe pinching -- no one can help it ; and it might easily have been worse . "
77045	77137	77270	77270	her	254	" By all means subscribe to charities -- subscribe to them largely -- but don t get carried away by absurd schemes of Social Reform . I see a good deal behind the scenes , and you can take it from me that there is no Social Question -- except for a few journalists who try to get a living out of the phrase . There are just rich and poor , as there always have been and always will be . Point me out a time when men have been equal-- "
77138	77143	77270	77270	her	254	" I didn t say-- "
77144	77191	77270	77270	her	254	" Point me out a time when desire for equality has made them happier . No , no . You can t. There always have been rich and poor . I m no fatalist . Heaven forbid ! But our civilisation is moulded by great impersonal forces "
77208	77223	77270	77270	her	254	" and there always will be rich and poor . You can t deny it "
77231	77254	77270	77270	her	254	voice)--"and you can t deny that , in spite of all , the tendency of civilisation has on the whole been upward . "
77255	77263	77265	77265	Helen	254	" Owing to God , I suppose , "
77272	77283	77270	77270	her	254	" You grab the dollars . God does the rest . "
77324	77332	77321	77321	He	2220	" She rather reminds me of Dolly . "
77340	77350	77352	77353	her sister	544	" Don t ever discuss political economy with Henry , "
77355	77364	77352	77353	her sister	544	" It ll only end in a cry . "
77365	77381	77383	77383	Helen	254	" But he must be one of those men who have reconciled science with religion , "
77386	77472	77383	77383	Helen	254	" I don t like those men . They are scientific themselves , and talk of the survival of the fittest , and cut down the salaries of their clerks , and stunt the independence of all who may menace their comfort , but yet they believe that somehow good -- it is always that sloppy somehow will be the outcome , and that in some mystical way the Mr. Basts of the future will benefit because the Mr. Brits of today are in pain . "
77473	77490	77571	77571	her	255	" He is such a man in theory . But oh , Helen , in theory ! "
77491	77501	77383	77383	Helen	254	" But oh , Meg , what a theory ! "
77502	77513	77571	77571	her	255	" Why should you put things so bitterly , dearie ? "
77514	77522	77524	77524	Helen	254	" Because I m an old maid , "
77530	77543	77524	77524	Helen	254	" I can t think why I go on like this myself . "
77614	77617	77618	77619	her aunt	546	" Margaret ! "
77622	77647	77618	77619	her aunt	546	" Magsy ! It isn t true , surely , what Mr. Wilcox says , that you want to go away early next week ? "
77648	77652	77654	77654	Margaret	255	" Not want , "
77659	77678	77654	77654	Margaret	255	" but there is so much to be settled , and I do want to see the Charles s. "
77679	77694	77696	77697	Mrs. Munt	264	" But going away without taking the Weymouth trip , or even the Lulworth ? "
77702	77712	77696	77697	Mrs. Munt	264	" Without going once more up Nine Barrows Down ? "
77713	77719	77654	77654	Margaret	255	" I m afraid so . "
77726	77737	77720	77721	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Good ! I did the breaking of the ice . "
77832	77835	77836	77836	she	254	" Yes , "
77847	77874	77836	77836	she	254	" there is a mystery . I can t help it . It s not my fault . It s the way life has been made . "
77953	77978	77933	77933	Helen	254	" Go on and marry him . I think you re splendid ; and if any one can pull it off , you will . "
77986	77990	77992	77992	she	255	" pull off , "
77995	78123	77992	77992	she	255	" Yes , there is , and I wasn t up to it with Paul . I can do only what s easy . I can only entice and be enticed . I can t , and won t , attempt difficult relations . If I marry , it will either be a man who s strong enough to boss me or whom I m strong enough to boss . So I shan t ever marry , for there aren t such men . And Heaven help any one whom I do marry , for I shall certainly run away from him before you can say Jack Robinson . There ! Because I m uneducated . But you , you re different ; you re a heroine . "
78124	78144	77992	77992	she	255	" Oh , Helen ! Am I ? Will it be as dreadful for poor Henry as all that ? "
78145	78335	77992	77992	she	255	" You mean to keep proportion , and that s heroic , it s Greek , and I don t see why it shouldn t succeed with you . Go on and fight with him and help him . Don t ask me for help , or even for sympathy . Henceforward I m going my own way . I mean to be thorough , because thoroughness is easy . I mean to dislike your husband , and to tell him so . I mean to make no concessions to Tibby . If Tibby wants to live with me , he must lump me . I mean to love you more than ever . Yes , I do . You and I have built up something real , because it is purely spiritual . There s no veil of mystery over us . Unreality and mystery begin as soon as one touches the body . The popular view is , as usual , exactly the wrong one . Our bothers are over tangible things -- money , husbands , house - hunting . But Heaven will work of itself . "
78348	78351	78336	78336	Margaret	255	" Perhaps . "
78460	78476	78477	78478	Aunt Juley	263	" Yes , I see , dear ; it s about half - way between , "
78581	78595	78597	78597	Helen	254	" I definitely dislike him , but I ll do what I can , "
78599	78610	78597	78597	Helen	254	" Do what you can with my friends in return . "
78656	78659	78597	78597	Helen	254	" pays , "
78929	78931	78920	78920	Henry	355	" strong "
78989	78993	78995	78996	Mr. Wilcox	258	" One minute ! "
79047	79064	79066	79066	his	258	" I hope that my wife -- how do you do?--will give you a decent lunch , "
79069	79135	79066	79066	his	258	" I left instructions , but we live in a rough - and - ready way . She expects you back to tea , too , after you have had a look at Howards End . I wonder what you ll think of the place . I wouldn t touch it with tongs myself . Do sit down ! It s a measly little place . "
79136	79143	79145	79145	Margaret	255	" I shall enjoy seeing it , "
79156	79204	79066	79066	his	258	" You ll see it at its worst , for Bryce decamped abroad last Monday without even arranging for a charwoman to clear up after him . I never saw such a disgraceful mess . It s unbelievable . He wasn t in the house a month . "
79205	79218	79220	79220	Henry	355	" I ve more than a little bone to pick with Bryce , "
79226	79234	79066	79066	his	258	" Why did he go so suddenly ? "
79235	79243	79066	79066	his	258	" Invalid type ; couldn t sleep . "
79244	79248	79066	79066	his	258	" Poor fellow ! "
79249	79253	79255	79256	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Poor fiddlesticks ! "
79261	79290	79255	79256	Mr. Wilcox	258	" He had the impudence to put up notice - boards without as much as saying with your leave or by your leave . Charles flung them down . "
79291	79299	79301	79301	Charles	258	" Yes , I flung them down , "
79304	79342	79391	79391	nobody	4513	" I ve sent a telegram after him , and a pretty sharp one , too . He , and he in person , is responsible for the upkeep of that house for the next three years . "
79343	79358	79410	79410	him	451	" The keys are at the farm ; we wouldn t have the keys . "
79359	79363	79391	79391	nobody	4513	" Quite right . "
79364	79378	79410	79410	him	451	" Dolly would have taken them , but I was in , fortunately . "
79379	79386	79388	79388	Margaret	255	" What s Mr. Bryce like ? "
79446	79453	79455	79455	he	258	" Now we ll be off , "
79722	79728	79730	79731	Mr. Wilcox	258	" They re all right , "
79733	79747	79730	79731	Mr. Wilcox	258	" They ll learn -- like the swallows and the telegraph - wires . "
79748	79757	79717	79720	children on the brain	2268	" Yes , but , while they re learning-- "
79758	79766	79767	79767	he	258	" The motor s come to stay , "
79770	79807	79767	79767	he	258	" One must get about . There s a pretty church -- oh , you aren t sharp enough . Well , look out , if the road worries you -- right outward at the scenery . "
80082	80091	80093	80094	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Kiss them now , and come away , "
80178	80183	80185	80185	Margaret	255	" What s happened ? "
80187	80193	80195	80195	Henry	355	" What do you suppose ? "
80207	80213	80249	80249	her	255	" Are we there already ? "
80214	80218	80249	80249	her	255	" We are . "
80219	80234	80249	80249	her	255	" Well , I never ! In years ago it seemed so far away . "
80267	80283	80264	80264	Henry	355	" That s no good ; it s locked . Who s got the key ? "
80338	80362	80333	80333	he	355	" Margaret , you wait in the dry . I ll go down for the key . It isn t a hundred yards . "
80363	80370	80333	80333	he	355	" Mayn t I come too ? "
80371	80383	80333	80333	he	355	" No ; I shall be back before I m gone . "
80581	80588	80590	80590	Margaret	255	" Naughty cow ! Go away ! "
81152	81160	81161	81161	She	254	" You will have to lose something . "
81238	81245	81246	81246	she	254	" Is that you , Henry ? "
81260	81268	81246	81246	she	254	" Henry , have you got in ? "
81354	81366	81328	81329	A woman	1045	" Oh ! Well , I took you for Ruth Wilcox . "
81370	81378	81367	81367	Margaret	255	" I -- Mrs. Wilcox -- I ? "
81379	81400	81402	81404	the old woman	4711	" In fancy , of course -- in fancy . You had her way of walking . Good - day . "
81413	81421	81423	81424	Mr. Wilcox	258	" It gave her quite a turn , "
81437	81534	81535	81535	He	258	" None of you girls have any nerves , really . Of course , a word from me put it all right , but silly old Miss Avery -- she frightened you , didn t she , Margaret ? There you stood clutching a bunch of weeds . She might have said something , instead of coming down the stairs with that alarming bonnet on . I passed her as I came in . Enough to make the car shy . I believe Miss Avery goes in for being a character ; some old maids do . "
81540	81567	81535	81535	He	258	" It is their last resource . Heaven knows what she was doing in the place ; but that s Bryce s business , not mine . "
81568	81578	81580	81580	Margaret	255	" I wasn t as foolish as you suggest , "
81581	81596	81535	81535	He	258	" She only startled me , for the house had been silent so long . "
81597	81606	81608	81608	Dolly	2351	" Did you take her for a spook ? "
81612	81614	81608	81608	Dolly	2351	" spooks "
81616	81620	81535	81535	He	258	" going to church "
81625	81629	81535	81535	He	258	" Not exactly . "
81630	81637	81639	81639	Henry	355	" She really did frighten you , "
81650	81664	81639	81639	Henry	355	" Poor Margaret ! And very naturally . Uneducated classes are so stupid . "
81665	81672	81673	81673	Margaret	457	" Is Miss Avery uneducated classes ? "
81691	81795	81639	81639	Henry	355	" She s just one of the crew at the farm . People like that always assume things . She assumed you d know who she was . She left all the Howards End keys in the front lobby , and assumed that you d seen them as you came in , that you d lock up the house when you d done , and would bring them on down to her . And there was her niece hunting for them down at the farm . Lack of education makes people very casual . Hilton was full of women like Miss Avery once . "
81796	81806	81910	81915	Her father - in - law	1389	" I shouldn t have disliked it , perhaps . "
81807	81817	81819	81819	Dolly	2355	" Or Miss Avery giving me a wedding present , "
81839	81857	81910	81915	Her father - in - law	1389	" But Charles said I must try not to mind , because she had known his grandmother . "
81858	81873	81910	81915	Her father - in - law	1389	" As usual , you ve got the story wrong , my good Dorothea . "
81874	81909	81910	81915	Her father - in - law	1389	" I meant great - grandmother -- the one who left Mrs. Wilcox the house . Weren t both of them and Miss Avery friends when Howards End , too , was a farm ? "
81969	82072	81946	81946	her	2358	" Then hadn t Mrs. Wilcox a brother -- or was it an uncle ? Anyhow , he popped the question , and Miss Avery , she said No . Just imagine , if she d said Yes , she would have been Charles s aunt . ( Oh , I say , that s rather good ! Charlie s Aunt ! I must chaff him about that this evening . ) And the man went out and was killed . Yes , I m certain I ve got it right now . Tom Howard -- he was the last of them . "
82073	82078	82080	82081	Mr. Wilcox	258	" I believe so , "
82084	82094	82096	82096	Dolly	2360	" I say ! Howards End -- Howards Ended ! "
82098	82110	82096	82096	Dolly	2360	" I m rather on the spot this evening , eh ? "
82111	82122	81946	81946	her	2358	" I wish you d ask whether Crane s ended . "
82123	82133	82096	82096	Dolly	2360	" Oh , Mr. Wilcox , how can you ? "
82134	82156	82157	82157	he	258	" Because , if he has had enough tea , we ought to go -- Dolly s a good little woman , "
82160	82182	82157	82157	he	258	" but a little of her goes a long way . I couldn t live near her if you paid me . "
82305	82309	82311	82311	Henry	355	" Curious mounds , "
82313	82323	82311	82311	Henry	355	" but in with you now ; another time . "
82542	82544	82537	82537	them	2379	" through "
82626	82632	82745	82746	two women	2383	" It is so unlucky , "
82637	82742	82745	82746	two women	2383	" that money wasn t put into it about fifty years ago . Then it had four -- five -- times the land -- thirty acres at least . One could have made something out of it then -- a small park , or at all events shrubberies , and rebuilt the house farther away from the road . What s the good of taking it in hand now ? Nothing but the meadow left , and even that was heavily mortgaged when I first had to do with things -- yes , and the house too . Oh , it was no joke . "
82773	82903	82764	82764	She	2369	" Mismanagement did it -- besides , the days for small farms are over . It doesn t pay -- except with intensive cultivation . Small holdings , back to the land -- ah ! philanthropic bunkum . Take it as a rule that nothing pays on a small scale . Most of the land you see ( they were standing at an upper window , the only one which faced west ) belongs to the people at the Park -- they made their pile over copper -- good chaps . Avery s Farm , Sishe s -- what they call the Common , where you see that ruined oak -- one after the other fell in , and so did this , as near as is no matter . "
82936	83048	82923	82923	he	355	" When I had more control I did what I could -- sold off the two and a half animals , and the mangy pony , and the superannuated tools ; pulled down the outhouses ; drained ; thinned out I don t know how many guelder - roses and elder - trees ; and inside the house I turned the old kitchen into a hall , and made a kitchen behind where the dairy was . Garage and so on came later . But one could still tell it s been an old farm . And yet it isn t the place that would fetch one of your artistic crew . "
83324	83327	83328	83328	he	258	" Extraordinary ! "
83331	83336	83328	83328	he	258	" Who told you ? "
83337	83347	83349	83349	her	2390	" I heard of it one winter in London , "
83428	83438	83439	83439	she	262	" But I never dreamt of such a thing , "
83442	83468	83439	83439	she	262	" Dad took me to call now and then , and made me ask her to Simpson s. Well , I m altogether off dad . "
83498	83503	83509	83509	she	262	" as a protest . "
83802	83820	83797	83797	She	457	" Oh , So - and - so s a good sort -- a thundering good sort , "
83861	83865	83860	83865	The " thundering good sort "	5266	" thundering good sort "
83871	83888	83860	83865	The " thundering good sort "	5266	" a fellow for whom I never did have much use , and have less now , "
84532	84559	84593	84593	them	2455	" Mr. Theobald Schlegel and Miss Helen Schlegel request the pleasure of Mrs. Plynlimmon s company on the occasion of the marriage of their sister Margaret . "
84785	84792	84768	84768	she	255	" Male and female created He them "
84942	84959	84939	84939	him	258	" For God s sake , hurry the women up ; we shall never be off , "
84965	84975	84977	84978	Colonel Fussell	468	" Not I ; I ve done my share , "
85343	85351	85352	85352	she	257	" They threaten to cut the painter , "
85355	85383	85352	85352	she	257	" and where shall we be then ? Miss Schlegel , you ll undertake to keep Henry sound about Tariff Reform ? It is our last hope . "

85592	85597	85599	85599	he	337	" I m sorry , "
85604	85621	85599	85599	he	337	" Do you mind getting out -- by the door on the right . Steady on . "
85622	85627	85629	85630	Mrs. Warrington	257	" What s happened ? "
85649	85657	85644	85644	Charles	258	" Get the women out at once . "
85705	85710	85711	85712	the ladies	957	" What is it ? "
85728	85741	85725	85725	he	258	" It s all right . Your car just touched a dog . "
85742	85746	85748	85748	Margaret	255	" But stop ! "
85752	85759	85725	85725	he	258	" It didn t hurt him . "
85760	85767	85769	85769	Myra	469	" Didn t really hurt him ? "
85771	85774	85725	85725	he	258	" No . "
85775	85780	85782	85782	Margaret	255	" Do PLEASE stop ! "
85805	85814	85787	85787	She	255	" I want to go back , please . "
85820	85828	85830	85830	another	4612	" We ve left Mr. Fussell behind , "
85832	85839	85830	85830	another	4612	" and Angelo , and Crane . "
85840	85847	85787	85787	She	255	" Yes , but no woman . "

85882	85890	85880	85880	Charles	258	" and Albert will do the talking . "
85891	85903	85905	85905	Margaret	255	" I want to go back , though , I say ! "
85931	85937	85939	85940	the others	3989	" The men are there , "
85942	85949	85939	85940	the others	3989	" They will see to it . "
85950	85973	85939	85940	the others	3989	" The men CAN T see to it . Oh , this is ridiculous ! Charles , I ask you to stop . "
85974	85980	85982	85982	Charles	258	" Stopping s no good , "
85984	85989	85991	85991	Margaret	255	" Isn t it ? "

86180	86186	86177	86177	he	337	" It was a cat . "

86350	86363	86337	86337	her	877	" Yes , madam . The girl will receive compensation for it . "
86364	86372	86374	86374	Angelo	475	" She was a very ruda girla , "

88327	88332	88318	88319	the child	2175	" What is that ? "
88337	88345	88318	88319	the child	2175	" --cut - yoke -- sack - back-- "
88346	88352	88380	88380	she	255	" I can t hear . "
88353	88361	88318	88319	the child	2175	" --On the bed -- tissue - paper-- "
88465	88483	88462	88462	Evie	262	" Dolly is a rotter not to be here ! Oh , we would rag just then ! "
88606	88609	88611	88611	Henry	355	" Burton , "
88613	88622	88611	88611	Henry	355	" serve tea and coffee from the sideboard ! "
88678	88693	88694	88694	one	3797	" Death , where is thy sting ? Love , where is thy victory ? "
88747	88752	88754	88754	he	355	" Certainly , dear , "
88756	88770	88754	88754	he	355	" Of course , I have the time . What do you want ? "
88771	88774	88819	88819	him	355	" Nothing . "
88775	88784	88754	88754	he	355	" I was afraid something had gone wrong . "
88785	88799	88819	88819	him	355	" No ; I have nothing to say , but you may talk . "
88999	89007	89008	89008	she	255	" If there is this nasty curve , "
89011	89048	89008	89008	she	255	" couldn t we walk to the church ? Not , of course , you and Evie ; but the rest of us might very well go on first , and that would mean fewer carriages . "
89049	89115	89154	89154	she	255	" One can t have ladies walking through the Market Square . The Fussells wouldn t like it ; they were awfully particular at Charles s wedding . My -- she -- our party was anxious to walk , and certainly the church was just round the corner , and I shouldn t have minded ; but the Colonel made a great point of it . "
89116	89125	89127	89127	Margaret	255	" You men shouldn t be so chivalrous , "
89130	89134	89154	89154	she	255	" Why not ? "
89310	89321	89307	89307	he	2661	" By your leave ; let me pass , please . "
89470	89478	89479	89479	she	255	" We shall never get through it ! "
89873	89877	89886	89886	she	255	well--"quite like a durbar "
90033	90042	90043	90043	she	255	" I think it did go off well , "
90046	90121	90043	90043	she	255	" Since I had to jump out of the motor , I m thankful I lighted on my left hand . I am so very glad about it , Henry dear ; I only hope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable . You must all remember that we have no practical person among us , except my aunt , and she is not used to entertainments on a large scale . "
90122	90126	90127	90127	he	2700	" I know , "
90131	90160	90127	90127	he	2700	" Under the circumstances , it would be better to put everything into the hands of Harrods or Whiteley s , or even to go to some hotel . "
90161	90167	90043	90043	she	255	" You desire a hotel ? "
90168	90194	90127	90127	he	2700	" Yes , because -- well , I mustn t interfere with you . No doubt you want to be married from your old home . "
90195	90218	90043	90043	she	255	" My old home s falling into pieces , Henry . I only want my new . Isn t it a perfect evening-- "
90219	90225	90127	90127	he	2700	" The Alexandrina isn t bad-- "
90226	90230	90231	90231	she	2700	" The Alexandrina , "
90258	90265	90127	90127	he	2700	" It s off Curzon Street . "
90266	90279	90127	90127	he	2700	" Is it ? Let s be married from off Curzon Street . "
90368	90374	90375	90375	she	2700	" Who are those people ? "
90378	90383	90385	90385	Henry	355	" They re callers ! "
90387	90395	90385	90385	Henry	355	" It s too late for callers . "
90396	90410	90360	90363	A parlour - maid	2707	" Perhaps they re town people who want to see the wedding presents . "
90411	90421	90385	90385	Henry	355	" I m not at home yet to townees . "
90422	90440	90360	90363	A parlour - maid	2707	" Well , hide among the ruins , and if I can stop them , I will . "
90532	90537	90538	90538	she	255	" What is it ? "
90541	90552	90538	90538	she	255	" Oh , what s wrong ? Is Tibby ill ? "
90570	90575	90576	90576	she	254	" They re starving ! "
90579	90585	90576	90576	she	254	" I found them starving ! "
90586	90594	90565	90565	she	254	" Who ? Why have you come ? "
90595	90599	90576	90576	she	254	" The Basts . "
90600	90605	90607	90607	Margaret	255	" Oh , Helen ! "
90609	90616	90607	90607	Margaret	255	" Whatever have you done now ? "
90617	90676	90576	90576	she	254	" He has lost his place . He has been turned out of his bank . Yes , he s done for . We upper classes have ruined him , and I suppose you ll tell me it s the battle of life . Starving . His wife is ill . Starving . She fainted in the train . "
90677	90684	90607	90607	Margaret	255	" Helen , are you mad ? "
90685	90744	90576	90576	she	254	" Perhaps . Yes . If you like , I m mad . But I ve brought them . I ll stand injustice no longer . I ll show up the wretchedness that lies under this luxury , this talk of impersonal forces , this ca nt about God doing what we re too slack to do ourselves . "
90745	90760	90607	90607	Margaret	255	" Have you actually brought two starving people from London to Shropshire , Helen ? "
90777	90787	90788	90788	she	254	" There was a restaurant car on the train , "
90791	90832	90833	90833	she	254	" Don t be absurd . They aren t starving , and you know it . Now , begin from the beginning . I won t have such theatrical nonsense . How dare you ! Yes , how dare you ! "
90841	90865	90867	90868	the house--"servants	5339	" bursting in to Evie s wedding in this heartless way . My goodness ! but you ve a perverted notion of philanthropy . Look"--she
90868	90918	90867	90868	the house--"servants	5339	house--"servants , people out of the windows . They think it s some vulgar scandal , and I must explain , Oh no , it s only my sister screaming , and only two hangers - on of ours , whom she has brought here for no conceivable reason . "
90919	90929	90931	90931	Helen	254	" Kindly take back that word hangers - on , "
90936	90940	90942	90942	Margaret	255	" Very well , "
90957	90985	90947	90947	her	255	" I , too , am sorry about them , but it beats me why you ve brought them here , or why you re here yourself . "
90986	90997	90947	90947	her	255	" It s our last chance of seeing Mr. Wilcox . "
91014	91032	90947	90947	her	255	" He s going to Scotland . I know he is . I insist on seeing him . "
91033	91040	90947	90947	her	255	" Yes , to - morrow . "
91041	91050	90947	90947	her	255	" I knew it was our last chance . "
91051	91060	91062	91062	Margaret	255	" How do you do , Mr. Bast ? "
91070	91085	91062	91062	Margaret	255	" This is an odd business . What view do you take of it ? "
91086	91094	91096	91096	Helen	254	" There is Mrs. Bast , too , "
91259	91264	91266	91267	the lady	1050	" You have fainted , "
91275	91284	91266	91267	the lady	1050	" Perhaps the air will do you good . "
91304	91315	91317	91317	Leonard	311	" I m sure I don t want to intrude , "
91326	91353	91317	91317	Leonard	311	" But you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about the Porphyrion that I wondered -- why , I wondered whether-- "
91354	91366	91368	91368	Helen	254	" Whether we could get him back into the Porphyrion again , "
91370	91391	91368	91368	Helen	254	" Meg , this has been a cheerful business . A bright evening s work that was on Chelsea Embankment . "
91402	91425	91317	91317	Leonard	311	" I don t understand . You left the Porphyrion because we suggested it was a bad concern , didn t you ? "
91426	91431	91317	91317	Leonard	311	" That s right . "
91432	91440	91317	91317	Leonard	311	" And went into a bank instead ? "
91441	91448	91450	91450	Helen	254	" I told you all that , "
91452	91485	91450	91450	Helen	254	" and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month , and now he s penniless , and I consider that we and our informant are directly to blame . "
91486	91492	91493	91493	Leonard	311	" I hate all this , "
91496	91550	91317	91317	Leonard	311	" I hope you do , Mr. Bast . But it s no good mincing matters . You have done yourself no good by coming here . If you intend to confront Mr. Wilcox , and to call him to account for a chance remark , you will make a very great mistake . "
91551	91561	91563	91563	Helen	254	" I brought them . I did it all , "
91565	91630	91450	91450	Helen	254	" I can only advise you to go at once . My sister has put you in a false position , and it is kindest to tell you so . It s too late to get to town , but you ll find a comfortable hotel in Oniton , where Mrs. Bast can rest , and I hope you ll be my guests there . "
91631	91642	91644	91644	Leonard	311	" That isn t what I want , Miss Schlegel , "
91646	91674	91644	91644	Leonard	311	" You re very kind , and no doubt it s a false position , but you make me miserable . I seem no good at all . "
91675	91682	91684	91684	Helen	254	" It s work he wants , "
91686	91692	91684	91684	Helen	254	" Can t you see ? "
91697	91743	91694	91694	he	311	" Jacky , let s go . We re more bother than we re worth . We re costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us , and they never will . There s nothing we re good enough to do . "
91744	91753	91755	91755	Margaret	255	" We would like to find you work , "
91759	91806	91755	91755	Margaret	255	" We want to -- I , like my sister . You re only down in your luck . Go to the hotel , have a good night s rest , and some day you shall pay me back the bill , if you prefer it . "
91822	91833	91834	91834	he	311	" You don t know what you re talking about , "
91837	91996	91834	91834	he	311	" I shall never get work now . If rich people fail at one profession , they can try another . Not I. I had my groove , and I ve got out of it . I could do one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary , but that s all . Poetry s nothing , Miss Schlegel . One s thoughts about this and that are nothing . Your money , too , is nothing , if you ll understand me . I mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job , it s all over with him . I have seen it happen to others . Their friends gave them money for a little , but in the end they fall over the edge . It s no good . It s the whole world pulling . There always will be rich and poor . "
92000	92009	92011	92011	Margaret	255	" Won t you have something to eat ? "
92013	92081	92011	92011	Margaret	255	" I don t know what to do . It isn t my house , and though Mr. Wilcox would have been glad to see you at any other time -- as I say , I don t know what to do , but I undertake to do what I can for you . Helen , offer them something . Do try a sandwich , Mrs. Bast . "
92151	92175	92148	92148	She	255	" Helen , I like Mr. Bast . I agree that he s worth helping . I agree that we are directly responsible . "
92176	92185	92114	92116	their overfed guests	2728	" No , indirectly . Via Mr. Wilcox . "
92186	92238	92148	92148	She	255	" Let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude , I ll do nothing . No doubt you re right logically , and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about Henry . Only , I won t have it . So choose . "
92245	92323	92114	92116	their overfed guests	2728	" If you promise to take them quietly to the George I will speak to Henry about them -- in my own way , mind ; there is to be none of this absurd screaming about justice . I have no use for justice . If it was only a question of money , we could do it ourselves . But he wants work , and that we can t give him , but possibly Henry can . "
92324	92331	92333	92333	Helen	254	" It s his duty to , "
92335	92410	92114	92116	their overfed guests	2728	" Nor am I concerned with duty . I m concerned with the characters of various people whom we know , and how , things being as they are , things may be made a little better . Mr. Wilcox hates being asked favours ; all business men do . But I am going to ask him , at the risk of a rebuff , because I want to make things a little better . "
92411	92424	92114	92116	their overfed guests	2728	" Very well . I promise . You take it very calmly . "
92425	92448	92114	92116	their overfed guests	2728	" Take them off to the George , then , and I ll try . Poor creatures ! but they look tired . "
92456	92511	92453	92453	she	254	" I haven t nearly done with you , though , Helen . You have been most self - indulgent . I can t get over it . You have less restraint rather than more as you grow older . Think it over and alter yourself , or we shan t have happy lives . "
92529	92534	92535	92535	he	355	" Was it townees ? "
92545	92552	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" You ll never believe me , "
92561	92574	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" It s all right now , but it was my sister . "
92575	92579	92580	92580	he	355	" Helen here ? "
92587	92599	92580	92580	he	355	" But she refused the invitation . I thought hated weddings . "
92600	92623	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" Don t get up . She has not come to the wedding . I ve bundled her off to the George . "
92630	92647	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" No ; she has two of her proteges with her and must keep with them . "
92648	92654	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" Let em all come . "
92655	92665	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" My dear Henry , did you see them ? "
92666	92681	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" I did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman , certainly . "
92682	92703	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" The brown bunch was Helen , but did you catch sight of a sea - green and salmon bunch ? "
92704	92714	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" What ! are they out bean - feasting ? "
92715	92738	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" No ; business . They wanted to see me , and later on I want to talk to you about them . "
92784	92799	92774	92774	Henry	355	" Why later on ? Tell me now . No time like the present . "
92800	92804	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" Shall I ? "
92805	92814	92774	92774	Henry	355	" If it isn t a long story . "
92815	92847	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" Oh , not five minutes ; but there s a sting at the end of it , for I want you to find the man some work in your office . "
92848	92854	92774	92774	Henry	355	" What are his qualifications ? "
92855	92866	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" I don t know . He s a clerk . "
92867	92871	92774	92774	Henry	355	" How old ? "
92872	92879	92554	92554	Margaret	255	" Twenty - five , perhaps . "
92880	92886	92774	92774	Henry	355	" What s his name ? "
92887	92890	92892	92892	Margaret	255	" Bast , "
92920	92926	92969	92969	her	255	" Where was he before ? "
92927	92932	92969	92969	her	255	" Dempster s Bank . "
92933	92939	92940	92940	he	355	" Why did he leave ? "
92947	92953	92969	92969	her	255	" They reduced their staff . "
92954	92963	92969	92969	her	255	" All right ; I ll see him . "
92998	93020	92988	92989	Mrs. Plynlimmon	466	" The woman who can t influence her husband to vote the way she wants ought to be ashamed of herself . "
93054	93064	93065	93065	she	255	" I should be glad if you took him , "
93068	93079	93065	93065	she	255	" but I don t know whether he s qualified . "
93080	93101	93043	93043	she	255	" I ll do what I can . But , Margaret , this mustn t be taken as a precedent . "
93102	93110	93065	93065	she	255	" No , of course -- of course-- "
93111	93126	93043	93043	she	255	" I can t fit in your proteges every day . Business would suffer . "
93127	93146	93065	93065	she	255	" I can promise you he s the last . He -- he s rather a special case . "
93147	93152	93043	93043	she	255	" Proteges always are . "
93272	93280	93282	93282	he	2736	" Your protege has made us late , "
93284	93293	93282	93282	he	2736	" The Fussells -- will just be starting . "
93587	93592	93593	93593	Margaret	255	" She s overtired , "
93596	93602	93604	93604	Henry	355	" She s something else , "
93606	93624	93604	93604	Henry	355	" This won t do . I can t have her in my garden in this state . "
93625	93628	93629	93629	Margaret	255	" Is she-- "
93633	93636	93629	93629	Margaret	255	" drunk . "
93680	93692	93693	93693	he	355	" Madam , you will be more comfortable at the hotel , "
93700	93707	93697	93697	Jacky	318	" If it isn t Hen ! "
93708	93718	93720	93720	Margaret	255	" Ne crois pas que le mari lui ressemble , "
93722	93730	93720	93720	Margaret	255	" Il est tout fait diff rent . "
93731	93734	93735	93735	she	255	" Henry ! "
93747	93755	93756	93756	he	258	" I congratulate you on your proteges , "
93759	93777	93720	93720	Margaret	255	" Hen , don t go . You do love me , dear , don t you ? "
93778	93786	93788	93788	Margaret	255	" Bless us , what a person ! "
93801	93811	93812	93812	She	255	" You re a nice boy , you are . "
93815	93823	93812	93812	She	255	" There now , I love you . "
93824	93832	93851	93851	he	258	" Henry , I am awfully sorry . "
93833	93838	93839	93839	he	258	" And pray why ? "
93864	93873	93851	93851	he	258	" To have brought this down on you . "
93874	93880	93851	93851	he	258	" Pray don t apologise . "
93885	93893	93895	93895	Margaret	255	" Why does she call you Hen ? "
93898	93906	93895	93895	Margaret	255	" Has she ever seen you before ? "
93907	93912	93914	93914	Jacky	318	" Seen Hen before ! "
93916	93941	93914	93914	Jacky	318	" Who hasn t seen Hen ? He s serving you like me , my boys ! You wait -- Still we love em . "
93942	93948	93949	93949	Henry	355	" Are you now satisfied ? "
93958	93969	93970	93970	she	255	" I don t know what it is all about , "
93973	93979	93970	93970	she	255	" Let s come in . "
94000	94006	94007	94007	he	355	" Don t you indeed ? "
94011	94027	94007	94007	he	355	" I do . Allow me to congratulate you on the success of your plan . "
94028	94038	93983	93983	she	255	" This is Helen s plan , not mine . "
94039	94096	94007	94007	he	355	" I now understand your interest in the Basts . Very well thought out . I am amused at your caution , Margaret . You are quite right -- it was necessary . I am a man , and have lived a man s past . I have the honour to release you from your engagement . "
94135	94138	94141	94141	her	2764	" So that-- "
94155	94159	94161	94162	Colonel Fussell	468	" So what ? "
94174	94192	94194	94194	his	468	" We were saying -- Henry and I were just having the fiercest argument , my point being-- "
94219	94227	94229	94229	Henry	355	" No , let me do that , "
94233	94246	94247	94248	The Colonel	2559	" Thanks so much ! You see -- he has forgiven me ! "
94252	94263	94247	94248	The Colonel	2559	" I don t expect there s much to forgive . "
94319	94328	94316	94316	Margaret	255	" So that woman has been your mistress ? "
94329	94338	94339	94339	he	468	" You put it with your usual delicacy , "
94342	94347	94316	94316	Margaret	255	" When , please ? "
94348	94351	94316	94316	Margaret	255	" Why ? "
94352	94357	94316	94316	Margaret	255	" When , please ? "
94358	94363	94316	94316	Margaret	255	" Ten years ago . "
94489	94496	94497	94497	she	254	" Mr. Wilcox is so illogical , "
94522	94571	94497	94497	she	254	" If we told him it was his duty to take you on , he might refuse to do it . The fact is , he isn t properly educated . I don t want to set you against him , but you ll find him a trial . "
94572	94583	94497	94497	she	254	" I can never thank you sufficiently , Miss Schlegel , "
94592	94707	94497	94497	she	254	" I believe in personal responsibility . Don t you ? And in personal everything . I hate -- I suppose I oughtn t to say that -- but the Wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely . Or perhaps it isn t their fault . Perhaps the little thing that says I is missing out of the middle of their heads , and then it s a waste of time to blame them . There s a nightmare of a theory that says a special race is being born which will rule the rest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing that says I. Had you heard that ? "
94708	94716	94800	94800	she	2784	" I get no time for reading . "
94717	94788	94497	94497	she	254	" Had you thought it , then ? That there are two kinds of people -- our kind , who live straight from the middle of their heads , and the other kind who can t , because their heads have no middle ? They can t say I. They AREN T in fact , and so they re supermen . Pierpont Morgan has never said I in his life . "
94814	94822	94823	94823	he	311	" I never got on to Nietzsche , "
94826	94842	94823	94823	he	311	" But I always understood that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists . "
94843	94851	94853	94853	Helen	254	" Oh no , that s wrong , "
94855	94937	94853	94853	Helen	254	" No superman ever said I want , because I want must lead to the question , Who am I ? and so to Pity and to Justice . He only says want . Want Europe , if he s Napoleon ; want wives , if he s Bluebeard ; want Botticelli , if he s Pierpont Morgan . Never the I ; and if you could pierce through the superman , you d find panic and emptiness in the middle . "
94949	94970	94946	94946	he	311	" May I take it , Miss Schlegel , that you and I are both the sort that say I ? "
94971	94975	94946	94946	he	311	" Of course . "
94976	94983	94946	94946	he	311	" And your sister , too ? "
94984	94988	94990	94990	Helen	254	" Of course , "
95009	95015	94996	94996	She	254	" All presentable people say I. "
95016	95025	95057	95057	she	254	" But Mr. Wilcox -- he is not perhaps-- "
95026	95041	94996	94996	She	254	" I don t know that it s any good discussing Mr. Wilcox either . "
95042	95049	95050	95050	he	311	" Quite so , quite so , "
95210	95212	95207	95207	Helen	254	" his "
95423	95433	95434	95434	she	1358	" Mrs. Bast -- does she ever say I ? "
95443	95449	95434	95434	she	1358	" Is she very tired ? "
95450	95460	95462	95462	Leonard	311	" It s better she stops in her room , "
95464	95472	95434	95434	she	1358	" Shall I sit up with her ? "
95473	95485	95434	95434	she	1358	" No , thank you ; she does not need company . "
95486	95498	95434	95434	she	1358	" Mr. Bast , what kind of woman is your wife ? "
95506	95522	95434	95434	she	1358	" You ought to know my ways by now . Does that question offend you ? "
95523	95534	95434	95434	she	1358	" No , oh no , Miss Schlegel , no . "
95535	95561	95434	95434	she	1358	" Because I love honesty . Don t pretend your marriage has been a happy one . You and she can have nothing in common . "
95572	95639	95562	95562	He	311	" I suppose that s pretty obvious ; but Jacky never meant to do anybody any harm . When things went wrong , or I heard things , I used to think it was her fault , but , looking back , it s more mine . I needn t have married her , but as I have I must stick to her and keep her . "
95640	95648	95434	95434	she	1358	" How long have you been married ? "
95649	95654	95562	95562	He	311	" Nearly three years . "
95655	95662	95434	95434	she	1358	" What did your people say ? "
95663	95694	95562	95562	He	311	" They will not have anything to do with us . They had a sort of family council when they heard I was married , and cut us off altogether . "
95705	95714	95715	95715	she	254	" My good boy , what a mess ! "
95719	95725	95715	95715	she	254	" Who are your people ? "
95758	95763	95750	95750	his	2796	" And your grandparents ? "
95778	95786	95787	95787	he	311	" They were just nothing at all , "
95789	95796	95787	95787	he	311	" agricultural labourers and that sort . "
95797	95804	95750	95750	his	2796	" So ! From which part ? "
95805	95827	95787	95787	he	311	" Lincolnshire mostly , but my mother s father -- he , oddly enough , came from these parts round here . "
95828	95860	95750	95750	his	2796	" From this very Shropshire . Yes , that is odd . My mother s people were Lancashire . But why do your brother and your sisters object to Mrs. Bast ? "
95861	95869	95787	95787	he	311	" Oh , I don t know . "
95870	95913	95750	95750	his	2796	" Excuse me , you do know . I am not a baby . I can bear anything you tell me , and the more you tell the more I shall be able to help . Have they heard anything against her ? "
95918	95926	95928	95928	Helen	254	" I think I have guessed now , "
95932	95946	96018	96019	the man	717	" I don t think so , Miss Schlegel ; I hope not . "
95947	96004	96018	96019	the man	717	" We must be honest , even over these things . I have guessed . I am frightfully , dreadfully sorry , but it does not make the least difference to me . I shall feel just the same to both of you . I blame , not your wife for these things , but men . "
96057	96063	96064	96064	he	717	" Don t you worry , "
96067	96133	96064	96064	he	717	" I can t bear that . We shall be all right if I get work . If I could only get work -- something regular to do . Then it wouldn t be so bad again . I don t trouble after books as I used . I can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again . It stops one thinking . "
96134	96140	96052	96052	her	254	" Settle down to what ? "
96141	96148	96064	96064	he	717	" Oh , just settle down . "
96149	96157	96159	96159	Helen	254	" And that s to be life ! "
96168	96190	96159	96159	Helen	254	" How can you , with all the beautiful things to see and do -- with music -- with walking at night-- "
96191	96203	96204	96204	he	717	" Walking is well enough when a man s in work , "
96207	96298	96204	96204	he	717	" Oh , I did talk a lot of nonsense once , but there s nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out of you . When I saw him fingering my Ruskins and Stevensons , I seemed to see life straight and real , and it isn t a pretty sight . My books are back again , thanks to you , but they ll never be the same to me again , and I shan t ever again think night in the woods is wonderful . "
96299	96303	96305	96305	Helen	254	" Why not ? "
96312	96321	96159	96159	Helen	254	" Because I see one must have money . "
96322	96329	96159	96159	Helen	254	" Well , you re wrong . "
96330	96410	96159	96159	Helen	254	" I wish I was wrong , but -- the clergyman -- he has money of his own , or else he s paid ; the poet or the musician -- just the same ; the tramp -- he s no different . The tramp goes to the workhouse in the end , and is paid for with other people s money . Miss Schlegel , the real thing s money , and all the rest is a dream . "
96411	96422	96159	96159	Helen	254	" You re still wrong . You ve forgotten Death . "
96428	96557	96159	96159	Helen	254	" If we lived forever , what you say would be true . But we have to die , we have to leave life presently . Injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever . As it is , we must hold to other things , because Death is coming . I love Death -- not morbidly , but because He explains . He shows me the emptiness of Money . Death and Money are the eternal foes . Not Death and Life . Never mind what lies behind Death , Mr. Bast , but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say , I am I. "
96558	96562	96159	96159	Helen	254	" I wonder . "
96563	96639	96159	96159	Helen	254	" We are all in a mist -- I know , but I can help you this far -- men like the Wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any . Sane , sound Englishmen ! building up empires , levelling all the world into what they call common sense . But mention Death to them and they re offended , because Death s really Imperial , and He cries out against them for ever . "
96640	96651	96159	96159	Helen	254	" I am as afraid of Death as any one . "
96652	96661	96159	96159	Helen	254	" But not of the idea of Death . "
96662	96669	96159	96159	Helen	254	" But what is the difference ? "
96670	96674	96676	96676	Helen	254	" Infinite difference , "
96793	96799	96800	96800	he	258	" I must be stupid , "
96814	96827	96800	96800	he	258	" Death destroys a man : the idea of Death saves him . "
96917	96923	96925	96926	the girl	877	" So never give in , "
97098	97103	97104	97104	she	255	" My dearest boy , "
97107	97159	97104	97104	she	255	" this is not to part us . It is everything or nothing , and I mean it to be nothing . It happened long before we ever met , and even if it had happened since , I should be writing the same , I hope . I do understand . "
97164	97168	97161	97161	she	255	" I do understand "
97189	97196	97184	97184	She	255	" It is everything or nothing . "
97217	97225	97226	97226	she	255	" I think that ll about do , "
97459	97466	97467	97468	the gods	1810	" Men did produce one jewel , "
97534	97540	97523	97523	she	255	" DEAR MR . BAST , "
97541	97568	97523	97523	she	255	" I have spoken to Mr. Wilcox about you , as I promised , and am sorry to say that he has no vacancy for you . "
97569	97573	97523	97523	she	255	" Yours truly , "
97574	97579	97523	97523	she	255	" M. J. SCHLEGEL . "
97617	97621	97523	97523	she	255	" DEAR HELEN , "
97622	97696	97608	97608	she	255	" Give him this . The Basts are no good . Henry found the woman drunk on the lawn . I am having a room got ready for you here , and will you please come round at once on getting this ? The Basts are not at all the type we should trouble about . I may go round to them myself in the morning , and do anything that is fair . "
97697	97699	97707	97707	she	255	" M. "
97892	97897	97898	97898	he	355	" Who s there ? "
97912	97920	97921	97921	she	255	" I have asked Helen to sleep , "
97924	97939	97921	97921	she	255	" She is best here ; so don t lock the front - door . "
97940	97949	97951	97951	Henry	355	" I thought some one had got in , "
97953	97985	97902	97903	the householder	2843	" At the same time I told the man that we could do nothing for him . I don t know about later , but now the Basts must clearly go . "
97986	98000	98063	98064	the servants	4350	" Did you say that your sister is sleeping here , after all ? "
98001	98004	97902	97903	the householder	2843	" Probably . "
98005	98016	98063	98064	the servants	4350	" Is she to be shown up to your room ? "
98017	98050	97902	97903	the householder	2843	" I have naturally nothing to say to her ; I am going to bed . Will you tell the servants about Helen ? Could some one go to carry her bag ? "
98066	98081	97902	97903	the householder	2843	" You must make more noise than that if you want them to hear . "
98096	98103	98104	98104	he	355	" Far too much screaming there , "
98562	98565	98567	98567	her	255	" Henry dear-- "
98628	98655	98621	98621	she	255	" Henry dear , look at me . No , I won t have you shirking . Look at me . There . That s all . "
98656	98664	98665	98665	he	355	" You re referring to last evening , "
98669	98710	98665	98665	he	355	" I have released you from your engagement . I could find excuses , but I won t. No , I won t. A thousand times no . I m a bad lot , and must be left at that . "
98750	98782	98713	98713	his	355	" Leave it where you will , boy . It s not going to trouble us ; I know what I m talking about , and it will make no difference . "
98783	98787	98788	98788	he	355	" No difference ? "
98791	98807	98713	98713	his	355	" No difference , when you find that I am not the fellow you thought ? "
98896	98903	98904	98904	he	355	" I am unworthy of you , "
98907	98947	98904	98904	he	355	" Had I been worthy , I should not have released you from your engagement . I know what I am talking about . I can t bear to talk of such things . We had better leave it . "
98969	99012	98963	98963	his	355	" You , with your sheltered life , and refined pursuits , and friends , and books , you and your sister , and women like you -- I say , how can you guess the temptations that lie round a man ? "
99013	99020	99022	99022	Margaret	255	" It is difficult for us , "
99024	99036	99022	99022	Margaret	255	" but if we are worth marrying , we do guess . "
99037	99080	98963	98963	his	355	" Cut off from decent society and family ties , what do you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows overseas ? Isolated . No one near . I know by bitter experience , and yet you say it makes no difference . "
99081	99086	99022	99022	Margaret	255	" Not to me . "
99166	99171	99172	99172	she	255	" Did Helen come ? "
99180	99202	99177	99177	his	2869	" But that won t do at all , at all ! We don t want her gossiping with Mrs. Bast . "
99203	99209	99210	99210	he	2869	" Good God ! no ! "
99222	99247	99217	99217	he	2869	" Let them gossip , my game s up , though I thank you for your unselfishness -- little as my thanks are worth . "
99248	99259	99177	99177	his	2869	" Didn t she send me a message or anything ? "
99260	99266	99217	99217	he	2869	" I heard of none . "
99267	99276	99177	99177	his	2869	" Would you ring the bell , please ? "
99277	99282	99217	99217	he	2869	" What to do ? "
99283	99289	99177	99177	his	2869	" Why , to inquire . "
99339	99347	99349	99349	Margaret	255	" I ll go , thank you , "
99355	99361	99363	99363	Henry	355	" It is no good , "
99365	99411	99412	99412	He	355	" Those things leak out ; you can not stop a story once it has started . I have known cases of other men -- I despised them once , I thought that I m different , I shall never be tempted . Oh , Margaret-- "
99432	99530	99423	99423	She	255	" We fellows all come to grief once in our time . Will you believe that ? There are moments when the strongest man-- Let him who standeth , take heed lest he fall . That s true , isn t it ? If you knew all , you would excuse me . I was far from good influences -- far even from England . I was very , very lonely , and longed for a woman s voice . That s enough . I have told you too much already for you to forgive me now . "
99531	99540	99611	99611	He	2876	" Yes , that s enough , dear . "
99541	99543	99545	99545	his	2874	" I have"--he
99546	99552	99611	99611	He	2876	voice--"I have been through hell . "
99574	99586	99563	99563	he	2874	" There ! that s over . Now for respectable life again "
99747	99756	99744	99744	she	2875	" I have already forgiven you , Henry . "
100003	100030	99998	99999	her clients	2895	" Well , let them go -- the man and his wife , I mean , for the more we see of your sister the better . "
100031	100074	100121	100121	her	255	" But they have gone separately -- Helen very early , the Basts just before I arrived . They have left no message . They have answered neither of my notes . I don t like to think what it all means . "
100075	100084	99998	99999	her clients	2895	" What did you say in the notes ? "
100085	100092	100121	100121	her	255	" I told you last night . "
100093	100111	99998	99999	her clients	2895	" Oh -- ah -- yes ! Dear , would you like one turn in the garden ? "
100197	100243	100175	100175	she	255	" I am afraid there has been gossiping of some kind at the George . Helen would not have left unless she had heard something . I mismanaged that . It is wretched . I ought to have parted her from that woman at once . "
100244	100247	100248	100248	he	2896	" Margaret ! "
100256	100263	100175	100175	she	255	" Yes -- yes , Henry ? "
100264	100315	100175	100175	she	255	" I am far from a saint -- in fact , the reverse -- but you have taken me , for better or worse . Bygones must be bygones . You have promised to forgive me . Margaret , a promise is a promise . Never mention that woman again . "
100316	100325	100175	100175	she	255	" Except for some practical reason -- never . "
100326	100332	100175	100175	she	255	" Practical ! You practical ! "
100333	100340	100341	100341	she	255	" Yes , I m practical , "
100414	100424	100425	100425	he	2896	" At all events , you mustn t worry , "
100428	100436	100425	100425	he	2896	" This is a man s business . "
100441	100450	100425	100425	he	2896	" On no account mention it to anybody . "
101363	101370	101371	101371	she	1391	" I have come from Oniton , "
101374	101385	101371	101371	she	1391	" There has been a great deal of trouble there . "
101386	101392	101394	101394	Tibby	259	" Who s for lunch ? "
101416	101423	101424	101424	he	259	" Why such an early start ? "
101427	101438	101371	101371	she	1391	" Sunrise or something -- when I could get away . "
101439	101446	101371	101371	she	1391	" So I surmise . Why ? "
101447	101500	101371	101371	she	1391	" I don t know what s to be done , Tibby . I am very much upset at a piece of news that concerns Meg , and do not want to face her , and I am not going back to Wickham Place . I stopped here to tell you this . "
101558	101582	101552	101552	Helen	254	" Give Meg my love and say that I want to be alone . I mean to go to Munich or else Bonn . "
101583	101591	101593	101594	her brother	576	" Such a message is easily given , "
101596	101672	101673	101673	She	254	" As regards Wickham Place and my share of the furniture , you and she are to do exactly as you like . My own feeling is that everything may just as well be sold . What does one want with dusty economic books , which have made the world no better , or with mother s hideous chiffoniers ? I have also another commission for you . I want you to deliver a letter . "
101677	101694	101695	101695	She	254	" I haven t written it yet . Why shouldn t I post it , though ? "
101700	101720	101695	101695	She	254	" My head is rather wretched . I hope that none of your friends are likely to come in . "
101748	101752	101754	101754	Helen	254	" Not there , "
101855	101864	101865	101865	he	259	" Do you mind Mrs. Martlett coming in ? "
101868	101880	101865	101865	he	259	" or shall I take it from her at the door ? "
101881	101890	101865	101865	he	259	" Could I bathe my eyes , Tibby ? "
101974	101980	101981	101981	she	254	" Now for the explanation , "
101984	102043	101981	101981	she	254	" Why didn t I begin with it ? I have found out something about Mr. Wilcox . He has behaved very wrongly indeed , and ruined two people s lives . It all came on me very suddenly last night ; I am very much upset , and I do not know what to do . Mrs. Bast-- "
102044	102050	101937	101937	his	259	" Oh , those people ! "
102055	102063	101937	101937	his	259	" Shall I lock the door again ? "
102064	102197	101937	101937	his	259	" No thanks , Tibbikins . You re being very good to me . I want to tell you the story before I go abroad , you must do exactly what you like -- treat it as part of the furniture . Meg can not have heard it yet , I think . But I can not face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has misconducted himself . I don t even know whether she ought to be told . Knowing as she does that I dislike him , she will suspect me , and think that I want to ruin her match . I simply don t know what to make of such a thing . I trust your judgment . What would you do ? "
102198	102207	102209	102209	Tibby	259	" I gather he has had a mistress , "
102218	102311	102211	102211	Helen	254	" And ruined two people s lives . And goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing , and there always will be rich and poor . He met her when he was trying to get rich out in Cyprus -- I don t wish to make him worse than he is , and no doubt she was ready enough to meet him . But there it is . They met . He goes his way and she goes hers . What do you suppose is the end of such women ? "
102321	102381	101937	101937	his	259	" They end in two ways : Either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the workhouses are full of them , and cause Mr. Wilcox to write letters to the papers complaining of our national degeneracy , or else they entrap a boy into marriage before it is too late . She -- I can t blame her . "
102382	102389	102390	102390	she	2952	" But this isn t all , "
102406	102603	102399	102400	the landlady	2946	" I come now to the business that took us to Oniton . We went all three . Acting on Mr. Wilcox s advice , the man throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure one , from which he is dismissed . There are certain excuses , but in the main Mr. Wilcox is to blame , as Meg herself admitted . It is only common justice that he should employ the man himself . But he meets the woman , and , like the cur that he is , he refuses , and tries to get rid of them . He makes Meg write . Two notes came from her late that evening -- one for me , one for Leonard , dismissing him with barely a reason . I couldn t understand . Then it comes out that Mrs. Bast had spoken to Mr. Wilcox on the lawn while we left her to get rooms , and was still speaking about him when Leonard came back to her . This Leonard knew all along . He thought it natural he should be ruined twice . Natural ! Could you have contained yourself ? "
102604	102613	102615	102615	Tibby	259	" It is certainly a very bad business , "
102625	102674	102617	102617	His	259	" I was afraid that I saw it out of proportion . But you are right outside it , and you must know . In a day or two -- or perhaps a week -- take whatever steps you think fit . I leave it in your hands . "
102680	102692	102693	102693	she	1391	" The facts as they touch Meg are all before you , "
102769	102772	102764	102764	Tibby	259	" personal relations "
102849	102869	102841	102842	his sister	1391	" You see , Helen -- have a cigarette -- I don t see what I m to do . "
102870	102897	102809	102810	human beings	760	" Then there s nothing to be done . I dare say you are right . Let them marry . There remains the question of compensation . "
102898	102916	102841	102842	his sister	1391	" Do you want me to adjudicate that too ? Had you not better consult an expert ? "
102917	102924	102926	102926	Helen	254	" This part is in confidence , "
102928	103012	102926	102926	Helen	254	" It has nothing to do with Meg , and do not mention it to her . The compensation -- I do not see who is to pay it if I don t , and I have already decided on the minimum sum . As soon as possible I am placing it to your account , and when I am in Germany you will pay it over for me . I shall never forget your kindness , Tibbikins , if you do this . "
103013	103019	102841	102842	his sister	1391	" What is the sum ? "
103020	103024	102926	102926	Helen	254	" Five thousand . "
103025	103030	103032	103032	Tibby	259	" Good God alive ! "
103038	103089	102926	102926	Helen	254	" Now , what is the good of driblets ? To go through life having done one thing -- to have raised one person from the abyss ; not these puny gifts of shillings and blankets -- making the grey more grey . No doubt people will think me extraordinary . "
103090	103101	103103	103103	he	259	" I don t care an iota what people think ! "
103112	103121	103103	103103	he	259	" But it s half what you have . "
103122	103127	103128	103128	She	2963	" Not nearly half . "
103138	103185	103186	103186	He	259	" I have far too much , and we settled at Chelsea last spring that three hundred a year is necessary to set a man on his feet . What I give will bring in a hundred and fifty between two . It isn t enough . "
103256	103266	103365	103367	The lovely creature	2968	" I didn t expect you to understand me . "
103267	103274	103346	103346	her	2965	" I ? I understand nobody . "
103275	103282	103365	103367	The lovely creature	2968	" But you ll do it ? "
103283	103286	103346	103346	her	2965	" Apparently . "
103287	103342	103365	103367	The lovely creature	2968	" I leave you two commissions , then . The first concerns Mr. Wilcox , and you are to use your discretion . The second concerns the money , and is to be mentioned to no one , and carried out literally . You will send a hundred pounds on account to - morrow . "
103470	103479	103461	103461	She	254	" Does that seem to you so odd ? "
103564	103575	103561	103561	she	255	" Did she seem worried at any rumour about Henry ? "
103579	103582	103576	103576	He	259	" Yes . "
103583	103590	103591	103591	she	255	" I knew it was that ! "
103594	103601	103602	103602	Tibby	259	" I ll write to her . "
104549	104581	104582	104582	Helen	254	" I don t say there is no standard , for that would destroy morality ; only that there can be no standard until our impulses are classified and better understood . "
105005	105014	105015	105015	he	258	" I didn t want to bother you , "
105018	105030	105015	105015	he	258	" Besides , I have only heard for certain this morning . "
105031	105038	105040	105040	Margaret	255	" Where are we to live ? "
105046	105065	105040	105040	Margaret	255	" I loved the place extraordinarily . Don t you believe in having a permanent home , Henry ? "
105095	105111	105082	105083	the foreigner	3031	" This is news . I never heard till this minute that Oniton was damp . "
105112	105115	105118	105118	his	258	" My dear girl!"--he
105119	105236	105082	105083	the foreigner	3031	hand--"have you eyes ? have you a skin ? How could it be anything but damp in such a situation ? In the first place , the Grange is on clay , and built where the castle moat must have been ; then there s that detestable little river , steaming all night like a kettle . Feel the cellar walls ; look up under the eaves . Ask Sir James or any one . Those Shropshire valleys are notorious . The only possible place for a house in Shropshire is on a hill ; but , for my part , I think the country is too far from London , and the scenery nothing special . "
105243	105252	105237	105237	Margaret	255	" Why did you go there , then ? "
105253	105257	105258	105258	He	258	" I -- because-- "
105268	105292	105258	105258	He	258	" Why have we come to the Tyrol , if it comes to that ? One might go on asking such questions indefinitely . "
105322	105343	105237	105237	Margaret	255	" The truth is , I took Oniton on account of Evie . Don t let this go any further . "
105344	105348	105237	105237	Margaret	255	" Certainly not . "
105349	105452	105237	105237	Margaret	255	" I shouldn t like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad bargain . No sooner did I sign the agreement than she got engaged . Poor little girl ! She was so keen on it all , and wouldn t even wait to make proper inquiries about the shooting . Afraid it would get snapped up -- just like all of your sex . Well , no harm s done . She has had her country wedding , and I ve got rid of my goose to some fellows who are starting a preparatory school . "
105453	105469	105237	105237	Margaret	255	" Where shall we live , then , Henry ? I should enjoy living somewhere . "
105470	105481	105237	105237	Margaret	255	" I have not yet decided . What about Norfolk ? "
105581	105587	105589	105589	Henry	355	" It is now what ? "
105591	105614	105589	105589	Henry	355	" Nearly October . Let us camp for the winter at Ducie Street , and look out for something in the spring . "
105615	105640	105772	105772	her	255	" If possible , something permanent . I can t be as young as I was , for these alterations don t suit me . "
105641	105657	105589	105589	Henry	355	" But , my dear , which would you rather have -- alterations or rheumatism ? "
105658	105664	105666	105666	Margaret	255	" I see your point , "
105671	105740	105666	105666	Margaret	255	" If Oniton is really damp , it is impossible , and must be inhabited by little boys . Only , in the spring , let us look before we leap . I will take warning by Evie , and not hurry you . Remember that you have a free hand this time . These endless moves must be bad for the furniture , and are certainly expensive . "
105741	105763	105589	105589	Henry	355	" What a practical little woman it is ! What s it been reading ? Theo -- theo -- how much ? "
105764	105767	105666	105666	Margaret	255	" Theosophy . "
105962	105964	105952	105952	they	3046	" miss "
106106	106113	106114	106114	Dolly	3050	" Have you heard the news ? "
106125	106151	106114	106114	Dolly	3050	" Charles is so ang -- I mean he is sure you know about it , or , rather , that you don t know . "
106152	106157	106159	106159	Margaret	255	" Why , Dolly ! "
106165	106179	106159	106159	Margaret	255	" Here s a surprise ! How are the boys and the baby ? "
106253	106267	106247	106247	she	3055	" But lucky you , with four courts of your own at Midhurst . "
106268	106275	106277	106277	Margaret	255	" It will be very jolly , "
106279	106292	106247	106247	she	3055	" Are those the plans ? Does it matter my seeing them ? "
106293	106298	106247	106247	she	3055	" Of course not . "
106299	106307	106247	106247	she	3055	" Charles has never seen the plans . "
106308	106347	106247	106247	she	3055	" They have only just arrived . Here is the ground floor -- no , that s rather difficult . Try the elevation . We are to have a good many gables and a picturesque sky - line . "
106348	106356	106358	106358	Dolly	3060	" What makes it smell so funny ? "
106375	106381	106247	106247	she	3055	" I suppose the paper . "
106382	106390	106247	106247	she	3055	" And WHICH way up is it ? "
106391	106414	106247	106247	she	3055	" Just the ordinary way up . That s the sky - line and the part that smells strongest is the sky . "
106415	106437	106247	106247	she	3055	" Well , ask me another . Margaret -- oh -- what was I going to say ? How s Helen ? "
106438	106442	106247	106247	she	3055	" Quite well . "
106443	106462	106247	106247	she	3055	" Is she never coming back to England ? Every one thinks it s awfully odd she doesn t. "
106463	106468	106470	106470	Margaret	255	" So it is , "
106487	106502	106478	106478	She	255	" Helen is odd , awfully . She has now been away eight months . "
106503	106511	106247	106247	she	3055	" But hasn t she any address ? "
106512	106537	106478	106478	She	255	" A poste restante somewhere in Bavaria is her address . Do write her a line . I will look it up for you . "
106538	106556	106247	106247	she	3055	" No , don t bother . That s eight months she has been away , surely ? "
106557	106574	106478	106478	She	255	" Exactly . She left just after Evie s wedding . It would be eight months . "
106575	106584	106247	106247	she	3055	" Just when baby was born , then ? "
106585	106589	106478	106478	She	255	" Just so . "
106713	106718	106719	106719	she	3061	" Oh , yes , "
106722	106737	106719	106719	she	3061	" that is it : Miss Avery has been unpacking your packing - cases . "
106738	106748	106686	106687	the stepmother	3068	" Why has she done that ? How unnecessary ! "
106749	106760	106719	106719	she	3061	" Ask another . I suppose you ordered her to . "
106761	106784	106686	106687	the stepmother	3068	" I gave no such orders . Perhaps she was airing the things . She did undertake to light an occasional fire . "
106785	106794	106796	106796	Dolly	3069	" It was far more than an air , "
106799	106827	106796	106796	Dolly	3069	" The floor sounds covered with books . Charles sent me to know what is to be done , for he feels certain you don t know . "
106828	106831	106833	106833	Margaret	255	" Books ! "
106841	106855	106833	106833	Margaret	255	" Dolly , are you serious ? Has she been touching our books ? "
106856	106883	106719	106719	she	3061	" Hasn t she , though ! What used to be the hall s full of them . Charles thought for certain you knew of it . "
106884	106937	106833	106833	Margaret	255	" I am very much obliged to you , Dolly . What can have come over Miss Avery ? I must go down about it at once . Some of the books are my brother s , and are quite valuable . She had no right to open any of the cases . "
106938	107000	106719	106719	she	3061	" I say she s dotty . She was the one that never got married , you know . Oh , I say , perhaps , she thinks your books are wedding - presents to herself . Old maids are taken that way sometimes . Miss Avery hates us all like poison ever since her frightful dust - up with Evie . "
107001	107009	107011	107011	Margaret	255	" I hadn t heard of that , "
107021	107057	106719	106719	she	3061	" Didn t you know she gave Evie a present last August , and Evie returned it , and then -- oh , goloshes ! You never read such a letter as Miss Avery wrote . "
107058	107081	106719	106719	she	3061	" But it was wrong of Evie to return it . It wasn t like her to do such a heartless thing . "
107082	107090	106719	106719	she	3061	" But the present was so expensive . "
107091	107101	106719	106719	she	3061	" Why does that make any difference , Dolly ? "
107102	107151	106719	106719	she	3061	" Still , when it costs over five pounds -- I didn t see it , but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a Bond Street shop . You can t very well accept that kind of thing from a farm woman . Now , can you ? "
107152	107165	106719	106719	she	3061	" You accepted a present from Miss Avery when you were married . "
107166	107265	106719	106719	she	3061	" Oh , mine was old earthenware stuff -- not worth a halfpenny . Evie s was quite different . You d have to ask any one to the wedding who gave you a pendant like that . Uncle Percy and Albert and father and Charles all said it was quite impossible , and when four men agree , what is a girl to do ? Evie didn t want to upset the old thing , so thought a sort of joking letter best , and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save Miss Avery trouble . "
107266	107271	106719	106719	she	3061	" But Miss Avery said-- "
107278	107317	107272	107272	Dolly	3071	" It was a perfectly awful letter . Charles said it was the letter of a madman . In the end she had the pendant back again from the shop and threw it into the duck - pond . "
107318	107325	106719	106719	she	3061	" Did she give any reasons ? "
107326	107343	107272	107272	Dolly	3071	" We think she meant to be invited to Oniton , and so climb into society . "
107344	107352	107354	107354	Margaret	255	" She s rather old for that , "
107357	107373	107354	107354	Margaret	255	" May she not have given the present to Evie in remembrance of her mother ? "
107374	107425	107272	107272	Dolly	3071	" That s a notion . Give every one their due , eh ? Well , I suppose I ought to be toddling . Come along , Mr. Muff -- you want a new coat , but I don t know who ll give it you , I m sure ; "
107454	107458	107442	107442	her	3073	" Oh yes . "
107459	107477	107442	107442	her	3073	" I wonder , then , why he let me ask her to look after the house . "
107478	107487	107489	107489	Dolly	3075	" But she s only a farm woman , "
107527	107539	107540	107540	he	355	" I have patience with a man who knows his job , "
108199	108204	108206	108206	Margaret	255	" Left to itself , "
108210	108217	108206	108206	Margaret	255	" this county would vote Liberal . "
108268	108314	108260	108264	A most finished young person	3120	" Yes , Mrs. Wilcox ; no , Mrs. Wilcox ; oh yes , Mrs. Wilcox , auntie received your letter quite duly . Auntie has gone up to your little place at the present moment . Shall I send the servant to direct you ? "
108318	108412	108260	108264	A most finished young person	3120	" Of course , auntie does not generally look after your place ; she only does it to oblige a neighbour as something exceptional . It gives her something to do . She spends quite a lot of her time there . My husband says to me sometimes , Where s auntie ? I say , Need you ask ? She s at Howards End . Yes , Mrs. Wilcox . Mrs. Wilcox , could I prevail upon you to accept a piece of cake ? Not if I cut it for you ? "
108433	108467	108469	108469	Wilcox	512	" I can not let you go on alone . Now don t. You really mustn t. I will direct you myself if it comes to that . I must get my hat . Now"--roguishly--"Mrs

109022	109033	109035	109035	Margaret	255	" Are you sure that Miss Avery is up here ? "
109037	109053	108984	108985	the niece	3138	" Oh , yes , Mrs. Wilcox , quite sure . She is here daily . "
109189	109194	109196	109200	some one inside the house	3152	" Well , well ! "
109202	109213	109196	109200	some one inside the house	3152	" If it isn t Mrs. Wilcox come at last ! "
109214	109223	109196	109200	some one inside the house	3152	" Have you got the key , auntie ? "
109224	109230	109232	109233	Miss Avery	456	" Madge , go away , "
109238	109245	109196	109200	some one inside the house	3152	" Auntie , it s Mrs. Wilcox-- "
109250	109259	109246	109246	Margaret	255	" Your niece and I have come together . "
109260	109274	109196	109200	some one inside the house	3152	" Madge , go away . This is no moment for your hat . "
109281	109288	109289	109289	she	3154	" Auntie gets more eccentric lately , "
109293	109297	109299	109299	Margaret	255	" Miss Avery ! "
109301	109316	109299	109299	Margaret	255	" I have come about the furniture . Could you kindly let me in ? "
109317	109323	109275	109277	The poor woman	3154	" Yes , Mrs. Wilcox , "
109328	109332	109275	109277	The poor woman	3154	" of course . "
109352	109361	109363	109363	Margaret	255	" I hope Miss Avery is not ill , "
109365	109374	109376	109376	Madge	255	" Well , if you ll excuse me , "
109378	109404	109376	109376	Madge	255	" perhaps I ought to be leaving you now . The servants need seeing to at the farm . Auntie is so odd at times . "
109436	109446	109432	109433	Miss Avery	456	" Well , come right in , Mrs. Wilcox ! "
109452	109458	109460	109460	Margaret	255	" Thank you so much , "
109479	109487	109489	109490	Miss Avery	456	" Come right into the hall first , "
109588	109599	109600	109600	she	255	" I m afraid this isn t what we meant , "
109603	109658	109600	109600	she	255	" Mr. Wilcox and I never intended the cases to be touched . For instance , these books are my brother s. We are storing them for him and for my sister , who is abroad . When you kindly undertook to look after things , we never expected you to do so much . "
109659	109668	109670	109672	the old woman	4711	" The house has been empty long enough , "
109679	109688	109689	109689	she	255	" I dare say we didn t explain , "
109693	109706	109689	109689	she	255	" It has been a mistake , and very likely our mistake . "
109707	109740	109600	109600	she	255	" Mrs. Wilcox , it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty years . The house is Mrs. Wilcox s , and she would not desire it to stand empty any longer . "
109751	109765	109600	109600	she	255	" Yes , Mrs. Wilcox s house , the mother of Mr. Charles . "
109766	109771	109773	109774	Miss Avery	456	" Mistake upon mistake , "
109776	109781	109773	109774	Miss Avery	456	" Mistake upon mistake . "
109782	109790	109792	109792	Margaret	255	" Well , I don t know , "
109803	109815	109816	109816	She	255	" I really don t know what s to be done . "
109826	109837	109822	109823	The other	814	" Yes , it should be a merry house enough . "
109838	109867	109822	109823	The other	814	" I don t know -- I dare say . Well , thank you very much , Miss Avery . Yes , that s all right . Delightful . "
109868	109875	109876	109876	She	255	" There is still the parlour . "
109898	109905	109822	109823	The other	814	" And the dining - room . "
109920	109924	109925	109926	Miss Avery	456	" Then through here-- "
109950	109958	109959	109959	she	456	" I ve not finished here yet , "
109964	109995	109959	109959	she	456	" There s still a deal to do . The farm lads will carry your great wardrobes upstairs , for there is no need to go into expense at Hilton . "
109996	110003	110005	110005	Margaret	255	" It is all a mistake , "
110016	110033	110005	110005	Margaret	255	" A misunderstanding . Mr. Wilcox and I are not going to live at Howards End . "
110034	110046	109959	109959	she	456	" Oh , indeed ! On account of his hay fever ? "
110047	110076	110005	110005	Margaret	255	" We have settled to build a new home for ourselves in Sussex , and part of this furniture -- my part -- will go down there presently . "
110121	110141	110107	110107	She	456	" You think that you won t come back to live here , Mrs. Wilcox , but you will . "
110142	110149	110151	110151	Margaret	255	" That remains to be seen , "
110155	110197	110151	110151	Margaret	255	" We have no intention of doing so for the present . We happen to need a much larger house . Circumstances oblige us to give big parties . Of course , some day -- one never knows , does one ? "
110202	110223	110198	110199	Miss Avery	456	" Some day ! Tcha ! tcha ! Don t talk about some day . You are living here now . "
110224	110228	110292	110293	her mother	1405	" Am I ? "
110229	110249	110198	110199	Miss Avery	456	" You are living here , and have been for the last ten minutes , if you ask me . "
110346	110350	110351	110351	she	456	" The nursery , "
110481	110488	110489	110489	she	255	" It s a beautiful meadow , "
110552	110561	110563	110564	Miss Avery	456	" Yes , the maidy s well enough , "
110566	110580	110582	110582	she	456	" for those , that is , who don t suffer from sneezing . "
110586	110668	110582	110582	she	456	" I ve seen Charlie Wilcox go out to my lads in hay time -- oh , they ought to do this -- they mustn t do that -- he d learn them to be lads . And just then the tickling took him . He has it from his father , with other things . There s not one Wilcox that can stand up against a field in June -- I laughed fit to burst while he was courting Ruth . "
110669	110677	110679	110679	Margaret	255	" My brother gets hay fever too , "
110681	110719	110582	110582	she	456	" This house lies too much on the land for them . Naturally , they were glad enough to slip in at first . But Wilcoxes are better than nothing , as I see you ve found . "
110723	110741	110582	110582	she	456	" They keep a place going , don t they ? Yes , it is just that . "
110742	110753	110582	110582	she	456	" They keep England going , it is my opinion . "
110762	110811	110755	110756	Miss Avery	456	" Ay , they breed like rabbits . Well , well , it s a funny world . But He who made it knows what He wants in it , I suppose . If Mrs. Charlie is expecting her fourth , it isn t for us to repine . "
110812	110820	110822	110822	Margaret	255	" They breed and they also work , "
110846	110882	110822	110822	Margaret	255	" It certainly is a funny world , but so long as men like my husband and his sons govern it , I think it ll never be a bad one -- never really bad . "
110883	110890	110892	110893	Miss Avery	456	" No , better n nothing , "
110943	111015	110940	110940	she	255	" I never saw much of Ruth after her grandmother died , but we stayed civil . It was a very civil family . Old Mrs. Howard never spoke against anybody , nor let any one be turned away without food . Then it was never Trespassers will be prosecuted in their land , but would people please not come in ? Mrs. Howard was never created to run a farm . "
111016	111025	111026	111026	Margaret	255	" Had they no men to help them ? "
111033	111043	111029	111030	Miss Avery	456	" Things went on until there were no men . "
111044	111051	111053	111053	Margaret	255	" Until Mr. Wilcox came along , "
111064	111105	111029	111030	Miss Avery	456	" I suppose so ; but Ruth should have married a -- no disrespect to you to say this , for I take it you were intended to get Wilcox any way , whether she got him first or no . "
111106	111113	111061	111061	his	1134	" Whom should she have married ? "
111114	111118	111120	111122	the old woman	4711	" A soldier ! "
111124	111129	111120	111122	the old woman	4711	" Some real soldier . "
111155	111162	111163	111163	she	255	" But that s all over , "
111167	111208	111163	111163	she	255	" A better time is coming now , though you ve kept me long enough waiting . In a couple of weeks I ll see your light shining through the hedge of an evening . Have you ordered in coals ? "
111209	111215	111217	111217	Margaret	255	" We are not coming , "
111230	111277	111220	111220	She	255	" No . Not coming . Never coming . It has all been a mistake . The furniture must be repacked at once , and I am very sorry , but I am making other arrangements , and must ask you to give me the keys . "
111278	111284	111286	111287	Miss Avery	456	" Certainly , Mrs. Wilcox , "
111443	111453	111478	111488	that spring party that after all gathered in that hospitable house	3197	" to really take my tiresome chest in hand , "

111792	111831	111869	111869	Margaret	255	" Helen won t be able to stop , Aunt Juley . She has telegraphed that she can only get away just to see you . She must go back to Germany as soon as you are well . "
111832	111841	111869	111869	Margaret	255	" How very odd of Helen ! Mr. Wilcox-- "
111842	111847	111869	111869	Margaret	255	" Yes , dear ? "
111848	111854	111869	111869	Margaret	255	" Can he spare you ? "

111951	111963	111915	111915	she	264	" I have been for a little walk with Miss Conder . "
111964	111978	111915	111915	she	264	" But she is not really interesting . If only you had Helen . "
111979	111987	111915	111915	she	264	" I have Tibby , Aunt Juley . "
111988	112013	111915	111915	she	264	" No , but he has to do his Chinese . Some real companion is what you need . Really , Helen is odd . "
112014	112021	111915	111915	she	264	" Helen is odd , very , "
112025	112043	111915	111915	she	264	" Not content with going abroad , why does she want to go back there at once ? "
112044	112064	111915	111915	she	264	" No doubt she will change her mind when she sees us . She has not the least balance . "

If Aunt Juley is much better , or if , for a terrible reason , it would be no good my coming down to Swanage , you must not think it odd if I do not come . I have all sorts of plans in my head . I am living abroad at present , and want to get back as quickly as possible . Will you please tell me where our furniture is ? I should like to take out one or two books ; the rest are for you .
112843	112865	112886	112886	she	255	" Forgive me , dearest Meg . This must read like rather a tiresome letter , but all letters are from your loving

113138	113149	113180	113180	experts	3229	" Perhaps he has come across that sort of thing . "

113322	113331	113291	113291	He	576	" None , unless it s something mental . "
113332	113337	113339	113339	Margaret	255	" Oh -- that ! "
113341	113345	113339	113339	Margaret	255	" Quite impossible . "

113736	113761	113734	113734	Margaret	255	" But why should it be just like Helen ? Why should she be allowed to be so queer , and to grow queerer ? "
113762	113835	113836	113836	He	3243	" Don t ask me . I m a plain man of business . I live and let live . My advice to you both is , don t worry . Margaret , you ve got black marks again under your eyes . You know that s strictly forbidden . First your aunt -- then your sister . No , we aren t going to have it . Are we , Theobald ? "
113841	113871	113836	113836	He	3243	" I ll give you some tea , and then you go straight to Ducie Street . I can t have my girl looking as old as her husband . "

113991	114005	113988	113988	Margaret	255	" Could you help us at all ? We are again in trouble . "
114006	114034	113956	113956	he	576	" I m afraid I can not . What are the facts ? We are all mad more or less , you know , in these days . "
114035	114042	114044	114044	Tibby	259	" The facts are as follows , "
114054	114108	114044	114044	Tibby	259	" The facts are that she has been in England for three days and will not see us . She has forbidden the bankers to give us her address . She refuses to answer questions . Margaret finds her letters colourless . There are other facts , but these are the most striking . "
114109	114120	114122	114122	Henry	355	" She has never behaved like this before , then ? "
114124	114129	114131	114132	his wife	1358	" Of course not ! "
114138	114150	114044	114044	Tibby	259	" Well , my dear , how am I to know ? "
114160	114172	114173	114173	she	1358	" You know quite well that Helen never sins against affection , "
114176	114188	114173	114173	she	1358	" You must have noticed that much in her , surely . "
114189	114203	114229	114229	her	1358	" Oh yes ; she and I have always hit it off together . "
114204	114218	114173	114173	she	1358	" No , Henry -- can t you see?--I don t mean that . "
114241	114354	114173	114173	she	1358	" I was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past , one could trace it back to the heart in the long - run . She behaved oddly because she cared for some one , or wanted to help them . There s no possible excuse for her now . She is grieving us deeply , and that is why I am sure that she is not well . Mad is too terrible a word , but she is not well . I shall never believe it . I shouldn t discuss my sister with you if I thought she was well -- trouble you about her , I mean . "
114470	114479	114480	114480	he	355	" You want to get hold of her ? "
114483	114501	114480	114480	he	355	" That s the problem , isn t it ? She has got to see a doctor . "
114502	114513	114533	114537	The genial , tentative host	3254	" For all I know she has seen one already . "
114514	114523	114524	114524	He	355	" Yes , yes ; don t interrupt . "
114569	114575	114576	114576	he	355	" I ve got it , "
114581	114601	114576	114576	he	355	" It s perfectly easy . Leave it to me . We ll send her down to Howards End . "
114602	114609	114544	114567	the man who had carved money out of Greece and Africa , and bought forests from the natives for a few bottles of gin	3255	" How will you do that ? "
114610	114631	114576	114576	he	355	" After her books . Tell her that she must unpack them herself . Then you can meet her there . "
114632	114663	114544	114567	the man who had carved money out of Greece and Africa , and bought forests from the natives for a few bottles of gin	3255	" But , Henry , that s just what she won t let me do . It s part of her -- whatever it is -- never to see me . "
114664	114726	114576	114576	he	355	" Of course you won t tell her you re going . When she is there , looking at the cases , you ll just stroll in . If nothing is wrong with her , so much the better . But there ll be the motor round the corner , and we can run her to a specialist in no time . "
114732	114738	114729	114729	her	255	" It s quite impossible . "
114739	114742	114576	114576	he	355	" Why ? "
114743	114752	114754	114754	Tibby	259	" It doesn t seem impossible to me , "
114756	114765	114754	114754	Tibby	259	" it is surely a very tippy plan . "
114766	114772	114773	114773	She	255	" It is impossible , because-- "
114780	114813	114773	114773	She	255	" It s not the particular language that Helen and I talk , if you see my meaning . It would do splendidly for other people , whom I don t blame . "
114814	114821	114823	114823	Tibby	259	" But Helen doesn t talk , "
114825	114850	114823	114823	Tibby	259	" That s our whole difficulty . She won t talk your particular language , and on that account you think she s ill . "
114851	114866	114754	114754	Tibby	259	" No , Henry ; it s sweet of you , but I couldn t. "
114867	114871	114872	114872	he	1134	" I see , "
114875	114880	114872	114872	he	1134	" you have scruples . "
114881	114886	114773	114773	She	255	" I suppose so . "
114887	114953	114872	114872	he	1134	" And sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer . You could have got her down to Swanage by a word , but you had scruples . And scruples are all very well . I am as scrupulous as any man alive , I hope ; but when it is a case like this , when there is a question of madness-- "
114954	114961	114773	114773	She	255	" I deny it s madness . "
114962	114967	114872	114872	he	1134	" You said just now-- "
114968	114984	114773	114773	She	255	" It s madness when I say it , but not when you say it . "
114990	114995	114996	114996	he	355	" Margaret ! Margaret ! "
114999	115028	114996	114996	he	355	" No education can teach a woman logic . Now , my dear , my time is valuable . Do you want me to help you or not ? "
115029	115035	114773	114773	She	255	" Not in that way . "
115036	115048	114996	114996	he	355	" Answer my question . Plain question , plain answer . Do-- "
115055	115069	115070	115070	he	258	" Pater , we may as well keep Howards End out of it , "
115073	115078	114996	114996	he	355	" Why , Charles ? "
115102	115112	115113	115113	he	258	" The whole house is at sixes and sevens , "
115117	115126	115113	115113	he	258	" We don t want any more mess . "
115127	115132	115134	115135	his father	3994	" Who s we ? "
115137	115146	115134	115135	his father	3994	" My boy , pray who s we ? "
115147	115156	115158	115158	Charles	258	" I am sure I beg your pardon , "
115160	115168	115158	115158	Charles	258	" I appear always to be intruding . "
115341	115369	115334	115335	Mr. Wilcox	258	" I can t have this sort of behaviour , my boy . Margaret s too sweet - natured to mind , but I mind for her . "
115375	115387	115334	115335	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Is anything wrong with you , Charles , this afternoon ? "
115388	115406	115334	115335	Mr. Wilcox	258	" No , pater ; but you may be taking on a bigger business than you reckon . "
115407	115410	115334	115335	Mr. Wilcox	258	" How ? "
115411	115417	115334	115335	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Don t ask me . "
115722	115729	115731	115731	Henry	355	" She was bound to drive , "
115733	115740	115731	115731	Henry	355	" There will be her books . "
115741	115749	115751	115751	Margaret	255	" I can not make it out , "
115757	115769	115731	115731	Henry	355	" Finish your coffee , dear . We must be off . "
115770	115782	115784	115784	Dolly	3281	" Yes , Margaret , you know you must take plenty , "
115825	115833	115834	115834	he	1389	" You re not fit for it , "
115838	115851	115834	115834	he	1389	" Let me go alone . I know exactly what to do . "
115852	115860	115862	115862	Margaret	255	" Oh yes , I am fit , "
115868	115936	115937	115937	She	255	" Only most frightfully worried . I can not feel that Helen is really alive . Her letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else . Her voice isn t in them . I don t believe your driver really saw her at the station . I wish I d never mentioned it . I know that Charles is vexed . Yes , he is-- "
115946	115962	115937	115937	She	255	" There , Dolly will forgive me . There . Now we ll be off . "
115978	115987	115988	115988	he	355	" Don t you want to tidy yourself ? "
115991	115996	115937	115937	She	255	" Have I time ? "
115997	116002	115937	115937	She	255	" Yes , plenty . "
116026	116035	116021	116022	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Dolly , I m going without her . "
116055	116063	116021	116022	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Tell her I thought it best . "
116064	116073	116047	116047	him	258	" Yes , Mr. Wilcox , I see . "
116074	116083	116021	116022	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Say anything you like . All right . "
116201	116214	116198	116198	She	3285	" I deserve it ; I am punished for lowering my colours . "
116227	116238	116239	116239	he	258	" I still consider you are not fit for it , "
116243	116262	116198	116198	She	3285	" Perhaps I was not at lunch . But the whole thing is spread clearly before me now . "
116263	116273	116198	116198	She	3285	" I was meaning to act for the best . "
116274	116292	116198	116198	She	3285	" Just lend me your scarf , will you . This wind takes one s hair so . "
116293	116305	116198	116198	She	3285	" Certainly , dear girl . Are you all right now ? "
116306	116315	116198	116198	She	3285	" Look ! My hands have stopped trembling . "
116316	116379	116198	116198	She	3285	" And have quite forgiven me ? Then listen . Her cab should already have arrived at Howards End . ( We re a little late , but no matter . ) Our first move will be to send it down to wait at the farm , as , if possible , one doesn t want a scene before servants . A certain gentleman"--he
116384	116413	116467	116468	the doctor	577	back--"won t drive in , but will wait a little short of the front gate , behind the laurels . Have you still the keys of the house ? "
116414	116417	116382	116382	Crane	364	" Yes . "
116418	116434	116467	116468	the doctor	577	" Well , they aren t wanted . Do you remember how the house stands ? "
116435	116438	116382	116382	Crane	364	" Yes . "
116439	116460	116467	116468	the doctor	577	" If we don t find her in the porch , we can stroll round into the garden . Our object-- "
116470	116529	116533	116536	a very young man	721	" I was just saying to my wife , Mansbridge , that our main object is not to frighten Miss Schlegel . The house , as you know , is my property , so it should seem quite natural for us to be there . The trouble is evidently nervous -- wouldn t you say so , Margaret ? "
116569	116572	116574	116574	Margaret	255	" Nothing , "
116586	116596	116574	116574	Margaret	255	" Though she did resent my husband s immorality . "
116597	116604	116606	116606	Henry	355	" She always was highly strung , "
116620	116650	116606	116606	Henry	355	" A tendency to spiritualism and those things , though nothing serious . Musical , literary , artistic , but I should say normal -- a very charming girl . "
116709	116714	116683	116684	The pack	3303	" Were they normal ? "
116990	116997	116999	116999	Henry	355	" Is the truant all right ? "
117007	117012	117001	117001	She	255	" Oh , my darling-- "
117033	117039	117040	117040	she	255	" Yes , all right , "
117054	117061	117063	117063	Henry	355	" Margaret , you look upset ! "
117143	117155	117159	117159	his	355	" You might have given me a knock with the gate , "
117177	117181	117168	117168	She	255	" Go away . "
117189	117212	117186	117186	He	355	" Margaret , you look upset again . My dear , give me the keys . What are you doing with Helen ? "
117213	117229	117168	117168	She	255	" Oh , dearest , do go away , and I will manage it all . "
117230	117234	117186	117186	He	355	" Manage what ? "
117257	117263	117264	117264	she	255	" Stop that at least , "
117321	117330	117332	117333	her husband	1134	" Come , this is an odd beginning , "
117364	117371	117373	117373	Margaret	255	" I can not help it , "
117375	117394	117373	117373	Margaret	255	" Do wait . It s not my fault . Please all four of you go away now . "
117403	117416	117418	117420	the young doctor	3336	" We are relying on you to help us , Mrs. Wilcox , "
117422	117435	117418	117420	the young doctor	3336	" Could you go in and persuade your sister to come out ? "
117436	117441	117443	117443	Margaret	255	" On what grounds ? "
117467	117505	117418	117420	the young doctor	3336	" I beg your pardon , but it is nothing of the sort . You are not qualified to attend my sister , Mr. Mansbridge . If we require your services , we will let you know . "
117506	117518	117519	117519	he	355	" I can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish , "
117522	117543	117418	117420	the young doctor	3336	" You could , but you have not . You are , therefore , not qualified to attend my sister . "
117544	117551	117553	117553	Henry	355	" Come , come , Margaret ! "
117560	117581	117553	117553	Henry	355	" This is a terrible business , an appalling business . It s doctor s orders . Open the door . "
117582	117591	117616	117617	the doctor	577	" Forgive me , but I will not . "
117592	117598	117553	117553	Henry	355	" I don t agree . "
117603	117614	117616	117617	the doctor	577	" This business is as broad as it s long , "
117619	117639	117616	117617	the doctor	577	" We had better all work together . You need us , Mrs. Wilcox , and we need you . "
117640	117644	117646	117646	Henry	355	" Quite so , "
117648	117658	117660	117660	Margaret	255	" I do not need you in the least , "
117671	117687	117616	117617	the doctor	577	" No more does my sister , who is still many weeks from her confinement . "
117688	117693	117733	117734	the doctor	577	" Margaret , Margaret ! "
117694	117711	117616	117617	the doctor	577	" Well , Henry , send your doctor away . What possible use is he now ? "
117748	117756	117758	117758	Margaret	255	" It all turns on affection now , "
117760	117768	117774	117774	she	255	" Affection . Don t you see ? "
117785	117839	117774	117774	she	255	" Surely you see . I like Helen very much , you not so much . Mr. Mansbridge doesn t know her . That s all . And affection , when reciprocated , gives rights . Put that down in your note - book , Mr. Mansbridge . It s a useful formula . "
117847	117857	117859	117859	Margaret	255	" You don t know what you want yourselves , "
117865	117907	117859	117859	Margaret	255	" For one sensible remark I will let you in . But you can not make it . You would trouble my sister for no reason . I will not permit it . I ll stand here all the day sooner . "
117908	117911	117913	117913	Henry	355	" Mansbridge , "
117919	117924	117913	117913	Henry	355	" perhaps not now . "
117946	117953	117954	117954	she	255	" Now , Henry , you , "
117968	118001	117960	117960	her	255	" Go away now , dear . I shall want your advice later , no doubt . Forgive me if I have been cross . But , seriously , you must go . "
118024	118035	118036	118036	she	255	" I shall soon find you down at Dolly s , "
118112	118118	118119	118119	she	255	" Oh , my darling ! "
118122	118129	118130	118130	Helen	254	" My darling , forgive me . "
118171	118194	118156	118156	Helen	254	" Convenient ! You did not tell me that the books were unpacked . I have found nearly everything that I want . "
118195	118204	118156	118156	Helen	254	" I told you nothing that was true . "
118205	118221	118156	118156	Helen	254	" It has been a great surprise , certainly . Has Aunt Juley been ill ? "
118222	118234	118156	118156	Helen	254	" Helen , you wouldn t think I d invent that ? "
118235	118240	118242	118242	Helen	254	" I suppose not , "
118253	118263	118242	118242	Helen	254	" But one loses faith in everything after this . "
118264	118281	118156	118156	Helen	254	" We thought it was illness , but even then -- I haven t behaved worthily . "
118287	118306	118156	118156	Helen	254	" I ought not to have consulted any one . What would our father have thought of me ? "
118358	118365	118367	118367	Helen	254	" Yes , I am annoyed , "
118369	118411	118367	118367	Helen	254	" My wishes should have been respected . I would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary , but after Aunt Juley recovered , it was not necessary . Planning my life , as I now have to do . "
118412	118419	118421	118421	Margaret	255	" Come away from those books , "
118423	118431	118421	118421	Margaret	255	" Helen , do talk to me . "
118432	118453	118330	118330	she	254	" I was just saying that I have stopped living haphazard . One can t go through a great deal of --"--she
118457	118559	118421	118421	Margaret	255	noun--"without planning one s actions in advance . I am going to have a child in June , and in the first place conversations , discussions , excitement , are not good for me . I will go through them if necessary , but only then . In the second place I have no right to trouble people . I can not fit in with England as I know it . I have done something that the English never pardon . It would not be right for them to pardon it . So I must live where I am not known . "
118560	118571	118421	118421	Margaret	255	" But why didn t you tell me , dearest ? "
118572	118575	118577	118577	Helen	254	" Yes , "
118580	118590	118577	118577	Helen	254	" I might have , but decided to wait . "
118591	118601	118421	118421	Margaret	255	" I believe you would never have told me . "
118602	118617	118577	118577	Helen	254	" Oh yes , I should . We have taken a flat in Munich . "
118625	118650	118577	118577	Helen	254	" By we I mean myself and Monica . But for her , I am and have been and always wish to be alone . "
118651	118659	118577	118577	Helen	254	" I have not heard of Monica . "
118660	118701	118577	118577	Helen	254	" You wouldn t have . She s an Italian -- by birth at least . She makes her living by journalism . I met her originally on Garda . Monica is much the best person to see me through . "
118702	118712	118577	118577	Helen	254	" You are very fond of her , then . "
118713	118722	118577	118577	Helen	254	" She has been extraordinarily sensible with me . "
118728	118730	118731	118731	they	3354	type--"Italiano Inglesiato "
118759	118770	118772	118772	Helen	254	" You must not think that we shall never meet , "
118779	118870	118772	118772	Helen	254	" I shall always have a room for you when you can be spared , and the longer you can be with me the better . But you haven t understood yet , Meg , and of course it is very difficult for you . This is a shock to you . It isn t to me , who have been thinking over our futures for many months , and they won t be changed by a slight contretemps , such as this . I can not live in England . "
118871	118895	118736	118741	the crude feminist of the South	3355	" Helen , you ve not forgiven me for my treachery . You COULDN T talk like this to me if you had . "
118896	118909	118910	118910	She	3357	" Oh , Meg dear , why do we talk at all ? "
118926	118941	118923	118923	she	3357	" Tell me , how is it that all the books are down here ? "
118942	118947	118736	118741	the crude feminist of the South	3355	" Series of mistakes . "
118948	118959	118923	118923	she	3357	" And a great deal of furniture has been unpacked . "
118960	118963	118736	118741	the crude feminist of the South	3355	" All . "
118964	118971	118923	118923	she	3357	" Who lives here , then ? "
118972	118976	118736	118741	the crude feminist of the South	3355	" No one . "
118977	118987	118923	118923	she	3357	" I suppose you are letting it , though . "
118988	118994	118996	118996	Margaret	255	" The house is dead , "
119002	119009	118996	118996	Margaret	255	" Why worry on about it ? "
119010	119068	118923	118923	she	3357	" But I am interested . You talk as if I had lost all my interest in life . I am still Helen , I hope . Now this hasn t the feel of a dead house . The hall seems more alive even than in the old days , when it held the Wilcoxes own things . "
119069	119110	119111	119111	She	3358	" Interested , are you ? Very well , I must tell you , I suppose . My husband lent it on condition we -- but by a mistake all our things were unpacked , and Miss Avery , instead of-- "
119114	119150	119111	119111	She	3358	" Look here , I can t go on like this . I warn you I won t. Helen , why should you be so miserably unkind to me , simply because you hate Henry ? "
119151	119159	119161	119161	Helen	254	" I don t hate him now , "
119163	119218	119161	119161	Helen	254	" I have stopped being a schoolgirl , and , Meg , once again , I m not being unkind . But as for fitting in with your English life -- no , put it out of your head at once . Imagine a visit from me at Ducie Street ! It s unthinkable . "
119293	119299	119301	119301	Helen	254	" Tell me about yourself , "
119316	119323	119290	119291	old friends	3360	" There s nothing to tell . "
119324	119334	119290	119291	old friends	3360	" But your marriage has been happy , Meg ? "
119335	119347	119290	119291	old friends	3360	" Yes , but I don t feel inclined to talk . "
119348	119355	119290	119291	old friends	3360	" You feel as I do . "
119356	119364	119290	119291	old friends	3360	" Not that , but I can t. "
119365	119380	119290	119291	old friends	3360	" No more can I. It is a nuisance , but no good trying . "
119434	119445	119572	119572	she	254	" Look here , Meg , is the coast clear ? "
119446	119458	119572	119572	she	254	" You mean that you want to go away from me ? "
119459	119511	119572	119572	she	254	" I suppose so -- dear old lady ! it isn t any use . I knew we should have nothing to say . Give my love to Aunt Juley and Tibby , and take more yourself than I can say . Promise to come and see me in Munich later . "
119512	119517	119572	119572	she	254	" Certainly , dearest . "
119518	119527	119572	119572	she	254	" For that is all we can do . "
119550	119562	119563	119563	She	254	" I am glad to have seen you and the things . "
119588	119600	119585	119585	She	255	" The car has gone , and here s your cab . "
119637	119645	119624	119632	The driver , who was leaning on the gate	3365	" Please , lady , a message , "
119658	119664	119665	119665	she	255	" How did this come ? "
119711	119719	119700	119700	she	255	" Il faut dormir sur ce sujet . "
119761	119770	119771	119771	she	255	" Henry would have done what he could , "
119819	119827	119828	119828	she	255	" This IS Mr. Wilcox s house ? "
119831	119838	119811	119813	the old Helen	254	" Surely you remember Howards End ? "
119839	119855	119811	119813	the old Helen	254	" Remember ? I who remember everything ! But it looks to be ours now . "
119856	119862	119864	119864	Margaret	255	" Miss Avery was extraordinary , "
119896	119926	119891	119891	she	255	" She loved Mrs. Wilcox , and would rather furnish her home with our things than think of it empty . In consequence here are all the library books . "
119927	119959	119811	119813	the old Helen	254	" Not all the books . She hasn t unpacked the Art books , in which she may show her sense . And we never used to have the sword here . "
119960	119968	119891	119891	she	255	" The sword looks well , though . "
119969	119972	119811	119813	the old Helen	254	" Magnificent . "
119973	119980	119891	119891	she	255	" Yes , doesn t it ? "
119981	119989	119811	119813	the old Helen	254	" Where s the piano , Meg ? "
119990	119999	119891	119891	she	255	" I warehoused that in London . Why ? "
120000	120003	119811	119813	the old Helen	254	" Nothing . "
120004	120014	119891	119891	she	255	" Curious , too , that the carpet fits . "
120015	120022	120024	120024	Helen	254	" The carpet s a mistake , "
120026	120050	120024	120024	Helen	254	" I know that we had it in London , but this floor ought to be bare . It is far too beautiful . "
120051	120082	119891	119891	she	255	" You still have a mania for under - furnishing . Would you care to come into the dining - room before you start ? There s no carpet there . "
120096	120107	120109	120109	Helen	254	" Oh , WHAT a place for mother s chiffonier ! "
120111	120119	119891	119891	she	255	" Look at the chairs , though . "
120120	120136	119891	119891	she	255	" Oh , look at them ! Wickham Place faced north , didn t it ? "
120137	120142	119891	119891	she	255	" North - west . "
120143	120170	119891	119891	she	255	" Anyhow , it is thirty years since any of those chairs have felt the sun . Feel . Their dear little backs are quite warm . "
120171	120186	119891	119891	she	255	" But why has Miss Avery made them set to partners ? I shall just-- "
120187	120205	119891	119891	she	255	" Over here , Meg . Put it so that any one sitting will see the lawn . "
120217	120228	119891	119891	she	255	" Ye -- es . The window s too high . "
120229	120237	119891	119891	she	255	" Try a drawing - room chair . "
120238	120268	119891	119891	she	255	" No , I don t like the drawing - room so much . The beam has been match - boarded . It would have been so beautiful otherwise . "
120269	120310	119891	119891	she	255	" Helen , what a memory you have for some things ! You re perfectly right . It s a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women . Men don t know what we want-- "
120311	120316	119891	119891	she	255	" And never will . "
120317	120338	119891	119891	she	255	" I don t agree . In two thousand years they ll know . Look where Tibby spilt the soup . "
120339	120347	119891	119891	she	255	" Coffee . It was coffee surely . "
120353	120369	120350	120350	her	254	" Impossible . Tibby was far too young to be given coffee at that time . "
120370	120375	119891	119891	she	255	" Was father alive ? "
120376	120379	120350	120350	her	254	" Yes . "
120380	120462	119891	119891	she	255	" Then you re right and it must have been soup . I was thinking of much later -- that unsuccessful visit of Aunt Juley s , when she didn t realise that Tibby had grown up . It was coffee then , for he threw it down on purpose . There was some rhyme , Tea , coffee -- coffee tea , that she said to him every morning at breakfast . Wait a minute -- how did it go ? "
120463	120479	120350	120350	her	254	" I know -- no , I don t. What a detestable boy Tibby was ! "
120480	120497	119891	119891	she	255	" But the rhyme was simply awful . No decent person could put up with it . "
120498	120506	120508	120508	Helen	254	" Ah , that greengage - tree , "
120521	120549	120508	120508	Helen	254	" Why do I connect it with dumb - bells ? And there come the chickens . The grass wants cutting . I love yellow - hammers . "
120554	120560	120561	120561	she	255	" I have got it , "
120564	120577	120638	120638	Helen	254	" Tea , tea , coffee , tea , Or chocolaritee . ' "
120578	120592	120638	120638	Helen	254	" That every morning for three weeks . No wonder Tibby was wild . "
120593	120601	120603	120603	Helen	254	" Tibby is moderately a dear now , "
120605	120625	120552	120552	her	254	" There ! I knew you d say that in the end . Of course he s a dear . "
120630	120637	120638	120638	Helen	254	" Listen ! what s that ? "
120641	120650	120638	120638	Helen	254	" Perhaps the Wilcoxes are beginning the siege . "
120651	120657	120695	120695	they	3376	" What nonsense -- listen ! "
120770	120776	120767	120767	She	254	" It is always Meg . "
120835	120844	120819	120820	Their visitor	1836	" Little boy , what do you want ? "
120845	120853	120819	120820	Their visitor	1836	" Please , I am the milk . "
120854	120861	120863	120863	Margaret	255	" Did Miss Avery send you ? "
120868	120873	120819	120820	Their visitor	1836	" Yes , please . "
120874	120886	120888	120888	she	255	" Then take it back and say we require no milk . "
120893	120912	120888	120888	she	255	" No , it s not the siege , but possibly an attempt to provision us against one . "
120913	120919	120921	120921	Helen	254	" But I like milk , "
120923	120929	120921	120921	Helen	254	" Why send it away ? "
120930	120954	120888	120888	she	255	" Do you ? Oh , very well . But we ve nothing to put it in , and he wants the can . "
120955	120969	120971	120972	the boy	662	" Please , I m to call in the morning for the can , "
120974	120983	120888	120888	she	255	" The house will be locked up then . "
120984	120994	120888	120888	she	255	" In the morning would I bring eggs too ? "
120995	121010	120888	120888	she	255	" Are you the boy whom I saw playing in the stacks last week ? "
121017	121027	121014	121014	his	2175	" Well , run away and do it again . "
121028	121033	121035	121035	Helen	254	" Nice little boy , "
121037	121050	121035	121035	Helen	254	" I say , what s your name ? Mine s Helen . "
121051	121054	121014	121014	his	2175	" Tom . "
121082	121100	121014	121014	his	2175	" Tom , this one here is Margaret . And at home we ve another called Tibby . "
121101	121108	121110	121110	Tom	459	" Mine are lop - eareds , "
121119	121140	121014	121014	his	2175	" You re a very good and rather a clever little boy . Mind you come again.--Isn t he charming ? "
121141	121144	121146	121146	Margaret	255	" Undoubtedly , "
121148	121169	121146	121146	Margaret	255	" He is probably the son of Madge , and Madge is dreadful . But this place has wonderful powers . "
121170	121176	121014	121014	his	2175	" What do you mean ? "
121177	121183	121146	121146	Margaret	255	" I don t know . "
121184	121192	121014	121014	his	2175	" Because I probably agree with you . "
121193	121206	121146	121146	Margaret	255	" It kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live . "
121207	121212	121214	121214	Helen	254	" I do agree , "
121222	121237	121214	121214	Helen	254	" But you said that the house was dead not half an hour ago . "
121238	121249	121146	121146	Margaret	255	" Meaning that I was dead . I felt it . "
121250	121310	121214	121214	Helen	254	" Yes , the house has a surer life than we , even if it was empty , and , as it is , I can t get over that for thirty years the sun has never shone full on our furniture . After all , Wickham Place was a grave . Meg , I ve a startling idea . "
121311	121316	121146	121146	Margaret	255	" What is it ? "
121317	121325	121214	121214	Helen	254	" Drink some milk to steady you . "
121329	121339	121341	121341	Helen	254	" No , I won t tell you yet , "
121343	121364	121341	121341	Helen	254	" because you may laugh or be angry . Let s go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing . "
121427	121434	121413	121413	She	254	" Then one would see really . "
121465	121484	121462	121462	she	254	" About my idea . Couldn t you and I camp out in this house for the night ? "
121485	121496	121498	121498	Margaret	255	" I don t think we could well do that , "
121500	121508	121462	121462	she	254	" Here are beds , tables , towels-- "
121509	121529	121462	121462	she	254	" I know ; but the house isn t supposed to be slept in , and Henry s suggestion was-- "
121530	121579	121462	121462	she	254	" I require no suggestions . I shall not alter anything in my plans . But it would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you . It will be something to look back on . Oh , Meg lovey , do let s ! "
121580	121588	121590	121590	Margaret	255	" But , Helen , my pet , "
121592	121630	121590	121590	Margaret	255	" we can t without getting Henry s leave . Of course , he would give it , but you said yourself that you couldn t visit at Ducie Street now , and this is equally intimate . "
121631	121682	121462	121462	she	254	" Ducie Street is his house . This is ours . Our furniture , our sort of people coming to the door . Do let us camp out , just one night , and Tom shall feed us on eggs and milk . Why not ? It s a moon . "
121686	121695	121696	121696	she	255	" I feel Charles wouldn t like it , "
121701	121756	121696	121696	she	255	" Even our furniture annoyed him , and I was going to clear it out when Aunt Juley s illness prevented me . I sympathise with Charles . He feels it s his mother s house . He loves it in rather an untaking way . Henry I could answer for -- not Charles . "
121757	121766	121768	121768	Helen	254	" I know he won t like it , "
121770	121805	121768	121768	Helen	254	" But I am going to pass out of their lives . What difference will it make in the long run if they say , And she even spent the night at Howards End ? "
121806	121826	121462	121462	she	254	" How do you know you ll pass out of their lives ? We have thought that twice before . "
121827	121831	121768	121768	Helen	254	" Because my plans-- "
121832	121840	121462	121462	she	254	" --which you change in a moment . "
121841	121853	121855	121855	Helen	254	" Then because my life is great and theirs are little , "
121860	121935	121855	121855	Helen	254	" I know of things they can t know of , and so do you . We know that there s poetry . We know that there s death . They can only take them on hearsay . We know this is our house , because it feels ours . Oh , they may take the title - deeds and the door - keys , but for this one night we are at home . "
121936	121948	121950	121950	Margaret	255	" It would be lovely to have you once more alone , "
121952	121962	121950	121950	Margaret	255	" It may be a chance in a thousand . "
121963	121971	121972	121972	She	254	" Yes , and we could talk . "
121977	122012	121972	121972	She	254	" It won t be a very glorious story . But under that wych - elm -- honestly , I see little happiness ahead . Can not I have this one night with you ? "
122013	122026	122080	122080	them	3392	" I needn t say how much it would mean to me . "
122027	122032	121972	121972	She	254	" Then let us . "
122033	122051	122080	122080	them	3392	" It is no good hesitating . Shall I drive down to Hilton now and get leave ? "
122052	122061	121972	121972	She	254	" Oh , we don t want leave . "
122124	122130	122132	122132	Helen	254	" Charles may say no , "
122134	122141	122110	122110	they	3392	" We shan t consult him . "
122142	122155	122110	122110	they	3392	" Go if you like ; I should have stopped without leave . "
122198	122227	122110	122110	they	3392	" Expect me back before dark . I am looking forward to it so much . It is like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing . "
122228	122237	122239	122239	Helen	254	" Not a thing , only an ending , "
122370	122373	122364	122364	Dolly	3400	" told , "
122402	122417	122418	122418	she	255	" But the diddums can t listen ; he isn t nine months old , "
122421	122430	122432	122437	her father - in - law	1389	" That s not what I was saying , "
122465	122472	122473	122473	he	717	" Is it what we feared ? "
122476	122480	122432	122437	her father - in - law	1389	" It is . "
122481	122485	122486	122486	he	717	" Dear girl , "
122489	122514	122515	122515	Margaret	255	" there is a troublesome business ahead of us , and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through . "
122520	122593	122515	122515	Margaret	255	" I am obliged to question you on subjects we d both prefer to leave untouched . As you know , I am not one of your Bernard Shaws who consider nothing sacred . To speak as I must will pain me , but there are occasions -- We are husband and wife , not children . I am a man of the world , and you are a most exceptional woman . "
122628	122671	122515	122515	Margaret	255	" I see that you feel as I felt when -- My poor little wife ! Oh , be brave ! Just one or two questions , and I have done with you . Was your sister wearing a wedding - ring ? "
122675	122678	122672	122672	Margaret	255	" No . "
122685	122699	122515	122515	Margaret	255	" Henry , I really came to ask a favour about Howards End . "
122700	122720	122515	122515	Margaret	255	" One point at a time . I am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer . "
122756	122761	122762	122762	he	3407	" Take your time , "
122766	122779	122762	122762	he	3407	" Remember that this is far worse for me than for you . "
122800	122814	122796	122796	she	255	" Seducer ? No ; I do not know her seducer s name . "
122815	122822	122796	122796	she	255	" Would she not tell you ? "
122823	122833	122835	122835	Margaret	255	" I never even asked her who seduced her , "
122844	122849	122851	122851	he	3407	" That is singular . "
122856	122911	122851	122851	he	3407	" Natural perhaps , dear girl , that you shouldn t ask . But until his name is known , nothing can be done . Sit down . How terrible it is to see you so upset ! I knew you weren t fit for it . I wish I hadn t taken you . "
122915	122939	122912	122912	Margaret	255	" I like to stand , if you don t mind , for it gives me a pleasant view of the Six Hills . "
122940	122945	122796	122796	she	255	" As you like . "
122946	122957	122912	122912	Margaret	255	" Have you anything else to ask me , Henry ? "
122958	123008	122796	122796	she	255	" Next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything . I have often noticed your insight , dear . I only wish my own was as good . You may have guessed something , even though your sister said nothing . The slightest hint would help us . "
123009	123014	122912	122912	Margaret	255	" Who is we ? "
123015	123025	122796	122796	she	255	" I thought it best to ring up Charles . "
123026	123031	123033	123033	Margaret	255	" That was unnecessary , "
123038	123047	123033	123033	Margaret	255	" This news will give Charles disproportionate pain . "
123048	123060	122912	122912	Margaret	255	" He has at once gone to call on your brother . "
123061	123067	123033	123033	Margaret	255	" That too was unnecessary . "
123068	123116	122912	122912	Margaret	255	" Let me explain , dear , how the matter stands . You don t think that I and my son are other than gentlemen ? It is in Helen s interests that we are acting . It is still not too late to save her name . "
123126	123136	123137	123137	she	255	" Are we to make her seducer marry her ? "
123140	123146	123193	123193	her	255	" If possible , yes . "
123147	123168	123193	123193	her	255	" But , Henry , suppose he turned out to be married already ? One has heard of such cases . "
123169	123191	123193	123193	her	255	" In that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct , and be thrashed within an inch of his life . "
123254	123263	123251	123251	she	255	" May I ask you my question now ? "
123264	123270	123251	123251	she	255	" Certainly , my dear . "
123271	123279	123251	123251	she	255	" To - morrow Helen goes to Munich-- "
123280	123288	123251	123251	she	255	" Well , possibly she is right . "
123289	123320	123251	123251	she	255	" Henry , let a lady finish . To - morrow she goes ; to - night , with your permission , she would like to sleep at Howards End . "
123383	123388	123389	123389	he	355	" Why Howards End ? "
123394	123410	123389	123389	he	355	" Would she not be more comfortable , as I suggested , at the hotel ? "
123418	123439	123411	123411	Margaret	255	" It is an odd request , but you know what Helen is and what women in her state are . "
123447	123515	123440	123440	He	355	" She has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good . I think she s right . Being one of those imaginative girls , the presence of all our books and furniture soothes her . This is a fact . It is the end of her girlhood . Her last words to me were , A beautiful ending . "
123516	123529	123389	123389	he	355	" She values the old furniture for sentimental reasons , in fact . "
123530	123548	123440	123440	He	355	" Exactly . You have quite understood . It is her last hope of being with it . "
123549	123626	123627	123627	he	3410	" I don t agree there , my dear ! Helen will have her share of the goods wherever she goes -- possibly more than her share , for you are so fond of her that you d give her anything of yours that she fancies , wouldn t you ? and I d raise no objection . I could understand it if it was her old home , because a home , or a house , "
123640	123704	123440	123440	He	355	point--"because a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred , I don t know why . Associations and so on . Now Helen has no associations with Howards End , though I and Charles and Evie have . I do not see why she wants to stay the night there . She will only catch cold . "
123705	123714	123716	123716	Margaret	255	" Leave it that you don t see , "
123718	123740	123716	123716	Margaret	255	" Call it fancy . But realise that fancy is a scientific fact . Helen is fanciful , and wants to . "
123756	123783	123750	123750	He	3410	" If she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two . We shall never get her out of the house , perhaps . "
123784	123787	123789	123789	Margaret	255	" Well ? "
123797	123822	123789	123789	Margaret	255	" And suppose we don t get her out of the house ? Would it matter ? She would do no one any harm . "
123828	123833	123834	123834	she	255	" No , Henry , "
123839	123865	123834	123834	she	255	" I didn t mean that . We will only trouble Howards End for this one night . I take her to London to - morrow-- "
123866	123879	123750	123750	He	3410	" Do you intend to sleep in a damp house , too ? "
123880	123888	123834	123834	she	255	" She can not be left alone . "
123889	123905	123750	123750	He	3410	" That s quite impossible ! Madness . You must be here to meet Charles . "
123906	123929	123834	123834	she	255	" I have already told you that your message to Charles was unnecessary , and I have no desire to meet him . "
123930	123936	123750	123750	He	3410	" Margaret -- my Margaret . "
123937	123964	123834	123834	she	255	" What has this business to do with Charles ? If it concerns me little , it concerns you less , and Charles not at all . "
123965	123974	123976	123977	Mr. Wilcox	258	" As the future owner of Howards End , "
123982	123992	123976	123977	Mr. Wilcox	258	" I should say that it did concern Charles . "
123993	124006	124030	124031	each other	3998	" In what way ? Will Helen s condition depreciate the property ? "
124007	124016	123976	123977	Mr. Wilcox	258	" My dear , you are forgetting yourself . "
124017	124026	124030	124031	each other	3998	" I think you yourself recommended plain speaking . "
124043	124049	124051	124051	Henry	355	" Helen commands my sympathy , "
124053	124108	124051	124051	Henry	355	" As your husband , I shall do all for her that I can , and I have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning . But I can not treat her as if nothing has happened . I should be false to my position in society if I did . "
124117	124129	124130	124130	she	3413	" No , let us go back to Helen s request , "
124133	124232	124130	124130	she	3413	" It is unreasonable , but the request of an unhappy girl . Tomorrow she will go to Germany , and trouble society no longer . To - night she asks to sleep in your empty house -- a house which you do not care about , and which you have not occupied for over a year . May she ? Will you give my sister leave ? Will you forgive her as you hope to be forgiven , and as you have actually been forgiven ? Forgive her for one night only . That will be enough . "
124233	124241	124268	124268	her	255	" As I have actually been forgiven-- ? "
124242	124254	124256	124256	Margaret	255	" Never mind for the moment what I mean by that , "
124258	124263	124256	124256	Margaret	255	" Answer my question . "
124290	124354	124287	124287	he	3414	" I seem rather unaccommodating , but I have some experience of life , and know how one thing leads to another . I am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel . I have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider . I am sorry , but see that she leaves my house at once . "
124355	124362	124287	124287	he	3414	" You have mentioned Mrs. Wilcox . "
124363	124369	124287	124287	he	3414	" I beg your pardon ? "
124370	124384	124287	124287	he	3414	" A rare occurrence . In reply , may I mention Mrs. Bast ? "
124385	124394	124396	124396	Henry	355	" You have not been yourself all day , "
124421	124428	124429	124429	she	255	" Not any more of this ! "
124432	124623	124429	124429	she	255	" You shall see the connection if it kills you , Henry ! You have had a mistress -- I forgave you . My sister has a lover -- you drive her from the house . Do you see the connection ? Stupid , hypocritical , cruel -- oh , contemptible!--a man who insults his wife when she s alive and cants with her memory when she s dead . A man who ruins a woman for his pleasure , and casts her off to ruin other men . And gives bad financial advice , and then says he is not responsible . These men are you . You can t recognise them , because you can not connect . I ve had enough of your unneeded kindness . I ve spoilt you long enough . All your life you have been spoiled . Mrs. Wilcox spoiled you . No one has ever told what you are -- muddled , criminally muddled . Men like you use repentance as a blind , so don t repent . Only say to yourself , What Helen has done , I ve done . "
124624	124631	124632	124632	Henry	355	" The two cases are different , "
124658	124705	124784	124784	his	355	" In what way different ? You have betrayed Mrs. Wilcox , Helen only herself . You remain in society , Helen can t. You have had only pleasure , she may die . You have the insolence to talk to me of differences , Henry ? "
124718	124781	124713	124713	Henry	355	" I perceive you are attempting blackmail . It is scarcely a pretty weapon for a wife to use against her husband . My rule through life has been never to pay the least attention to threats , and I can only repeat what I said before : I do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at Howards End . "
125352	125365	125348	125348	he	259	" I suppose you realise that you are your sister s protector ? "
125366	125371	125308	125308	them	3447	" In what sense ? "
125372	125397	125348	125348	he	259	" If a man played about with my sister , I d send a bullet through him , but perhaps you don t mind . "
125398	125404	125406	125406	Tibby	259	" I mind very much , "
125408	125426	125348	125348	he	259	" Who d ye suspect , then ? Speak out man . One always suspects some one . "
125427	125437	125439	125439	he	259	" No one . I don t think so . "
125452	125458	125460	125460	Charles	512	" You are hiding something , "
125474	125493	125494	125494	he	259	" When you saw her last , did she mention any one s name ? Yes or no ! "
125502	125515	125439	125439	he	259	" In my rooms she mentioned some friends , called the Basts . "
125516	125522	125466	125466	he	259	" Who are the Basts ? "
125523	125534	125439	125439	he	259	" People -- friends of hers at Evie s wedding . "
125535	125595	125466	125466	he	259	" I don t remember . But , by great Scott , I do ! My aunt told me about some rag - tag . Was she full of them when you saw her ? Is there a man ? Did she speak of the man ? Or -- look here -- have you had any dealings with him ? "
125678	125709	125713	125713	himself	259	" I see -- you are in his confidence . They met at your rooms . Oh , what a family , what a family ! God help the poor pater-- "
126092	126096	126098	126098	Helen	254	" One isolates , "
126101	126145	126098	126098	Helen	254	" I isolated Mr. Wilcox from the other forces that were pulling Leonard downhill . Consequently , I was full of pity , and almost of revenge . For weeks I had blamed Mr. Wilcox only , and so , when your letters came-- "
126146	126154	126156	126156	Margaret	255	" I need never have written them , "
126158	126178	126156	126156	Margaret	255	" They never shielded Henry . How hopeless it is to tidy away the past , even for others ! "
126179	126195	126083	126083	her	254	" I did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the Basts . "
126196	126206	126156	126156	Margaret	255	" Looking back , that was wrong of me . "
126207	126481	126083	126083	her	254	" Looking back , darling , I know that it was right . It is right to save the man whom one loves . I am less enthusiastic about justice now . But we both thought you wrote at his dictation . It seemed the last touch of his callousness . Being very much wrought up by this time -- and Mrs. Bast was upstairs . I had not seen her , and had talked for a long time to Leonard -- I had snubbed him for no reason , and that should have warned me I was in danger . So when the notes came I wanted us to go to you for an explanation . He said that he guessed the explanation -- he knew of it , and you mustn t know . I pressed him to tell me . He said no one must know ; it was something to do with his wife . Right up to the end we were Mr. Bast and Miss Schlegel . I was going to tell him that he must be frank with me when I saw his eyes , and guessed that Mr. Wilcox had ruined him in two ways , not one . I drew him to me . I made him tell me . I felt very lonely myself . He is not to blame . He would have gone on worshipping me . I want never to see him again , though it sounds appalling . I wanted to give him money and feel finished . Oh , Meg , the little that is known about these things ! "
126490	126523	126083	126083	her	254	" The little , too , that is known about growth ! Both times it was loneliness , and the night , and panic afterwards . Did Leonard grow out of Paul ? "
126579	126588	126589	126589	she	3464	" Leonard is a better growth than madness , "
126592	126609	126589	126589	she	3464	" I was afraid that you would react against Paul until you went over the verge . "
126610	126675	126565	126565	she	3464	" I did react until I found poor Leonard . I am steady now . I shan t ever like your Henry , dearest Meg , or even speak kindly about him , but all that blinding hate is over . I shall never rave against Wilcoxes any more . I understand how you married him , and you will now be very happy . "
126681	126684	126686	126686	Helen	254	" Yes , "
126694	126701	126688	126688	her	254	" I do at last understand . "
126702	126716	126589	126589	she	3464	" Except Mrs. Wilcox , dearest , no one understands our little movements . "
126717	126725	126688	126688	her	254	" Because in death -- I agree . "
126726	126846	126589	126589	she	3464	" Not quite . I feel that you and I and Henry are only fragments of that woman s mind . She knows everything . She is everything . She is the house , and the tree that leans over it . People have their own deaths as well as their own lives , and even if there is nothing beyond death , we shall differ in our nothingness . I can not believe that knowledge such as hers will perish with knowledge such as mine . She knew about realities . She knew when people were in love , though she was not in the room . I don t doubt that she knew when Henry deceived her . "
126847	126855	126688	126688	her	254	" Good - night , Mrs. Wilcox , "
126860	126870	126589	126589	she	3464	" Oh , good - night , Miss Avery . "
126871	126880	126881	126881	Helen	254	" Why should Miss Avery work for us ? "
126884	126889	126589	126589	she	3464	" Why , indeed ? "
126948	126957	126959	126959	Helen	254	" This is not quite our house yet , "
126961	126977	126959	126959	Helen	254	" When Miss Avery called , I felt we are only a couple of tourists . "
126978	126989	127075	127075	she	255	" We shall be that everywhere , and for ever . "
126990	126995	126959	126959	Helen	254	" But affectionate tourists . "
126996	127007	127075	127075	she	255	" But tourists who pretend each hotel is their home . "
127008	127016	127018	127018	Helen	254	" I can t pretend very long , "
127020	127064	127018	127018	Helen	254	" Sitting under this tree one forgets , but I know that to - morrow I shall see the moon rise out of Germany . Not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case . Unless you will come with me . "
127132	127150	127101	127101	her	255	" Are you serious in asking me , Helen ? Should I get on with your Monica ? "
127151	127164	127101	127101	her	255	" You would not , but I am serious in asking you . "
127165	127178	127101	127101	her	255	" Still , no more plans now . And no more reminiscences . "
127259	127263	127265	127265	Margaret	255	" Sleep now , "
127319	127322	127275	127275	her	255	" now , "
127324	127326	127275	127275	her	255	" now "

127500	127510	127494	127494	he	3855	" Brute -- you brute , I couldn t have-- "
127608	127620	127592	127592	He	311	" Oh what SHALL I do , whatever SHALL I do ? "
128113	128125	128098	128098	he	311	" There is nothing to choose between us , after all . "
128255	128261	128263	128263	Blanche	536	" A letter from Leonard , "
128268	128275	128263	128263	Blanche	536	" and after all this time . "
128315	128321	128323	128325	the other sister	3504	" A letter from Leonard ! "
128444	128459	128440	128440	he	311	" She minds that ! What would she say if she knew the truth ? "
128621	128640	128648	128650	a hard man	3518	" And if I drink oblivion of a day , So shorten I the stature of my soul . "
129361	129373	129355	129356	the clerks	3543	" Excuse me , sir , but is your boss married ? "
129382	129389	129379	129379	some	1079	" What s that to you ? "
129545	129552	129553	129553	he	311	" Does Mrs. Wilcox live here ? "
129556	129561	129528	129529	the parlourmaid	3551	" She s out , "
129566	129573	129593	129593	her	255	" When will she be back ? "
129574	129579	129581	129582	the parlourmaid	3551	" I ll ask , "
129657	129672	129653	129653	He	259	" I don t know . Hilton . Howards End . Who is it ? "
129673	129680	129708	129708	her	255	" I ll ask , sir . "
129681	129688	129653	129653	He	259	" No , don t bother . "
129689	129699	129704	129704	Leonard	311	" They have taken the car to Howards End , "
129717	129728	129729	129729	she	255	" You appear to want to know a good deal , "
129755	129763	129736	129736	her	255	" Is it a village , please ? "
129764	129796	129741	129741	She	255	" Village ! It s Mr. Wilcox s private house -- at least , it s one of them . Mrs. Wilcox keeps her furniture there . Hilton is the village . "
129797	129807	129736	129736	her	255	" Yes . And when will they be back ? "
129808	129824	129825	129825	She	255	" Mr. Schlegel doesn t know . We can t know everything , can we ? "
129923	129935	129918	129920	Part of him	3559	" Why horrible ? It s ordinary light from the moon . "
129936	129941	129918	129920	Part of him	3559	" But it moves . "
129942	129948	129918	129920	Part of him	3559	" So does the moon . "
129949	129957	129918	129920	Part of him	3559	" But it is a clenched fist . "
129958	129962	129918	129920	Part of him	3559	" Why not ? "
129963	129972	129918	129920	Part of him	3559	" But it is going to touch me . "
129973	129977	129918	129920	Part of him	3559	" Let it . "
130004	130012	129918	129920	Part of him	3559	" Is there life in the moon ? "
130013	130017	129918	129920	Part of him	3559	" Of course . "
130018	130026	129918	129920	Part of him	3559	" But I thought it was uninhabited . "
130027	130041	129918	129920	Part of him	3559	" Not by Time , Death , Judgment , and the smaller snakes . "
130042	130046	130048	130048	Leonard	311	" Smaller snakes ! "
130053	130058	130048	130048	Leonard	311	" What a notion ! "
130109	130123	130048	130048	Leonard	311	" I say , Jacky , I m going out for a bit . "
130287	130297	130284	130284	her	3561	" Hullo , Len ! What ho , Len ! "
130298	130309	130284	130284	her	3561	" What ho , Jacky ! see you again later . "
130666	130669	130663	130663	her	3583	" now . "
131122	131131	131117	131117	He	311	" Mrs. Wilcox , I have done wrong , "
131215	131238	131206	131212	a man whom he had never seen	3617	" Oh , is he there ? I am not surprised . I now thrash him within an inch of his life . "
131239	131243	131245	131245	Leonard	311	" Mrs. Wilcox , "
131247	131253	131245	131245	Leonard	311	" I have done wrong . "
131264	131270	131254	131255	The man	717	" Bring me a stick . "
131309	131314	131316	131316	Charles	512	" Get some water , "
131326	131348	131316	131316	Charles	512	" He s shamming . Of course I only used the blade . Here , carry him out into the air . "
131378	131383	131385	131385	Charles	512	" That s enough , "
131387	131394	131396	131397	Miss Avery	456	" Yes , murder s enough , "
131458	131468	131470	131470	Charles	512	" I don t know where she is , pater "
131472	131483	131470	131470	Charles	512	" Dolly kept back dinner nearly an hour for her . "
131484	131492	131506	131507	his father	3994	" Tell me when she comes in . "
131522	131553	131590	131590	sir	3939	" I ll sit up for her as late as you like , but she can hardly be coming . Isn t she stopping with her sister at the hotel ? "
131554	131557	131559	131560	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Perhaps , "
131561	131563	131590	131590	sir	3939	thoughtfully--"perhaps . "
131564	131574	131590	131590	sir	3939	" Can I do anything for you , sir ? "
131575	131584	131590	131590	sir	3939	" Not to - night , my boy . "
131646	131652	131653	131653	he	258	" I can t sleep , "
131656	131670	131653	131653	he	258	" I had better have a talk with you and get it over . "
131720	131729	131731	131732	Mr. Wilcox	258	" She will feel differently in the morning , "
131744	131814	131815	131815	He	258	" But I can not let this kind of thing continue without comment . I am morally certain that she is with her sister at Howards End . The house is mine -- and , Charles , it will be yours -- and when I say that no one is to live there , I mean that no one is to live there . I won t have it . "
131822	131841	131815	131815	He	258	" To my mind this question is connected with something far greater , the rights of property itself . "
131842	131845	131847	131847	Charles	258	" Undoubtedly , "
131870	131937	131849	131850	Mr. Wilcox	258	" I don t want you to conclude that my wife and I had anything of the nature of a quarrel . She was only overwrought , as who would not be ? I shall do what I can for Helen , but on the understanding that they clear out of the house at once . Do you see ? That is a sine qua non . "
131938	131953	132002	132002	he	258	" Then at eight to - morrow I may go up in the car ? "
131954	131979	131849	131850	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Eight or earlier . Say that you are acting as my representative , and , of course , use no violence , Charles . "
132074	132081	132083	132083	Charles	258	" It has been pretty horrible , "
132086	132102	132083	132083	Charles	258	" They were there , and they had the man up there with them too . "
132103	132109	132045	132046	the police	4562	" What -- what man ? "
132110	132122	132083	132083	Charles	258	" I told you last night . His name was Bast . "
132123	132131	132133	132134	Mr. Wilcox	258	" My God ! is it possible ? "
132136	132151	132133	132134	Mr. Wilcox	258	" In your mother s house ! Charles , in your mother s house ! "
132152	132216	132083	132083	Charles	258	" I know , pater . That was what I felt . As a matter of fact , there is no need to trouble about the man . He was in the last stages of heart disease , and just before I could show him what I thought of him he went off . The police are seeing about it at this moment . "
132222	132304	132045	132046	the police	4562	" I got up there -- oh , it couldn t have been more than half - past seven . The Avery woman was lighting a fire for them . They were still upstairs . I waited in the drawing - room . We were all moderately civil and collected , though I had my suspicions . I gave them your message , and Mrs. Wilcox said , Oh yes , I see ; yes , in that way of hers . "
132305	132309	132083	132083	Charles	258	" Nothing else ? "
132310	132341	132045	132046	the police	4562	" I promised to tell you , with her love , that she was going to Germany with her sister this evening . That was all we had time for . "
132347	132398	132083	132083	Charles	258	" Because by then I suppose the man got tired of hiding , for suddenly Mrs. Wilcox screamed out his name . I recognised it , and I went for him in the hall . Was I right , pater ? I thought things were going a little too far . "
132399	132437	132438	132438	He	258	" Right , my dear boy ? I don t know . But you would have been no son of mine if you hadn t. Then did he just -- just -- crumple up as you said ? "
132445	132491	132045	132046	the police	4562	" He caught hold of the bookcase , which came down over him . So I merely put the sword down and carried him into the garden . We all thought he was shamming . However , he s dead right enough . Awful business ! "
132492	132495	132497	132498	his father	3994	" Sword ? "
132506	132513	132503	132503	his	3994	" What sword ? Whose sword ? "
132514	132520	132438	132438	He	258	" A sword of theirs . "
132521	132529	132503	132503	his	3994	" What were you doing with it ? "
132530	132578	132438	132438	He	258	" Well , didn t you see , pater , I had to snatch up the first thing handy . I hadn t a riding - whip or stick . I caught him once or twice over the shoulders with the flat of their old German sword . "
132579	132583	132503	132503	his	3994	" Then what ? "
132584	132598	132600	132600	Charles	512	" He pulled over the bookcase , as I said , and fell , "
132622	132637	132503	132503	his	3994	" But the real cause was heart disease ? Of that you re sure ? "
132638	132660	132689	132690	the police	4562	" That or a fit . However , we shall hear more than enough at the inquest on such unsavoury topics . "
132783	132796	132798	132799	his father	3994	" I think I ll go round to the police - station , "
132805	132809	132811	132811	Dolly	3652	" What for ? "
132818	132821	132811	132811	Dolly	3652	" told . "
132822	132834	132774	132774	they	3644	" Very well , sir . Which car will you have ? "
132835	132842	132811	132811	Dolly	3652	" I think I ll walk . "
132843	132852	132854	132854	Charles	512	" It s a good half - mile , "
132861	132889	132854	132854	Charles	512	" The sun s very hot for April . Shan t I take you up , and then , perhaps , a little spin round by Tewin ? "
132890	132904	132906	132907	Mr. Wilcox	258	" You go on as if I didn t know my own mind , "
132915	132944	132910	132910	Charles	258	" You young fellows one idea is to get into a motor . I tell you , I want to walk ; I m very fond of walking . "
132945	132982	133015	133016	his father	3994	" Oh , all right ; I m about the house if you want me for anything . I thought of not going up to the office to - day , if that is your wish . "
132983	132992	132994	132995	Mr. Wilcox	258	" It is , indeed , my boy , "
133138	133140	133132	133132	he	258	" I "
133219	133224	133226	133226	Charles	258	" I expected that , "
133228	133239	133226	133226	Charles	258	" I shall naturally be the most important witness there . "
133556	133567	133547	133548	Miss Avery	456	" No one ever told the lad he ll have a child"--they
133876	133886	133887	133887	she	254	" No doubt Mr. Wilcox may have induced death , "
133890	133907	133887	133887	she	254	" but if it wasn t one thing it would have been another as you know . "
134019	134023	134024	134025	the Schlegels	267	" Nothing matters , "
134032	134046	134024	134025	the Schlegels	267	" except one s self - respect and that of one s friends . "
134680	134690	134691	134691	she	255	" Is it the keys that Mr. Wilcox wants ? "
134694	134702	134676	134676	he	355	" He didn t say , madam . "
134703	134712	134676	134676	he	355	" You haven t any note for me ? "
134713	134721	134676	134676	he	355	" He didn t say , madam . "
134845	134855	134841	134841	he	355	" I prefer to discuss things with you outside . "
134856	134870	134872	134872	Margaret	255	" It will be more appropriate in the road , I am afraid , "
134874	134881	134872	134872	Margaret	255	" Did you get my message ? "
134882	134886	134841	134841	he	355	" What about ? "
134887	134934	134872	134872	Margaret	255	" I am going to Germany with my sister . I must tell you now that I shall make it my permanent home . Our talk last night was more important than you have realised . I am unable to forgive you and am leaving you . "
134935	134941	134943	134943	Henry	355	" I am extremely tired , "
134949	134965	134943	134943	Henry	355	" I have been walking about all the morning , and wish to sit down . "
134966	134979	134872	134872	Margaret	255	" Certainly , if you will consent to sit on the grass . "
135036	135042	135044	135044	Margaret	255	" Here are your keys , "
135069	135077	135078	135078	he	355	" I have something to tell you , "
135105	135114	135115	135115	she	3722	" I don t want to hear it , "
135118	135152	135115	135115	she	3722	" My sister is going to be ill . My life is going to be with her now . We must manage to build up something , she and I and her child . "
135153	135159	135078	135078	he	355	" Where are you going ? "
135160	135176	135115	135115	she	3722	" Munich . We start after the inquest , if she is not too ill . "
135177	135182	135078	135078	he	355	" After the inquest ? "
135183	135186	135115	135115	she	3722	" Yes . "
135187	135200	135078	135078	he	355	" Have you realised what the verdict at the inquest will be ? "
135201	135207	135115	135115	she	3722	" Yes , heart disease . "
135208	135216	135078	135078	he	355	" No , my dear ; manslaughter . "
135236	135239	135241	135242	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Manslaughter , "
135244	135277	135241	135242	Mr. Wilcox	258	" Charles may go to prison . I dare not tell him . I don t know what to do -- what to do . I m broken -- I m ended . "
135450	135457	135458	135458	she	254	" I haven t any idea , "
135461	135470	135458	135458	she	254	" Do you suppose baby may , Meg ? "
135481	135486	135487	135487	she	255	" What was that ? "
135490	135505	135458	135458	she	254	" Tom wants to know whether baby is old enough to play with hay ? "
135506	135514	135516	135516	Margaret	255	" I haven t the least notion , "
135525	135590	135458	135458	she	254	" Now , Tom , baby is not to stand ; he is not to lie on his face ; he is not to lie so that his head wags ; he is not to be teased or tickled ; and he is not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter . Will you be as careful as all that ? "
135597	135605	135607	135607	Margaret	255	" That child is a wonderful nursemaid , "
135609	135623	135625	135625	Helen	254	" He is fond of baby . That s why he does it ! "
135629	135638	135625	135625	Helen	254	" They re going to be lifelong friends . "
135639	135649	135594	135594	his	459	" Starting at the ages of six and one ? "
135650	135663	135625	135625	Helen	254	" Of course . It will be a great thing for Tom . "
135664	135674	135594	135594	his	459	" It may be a greater thing for baby . "
135823	135831	135833	135833	Helen	254	" What a time they all are ! "
135835	135843	135844	135844	Margaret	255	" What can they be doing inside ? "
135887	135897	135899	135899	Helen	254	" I wish Henry was out to enjoy this , "
135901	135919	135899	135899	Helen	254	" This lovely weather and to be shut up in the house ! It s very hard . "
135920	135926	135928	135928	Margaret	255	" It has to be , "
135930	135949	135928	135928	Margaret	255	" The hay fever is his chief objection against living here , but he thinks it worth while . "
135950	135966	135873	135874	a man	569	" Meg , is or isn t he ill ? I can t make out . "
135967	136000	135928	135928	Margaret	255	" Not ill . Eternally tired . He has worked very hard all his life , and noticed nothing . Those are the people who collapse when they do notice a thing . "
136001	136014	135873	135874	a man	569	" I suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle . "
136015	136048	135928	135928	Margaret	255	" Dreadfully . That is why I wish Dolly had not come , too , to - day . Still , he wanted them all to come . It has to be . "
136049	136056	135873	135874	a man	569	" Why does he want them ? "
136062	136075	135873	135874	a man	569	" Meg , may I tell you something ? I like Henry . "
136076	136086	136088	136088	Margaret	255	" You d be odd if you didn t , "
136090	136096	136104	136104	her	255	" I usen t to . "
136097	136101	136102	136102	She	255	" Usen t ! "
136170	136179	136208	136208	she	254	" I like Henry because he does worry . "
136180	136189	136208	136208	she	254	" And he likes you because you don t. "
136211	136215	136208	136208	she	254	" About love , "
136229	136371	136208	136208	she	254	" I mean a woman s love for a man . I supposed I should hang my life on to that once , and was driven up and down and about as if something was worrying through me . But everything is peaceful now ; I seem cured . That Herr Forstmeister , whom Frieda keeps writing about , must be a noble character , but he doesn t see that I shall never marry him or anyone . It isn t shame or mistrust of myself . I simply couldn t. I m ended . I used to be so dreamy about a man s love as a girl , and think that for good or evil love must be the great thing . But it hasn t been ; it has been itself a dream . Do you agree ? "
136372	136382	136208	136208	she	254	" I do not agree . I do not . "
136383	136393	136395	136395	Helen	254	" I ought to remember Leonard as my lover , "
136403	136456	136457	136457	Her	254	" I tempted him , and killed him , and it is surely the least I can do . I would like to throw out all my heart to Leonard on such an afternoon as this . But I can not . It is no good pretending . I am forgetting him . "
136463	136477	136478	136478	She	254	" How nothing seems to match -- how , my darling , my precious-- "
136482	136485	136478	136478	She	254	" Tommy ! "
136486	136491	136457	136457	Her	254	" Yes , please ? "
136492	136544	136478	136478	She	254	" Baby s not to try and stand.--There s something wanting in me . I see you loving Henry , and understanding him better daily , and I know that death wouldn t part you in the least . But I -- Is it some awful , appalling , criminal defect ? "
136552	136764	136549	136549	She	255	" It is only that people are far more different than is pretended . All over the world men and women are worrying because they can not develop as they are supposed to develop . Here and there they have the matter out , and it comforts them . Don t fret yourself , Helen . Develop what you have ; love your child . I do not love children . I am thankful to have none . I can play with their beauty and charm , but that is all -- nothing real , not one scrap of what there ought to be . And others -- others go farther still , and move outside humanity altogether . A place , as well as a person , may catch the glow . Don t you see that all this leads to comfort in the end ? It is part of the battle against sameness . Differences , eternal differences , planted by God in a single family , so that there may always be colour ; sorrow perhaps , but colour in the daily grey . Then I can t have you worrying about Leonard . Don t drag in the personal when it will not come . Forget him . "
136765	136779	136874	136874	Helen	254	" Yes , yes , but what has Leonard got out of life ? "
136780	136785	136549	136549	She	255	" Perhaps an adventure . "
136786	136791	136874	136874	Helen	254	" Is that enough ? "
136792	136801	136549	136549	She	255	" Not for us . But for him . "
136848	136854	136856	136856	Margaret	255	" Is it sweetening yet ? "
136858	136864	136549	136549	She	255	" No , only withered . "
136865	136873	136549	136549	She	255	" It will sweeten to - morrow . "
136877	136887	136888	136888	she	254	" Oh , Meg , you are a person , "
136891	136923	136888	136888	she	254	" Think of the racket and torture this time last year . But now I couldn t stop unhappy if I tried . What a change -- and all through you ! "
136924	136952	136549	136549	She	255	" Oh , we merely settled down . You and Henry learnt to understand one another and to forgive , all through the autumn and the winter . "
136953	136962	136888	136888	she	254	" Yes , but who settled us down ? "
136985	136988	136990	136990	Helen	254	" You ! "
136992	137114	136990	136990	Helen	254	" You did it all , sweetest , though you re too stupid to see . Living here was your plan -- I wanted you ; he wanted you ; and everyone said it was impossible , but you knew . Just think of our lives without you , Meg -- I and baby with Monica , revolting by theory , he handed about from Dolly to Evie . But you picked up the pieces , and made us a home . Can t it strike you -- even for a moment -- that your life has been heroic ? Can t you remember the two months after Charles s arrest , when you began to act , and did all ? "
137115	137124	137126	137126	Margaret	255	" You were both ill at the time , "
137128	137192	137126	137126	Margaret	255	" I did the obvious things . I had two invalids to nurse . Here was a house , ready furnished and empty . It was obvious . I didn t know myself it would turn into a permanent home . No doubt I have done a little towards straightening the tangle , but things that I can t phrase have helped me . "
137193	137201	137203	137203	Helen	254	" I hope it will be permanent , "
137211	137228	137126	137126	Margaret	255	" I think so . There are moments when I feel Howards End peculiarly our own . "
137229	137238	137126	137126	Margaret	255	" All the same , London s creeping . "
137262	137273	137274	137274	she	254	" You see that in Surrey and even Hampshire now , "
137277	137313	137274	137274	she	254	" I can see it from the Purbeck Downs . And London is only part of something else , I m afraid . Life s going to be melted down , all over the world . "
137377	137394	137395	137395	she	254	" Because a thing is going strong now , it need not go strong for ever , "
137398	137473	137395	137395	she	254	" This craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred years . It may be followed by a civilisation that won t be a movement , because it will rest on the earth . All the signs are against it now , but I can t help hoping , and very early in the morning in the garden I feel that our house is the future as well as the past . "
137507	137513	137504	137504	Margaret	255	" Oh , take care-- ! "
137529	137541	137566	137572	a man with a heavy black moustache	3759	" The conclave s breaking at last . I ll go . "
137574	137582	137583	137583	he	3759	" My father has asked for you , "
137596	137603	137604	137604	he	3759	" We have been talking business , "
137607	137619	137604	137604	he	3759	" but I dare say you knew all about it beforehand . "
137620	137626	137627	137629	Clumsy of movement	3760	" Yes , I did . "
137796	137804	137806	137806	Henry	355	" Is this going to suit everyone ? "
137826	137846	137812	137812	He	355	" Because I don t want you all coming here later on and complaining that I have been unfair . "
137847	137856	137858	137858	Paul	256	" It s apparently got to suit us , "
137860	137885	137812	137812	He	355	" I beg your pardon , my boy . You have only to speak , and I will leave the house to you instead . "
137899	137932	137933	137933	he	256	" As I ve given up the outdoor life that suited me , and I have come home to look after the business , it s no good my settling down here , "
137938	137953	137933	137933	he	256	" It s not really the country , and it s not the town . "
137954	137966	137812	137812	He	355	" Very well . Does my arrangement suit you , Evie ? "
137967	137973	137933	137933	he	256	" Of course , father . "
137974	137980	137812	137812	He	355	" And you , Dolly ? "
137996	138000	138001	138001	she	3769	" Perfectly splendidly , "
138004	138072	138001	138001	she	3769	" I thought Charles wanted it for the boys , but last time I saw him he said no , because we can not possibly live in this part of England again . Charles says we ought to change our name , but I can not think what to , for Wilcox just suits Charles and me , and I can t think of any other name . "
138098	138109	138111	138111	Henry	355	" Then I leave Howards End to my wife absolutely , "
138113	138134	138111	138111	Henry	355	" And let everyone understand that ; and after I am dead let there be no jealousy and no surprise . "
138170	138181	138183	138183	Henry	355	" In consequence , I leave my wife no money , "
138185	138284	138183	138183	Henry	355	" That is her own wish . All that she would have had will be divided among you . I am also giving you a great deal in my lifetime , so that you may be independent of me . That is her wish , too . She also is giving away a great deal of money . She intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten years ; she intends when she dies to leave the house to her nephew , down in the field . Is all that clear ? Does everyone understand ? "
138316	138339	138313	138313	he	256	" Down in the field ? Oh , come ! I think we might have had the whole establishment , piccaninnies included . "
138344	138357	138340	138341	Mrs. Cahill	543	" Don t , Paul . You promised you d take care . "
138379	138387	138388	138388	he	822	" Good - bye , old girl , "
138391	138399	138388	138388	he	822	" don t you worry about me . "
138400	138407	138419	138419	she	3776	" Good - bye , dad . "
138426	138457	138419	138419	she	3776	" Good - bye , Mr. Wilcox . It does seem curious that Mrs. Wilcox should have left Margaret Howards End , and yet she get it , after all . "
138467	138470	138471	138471	she	3776	" Goodbye , "
138496	138501	138471	138471	she	3776	" Good - bye . "
138502	138509	138471	138471	she	3776	" Good - bye , Dolly . "
138510	138516	138471	138471	she	3776	" So long , father . "
138517	138531	138471	138471	she	3776	" Good - bye , my boy ; always take care of yourself . "
138532	138540	138471	138471	she	3776	" Good - bye , Mrs. Wilcox . "
138541	138546	138471	138471	she	3776	" Good - bye . "
138587	138607	138584	138584	she	255	" Could you tell me , Henry , what was that about Mrs. Wilcox having left me Howards End ? "
138612	138695	138609	138609	he	1134	" Yes , she did . But that is a very old story . When she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some return , and , not being herself at the time , scribbled Howards End on a piece of paper . I went into it thoroughly , and , as it was clearly fanciful , I set it aside , little knowing what my Margaret would be to me in the future . "
138713	138723	138724	138724	he	1134	" I didn t do wrong , did I ? "
138730	138743	138609	138609	he	1134	" You didn t , darling . Nothing has been done wrong . "
138750	138757	138759	138759	Henry	355	" Here they are at last ! "
138793	138799	138800	138800	Helen	254	" The field s cut ! "
138802	138826	138800	138800	Helen	254	excitedly--"the big meadow ! We ve seen to the very end , and it ll be such a crop of hay as never ! "
