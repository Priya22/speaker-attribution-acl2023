2477	2499	2473	2473	Francis	44	" but if a man accomplishes anything , after all , it seems only a short time to look back upon . "
2500	2541	2430	2430	her	268	" All time is short to look back upon . It is the looking forward to it that counts . It does n't , though , with a man , I suppose . He 's doing something all the while . "
2542	2564	2473	2473	Francis	44	" Yes , a man is always doing something , even if only waiting ; but waiting is such unheroic business . "
2565	2595	2430	2430	her	268	" That is the part that usually falls to a woman 's lot . I have no doubt that some dark - eyed mademoiselle is waiting for you now . "
2711	2754	2702	2702	Someone	273	" Oh , Miss Claire , you will not dare to talk with such little awe to our friend when he comes back with his ribbons and his medals . Why , we shall all have to bow to you , Frank ! "
2755	2763	2765	2765	Francis	44	" You 're wronging me , Esterton , "
2767	2792	2765	2765	Francis	44	" No foreign decoration could ever be to me as much as the flower of approval from the fair women of my own State . "
2793	2796	2798	2799	the ladies	274	" Hear ! "
2801	2823	2702	2702	Someone	273	" Trust artists and poets to pay pretty compliments , and this wily friend of mine pays his at my expense . "
2824	2835	2836	2839	an old military man	275	" A good bit of generalship , that , Frank , "
2843	2863	2836	2839	an old military man	275	" Esterton opened the breach and you at once galloped in . That 's the highest art of war . "
3083	3090	3091	3091	he	39	" What is it , Francis ? "
3098	3107	3079	3080	his brother	201	" I have just discovered a considerable loss , "
3116	3134	3079	3080	his brother	201	" If it is no worse than loss , I am glad ; but what is it ? "
3135	3155	3079	3080	his brother	201	" Every cent of money that I had to secure my letter of credit is gone from my bureau . "
3156	3164	3079	3080	his brother	201	" What ? When did it disappear ? "
3165	3211	3079	3080	his brother	201	" I went to my bureau to - night for something and found the money gone ; then I remembered that when I opened it two days ago I must have left the key in the lock , as I found it to - night . "
3212	3275	3290	3291	his brother	201	" It 's a bad business , but do n't let 's talk of it now . Come , let 's go back to our guests . Do n't look so cut up about it , Frank , old man . It is n't as bad as it might be , and you must n't show a gloomy face to - night . "
3359	3378	3379	3379	he	291	" When Leslie is in bed , come into the library . I will wait for you there , "
3387	3393	3395	3396	his brother	201	" Poor , foolish Frank , "
3398	3408	3395	3396	his brother	201	" as if the loss could matter to him . "
3442	3457	3428	3428	He	291	" Come , brace up now , Frank , and tell me about it . "
3478	3492	3493	3493	he	44	" I do n't know what you 'll think of me , Maurice , "
3496	3508	3493	3493	he	44	" I have never before been guilty of such criminal carelessness . "
3509	3533	3428	3428	He	291	" Do n't stop to accuse yourself . Our only hope in this matter lies in prompt action . Where was the money ? "
3534	3643	3493	3493	he	44	" In the oak cabinet and lying in the bureau drawer . Such a thing as a theft seemed so foreign to this place that I was never very particular about the box . But I did not know until I went to it to - night that the last time I had opened it I had forgotten to take the key out . It all flashed over me in a second when I saw it shining there . Even then I did n't suspect anything . You do n't know how I felt to open that cabinet and find all my money gone . It 's awful . "
3644	3656	3428	3428	He	291	" Do n't worry . How much was there in all ? "
3657	3682	3493	3493	he	44	" Nine hundred and eighty - six dollars , most of which , I am ashamed to say , I had accepted from you . "
3683	3761	3428	3428	He	291	" You have no right to talk that way , Frank ; you know I do not begrudge a cent you want . I have never felt that my father did quite right in leaving me the bulk of the fortune ; but we wo n't discuss that now . What I want you to understand , though , is that the money is yours as well as mine , and you are always welcome to it . "
3768	3773	3774	3774	he	253	" No , Maurice , "
3777	3859	3774	3774	he	253	" I can accept no more from you . I have already used up all my own money and too much of yours in this hopeless fight . I do n't suppose I was ever cut out for an artist , or I 'd have done something really notable in this time , and would not be a burden upon those who care for me . No , I 'll give up going to Paris and find some work to do . "
3860	3923	3978	3980	The younger man	291	" Frank , Frank , be silent . This is nonsense , Give up your art ? You shall not do it . You shall go to Paris as usual . Leslie and I have perfect faith in you . You shall not give up on account of this misfortune . What are the few paltry dollars to me or to you ? "
3924	3946	3774	3774	he	253	" Nothing , nothing , I know . It is n't the money , it 's the principle of the thing . "
3947	3977	3978	3980	The younger man	291	" Principle be hanged ! You go back to Paris to - morrow , just as you had planned . I do not ask it , I command it . "
3985	4039	3978	3980	The younger man	291	" Pardon me , Frank , for using those words and at such a time . You know how near my heart your success lies , and to hear you talk of giving it all up makes me forget myself . Forgive me , but you 'll go back , wo n't you ? "
4040	4048	4050	4050	Frank	44	" You are too good , Maurice , "
4053	4068	4050	4050	Frank	44	" and I will go back , and I 'll try to redeem myself . "
4069	4109	3978	3980	The younger man	291	" There is no redeeming of yourself to do , my dear boy ; all you have to do is to mature yourself . We 'll have a detective down and see what we can do in this matter . "
4117	4125	4126	4126	he	44	" I do so hate such things , "
4129	4150	4126	4126	he	44	" and , anyway , what 's the use ? They 'll never find out where the stuff went to . "
4151	4195	3978	3980	The younger man	291	" Oh , you need not be troubled in this matter . I know that such things must jar on your delicate nature . But I am a plain hard - headed business man , and I can attend to it without distaste . "
4196	4220	4126	4126	he	44	" But I hate to shove everything unpleasant off on you , It 's what I ' ve been doing all my life . "
4221	4241	3978	3980	The younger man	291	" Never mind that . Now tell me , who was the last person you remember in your room ? "
4242	4261	4126	4126	he	44	" Oh , Esterton was up there awhile before dinner . But he was not alone two minutes . "
4262	4277	3978	3980	The younger man	291	" Why , he would be out of the question anyway . Who else ? "
4278	4284	4126	4126	he	44	" Hamilton was up yesterday . "
4285	4288	3978	3980	The younger man	291	" Alone ? "
4289	4315	4126	4126	he	44	" Yes , for a while . His boy , Joe , shaved me , and Jack was up for a while brushing my clothes . "
4316	4325	3978	3980	The younger man	291	" Then it lies between Jack and Joe ? "
4329	4338	4326	4326	Frank	44	" Neither one was left alone , though . "
4339	4363	4326	4326	Frank	44	" Then only Hamilton and Esterton have been alone for any time in your room since you left the key in your cabinet ? "
4364	4402	4326	4326	Frank	44	" Those are the only ones of whom I know anything . What others went in during the day , of course , I know nothing about . It could n't have been either Esterton or Hamilton . "
4403	4409	4326	4326	Frank	44	" Not Esterton , no . "
4410	4417	4326	4326	Frank	44	" And Hamilton is beyond suspicion . "
4418	4425	4326	4326	Frank	44	" No servant is beyond suspicion . "
4426	4433	4435	4435	Frank	44	" I would trust Hamilton anywhere , "
4438	4443	4435	4435	Frank	44	" and with anything . "
4444	4514	4326	4326	Frank	44	" That 's noble of you , Frank , and I would have done the same , but we must remember that we are not in the old days now . The negroes are becoming less faithful and less contented , and more 's the pity , and a deal more ambitious , although I have never had any unfaithfulness on the part of Hamilton to complain of before . "
4515	4523	4435	4435	Frank	44	" Then do not condemn him now . "
4524	4550	4326	4326	Frank	44	" I shall not condemn any one until I have proof positive of his guilt or such clear circumstantial evidence that my reason is satisfied . "
4551	4566	4435	4435	Frank	44	" I do not believe that you will ever have that against old Hamilton . "
4567	4692	4326	4326	Frank	44	" This spirit of trust does you credit , Frank , and I very much hope that you may be right . But as soon as a negro like Hamilton learns the value of money and begins to earn it , at the same time he begins to covet some easy and rapid way of securing it . The old negro knew nothing of the value of money . When he stole , he stole hams and bacon and chickens . These were his immediate necessities and the things he valued . The present laughs at this tendency without knowing the cause . The present negro resents the laugh , and he has learned to value other things than those which satisfy his belly . "
4697	4721	4746	4746	he	39	" But pardon me for boring you . I know you want to go to bed . Go and leave everything to me . "
4911	4928	4984	4986	the young fellow	319	" I am sorry to disturb you again , Frank , but may we come in ? "
4929	4935	4984	4986	the young fellow	319	" Who is with you ? "
4936	4940	4984	4986	the young fellow	319	" The detective . "
4941	4954	4984	4986	the young fellow	319	" I did not know he was to come to - night . "
4955	4962	4984	4986	the young fellow	319	" The chief thought it better . "
4963	4970	4984	4986	the young fellow	319	" All right in a moment . "
5075	5087	5210	5212	The younger man	291	" When you opened this cabinet , your money was gone ? "
5088	5091	5210	5212	The younger man	291	" Yes . "
5092	5100	5210	5212	The younger man	291	" Were any of your papers touched ? "
5101	5104	5210	5212	The younger man	291	" No . "
5105	5111	5210	5212	The younger man	291	" How about your jewels ? "
5112	5122	5210	5212	The younger man	291	" I have but few and they were elsewhere . "
5155	5164	5210	5212	The younger man	291	" Do you ever leave this window open ? "
5165	5172	5210	5212	The younger man	291	" It is almost always so . "
5173	5184	5210	5212	The younger man	291	" Is this porch on the front of the house ? "
5185	5192	5210	5212	The younger man	291	" No , on the side . "
5193	5201	5210	5212	The younger man	291	" What else is out that way ? "
5226	5241	5222	5222	Maurice	39	" My butler 's cottage is on that side and a little way back . "
5242	5265	5216	5216	his	291	" Uh huh ! and your butler is , I believe , the Hamilton whom the young gentleman mentioned some time ago . "
5266	5269	5222	5222	Maurice	39	" Yes . "
5284	5292	5293	5293	he	311	" I think I have a clue , "
5297	5308	5293	5293	he	311	" I will be here again to - morrow morning . "
5309	5316	5318	5318	Frank	44	" But I shall be gone , "
5320	5329	5293	5293	he	311	" You will hardly be needed , anyway . "
5397	5415	5417	5417	Oakley	44	" Come , come , Frank , you must take a drink now and go to bed , "
5419	5425	5378	5378	his	44	" I am completely unnerved . "
5426	5451	5417	5417	Oakley	44	" I know it , and I am no less shocked than you . But we ' ve got to face it like men . "
5472	5479	5480	5480	he	39	" Who would have thought it ? "
5490	5512	5417	5417	Oakley	44	" Not I. I had hoped against hope up until the last that it would turn out to be a mistake . "
5513	5569	5480	5480	he	39	" Nothing angers me so much as being deceived by the man I have helped and trusted . I should feel the sting of all this much less if the thief had come from the outside , broken in , and robbed me , but this , after all these years , is too low . "
5570	5598	5417	5417	Oakley	44	" Do n't be hard on a man , Maurice ; one never knows what prompts him to a deed . And this evidence is all circumstantial . "
5599	5655	5480	5480	he	39	" It is plain enough for me . You are entirely too kind - hearted , Frank . But I see that this thing has worn you out . You must not stand here talking . Go to bed , for you must be fresh for to - morrow morning 's journey to New York . "
5688	5692	5693	5693	he	201	" Poor fellow , "
5696	5712	5693	5693	he	201	" he is so delicately constructed that he can not stand such shocks as these ; "
5718	5741	5715	5715	he	201	" To think of that black hound 's treachery ! I 'll give him all that the law sets down for him . "
5865	5870	5871	5871	he	201	" You , Joe , "
5877	5975	5871	5871	he	201	" git up f'om daih an ' come right hyeah . You got to he'p me befo ' you go to any shop dis mo'nin ' . You , Kitty , stir yo ' stumps , miss .

6154	6180	6152	6152	Hamilton	45	" you all 's as bad as dem white people was las ' night . De way dey waded into dat food was a caution . "
6189	6234	6271	6271	himself	37	" I reckon dat 's what dey come fu ' . I was n't payin ' so much ' tention to what dey eat as to de way dem women was dressed . Why , Mis ' Jedge Hill was des ' mo'n go'geous . "
6235	6254	6257	6257	Kitty	38	" Oh , yes , ma , an ' Miss Lessing was n't no ways behin ' her , "
6296	6305	6307	6307	Berry	34	" Well , I got to be goin' , "

6472	6479	6480	6480	he	34	" Good - bye , Berry , "
6538	6547	6549	6550	his brother	201	" How could you do it , Frank ? "
6563	6568	6570	6571	Mrs. Oakley	40	" Hush , Maurice , "
6574	6584	6570	6571	Mrs. Oakley	40	" I think it was very noble of him . "
6585	6596	6598	6598	Frank	52	" Oh , I felt sorry for the poor fellow , "
6602	6635	6598	6598	Frank	52	" Promise me you wo n't be too hard on him , Maurice . Give him a little scare and let him go . He 's possibly buried the money , anyhow . "
6636	6646	6647	6649	The young man	304	" I shall deal with him as he deserves . "
6660	6677	6678	6678	he	304	" Whether I fail or succeed , you will always think well of me , Maurice ? "
6683	6704	6678	6678	he	304	" and if I do n't come up to your expectations , well -- forgive me -- that 's all . "
6711	6723	6724	6724	he	304	" You will always come up to my expectations , Frank , "
6727	6734	6724	6724	he	304	" Wo n't he , Leslie ? "
6735	6757	6758	6760	The young fellow	319	" He will always be our Frank , our good , generous - hearted , noble boy . God bless him ! "
6807	6816	6818	6819	Mrs. Oakley	40	" He seems to be sad at going , "
6821	6853	6794	6794	he	319	" Poor fellow , the affair of last night has broken him up considerably , but I 'll make Berry pay for every pang of anxiety that my brother has suffered . "
6854	6871	6922	6929	a man who is both exasperated and determined	378	" Do n't be revengeful , Maurice ; you know what brother Frank asked of you . "
6872	6893	6794	6794	he	319	" He is gone and will never know what happens , so I may be as revengeful as I wish . "
6952	6955	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" Well ? "
6971	6986	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" I have some more information that may or may not be of importance . "
6987	6997	6932	6933	the officer	331	" Out with it ; maybe I can tell . "
6998	7032	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" First , let me ask if you had any reason to believe that your butler had any resources of his own , say to the amount of three or four hundred dollars ? "
7033	7072	6932	6933	the officer	331	" Certainly not . I pay him thirty dollars a month , and his wife fifteen dollars , and with keeping up his lodges and the way he dresses that girl , he ca n't save very much . "
7073	7084	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" You know that he has money in the bank ? "
7085	7088	6932	6933	the officer	331	" No . "
7089	7100	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" Well , he has . Over eight hundred dollars . "
7101	7114	6932	6933	the officer	331	" What ? Berry ? It must be the pickings of years . "
7115	7126	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" And yesterday it was increased by five hundred more . "
7127	7131	6932	6933	the officer	331	" The scoundrel ! "
7132	7143	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" How was your brother 's money , in bills ? "
7144	7157	6932	6933	the officer	331	" It was in large bills and gold , with some silver . "
7158	7174	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" Berry 's money was almost all in bills of a small denomination and silver . "
7175	7187	6932	6933	the officer	331	" A poor trick ; it could easily have been changed . "
7188	7197	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" Not such a sum without exciting comment . "
7198	7207	6932	6933	the officer	331	" He may have gone to several places . "
7208	7220	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" But he had only a day to do it in . "
7221	7231	6932	6933	the officer	331	" Then some one must have been his accomplice . "
7232	7239	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" That remains to be proven . "
7240	7283	6932	6933	the officer	331	" Nothing remains to be proven . Why , it 's as clear as day that the money he has is the result of a long series of peculations , and that this last is the result of his first large theft . "
7284	7294	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" That must be made clear to the law . "
7295	7300	6932	6933	the officer	331	" It shall be . "
7301	7324	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" I should advise , though , no open proceedings against this servant until further evidence to establish his guilt is found . "
7325	7348	6932	6933	the officer	331	" If the evidence satisfies me , it must be sufficient to satisfy any ordinary jury . I demand his immediate arrest . "
7349	7376	6957	6959	the impatient man	380	" As you will , sir . Will you have him called here and question him , or will you let me question him at once ? "
7377	7380	6932	6933	the officer	331	" Yes . "

7543	7546	7547	7548	the officer	331	" Berry , "
7551	7564	7547	7548	the officer	331	" you admit having deposited five hundred dollars in the bank yesterday ? "
7565	7590	7521	7522	the officer	331	" Sut'ny . Dey ai n't no reason why I should n't admit it , ' ceptin ' erroun ' ermong dese jealous niggahs . "
7591	7606	7547	7548	the officer	331	" Uh huh ! well , now , where did you get this money ? "
7607	7648	7521	7522	the officer	331	" Why , I wo'ked fu ' it , o ' co'se , whaih you s'pose I got it ? ' T ai n't drappin ' off trees , I reckon , not roun ' dis pa't of de country . "
7649	7674	7547	7548	the officer	331	" You worked for it ? You must have done a pretty big job to have got so much money all in a lump ? "
7675	7704	7521	7522	the officer	331	" But I did n't git it in a lump . Why , man , I ' ve been savin ' dat money fu mo'n fo ' yeahs . "
7705	7725	7547	7548	the officer	331	" More than four years ? Why did n't you put it in the bank as you got it ? "
7726	7842	7521	7522	the officer	331	" Why , mos'ly it was too small , an ' so I des ' kep ' it in a ol' sock . I tol ' Fannie dat some day ef de bank did n't bus ' wid all de res ' I had , I 'd put it in too . She was allus sayin ' it was too much to have layin ' ' roun ' de house . But I des ' tol ' huh dat no robber was n't goin' to bothah de po ' niggah down in de ya'd wid de rich white man up at de house . But fin'lly I listened to huh an ' sposited it yistiddy . "

7888	7898	7547	7548	the officer	331	" Calm yourself , Mr. Oakley , calm yourself . "
7899	7920	7859	7859	Oakley	55	" I will not calm myself . Take him away . He shall not stand here and lie to me . "

8041	8055	8003	8004	the servant	386	" I think it would be better to call his wife , Oakley . "
8056	8071	7521	7522	the officer	331	" Well , call her , but let this matter be done with soon . "
8115	8119	8121	8121	Oakley	55	" Well posted , "

Ol' Chloe ai n't lived all dese yeahs fu ' nuffin ' , an ' ef she got de gif ' o ' secon ' sight , ' t ai n't fu ' huh to say . "
9740	9745	9747	9749	old Horace Talbot	65	" I tell you , "
9762	9784	9785	9785	They	450	" I tell you , I pity that darky more than I blame him . Now , here 's my theory . "
9806	10101	9796	9798	the old gentleman	453	" It 's just like this : The North thought they were doing a great thing when they come down here and freed all the slaves . They thought they were doing a great thing , and I ' m not saying a word against them . I give them the credit for having the courage of their convictions . But I maintain that they were all wrong , now , in turning these people loose upon the country the way they did , without knowledge of what the first principle of liberty was . The natural result is that these people are irresponsible . They are unacquainted with the ways of our higher civilisation , and it 'll take them a long time to learn . You know Rome was n't built in a day . I know Berry , and I ' ve known him for a long while , and a politer , likelier darky than him you would have to go far to find . And I have n't the least doubt in the world that he took that money absolutely without a thought of wrong , sir , absolutely . He saw it . He took it , and to his mental process , that was the end of it . To him there was no injury inflicted on any one , there was no crime committed . His elemental reasoning was simply this : This man has more money than I have ; here is some of his surplus,--I 'll just take it . Why , gentlemen , I maintain that that man took that money with the same innocence of purpose with which one of our servants a few years ago would have appropriated a stray ham . "
10102	10112	10115	10117	Mr. Beachfield Davis	68	" I disagree with you entirely , Mr. Talbot , "
10123	10395	10115	10117	Mr. Beachfield Davis	68	hunter.--"Make mine the same , Jerry , only add a little syrup.--I disagree with you . It 's simply total depravity , that 's all . All niggers are alike , and there 's no use trying to do anything with them . Look at that man , Dodson , of mine . I had one of the finest young hounds in the State . You know that white pup of mine , Mr. Talbot , that I bought from Hiram Gaskins ? Mighty fine breed . Well , I was spendin ' all my time and patience trainin ' that dog in the daytime . At night I put him in that nigger 's care to feed and bed . Well , do you know , I came home the other night and found that black rascal gone ? I went out to see if the dog was properly bedded , and by Jove , the dog was gone too . Then I got suspicious . When a nigger and a dog go out together at night , one draws certain conclusions . I thought I had heard bayin ' way out towards the edge of the town . So I stayed outside and watched . In about an hour here came Dodson with a possum hung over his shoulder and my dog trottin ' at his heels . He 'd been possum huntin ' with my hound -- with the finest hound in the State , sir . Now , I appeal to you all , gentlemen , if that ai n't total depravity , what is total depravity ? "
10396	10455	10456	10457	Old Horace	73	" Not total depravity , Beachfield , I maintain , but the very irresponsibility of which I have spoken . Why , gentlemen , I foresee the day when these people themselves shall come to us Southerners of their own accord and ask to be re - enslaved until such time as they shall be fit for freedom . "
10464	10480	10482	10483	Colonel Saunders	74	" Well , do you think there 's any doubt of the darky 's guilt ? "
10515	10519	10521	10522	Old Horace	73	" Any doubt ! "
10524	10528	10530	10531	Mr. Davis	68	" Any doubt ! "
10533	10537	10540	10541	the rest	456	" Any doubt ? "
10543	10605	10540	10541	the rest	456	" Why , there can be no doubt . Why , Colonel , what are you thinking of ? Tell us who has got the money if he has n't ? Tell us where on earth the nigger got the money he 's been putting in the bank ? Doubt ? Why , there is n't the least doubt about it . "
10606	10611	10613	10614	the Colonel	457	" Certainly , certainly , "
10616	10650	10613	10614	the Colonel	457	" but I thought , of course , he might have saved it . There are several of those people , you know , who do a little business and have bank accounts . "
10651	10677	10684	10684	he	457	" Yes , but they are in some sort of business . This man makes only thirty dollars a month . Do n't you see ? "
10802	10805	10799	10799	he	416	" Not guilty "
10908	10968	10893	10893	he	416	" I did n't tech his money , Fannie , you know I did n't . I wo'ked fu ' every cent of dat money , an ' I saved it myself . Oh , I 'll nevah be able to git a job ag'in . Me in de lock - up -- me , aftah all dese yeahs ! "
11099	11106	11107	11107	she	35	" Oh , Mis ' Oakley , "
11110	11137	11107	11107	she	35	" ef he did steal de money , we ' ve got enough saved to mek it good . Let him go ! let him go ! "
11138	11147	11148	11149	Mrs. Oakley	40	" Then you admit that he did steal ? "
11156	11171	11107	11107	she	35	" Oh , I did n't say dat ; I did n't mean dat . "
11172	11191	11107	11107	she	35	" That will do , Fannie . I understand perfectly . You should have confessed that long ago . "
11192	11207	11107	11107	she	35	" But I ai n't confessin ' ! I ai n't ! He did n't---- "
11208	11213	11107	11107	she	35	" You may go . "
11698	11711	11685	11694	Some one , a bit more brutal than the rest	499	" It 's five dollars ' fine every time a nigger faints , "
11767	11772	11773	11773	he	39	" You must go , "
11776	11794	11773	11773	he	39	" You ca n't stay here any longer . I want none of your breed about me . "
12276	12334	12260	12260	she	35	" I 'll go an ' see what I kin do , anyway , Kit . ' T ai n't much use , I reckon , trying to get into a bahbah shop where they shave white folks , because all the white folks are down on us . I 'll try one of the coloured shops . "

12480	12531	12477	12478	the proprietor	531	" I do n't think we got anything fu ' you to do ; you 're a white man 's bahbah . We do n't shave nothin' but niggahs hyeah , an ' we shave 'em in de light o ' day an ' on de groun ' flo ' . "
12532	12565	12575	12577	a grinning negro	533	" W'y , I hyeah you say dat you could n't git a paih of sheahs thoo a niggah 's naps . You ai n't been practisin ' lately , has you ? "
12585	12613	12575	12577	a grinning negro	533	" Oh , yes , you 're done with burr - heads , are you ? But burr - heads are good enough fu ' you now . "

12997	13008	13009	13009	he	37	" Well , I guess we can take you on , "
13012	13018	13009	13009	he	37	" What 's your name ? "

13035	13063	13082	13083	the bellmen	548	" Well , Joe , you go over there and sit where you see those fellows in uniform , and wait until I call the head bellman . "
13177	13183	13184	13184	he	544	" I did n't know , "
13185	13239	13171	13172	The clerk	544	said,--"I did n't know that you were Berry Hamilton 's boy . Now , I ' ve got nothing against you myself . I do n't hold you responsible for what your father did , but I do n't believe our boys would work with you . I ca n't take you on . "
13301	13317	13320	13320	he	37	" There goes Joe Hamilton , whose father went to the penitentiary the other day . "

13395	13402	13391	13391	he	37	" no one wants me now . "
13403	13426	13382	13382	Kit	38	" No one wants you ? Why , Joe -- they -- they do n't think hard of us , do they ? "
13427	13450	13391	13391	he	37	" I do n't know what they think of ma and you , but they think hard of me , all right . "
13451	13469	13382	13382	Kit	38	" Oh , do n't you worry ; it 'll be all right when it blows over . "
13470	13485	13391	13391	he	37	" Yes , when it all blows over ; but when 'll that be ? "

21857	21913	21827	21827	Sadness	90	" Mr. Hamilton will believe me when I say that I have no intention of being stiff , but duty is duty . I ' ve got to go down town to pay a bill , and if I get too much aboard , it would n't be safe walking around with money on me . "

23235	23401	23231	23231	He	926	" You see , a lot o ' fellows say to me , ' What do you want to go down to that nigger club for ? ' That 's what they call it,--'nigger club . ' But I say to 'em , ' Gentlemen , at that nigger club , as you choose to call it , I get more inspiration than I could get at any of the greater clubs in New York . ' I ' ve often been invited to join some of the swell clubs here , but I never do it . By Jove ! I 'd rather come down here and fellowship right in with you fellows . I like coloured people , anyway . It 's natural . You see , my father had a big plantation and owned lots of slaves,--no offence , of course , but it was the custom of that time,--and I ' ve played with little darkies ever since I could remember . "
23538	23544	23545	23545	he	95	" Now look at Maudie , "
23549	23592	23545	23545	he	95	" would you believe it that she was of a fine , rich family , and that the coloured girl she 's dancing with now used to be her servant ? She 's just like me about that . Absolutely no prejudice . "
23668	23710	23664	23664	He	940	" Everybody knows Maudie , and that coloured girl is Mamie Lacey , and never worked for anybody in her life . Skaggsy 's a good fellah , all right , but he 's the biggest liar in N ' Yawk . "

25922	26001	25790	25790	she	63	" Oh , I got a gent'man friend what 's a porter , an ' his run 's been changed so that he comes hyeah , an ' he told me , if I wanted to come he 'd bring me thoo fur a visit , so , you see , hyeah I am . I allus was mighty anxious to see this hyeah town . But tell me , how 's Kit an ' yo ' ma ? "

26086	26121	26078	26078	She	1010	" Oh , that 's all right . Let by - gones be by - gones . You know I ai n't the kin ' o ' person that holds a grudge ag'in anybody . "
26122	26133	26134	26134	he	1007	" That 's right , Minty , that 's right , "
26229	26259	26207	26207	she	45	" But do n't you see what she can do for us , ma ? She knows people that I know , and she can ruin me with them . "
26260	26284	26286	26287	his mother	478	" I ai n't never bowed my haid to Minty Brown an ' I ai n't a - goin' to do it now , "

26671	26688	26614	26615	her mother	174	" All you got to do is to tell dat ooman jes ' what I say . "
26737	26788	26715	26715	her	63	" Oh , nevah min ' , lady , I ai n't anxious to see 'em . I jest called out o ' pity , but I reckon dey ' shamed to see me 'cause de ol' man 's in penitentiary an ' dey was run out o ' town . "

26861	26899	26858	26858	she	79	" I ' ve had a talk with the lady downstairs , an ' she 's tol ' me everything . I 'd be glad if you 'd let me have my rooms as soon as possible . "
26900	26915	26846	26846	her	79	" So you goin' to put me out on de wo'd of a stranger ? "
26916	26960	26858	26858	she	79	" I ' m kin ' o ' sorry , but everybody in the house heard what Mis ' Brown said , an ' it 'll soon be all over town , an ' that ' ud ruin the reputation of my house . "
26961	26971	26846	26846	her	79	" I reckon all dat kin be ' splained . "
26972	27002	27003	27003	She	1033	" Yes , but I do n't know that anybody kin ' splain your daughter allus being with Mr. Thomas , who ai n't even divo'ced from his wife . "
27024	27061	27009	27010	the girl	183	" You daih to say dat , Mis ' Jones , you dat fust interduced my gal to dat man and got huh to go out wid him ? I reckon you 'd bettah go now . "
27087	27103	27083	27083	Joe	37	" There , there ! see what you ' ve done with your damned foolishness . "

27222	27230	27231	27231	he	182	" I ai n't goin' to cuss , "
27235	27246	27231	27231	he	182	" I ' m goin' out o ' your way . "

27379	27392	27394	27395	the girl	183	" Dey ai n't nothin' lef ' but you now , Kit ; "
27417	27426	27411	27411	her	174	" My Gawd , not you , Kit ! "
27711	27715	27707	27707	his	856	" getting together . "
27935	27947	27948	27948	he	37	" Mr. Hamilton says ' Make it two , Jack , ' "
27954	27970	27948	27948	he	37	" Well , what 's the matter , old man ? You 're looking glum . "
27971	27976	27948	27948	he	37	" I feel glum . "
27977	28009	27948	27948	he	37	" The divine Hattie has n't been cutting any capers , has she ? The dear old girl has n't been getting hysterical at her age ? Let us hope not . "
28038	28102	28165	28166	this man	1709	" Come , come now , Hamilton , if you 're sore because I invited myself to take a drink with you , I 'll withdraw the order . I know the heroic thing to say is that I 'll pay for the drinks myself , but I ca n't screw my courage up to the point of doing so unnatural a thing . "
28109	28133	28103	28104	Young Hamilton	78	" Oh , I know you fellows now well enough to know how many drinks to pay for . It ai n't that . "
28134	28157	28165	28166	this man	1709	" Well , then , out with it . What is it ? Have n't been up to anything , have you ? "
28237	28376	28234	28234	he	37	" For a fellow who has had for a full year the advantage of the education of the New York clubs , you are strangely young . Let me see , you are nineteen or twenty now -- yes . Well , that perhaps accounts for it . It 's a pity you were n't born older . It 's a pity most men are n't . They would n't have to take so much time and lose so many good things learning . Now , Mr. Hamilton , let me tell you , and you will pardon me for it , that you are a fool . Your case is n't half as bad as that of nine - tenths of the fellows that hang around here . Now , for instance , my father was hung . "
28386	28482	28377	28377	Joe	37	" Oh , yes , but it was done with a very good rope and by the best citizens of Texas , so it seems that I really ought to be very grateful to them for the distinction they conferred upon my family , but I am not . I am ungratefully sad . A man must be very high or very low to take the sensible view of life that keeps him from being sad . I must confess that I have aspired to the depths without ever being fully able to reach them . "
28483	28906	28936	28937	the man	269	" Now look around a bit . See that little girl over there ? That 's Viola . Two years ago she wrenched up an iron stool from the floor of a lunch - room , and killed another woman with it . She 's nineteen,--just about your age , by the way . Well , she had friends with a certain amount of pull . She got out of it , and no one thinks the worse of Viola . You see , Hamilton , in this life we are all suffering from fever , and no one edges away from the other because he finds him a little warm . It 's dangerous when you 're not used to it ; but once you go through the parching process , you become inoculated against further contagion . Now , there 's Barney over there , as decent a fellow as I know ; but he has been indicted twice for pocket - picking . A half - dozen fellows whom you meet here every night have killed their man . Others have done worse things for which you respect them less . Poor Wallace , who is just coming in , and who looks like a jaunty ragpicker , came here about six months ago with about two thousand dollars , the proceeds from the sale of a house his father had left him . He 'll sleep in one of the club chairs to - night , and not from choice . He spent his two thousand learning . But , after all , it was a good investment . It was like buying an annuity . He begins to know already how to live on others as they have lived on him . The plucked bird 's beak is sharpened for other 's feathers . From now on Wallace will live , eat , drink , and sleep at the expense of others , and will forget to mourn his lost money . He will go on this way until , broken and useless , the poor - house or the potter 's field gets him . Oh , it 's a fine , rich life , my lad . I know you 'll like it . I said you would the first time I saw you . It has plenty of stir in it , and a man never gets lonesome . Only the rich are lonesome . It 's only the independent who depend upon others . "
28978	28982	28985	28985	him	37	" in it . "
29018	29023	29024	29024	he	37	" Thanks , Sadness , "
29027	29035	29024	29024	he	37	" you ' ve helped me lots . "
29046	29050	29051	29051	he	37	" You lie , "
29054	29067	29051	29051	he	37	" I have n't ; I was only fool enough to try ; "
29093	29098	29099	29099	he	37	" Poor old fellow , "
29102	29115	29099	29099	he	37	" drunk again . Must have had something before he came in . "
29264	29266	29286	29286	they	1086	" shoestring "
29574	29579	29580	29580	he	37	" Why , Minty , "
29587	29598	29580	29580	he	37	" you ai n't mad at me , are you ? "
29599	29606	29607	29607	she	63	" Go on away f'om hyeah , "
29611	29630	29607	29607	she	63	" I do n't want none o ' thievin ' Berry Hamilton 's fambly to speak to me . "
29631	29641	29685	29685	he	1106	" Why , you were all right this evening . "
29642	29671	29607	29607	she	63	" Yes , but jest out o ' pity , an ' you was nice 'cause you was afraid I 'd tell on you . Go on now . "
29672	29677	29679	29682	Minty 's young man	1106	" Go on now , "
29826	29836	29837	29837	she	100	" Let 's go somewhere and get some supper , "
29840	29860	29837	29837	she	100	" I ' m as hungry as I can be . What are you looking so cut up about ? "
29861	29873	29818	29818	she	100	" Oh , I ai n't feelin ' so very good . "
29874	29895	29837	29837	she	100	" I hope you ai n't lettin ' that long - tongued Brown woman bother your head , are you ? "
29909	29917	29818	29818	she	100	" Do you know all about it ? "
29918	29939	29818	29818	she	100	" Why , of course I do . You might know she 'd come to me first with her story . "
29940	29950	29818	29818	she	100	" And you still keep on speaking to me ? "
29951	30062	29818	29818	she	100	" Now look here , Joe , if you ' ve been drinking , I 'll forgive you ; if you ai n't , you go on and leave me . Say , what do you take me for ? Do you think I 'd throw down a friend because somebody else talked about him ? Well , you do n't know Hat Sterling . When Minty told me that story , she was back in my dressing - room , and I sent her out o ' there a - flying , and with a tongue - lashing that she wo n't forget for a month o ' Sundays . "
30063	30080	30081	30081	He	1112	" I reckon that was the reason she jumped on me so hard at the club . "
30114	30128	29818	29818	she	100	" So she jumped on you hard , did she ? The cat ! "
30129	30141	29818	29818	she	100	" Oh , she did n't say a thing to me . "
30142	30226	29818	29818	she	100	" Well , Joe , it 's just like this . I ai n't an angel , you know that , but I do try to be square , and whenever I find a friend of mine down on his luck , in his pocket - book or his feelings , why , I give him my flipper . Why , old chap , I believe I like you better for the stiff upper lip you ' ve been keeping under all this . "
30227	30232	30233	30233	he	1114	" Why , Hattie , "
30244	30251	30233	30233	he	1114	" you 're -- you ' re---- "
30252	30330	29818	29818	she	100	" Oh , I ' m just plain Hat Sterling , who wo n't throw down her friends . Now come on and get something to eat . If that thing is at the club , we 'll go there and show her just how much her talk amounted to . She thinks she 's the whole game , but I can spot her and then show her that she ai n't one , two , three . "
30458	30463	30464	30464	she	100	" Now look here , "
30467	30531	30532	30532	she	100	" you ca n't have any supper because you have n't reached the stage of magnificent hunger to make a meal palatable to you . You ' ve got so used to being nearly starved that a meal do n't taste good to you under any other circumstances . You 're in on the drinks , though . Your thirst is always available.--Jack , "
30542	30601	30532	30532	she	100	" make it three.--Lean over here , I want to talk to you . See that woman over there by the wall ? No , not that one,--the big light woman with Griggs . Well , she 's come here with a story trying to throw Joe down , and I want you to help me do her . "
30602	30618	30620	30620	Sadness	90	" Oh , that 's the one that upset our young friend , is it ? "
30629	30643	30532	30532	she	100	" That 's her . So you know about it , do you ? "
30644	30666	30667	30667	He	90	" Yes , and I 'll help do her . She must n't touch one of the fraternity , you know . "
30772	30778	30779	30779	she	1122	" everything was going fat , "
30801	30819	30779	30779	she	1122	" Say , boys , you ' ve heard that story about Joe , have n't you ? "
30823	30854	30779	30779	she	1122	" Well , that 's the one that told it ; she 's come here to try to throw him and me down . Is she going to do it ? "
30855	30862	30779	30779	she	1122	" Well , I guess not ! "
30905	30911	30913	30913	her	1122	" Thank you , fellows , "
30966	30972	30973	30973	she	38	" You see , Joe , "

31518	31522	31483	31483	he	304	" up stage . "
31554	31561	31562	31563	Hattie Sterling	100	" I tell you , now , "
31575	31625	31562	31563	Hattie Sterling	100	" your voice is too good for the chorus . Gi ' me a cigarette , Joe . Have one , Kitty?--I ' m goin' to call you Kitty . It 's nice and homelike , and then we ' ve got to be great chums , you know . "
31652	31679	31562	31563	Hattie Sterling	100	" Tut , tut , Kitty , child , do n't do it if you ai n't used to it . You 'll learn soon enough . "
31709	31719	31720	31721	the lady	1957	" Now , what I was going to say , "
31728	31801	31720	31721	the lady	1957	" is that you 'll have to begin in the chorus any way and work your way up . It would n't take long for you , with your looks and voice , to put one of the ' up and ups ' out o ' the business . Only hope it wo n't be me . I ' ve had people I ' ve helped try to do it often enough . "
31853	31865	31866	31866	Kit	38	" Oh , I would n't want to push anybody out , "
31869	31962	32004	32004	him	37	" Oh , never mind , you 'll soon get bravely over that feeling , and even if you did n't it would n't matter much . The thing has to happen . Somebody 's got to go down . We do n't last long in this life : it soon wears us out , and when we 're worn out and sung out , danced out and played out , the manager has no further use for us ; so he reduces us to the ranks or kicks us out entirely . "
31976	31982	31983	31983	he	37	" Get out , Hat , "
31987	31997	31983	31983	he	37	" you 're good for a dozen years yet . "
32014	32118	32004	32004	him	37	" Do n't you let what I say scare you , though , Kitty . You ' ve got a good chance , and maybe you 'll have more sense than I ' ve got , and at least save money -- while you 're in it . But let 's get off that . It makes me sick . All you ' ve got to do is to come to the opera - house to - morrow and I 'll introduce you to the manager . He 's a fool , but I think we can make him do something for you . "
32119	32135	31998	31998	She	38	" Oh , thank you , I 'll be around to - morrow , sure . "
32136	32194	32004	32004	him	37	" Better come about ten o'clock . There 's a rehearsal to - morrow , and you 'll find him there . Of course , he 'll be pretty rough , he always is at rehearsals , but he 'll take to you if he thinks there 's anything in you and he can get it out . "
32209	32218	32219	32219	he	37	" I 'll see you later , Kit , "
32222	32232	32233	32233	he	37	" I ai n't goin' just yet . Say , "
32242	32267	32233	32233	he	37	" you 're a hot one . What do you want to give her all that con for ? She 'll never get in . "
32268	32271	32273	32273	Hattie	100	" Joe , "
32275	32358	32273	32273	Hattie	100	" do n't you get awful tired of being a jackass ? Sometimes I want to kiss you , and sometimes I feel as if I had to kick you . I 'll compromise with you now by letting you bring me some more beer . This got all stale while your sister was here . I saw she did n't like it , and so I would n't drink any more for fear she 'd try to keep up with me . "
32359	32370	32371	32371	Joe	37	" Kit is a good deal of a jay yet , "
32375	32441	32273	32273	Hattie	100	" Oh , yes , this world is full of jays . Lots of 'em have seen enough to make 'em wise , but they 're still jays , and do n't know it . That 's the worst of it . They go around thinking they 're it , when they ai n't even in the game . Go on and get the beer . "
32478	32502	32470	32470	She	38	" Oh , ma , ma , Miss Hattie thinks I 'll do to go on the stage . Ai n't it grand ? "
32517	32573	32514	32515	her mother	174	" I do ' know as it 'll be so gran ' . F'om what I see of dem stage people dey do n't seem to ' mount to much . De way dem gals shows demse'ves is right down bad to me . Is you goin' to dress lak dem we seen dat night ? "
32579	32587	32514	32515	her mother	174	" I guess I 'll have to . "
32588	32638	32576	32576	her	38	" Well , ef you have to , I 'd ruther see you daid any day . Oh , Kit , my little gal , do n't do it , do n't do it . Do n't you go down lak yo ' brothah Joe . Joe 's gone . "
32639	32679	32514	32515	her mother	174	" Why , ma , you do n't understand . Joe 's somebody now . You ought to ' ve heard how Miss Hattie talked about him . She said he 's been her friend for a long while . "
32680	32716	32576	32576	her	38	" Her frien ' , yes , an ' his own inimy . You need n ' pattern aftah dat gal , Kit . She ruint Joe , an ' she 's aftah you now . "
32717	32728	32514	32515	her mother	174	" But nowadays everybody thinks stage people respectable up here . "
32729	32808	32576	32576	her	38	" Maybe I ' m ol'-fashioned , but I ca n't believe in any ooman 's ladyship when she shows herse'f lak dem gals does . Oh , Kit , do n't do it . Ai n't you seen enough ? Do n't you know enough already to stay away f'om dese hyeah people ? Dey do n't want nothin' but to pull you down an ' den laugh at you w'en you 's dragged in de dust . "
32809	32828	32514	32515	her mother	174	" You must n't feel that away , ma . I ' m doin' it to help you . "
32829	32843	32576	32576	her	38	" I do ' want no sich help . I 'd ruther starve . "
32858	32861	32862	32863	her mother	174	" Kit , "
32867	32923	32924	32924	She	174	" dey 's somep'n I ai n't nevah tol ' you dat I ' m goin' to tell you now . Mistah Gibson ust to come to Mis ' Jones 's lots to see me befo ' we moved hyeah , an ' he 's been talkin ' 'bout a good many things to me . "
32927	33075	32924	32924	She	174	" He say dat I ai n't noways ma'ied to my po ' husban ' , dat a pen'tentiary sentence is de same as a divo'ce , an ' if Be'y should live to git out , we 'd have to ma'y ag'in . I would n't min ' dat , Kit , but he say dat at Be'y 's age dey ai n't much chanst of his livin ' to git out , an ' hyeah I 'll live all dis time alone , an ' den have no one to tek keer o ' me w'en I git ol' . He wants me to ma'y him , Kit . Kit , I love yo ' fathah ; he 's my only one . But Joe , he 's gone , an ' ef yo go , befo ' Gawd I 'll tell Tawm Gibson yes . "
33124	33188	33106	33107	the girl	183	" Why , it 'll be splendid . He 's such a nice man , an ' race - horse men ' most always have money . Why do n't you marry him , ma ? Then I 'd feel that you was safe an ' settled , an ' that you would n't be lonesome when the show was out of town . "
33189	33205	33097	33097	she	206	" You want me to ma'y him an ' desert yo ' po ' pa ? "
33206	33243	33106	33107	the girl	183	" I guess what he says is right , ma . I do n't reckon we 'll ever see pa again an ' you got to do something . You got to live for yourself now . "
33253	33257	33258	33258	she	174	" All right , "
33261	33311	33258	33258	she	174	" I 'll do it ; I 'll ma'y him . I might as well go de way both my chillen 's gone . Po ' Be'y , po ' Be'y . Ef you evah do come out , Gawd he'p you to baih what you 'll fin ' . "
33348	33352	33353	33353	she	38	" Poor ma , "
33356	33376	33353	33353	she	38	" an ' poor pa . But I know , an ' I know it 's for the best . "
33396	33401	33381	33381	she	45	" Martin 's Blackbirds . "
33417	33428	33429	33429	she	100	" I ' m glad you came early , Kitty , "
33432	33501	33429	33429	she	100	" for maybe you can get a chance to talk with Martin before he begins rehearsal and gets all worked up . He 'll be a little less like a bear then . But even if you do n't see him before then , wait , and do n't get scared if he tries to bluff you . His bark is a good deal worse than his bite . "
33592	33614	33582	33582	He	111	" Mornin ' , Mr. Smith , mornin ' , Mrs. Jones . Ha , ladies and gentlemen , all here ? "
33723	33728	33729	33729	he	111	" Who 's that ? "
33746	33768	33770	33770	Hattie	100	" Well , do n't snap her head off . It 's a girl friend of mine that wants a place , "
33782	33827	33774	33780	the only one who would brave Martin	1171	" Humph . Let her wait . I ai n't got no time to hear any one now . Get yourselves in line , you all who are on to that first chorus , while I ' m getting into my sweat - shirt . "
33909	33914	33915	33915	he	269	" Now , now , "
33919	33990	33915	33915	he	269	" the left foot on that beat . Bah , bah , stop ! You walk like a lot of tin soldiers . Are your joints rusty ? Do you want oil ? Look here , Taylor , if I did n't know you , I 'd take you for a truck . Pick up your feet , open your mouths , and move , move , move ! Oh ! "
34000	34022	34024	34024	he	269	" And to think that I ' ve got to do something with these things in two weeks -- two weeks ! "
34037	34132	34024	34024	he	269	" Now , at it again , at it again ! Hold that note , hold it ! Now whirl , and on the left foot . Stop that music , stop it ! Miss Coster , you 'll learn that step in about a thousand years , and I ' ve got nine hundred and ninety - nine years and fifty weeks less time than that to spare . Come here and try that step with me . Do n't be afraid to move . Step like a chicken on a hot griddle ! "
34269	34307	34265	34266	Mr. Martin	111	" Oh , quit , quit , and go rest yourselves , you ancient pieces of hickory , and let me forget you for a minute before I go crazy . Where 's that new girl now ? "
34323	34329	34265	34266	Mr. Martin	111	" What can you do ? "
34330	34335	34265	34266	Mr. Martin	111	" I can sing , "
34339	34383	34265	34266	Mr. Martin	111	" Well , if that 's the voice you 're going to sing in , there wo n't be many that 'll know whether it 's good or bad . Well , let 's hear something . Do you know any of these ? "
34405	34418	34401	34401	he	269	" Try this . Here , Tom , play it for her . "
34593	34600	34602	34602	Martin	111	" Haw , haw , haw ! "
34604	34687	34602	34602	Martin	111	" haw , haw , haw ! The little one was scared , see ? She was scared , d ' you understand ? But did you see the grit she went at it with ? Just took the bit in her teeth and got away . Haw , haw , haw ! Now , that 's what I like . If all you girls had that spirit , we could do something in two weeks . Try another one , girl . "
34709	34712	34714	34714	Martin	111	" Good ! "
34725	34754	34717	34717	he	111	" You watch these girls close and see what they do , and to - morrow be prepared to go into line and move as well as sing . "
34956	34964	34965	34965	he	80	" Who 'd ' a ' thought , "
34968	35018	34965	34965	he	80	" that the kid had that much nerve ? Well , if they do n't want to find out things , what do they come to N ' Yawk for ? It ai n't nobody 's old Sunday - school picnic . Guess I got out easy , anyhow . "
35028	35031	35032	35032	she	100	" Say , "
35035	35072	35032	35032	she	100	" if you come this way for me again , it 's all over , see ? Your little sister 's a comer , and I ' ve got to hustle to keep up with her . "
35266	35274	35275	35275	he	34	" Frank is getting down to work , "
35280	35310	35312	35312	her	40	" He is past the first buoyant enthusiasm of youth . Ah , Leslie , when a man begins to be serious , then he begins to be something . "
35318	35332	35312	35312	her	40	" I wonder , Maurice , if Claire Lessing will wait for him ? "
35436	35442	35443	35443	she	40	" Brother ought to know , "
35446	35454	35443	35443	she	40	" that Berry is being properly punished . "
35455	35460	35462	35463	her husband	181	" By no means , "
35465	35486	35462	35463	her husband	181	" You know that it would only hurt him . He shall never know if I have to tell him . "
35487	35519	35443	35443	she	40	" You are right , Maurice , you are always right . We must shield Frank from the pain it would cause him . Poor fellow ! he is so sensitive . "
35715	35721	35722	35722	he	39	" A letter from Frank , "
35726	35736	35722	35722	he	39	" and an important one , I 'll wager . "
36309	36322	36323	36323	he	39	" My fancies go on and conquer the world for my brother , "
36326	36339	36323	36323	he	39	" He will follow their flight one day and do it himself . "
36360	36390	36323	36323	he	39	" No , I will not do it ; I will wait until Leslie comes . She will be as glad to hear the good news as I am . "
36445	36448	36449	36449	he	39	" Surely , "
36452	36539	36449	36449	he	39	" this new picture can not be greater than that , though it shall hang where kings can see it and this only graces the library of my poor house . It has the feeling of a woman 's soul with the strength of a man 's heart . When Frank and Claire marry , I shall give it back to them . It is too great a treasure for a clod like me . Heigho , why will women be so long a - shopping ? "
36562	36584	36595	36595	he	39	" Ah , Lady Leslie , I ' ve a mind to open it to punish you for staying so long . "
36778	36789	36772	36772	He	39	" I ' ve been waiting so long for you ! "
37058	37062	37037	37037	he	39	" Dear Brother . "
37063	37066	37037	37037	he	39	" Dear Brother "
37206	37211	37212	37212	she	133	" What is it ? "
37215	37220	37212	37212	she	133	" Maurice ! Maurice ! "
37382	37386	37349	37354	the unconscious man at her feet	1252	" DEAR BROTHER , "
37390	37539	37349	37354	the unconscious man at her feet	1252	" I know you will grieve at receiving this , and I wish that I might bear your grief for you , but I can not , though I have as heavy a burden as this can bring to you . Mine would have been lighter to - day , perhaps , had you been more straightforward with me . I am not blaming you , however , for I know that my hypocrisy made you believe me possessed of a really soft heart , and you thought to spare me . Until yesterday , when in a letter from Esterton he casually mentioned the matter , I did not know that Berry was in prison , else this letter would have been written sooner . I have been wanting to write it for so long , and yet have been too great a coward to do so . "
37540	37659	37349	37354	the unconscious man at her feet	1252	" I know that you will be disappointed in me , and just what that disappointment will cost you I know ; but you must hear the truth . I shall never see your face again , or I should not dare to tell it even now . You will remember that I begged you to be easy on your servant . You thought it was only my kindness of heart . It was not ; I had a deeper reason . I knew where the money had gone and dared not tell . Berry is as innocent as yourself -- and I -- well , it is a story , and let me tell it to you . "
37660	37742	37349	37354	the unconscious man at her feet	1252	" You have had so much confidence in me , and I hate to tell you that it was all misplaced . I have no doubt that I should not be doing it now but that I have drunken absinthe enough to give me the emotional point of view , which I shall regret to - morrow . I do not mean that I am drunk . I can think clearly and write clearly , but my emotions are extremely active . "
37743	37802	37349	37354	the unconscious man at her feet	1252	" Do you remember Claire 's saying at the table that night of the farewell dinner that some dark - eyed mademoiselle was waiting for me ? She did not know how truly she spoke , though I fancy she saw how I flushed when she said it : for I was already in love -- madly so . "
37803	37892	37349	37354	the unconscious man at her feet	1252	" I need not describe her . I need say nothing about her , for I know that nothing I say can ever persuade you to forgive her for taking me from you . This has gone on since I first came here , and I dared not tell you , for I saw whither your eyes had turned . I loved this girl , and she both inspired and hindered my work . Perhaps I would have been successful had I not met her , perhaps not . "
37893	37951	37349	37354	the unconscious man at her feet	1252	" I love her too well to marry her and make of our devotion a stale , prosy thing of duty and compulsion . When a man does not marry a woman , he must keep her better than he would a wife . It costs . All that you gave me went to make her happy . "
37952	38102	37349	37354	the unconscious man at her feet	1252	" Then , when I was about leaving you , the catastrophe came . I wanted much to carry back to her . I gambled to make more . I would surprise her . Luck was against me . Night after night I lost . Then , just before the dinner , I woke from my frenzy to find all that I had was gone . I would have asked you for more , and you would have given it ; but that strange , ridiculous something which we misname Southern honour , that honour which strains at a gnat and swallows a camel , withheld me , and I preferred to do worse . So I lied to you . The money from my cabinet was not stolen save by myself . I am a liar and a thief , but your eyes shall never tell me so . "
38103	38168	38205	38206	the doctor	1255	" Tell the truth and have Berry released . I can stand it . Write me but one letter to tell me of this . Do not plead with me , do not forgive me , do not seek to find me , for from this time I shall be as one who has perished from the earth ; I shall be no more . "
38169	38175	38205	38206	the doctor	1255	" Your brother , FRANK . "
38237	38241	38242	38242	he	1254	" The letter ! "
38245	38258	38230	38230	he	1254	" Yes , dear , I have it ; I have it . "
38259	38265	38266	38266	he	1254	" Give it to me , "
38285	38294	38230	38230	he	1254	" Did -- did -- you read it ? "
38295	38302	38230	38230	he	1254	" Yes , I did not know---- "
38303	38346	38230	38230	he	1254	" Oh , my God , I did not intend that you should see it . I wanted the secret for my own . I wanted to carry it to my grave with me . Oh , Frank , Frank , Frank ! "
38347	38362	38230	38230	he	1254	" Never mind , Maurice . It is as if you alone knew it . "
38363	38375	38230	38230	he	1254	" It is not , I say , it is not ! "
38403	38409	38410	38410	he	1254	" Oh , my God , "
38413	38420	38410	38410	he	1254	" my brother , my brother ! "
38421	38437	38389	38390	a man	1563	" ' Sh , dearie , think -- it 's -- it 's -- Frank . "
38438	38462	38410	38410	he	1254	" That 's it , that 's it -- that 's what I ca n't forget . It 's Frank,--Frank , my brother . "
38475	38489	38490	38490	he	1254	" Leslie , no one must ever know what is in this letter , "
38494	38508	38473	38473	hers	1258	" No one shall , Maurice ; come , let us burn it . "
38509	38517	38518	38518	he	1254	" Burn it ? No , no , "
38526	38558	38518	38518	he	1254	" It must not be burned . What ! burn my brother 's secret ? No , no , I must carry it with me,--carry it with me to the grave . "
38559	38563	38576	38576	he	1254	" But , Maurice---- "
38564	38572	38518	38518	he	1254	" I must carry it with me . "
38675	38682	38683	38683	he	1260	" It 's a strange case , "
38686	38729	38683	38683	he	1260	" there 's something more than the nervous shock that makes him clutch his chest like that , and yet I have never noticed signs of heart trouble in Oakley . Oh , well , business worry will produce anything in anybody . "
38757	38776	38750	38750	he	1260	" Ah , Leslie , you and I will keep the secret . No one shall ever know . "
38777	38790	38750	38750	he	1260	" Yes , dear , but -- but -- what of Berry ? "

No one had ever looked at you until I picked you up and you ' ve been strutting around ever since , showing off because I was kind to you , and now this is the way you pay me back . Drunk half the time and half drunk the rest . Well , you know what I told you the last time you got ' loaded ' ? I mean it too . You 're not the only star in sight , see ? "

40429	40476	40426	40426	he	304	" did you hear that ? Bet the chap stole it himself and 's letting the old man suffer for it . Great story , ai n't it ? Come , come , wake up here . Three more , Jack . What about your father ? "

40590	40629	40635	40637	the young man	304	" Oh , let me alone , man . I ' ve been trying for years to get a big sensation for my paper , and if this story is one , I ' m a made man . "

40685	40717	40683	40683	Sadness	90	" you see drunken men tell the truth , and you do n't seem to get much guilt out of our young friend . You 're disappointed , are n't you ? "
40718	40737	40664	40664	he	304	" I confess I am disappointed , but I ' ve got an idea , just the same . "
40738	40757	40759	40759	Sadness	90	" Oh , you have ? Well , do n't handle it carelessly ; it might go off . "

43717	43739	43666	43668	The old man	2177	" Oh , it was n't anything much . Only an old and trusted servant robbed his master , and my theory---- "
43740	43749	43752	43752	Davis	68	" But you will remember , Mr. Talbot , "
43754	43769	43752	43752	Davis	68	" that I proved your theory to be wrong and cited a conclusive instance . "

43781	43809	43752	43752	Davis	68	" I am really anxious to hear about the robbery , though . It seems such an unusual thing for a negro to steal a great amount . "
43810	43823	43666	43668	The old man	2177	" Just so , and that was part of my theory . Now---- "
43824	43845	43847	43848	Colonel Saunders	74	" It 's an old story and a long one , Mr. Skaggs , and one of merely local repute , "

43884	43929	43666	43668	The old man	2177	" Those things do interest me very much , though . I am something of a psychologist , and I often find the smallest and most insignificant - appearing details pregnant with suggestion . Wo n't you let me hear the story , Colonel ? "
43930	43968	43847	43848	Colonel Saunders	74	" Why , yes , though there 's little in it save that I am one of the few men who have come to believe that the negro , Berry Hamilton , is not the guilty party . "

44102	44113	44114	44114	he	457	" Now , in the first place , Mr. Skaggs , "
44122	44160	44114	44114	he	457	" I am lawyer enough to see for myself how weak the evidence was upon which the negro was convicted , and later events have done much to confirm me in the opinion that he was innocent . "
44161	44165	44087	44088	the Colonel	457	" Later events ? "
44166	44169	44170	44171	The Colonel	457	" Yes . "
44184	44308	44170	44171	The Colonel	457	" Four years ago a great change took place in Maurice Oakley . It happened in the space of a day , and no one knows the cause of it . From a social , companionable man , he became a recluse , shunning visitors and dreading society . From an open - hearted , unsuspicious neighbour , he became secretive and distrustful of his own friends . From an active business man , he has become a retired brooder . He sees no one if he can help it . He writes no letters and receives none , not even from his brother , it is said . And all of this came about in the space of twenty - four hours . "
44309	44318	44499	44499	his	457	" But what was the beginning of it ? "
44319	44423	44170	44171	The Colonel	457	" No one knows , save that one day he had some sort of nervous attack . By the time the doctor was called he was better , but he kept clutching his hand over his heart . Naturally , the physician wanted to examine him there , but the very suggestion of it seemed to throw him into a frenzy ; and his wife too begged the doctor , an old friend of the family , to desist . Maurice Oakley had been as sound as a dollar , and no one of the family had had any tendency to heart affection . "
44424	44429	44499	44499	his	457	" It is strange . "
44430	44441	44170	44171	The Colonel	457	" Strange it is , but I have my theory . "
44442	44455	44499	44499	his	457	" His actions are like those of a man guarding a secret . "
44456	44473	44170	44171	The Colonel	457	" Sh ! His negro laundress says that there is an inside pocket in his undershirts . "
44474	44479	44499	44499	his	457	" An inside pocket ? "
44480	44483	44170	44171	The Colonel	457	" Yes . "
44484	44489	44490	44490	Skaggs	95	" And for what ? "
44503	44509	44510	44510	he	457	" We can only speculate , "
44513	44645	44510	44510	he	457	" but , as I have said , I have my theory . Oakley was a just man , and in punishing his old servant for the supposed robbery it is plain that he acted from principle . But he is also a proud man and would hate to confess that he had been in the wrong . So I believed that the cause of his first shock was the finding of the money that he supposed gone . Unwilling to admit this error , he lets the misapprehension go on , and it is the money which he carries in his secret pocket , with a morbid fear of its discovery , that has made him dismiss his servants , leave his business , and refuse to see his friends . "
44646	44682	44823	44824	the reporter	939	" A very natural conclusion , Colonel , and I must say that I believe you . It is strange that others have not seen as you have seen and brought the matter to light . "
44683	44775	44510	44510	he	457	" Well , you see , Mr. Skaggs , none are so dull as the people who think they think . I can safely say that there is not another man in this town who has lighted upon the real solution of this matter , though it has been openly talked of for so long . But as for bringing it to light , no one would think of doing that . It would be sure to hurt Oakley 's feelings , and he is of one of our best families . "
44776	44784	44859	44859	He	95	" Ah , yes , perfectly right . "
44834	44858	44823	44824	the reporter	939	" Good - night , Colonel . If I were a criminal , I should be afraid of that analytical mind of yours ! "
44864	44869	44870	44870	he	95	" The old fool ! "
44880	44903	44870	44870	he	95	" I ' ve got it ! I ' ve got it ! Maurice Oakley must see me , and then what ? "
44942	44947	44938	44938	he	95	" brace old Oakley . "
44975	44983	44984	44984	he	95	" I want to see Mr. Oakley , "
44987	45005	44962	44970	A gray - haired , sad - eyed woman	1405	" You can not see him . Mr. Oakley is not well and does not see visitors . "
45006	45023	44962	44970	A gray - haired , sad - eyed woman	1405	" But I must see him , madam ; I am here upon business of importance . "
45024	45046	44962	44970	A gray - haired , sad - eyed woman	1405	" You can tell me just as well as him . I am his wife and transact all of his business . "
45047	45061	44962	44970	A gray - haired , sad - eyed woman	1405	" I can tell no one but the master of the house himself . "
45062	45075	44962	44970	A gray - haired , sad - eyed woman	1405	" You can not see him . It is against his orders . "
45076	45080	45082	45082	Skaggs	95	" Very well , "
45088	45116	45082	45082	Skaggs	95	" it is his loss , not mine . I have tried to do my duty and failed . Simply tell him that I came from Paris . "
45117	45120	45126	45127	the woman	268	" Paris ? "
45131	45151	45126	45127	the woman	268	" Leslie , why do you keep the gentleman at the door ? Let him come in at once . "
45249	45260	45261	45261	he	269	" You 're from Paris , sir , from Paris ? "
45264	45271	45261	45261	he	269	" Come in , come in . "
45383	45392	45393	45393	he	269	" It is there the secret is hidden , "
45398	45429	45393	45393	he	269	" and whatever it is , I must have it . But how -- how ? I ca n't knock the man down and rob him in his own house . "
45441	45471	45393	45393	he	269	" You -- you -- perhaps have a message from my brother -- my brother who is in Paris . I have not heard from him for some time . "
45496	45501	45502	45502	he	95	" Now or never , "
45510	45521	45506	45506	he	95	" Yes , I have a message from your brother . "
45533	45559	45522	45523	The man	269	" You have ? you have ? Give it to me . After four years he sends me a message ! Give it to me ! "
45588	45630	45565	45566	the man	269	" Your brother bade me to say to you that you have a terrible secret , that you bear it in your breast -- there -- there . I am his messenger . He bids you to give it to me . "
45642	45647	45648	45648	he	269	" No , no ! "
45651	45661	45648	45648	he	269	" no , no ! I have no secret . "
45710	45721	45698	45698	his	2177	" Give it to me , as your brother commands . "
45722	45764	45698	45698	his	2177	" No , no , no ! It is not his secret ; it is mine . I must carry it here always , do you hear ? I must carry it till I die . Go away ! Go away ! "
45843	45849	45850	45850	she	40	" What is the matter ? "
45853	45862	45807	45807	his	2177	" My message has somewhat upset your husband , "
45868	45902	45850	45850	she	40	" But his breast is open . Your hand has been in his bosom . You have taken something from him . Give it to me , or I shall call for help . "
45918	45926	45927	45927	he	95	" You dare not call for help , "
45930	45937	45927	45927	he	95	" or the world will know ! "
45946	45968	45940	45940	her	40	" Oh , give it to me , give it to me . We ' ve never done you any harm . "
45969	45983	45940	45940	her	40	" But you ' ve harmed some one else ; that is enough . "
46104	46192	46096	46096	he	95	" Thank God ! thank God ! I was right , and the _ Universe _ shall have a sensation . The brother is the thief , and Berry Hamilton is an innocent man . Hurrah ! Now , who is it that has come on a wild - goose chase ? Who is it that ought to handle his idea carefully ? Heigho , Saunders my man , the drinks 'll be on you , and old Skaggsy will have done some good in the world . "
46491	46494	46489	46489	he	1370	" Huh ! "

46601	46622	46592	46592	it	1439	" Look you what we have done , and behold how great we are , the friend of the people ! "
46740	46744	46791	46791	Skaggs	95	" A Burning Shame !
46789	46789	46784	46785	the People	617	"
47110	47116	47117	47117	he	74	" To think , suh , "
47126	47159	47117	47117	he	74	spirits,--"to think of that man 's being a reporter , suh , a common , ordinary reporter , and that I sat and talked to him as if he were a gentleman ! "
47160	47170	47172	47174	old Horace Talbot	65	" You 're not to be blamed , Colonel , "
47176	47315	47172	47174	old Horace Talbot	65	" You ' ve done no more than any other gentleman would have done . The trouble is that the average Northerner has no sense of honour , suh , no sense of honour . If this particular man had had , he would have kept still , and everything would have gone on smooth and quiet . Instead of that , a distinguished family is brought to shame , and for what ? To give a nigger a few more years of freedom when , likely as not , he do n't want it ; and Berry Hamilton 's life in prison has proved nearer the ideal reached by slavery than anything he has found since emancipation . Why , suhs , I fancy I see him leaving his prison with tears of regret in his eyes . "
47800	47811	47813	47813	Skaggs	95	" This is a very happy occasion , Mr. Hamilton , "
