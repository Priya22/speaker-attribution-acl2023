1111	1154	1155	1155	He	80	" Yes , he would give them three thousand pounds : it would be liberal and handsome ! It would be enough to make them completely easy . Three thousand pounds ! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience . "
2194	2205	2207	2208	her husband	282	" It was my father s last request to me , "
2210	2220	2207	2208	her husband	282	" that I should assist his widow and daughters . "
2221	2280	2207	2208	her husband	282	" He did not know what he was talking of , I dare say ; ten to one but he was light - headed at the time . Had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child . "
2281	2403	2207	2208	her husband	282	" He did not stipulate for any particular sum , my dear Fanny ; he only requested me , in general terms , to assist them , and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do . Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself . He could hardly suppose I should neglect them . But as he required the promise , I could not do less than give it ; at least I thought so at the time . The promise , therefore , was given , and must be performed . Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home . "
2404	2432	2433	2433	she	334	" Well , then , _ let _ something be done for them ; but _ that _ something need not be three thousand pounds . Consider , "
2436	2477	2433	2433	she	334	" that when the money is once parted with , it never can return . Your sisters will marry , and it will be gone for ever . If , indeed , it could be restored to our poor little boy "
2478	2485	2487	2488	her husband	282	" Why , to be sure , "
2493	2536	2487	2488	her husband	282	" that would make great difference . The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with . If he should have a numerous family , for instance , it would be a very convenient addition . "
2537	2544	2207	2208	her husband	282	" To be sure it would . "
2545	2578	2487	2488	her husband	282	" Perhaps , then , it would be better for all parties , if the sum were diminished one half . Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes ! "
2579	2623	2207	2208	her husband	282	" Oh ! beyond anything great ! What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters , even if _ really _ his sisters ! And as it is only half blood ! But you have such a generous spirit ! "
2624	2635	2636	2636	he	282	" I would not wish to do any thing mean , "
2639	2680	2636	2636	he	282	" One had rather , on such occasions , do too much than too little . No one , at least , can think I have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more . "
2681	2693	2695	2696	the lady	336	" There is no knowing what _ they _ may expect , "
2698	2720	2695	2696	the lady	336	" but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do . "
2721	2771	2207	2208	her husband	282	" Certainly and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a - piece . As it is , without any addition of mine , they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother s death a very comfortable fortune for any young woman . "
2772	2838	2695	2696	the lady	336	" To be sure it is ; and , indeed , it strikes me that they can want no addition at all . They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them . If they marry , they will be sure of doing well , and if they do not , they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds . "
2839	2912	2207	2208	her husband	282	" That is very true , and , therefore , I do not know whether , upon the whole , it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives , rather than for them something of the annuity kind I mean . My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself . A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable . "
2929	2934	2936	2936	she	245	" To be sure , "
2938	2969	2936	2936	she	245	" it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once . But , then , if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in . "
2970	2988	2695	2696	the lady	336	" Fifteen years ! my dear Fanny ; her life can not be worth half that purchase . "
2989	3232	2936	2936	she	245	" Certainly not ; but if you observe , people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them ; and she is very stout and healthy , and hardly forty . An annuity is a very serious business ; it comes over and over every year , and there is no getting rid of it . You are not aware of what you are doing . I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities ; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father s will , and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it . Twice every year these annuities were to be paid ; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them ; and then one of them was said to have died , and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing . My mother was quite sick of it . Her income was not her own , she said , with such perpetual claims on it ; and it was the more unkind in my father , because , otherwise , the money would have been entirely at my mother s disposal , without any restriction whatever . It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world . "
3233	3241	3243	3244	Mr. Dashwood	80	" It is certainly an unpleasant thing , "
3246	3308	3243	3244	Mr. Dashwood	80	" to have those kind of yearly drains on one s income . One s fortune , as your mother justly says , is _ not _ one s own . To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum , on every rent day , is by no means desirable : it takes away one s independence . "
3309	3394	2695	2696	the lady	336	" Undoubtedly ; and after all you have no thanks for it . They think themselves secure , you do no more than what is expected , and it raises no gratitude at all . If I were you , whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely . I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly . It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred , or even fifty pounds from our own expenses . "
3395	3513	3243	3244	Mr. Dashwood	80	" I believe you are right , my love ; it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case ; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance , because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income , and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year . It will certainly be much the best way . A present of fifty pounds , now and then , will prevent their ever being distressed for money , and will , I think , be amply discharging my promise to my father . "
3514	3832	2695	2696	the lady	336	" To be sure it will . Indeed , to say the truth , I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all . The assistance he thought of , I dare say , was only such as might be reasonably expected of you ; for instance , such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them , helping them to move their things , and sending them presents of fish and game , and so forth , whenever they are in season . I ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther ; indeed , it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did . Do but consider , my dear Mr. Dashwood , how excessively comfortable your mother - in - law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds , besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls , which brings them in fifty pounds a year a - piece , and , of course , they will pay their mother for their board out of it . Altogether , they will have five hundred a - year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that ? They will live so cheap ! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all . They will have no carriage , no horses , and hardly any servants ; they will keep no company , and can have no expenses of any kind ! Only conceive how comfortable they will be ! Five hundred a year ! I am sure I can not imagine how they will spend half of it ; and as to your giving them more , it is quite absurd to think of it . They will be much more able to give _ you _ something . "
3833	3838	3840	3841	Mr. Dashwood	80	" Upon my word , "
3843	3928	3840	3841	Mr. Dashwood	80	" I believe you are perfectly right . My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say . I clearly understand it now , and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described . When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can . Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then . "
3929	3932	3934	3936	Mrs. John Dashwood	83	" Certainly , "
3938	4003	3934	3936	Mrs. John Dashwood	83	" But , however , _ one _ thing must be considered . When your father and mother moved to Norland , though the furniture of Stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother . Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it . "
4004	4036	4186	4187	his father	253	" That is a material consideration undoubtedly . A valuable legacy indeed ! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here . "
4037	4142	3934	3936	Mrs. John Dashwood	83	" Yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house . A great deal too handsome , in my opinion , for any place _ they _ can ever afford to live in . But , however , so it is . Your father thought only of _ them _ . And I must say this : that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to _ them _ . "
5141	5146	5148	5148	she	83	" It is enough , "
5150	5171	5148	5148	she	83	" to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough . It implies everything amiable . I love him already . "
5172	5180	5182	5182	Elinor	84	" I think you will like him , "
5184	5192	5182	5182	Elinor	84	" when you know more of him . "
5193	5197	5199	5200	her mother	296	" Like him ! "
5205	5216	5199	5200	her mother	296	" I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love . "
5217	5223	5182	5182	Elinor	84	" You may esteem him . "
5224	5239	5199	5200	her mother	296	" I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love . "
5366	5376	5378	5378	she	83	" In a few months , my dear Marianne , "
5380	5405	5378	5378	she	83	" Elinor will , in all probability be settled for life . We shall miss her ; but _ she _ will be happy . "
5406	5418	5348	5348	she	83	" Oh ! Mama , how shall we do without her ? "
5419	5490	5378	5378	she	83	" My love , it will be scarcely a separation . We shall live within a few miles of each other , and shall meet every day of our lives . You will gain a brother , a real , affectionate brother . I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward s heart . But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister s choice ? "
5491	5494	5496	5496	Marianne	85	" Perhaps , "
5498	5785	5496	5496	Marianne	85	" I may consider it with some surprise . Edward is very amiable , and I love him tenderly . But yet he is not the kind of young man there is something wanting his figure is not striking ; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister . His eyes want all that spirit , that fire , which at once announce virtue and intelligence . And besides all this , I am afraid , Mama , he has no real taste . Music seems scarcely to attract him , and though he admires Elinor s drawings very much , it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth . It is evident , in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws , that in fact he knows nothing of the matter . He admires as a lover , not as a connoisseur . To satisfy me , those characters must be united . I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own . He must enter into all my feelings ; the same books , the same music must charm us both . Oh ! mama , how spiritless , how tame was Edward s manner in reading to us last night ! I felt for my sister most severely . Yet she bore it with so much composure , she seemed scarcely to notice it . I could hardly keep my seat . To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild , pronounced with such impenetrable calmness , such dreadful indifference ! "
5786	5816	5378	5378	she	83	" He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose . I thought so at the time ; but you _ would _ give him Cowper . "
5817	5939	5496	5496	Marianne	85	" Nay , Mama , if he is not to be animated by Cowper ! but we must allow for difference of taste . Elinor has not my feelings , and therefore she may overlook it , and be happy with him . But it would have broke _ my _ heart , had I loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility . Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love . I require so much ! He must have all Edward s virtues , and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm . "
5940	5992	5378	5378	she	83	" Remember , my love , that you are not seventeen . It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness . Why should you be less fortunate than your mother ? In one circumstance only , my Marianne , may your destiny be different from hers ! "
5996	6005	6007	6007	Marianne	85	" What a pity it is , Elinor , "
6009	6019	6007	6007	Marianne	85	" that Edward should have no taste for drawing . "
6020	6026	6028	6028	Elinor	84	" No taste for drawing ! "
6030	6144	6028	6028	Elinor	84	" why should you think so ? He does not draw himself , indeed , but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people , and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste , though he has not had opportunities of improving it . Had he ever been in the way of learning , I think he would have drawn very well . He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much , that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture ; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste , which in general direct him perfectly right . "
6222	6228	6230	6230	Elinor	84	" I hope , Marianne , "
6232	6285	6230	6230	Elinor	84	" you do not consider him as deficient in general taste . Indeed , I think I may say that you can not , for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial , and if _ that _ were your opinion , I am sure you could never be civil to him . "
6323	6400	6320	6320	she	85	" Do not be offended , Elinor , if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits . I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind , his inclinations and tastes , as you have ; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense . I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable . "
6401	6406	6408	6408	Elinor	84	" I am sure , "
6414	6441	6408	6408	Elinor	84	" that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that . I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly . "
6453	6461	6463	6463	Elinor	84	" Of his sense and his goodness , "
6465	6728	6463	6463	Elinor	84	" no one can , I think , be in doubt , who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation . The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent . You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth . But of his minuter propensities , as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself . He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother . I have seen a great deal of him , have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste ; and , upon the whole , I venture to pronounce that his mind is well - informed , enjoyment of books exceedingly great , his imagination lively , his observation just and correct , and his taste delicate and pure . His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person . At first sight , his address is certainly not striking ; and his person can hardly be called handsome , till the expression of his eyes , which are uncommonly good , and the general sweetness of his countenance , is perceived . At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so . What say you , Marianne ? "
6729	6775	6797	6797	him	395	" I shall very soon think him handsome , Elinor , if I do not now . When you tell me to love him as a brother , I shall no more see imperfection in his face , than I now do in his heart . "
6884	6892	6894	6894	she	84	" I do not attempt to deny , "
6896	6914	6894	6894	she	84	" that I think very highly of him that I greatly esteem , that I like him . "
6921	6960	6915	6915	Marianne	85	" Esteem him ! Like him ! Cold - hearted Elinor ! Oh ! worse than cold - hearted ! Ashamed of being otherwise . Use those words again , and I will leave the room this moment . "
6967	6971	6973	6973	she	84	" Excuse me , "
6975	7218	6973	6973	she	84	" and be assured that I meant no offence to you , by speaking , in so quiet a way , of my own feelings . Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly . But farther than this you must _ not _ believe . I am by no means assured of his regard for me . There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful ; and till his sentiments are fully known , you can not wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality , by believing or calling it more than it is . In my heart I feel little scarcely any doubt of his preference . But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination . He is very far from being independent . What his mother really is we can not know ; but , from Fanny s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank . "
7238	7248	7250	7250	she	85	" And you really are not engaged to him ! "
7252	7330	7250	7250	she	85	" Yet it certainly soon will happen . But two advantages will proceed from this delay . _ I _ shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity . Oh ! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself , how delightful it would be ! "
8395	8418	8419	8419	She	83	" Devonshire ! Are you , indeed , going there ? So far from hence ! And to what part of it ? "
8433	8440	8441	8441	she	83	" It is but a cottage , "
8444	8492	8441	8441	she	83	" but I hope to see many of my friends in it . A room or two can easily be added ; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me , I am sure I will find none in accommodating them . "
9287	9293	9295	9295	Marianne	85	" Dear , dear Norland ! "
9314	9437	9295	9295	Marianne	85	" when shall I cease to regret you ! when learn to feel a home elsewhere ! Oh ! happy house , could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot , from whence perhaps I may view you no more ! And you , ye well - known trees ! but you will continue the same . No leaf will decay because we are removed , nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer ! No ; you will continue the same ; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion , and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade ! But who will remain to enjoy you ? "
9953	9964	9966	9966	she	83	" As for the house itself , to be sure , "
9968	10163	9966	9966	she	83	" it is too small for our family , but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present , as it is too late in the year for improvements . Perhaps in the spring , if I have plenty of money , as I dare say I shall , we may think about building . These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here ; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other , and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance ; this , with a new drawing room which may be easily added , and a bed - chamber and garret above , will make it a very snug little cottage . I could wish the stairs were handsome . But one must not expect every thing ; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them . I shall see how much I am before - hand with the world in the spring , and we will plan our improvements accordingly . "
12832	12928	12793	12813	a man five years younger than herself , so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter	653	" But at least , Mama , you can not deny the absurdity of the accusation , though you may not think it intentionally ill - natured . Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings , but he is old enough to be _ my _ father ; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love , must have long outlived every sensation of the kind . It is too ridiculous ! When is a man to be safe from such wit , if age and infirmity will not protect him ? "
12929	12932	12934	12934	Elinor	84	" Infirmity ! "
12936	12978	12934	12934	Elinor	84	" do you call Colonel Brandon infirm ? I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother ; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs ! "
12979	13001	12793	12813	a man five years younger than herself , so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter	653	" Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism ? and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life ? "
13002	13007	13009	13010	her mother	296	" My dearest child , "
13014	13051	13009	13010	her mother	296	" at this rate you must be in continual terror of _ my _ decay ; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty . "
13052	13106	12793	12813	a man five years younger than herself , so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter	653	" Mama , you are not doing me justice . I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature . He may live twenty years longer . But thirty - five has nothing to do with matrimony . "
13107	13110	13112	13112	Elinor	84	" Perhaps , "
13114	13172	13112	13112	Elinor	84	" thirty - five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together . But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty , I should not think Colonel Brandon s being thirty - five any objection to his marrying _ her _ . "
13173	13181	13183	13183	Marianne	85	" A woman of seven and twenty , "
13190	13311	13183	13183	Marianne	85	" can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife . In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable . It would be a compact of convenience , and the world would be satisfied . In my eyes it would be no marriage at all , but that would be nothing . To me it would seem only a commercial exchange , in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other . "
13312	13321	13323	13323	Elinor	84	" It would be impossible , I know , "
13325	13406	13323	13323	Elinor	84	" to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty - five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her . But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber , merely because he chanced to complain yesterday ( a very cold damp day ) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders . "
13407	13415	13417	13417	Marianne	85	" But he talked of flannel waistcoats , "
13419	13450	13417	13417	Marianne	85	" and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches , cramps , rheumatisms , and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble . "
13451	13497	13183	13183	Marianne	85	" Had he been only in a violent fever , you would not have despised him half so much . Confess , Marianne , is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek , hollow eye , and quick pulse of a fever ? "
13509	13512	13514	13514	Marianne	85	" Mama , "
13516	13577	13514	13514	Marianne	85	" I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I can not conceal from you . I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well . We have now been here almost a fortnight , and yet he does not come . Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay . What else can detain him at Norland ? "
13578	13589	13591	13592	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" Had you any idea of his coming so soon ? "
13594	13652	13591	13592	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" _ I _ had none . On the contrary , if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject , it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation , when I talked of his coming to Barton . Does Elinor expect him already ? "
13653	13668	13183	13183	Marianne	85	" I have never mentioned it to her , but of course she must . "
13669	13721	13591	13592	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" I rather think you are mistaken , for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time . "
13722	13872	13183	13183	Marianne	85	" How strange this is ! what can be the meaning of it ! But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable ! How cold , how composed were their last adieus ! How languid their conversation the last evening of their being together ! In Edward s farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me : it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both . Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room . And Elinor , in quitting Norland and Edward , cried not as I did . Even now her self - command is invariable . When is she dejected or melancholy ? When does she try to avoid society , or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ? "
14388	14397	14399	14399	Marianne	85	" Is there a felicity in the world , "
14401	14417	14399	14399	Marianne	85	" superior to this ? Margaret , we will walk here at least two hours . "
15225	15228	15230	15231	Sir John	94	" Willoughby ! "
15233	15264	15230	15231	Sir John	94	" what , is _ he _ in the country ? That is good news however ; I will ride over tomorrow , and ask him to dinner on Thursday . "
15265	15271	15273	15274	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" You know him then , "
15276	15295	15215	15223	any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham	710	" Know him ! to be sure I do . Why , he is down here every year . "
15296	15307	15215	15223	any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham	710	" And what sort of a young man is he ? "
15308	15338	15215	15223	any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham	710	" As good a kind of fellow as ever lived , I assure you . A very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in England . "
15339	15352	15354	15354	Marianne	85	" And is _ that _ all you can say for him ? "
15358	15379	15354	15354	Marianne	85	" But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance ? What his pursuits , his talents , and genius ? "
15386	15391	15393	15393	he	94	" Upon my soul , "
15395	15442	15393	15393	he	94	" I do not know much about him as to all _ that _ . But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw . Was she out with him today ? "
15472	15478	15480	15480	Elinor	84	" But who is he ? "
15482	15496	15480	15480	Elinor	84	" Where does he come from ? Has he a house at Allenham ? "
15557	15640	15509	15509	he	94	" Yes , yes , he is very well worth catching I can tell you , Miss Dashwood ; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides ; and if I were you , I would not give him up to my younger sister , in spite of all this tumbling down hills . Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself . Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care . "
15641	15647	15649	15650	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" I do not believe , "
15658	15741	15649	15650	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of _ my _ daughters towards what you call _ catching him _ . It is not an employment to which they have been brought up . Men are very safe with us , let them be ever so rich . I am glad to find , however , from what you say , that he is a respectable young man , and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible . "
15742	15759	15761	15762	Sir John	94	" He is as good a sort of fellow , I believe , as ever lived , "
15764	15791	15761	15762	Sir John	94	" I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park , he danced from eight o clock till four , without once sitting down . "
15792	15797	15799	15799	Marianne	85	" Did he indeed ? "
15804	15812	15799	15799	Marianne	85	" and with elegance , with spirit ? "
15813	15828	15649	15650	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert . "
15829	15868	15799	15799	Marianne	85	" That is what I like ; that is what a young man ought to be . Whatever be his pursuits , his eagerness in them should know no moderation , and leave him no sense of fatigue . "
15869	15881	15883	15884	Sir John	94	" Aye , aye , I see how it will be , "
15886	15911	15883	15884	Sir John	94	" I see how it will be . You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon . "
15912	15921	15923	15923	Marianne	85	" That is an expression , Sir John , "
15927	15993	15923	15923	Marianne	85	" which I particularly dislike . I abhor every common - place phrase by which wit is intended ; and setting one s cap at a man , or making a conquest , are the most odious of all . Their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity . "
16017	16072	16004	16004	he	94	" Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other . Poor Brandon ! he is quite smitten already , and he is very well worth setting your cap at , I can tell you , in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles . "
16631	16636	16638	16638	Elinor	84	" Well , Marianne , "
16648	16770	16638	16638	Elinor	84	" for _ one _ morning I think you have done pretty well . You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby s opinion in almost every matter of importance . You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott ; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought , and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper . But how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ? You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic . Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty , and second marriages , and then you can have nothing farther to ask . "
16771	16774	16776	16776	Marianne	85	" Elinor , "
16778	16875	16776	16776	Marianne	85	" is this fair ? is this just ? are my ideas so scanty ? But I see what you mean . I have been too much at my ease , too happy , too frank . I have erred against every common - place notion of decorum ; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved , spiritless , dull , and deceitful had I talked only of the weather and the roads , and had I spoken only once in ten minutes , this reproach would have been spared . "
16876	16880	16882	16883	her mother	296	" My love , "
16885	16923	16882	16883	her mother	296	" you must not be offended with Elinor she was only in jest . I should scold her myself , if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend . "
17705	17714	17716	17716	Willoughby	101	" Brandon is just the kind of man , "
17728	17755	17716	17716	Willoughby	101	" whom every body speaks well of , and nobody cares about ; whom all are delighted to see , and nobody remembers to talk to . "
17756	17766	17768	17768	Marianne	85	" That is exactly what I think of him , "
17770	17779	17781	17781	Elinor	84	" Do not boast of it , however , "
17783	17819	17781	17781	Elinor	84	" for it is injustice in both of you . He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him . "
17820	17830	17832	17832	Willoughby	101	" That he is patronised by _ you _ , "
17834	17887	17832	17832	Willoughby	101	" is certainly in his favour ; but as for the esteem of the others , it is a reproach in itself . Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings , that could command the indifference of any body else ? "
17888	17939	17716	17716	Willoughby	101	" But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother . If their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust . "
17940	17955	17832	17832	Willoughby	101	" In defence of your _ prot g _ you can even be saucy . "
17956	18049	17716	17716	Willoughby	101	" My _ prot g _ , as you call him , is a sensible man ; and sense will always have attractions for me . Yes , Marianne , even in a man between thirty and forty . He has seen a great deal of the world ; has been abroad , has read , and has a thinking mind . I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature . "
18050	18056	18058	18058	Marianne	85	" That is to say , "
18061	18083	18058	18058	Marianne	85	" he has told you , that in the East Indies the climate is hot , and the mosquitoes are troublesome . "
18084	18119	17716	17716	Willoughby	101	" He _ would _ have told me so , I doubt not , had I made any such inquiries , but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed . "
18120	18123	18125	18125	Willoughby	101	" Perhaps , "
18127	18145	18125	18125	Willoughby	101	" his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs , gold mohrs , and palanquins . "
18146	18174	17716	17716	Willoughby	101	" I may venture to say that _ his _ observations have stretched much further than _ your _ candour . But why should you dislike him ? "
18175	18234	18125	18125	Willoughby	101	" I do not dislike him . I consider him , on the contrary , as a very respectable man , who has every body s good word , and nobody s notice ; who has more money than he can spend , more time than he knows how to employ , and two new coats every year . "
18235	18240	18242	18242	Marianne	85	" Add to which , "
18244	18274	18242	18242	Marianne	85	" that he has neither genius , taste , nor spirit . That his understanding has no brilliancy , his feelings no ardour , and his voice no expression . "
18275	18287	18289	18289	Elinor	84	" You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass , "
18291	18354	18289	18289	Elinor	84	" and so much on the strength of your own imagination , that the commendation _ I _ am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid . I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , I believe , possessing an amiable heart . "
18355	18359	18361	18361	Willoughby	101	" Miss Dashwood , "
18363	18515	18361	18361	Willoughby	101	" you are now using me unkindly . You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason , and to convince me against my will . But it will not do . You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful . I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon ; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine ; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle , and I can not persuade him to buy my brown mare . If it will be any satisfaction to you , however , to be told , that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable , I am ready to confess it . And in return for an acknowledgment , which must give me some pain , you can not deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever . "
19577	19591	19569	19569	he	99	" Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments . "
19592	19595	19597	19597	Elinor	84	" No , "
19599	19606	19597	19597	Elinor	84	" her opinions are all romantic . "
19607	19622	19569	19569	he	99	" Or rather , as I believe , she considers them impossible to exist . "
19623	19695	19597	19597	Elinor	84	" I believe she does . But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father , who had himself two wives , I know not . A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation ; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are , by any body but herself . "
19696	19704	19705	19705	he	99	" This will probably be the case , "
19708	19741	19705	19705	he	99	" and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions . "
19742	19751	19753	19753	Elinor	84	" I can not agree with you there , "
19755	19814	19753	19753	Elinor	84	" There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne s , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world can not atone for . Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage . "
19826	19886	19819	19819	he	99	" Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment ? or is it equally criminal in every body ? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? "
19887	19923	20036	20036	he	99	" Upon my word , I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles . I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment s being pardonable . "
19924	19927	19929	19929	he	99	" This , "
19931	20026	20028	20028	he	99	" can not hold ; but a change , a total change of sentiments No , no , do not desire it ; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way , how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common , and too dangerous ! I speak from experience . I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an enforced change from a series of unfortunate circumstances "
20320	20333	20334	20334	she	84	" He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it , "
20337	20375	20334	20334	she	84	" and when it arrives we will ride every day . You shall share its use with me . Imagine to yourself , my dear Elinor , the delight of a gallop on some of these downs . "
20497	20504	20506	20506	she	84	" You are mistaken , Elinor , "
20509	20638	20506	20506	she	84	" in supposing I know very little of Willoughby . I have not known him long indeed , but I am much better acquainted with him , than I am with any other creature in the world , except yourself and mama . It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy ; it is disposition alone . Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other , and seven days are more than enough for others . I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother , than from Willoughby . Of John I know very little , though we have lived together for years ; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed . "
20845	20896	20836	20836	he	101	" But , Marianne , the horse is still yours , though you can not use it now . I shall keep it only till you can claim it . When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home , Queen Mab shall receive you . "
21073	21078	21079	21079	she	79	" Oh , Elinor ! "
21082	21107	21079	21079	she	79	" I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne . I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon . "
21108	21114	21116	21116	Elinor	84	" You have said so , "
21118	21172	21116	21116	Elinor	84	" almost every day since they first met on High - church Down ; and they had not known each other a week , I believe , before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle . "
21173	21202	21062	21064	her eldest sister	800	" But indeed this is quite another thing . I am sure they will be married very soon , for he has got a lock of her hair . "
21203	21224	21116	21116	Elinor	84	" Take care , Margaret . It may be only the hair of some great uncle of _ his _ . "
21225	21339	21062	21064	her eldest sister	800	" But , indeed , Elinor , it is Marianne s. I am almost sure it is , for I saw him cut it off . Last night after tea , when you and mama went out of the room , they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be , and he seemed to be begging something of her , and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair , for it was all tumbled down her back ; and he kissed it , and folded it up in a piece of white paper ; and put it into his pocket - book . "
21444	21455	21433	21433	Margaret	86	" I must not tell , may I , Elinor ? "
21535	21552	21512	21512	she	85	" Remember that whatever your conjectures may be , you have no right to repeat them . "
21553	21562	21564	21564	Margaret	86	" I never had any conjectures about it , "
21566	21577	21564	21564	Margaret	86	" it was you who told me of it yourself . "
21596	21611	21613	21614	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Oh ! pray , Miss Margaret , let us know all about it , "
21616	21624	21613	21614	Mrs. Jennings	98	" What is the gentleman s name ? "
21625	21651	21512	21512	she	85	" I must not tell , ma am . But I know very well what it is ; and I know where he is too . "
21652	21685	21613	21614	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at Norland to be sure . He is the curate of the parish I dare say . "
21686	21704	21512	21512	she	85	" No , _ that _ he is not . He is of no profession at all . "
21705	21708	21710	21710	Marianne	85	" Margaret , "
21715	21738	21710	21710	Marianne	85	" you know that all this is an invention of your own , and that there is no such person in existence . "
21739	21769	21512	21512	she	85	" Well , then , he is lately dead , Marianne , for I am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an F. "
21785	21792	21794	21794	she	84	" that it rained very hard , "
22301	22309	22311	22312	Sir John	94	" What is the matter with Brandon ? "
22318	22328	22330	22331	Lady Middleton	95	" I hope he has had no bad news , "
22333	22351	22330	22331	Lady Middleton	95	" It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly . "
22359	22369	22371	22372	Mrs. Jennings	98	" No bad news , Colonel , I hope ; "
22382	22394	22311	22312	Sir John	94	" None at all , ma am , I thank you . "
22395	22414	22330	22331	Lady Middleton	95	" Was it from Avignon ? I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse . "
22415	22434	22311	22312	Sir John	94	" No , ma am . It came from town , and is merely a letter of business . "
22435	22476	22330	22331	Lady Middleton	95	" But how came the hand to discompose you so much , if it was only a letter of business ? Come , come , this won t do , Colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it . "
22477	22482	22484	22485	Lady Middleton	95	" My dear madam , "
22487	22494	22484	22485	Lady Middleton	95	" recollect what you are saying . "
22495	22509	22511	22512	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married ? "
22522	22531	22330	22331	Lady Middleton	95	" No , indeed , it is not . "
22532	22553	22484	22485	Lady Middleton	95	" Well , then , I know who it is from , Colonel . And I hope she is well . "
22554	22563	22565	22565	he	831	" Whom do you mean , ma am ? "
22571	22580	22484	22485	Lady Middleton	95	" Oh ! you know who I mean . "
22581	22590	22592	22592	he	831	" I am particularly sorry , ma am , "
22598	22620	22592	22592	he	831	" that I should receive this letter today , for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town . "
22621	22625	22627	22628	Mrs. Jennings	98	" In town ! "
22630	22645	22627	22628	Mrs. Jennings	98	" What can you have to do in town at this time of year ? "
22646	22653	22654	22654	he	831	" My own loss is great , "
22657	22689	22654	22654	he	831	" in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ; but I am the more concerned , as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell . "
22699	22713	22715	22715	Marianne	85	" But if you write a note to the housekeeper , Mr. Brandon , "
22719	22726	22715	22715	Marianne	85	" will it not be sufficient ? "
22732	22737	22739	22740	Sir John	94	" We must go , "
22742	22771	22739	22740	Sir John	94	" It shall not be put off when we are so near it . You can not go to town till tomorrow , Brandon , that is all . "
22772	22797	22729	22729	his	831	" I wish it could be so easily settled . But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day ! "
22798	22811	22813	22814	Mrs. Jennings	98	" If you would but let us know what your business is , "
22816	22829	22813	22814	Mrs. Jennings	98	" we might see whether it could be put off or not . "
22830	22839	22841	22841	Willoughby	101	" You would not be six hours later , "
22843	22855	22841	22841	Willoughby	101	" if you were to defer your journey till our return . "
22856	22868	22729	22729	his	831	" I can not afford to lose _ one _ hour . "
22882	22935	22872	22872	Willoughby	101	" There are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure . Brandon is one of them . He was afraid of catching cold I dare say , and invented this trick for getting out of it . I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing . "
22936	22944	22946	22946	Marianne	85	" I have no doubt of it , "
22948	22966	22968	22969	Sir John	94	" There is no persuading you to change your mind , Brandon , I know of old , "
22971	23035	22968	22969	Sir John	94	" when once you are determined on anything . But , however , I hope you will think better of it . Consider , here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton , the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage , and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time , on purpose to go to Whitwell . "
23062	23074	23048	23049	the party	544	" Well , then , when will you come back again ? "
23075	23085	23087	23088	her ladyship	534	" I hope we shall see you at Barton , "
23090	23113	23087	23088	her ladyship	534	" as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return . "
23114	23147	23048	23049	the party	544	" You are very obliging . But it is so uncertain , when I may have it in my power to return , that I dare not engage for it at all . "
23148	23158	23160	23161	Sir John	94	" Oh ! he must and shall come back , "
23163	23182	23160	23161	Sir John	94	" If he is not here by the end of the week , I shall go after him . "
23183	23192	23194	23195	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Ay , so do , Sir John , "
23197	23210	23194	23195	Mrs. Jennings	98	" and then perhaps you may find out what his business is . "
23211	23234	23048	23049	the party	544	" I do not want to pry into other men s concerns . I suppose it is something he is ashamed of . "
23242	23255	23257	23258	Sir John	94	" You do not go to town on horseback , do you ? "
23260	23273	23048	23049	the party	544	" No . Only to Honiton . I shall then go post . "
23274	23299	23048	23049	the party	544	" Well , as you are resolved to go , I wish you a good journey . But you had better change your mind . "
23300	23311	23048	23049	the party	544	" I assure you it is not in my power . "
23321	23341	23317	23319	the whole party	824	" Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? "
23342	23351	23317	23319	the whole party	824	" I am afraid , none at all . "
23352	23370	23317	23319	the whole party	824	" Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do . "
23381	23385	23387	23388	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Come Colonel , "
23390	23405	23387	23388	Mrs. Jennings	98	" before you go , do let us know what you are going about . "
23455	23466	23468	23469	Mrs. Jennings	98	" I can guess what his business is , however , "
23472	23479	23481	23483	almost every body	839	" Can you , ma am ? "
23485	23498	23468	23469	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Yes ; it is about Miss Williams , I am sure . "
23499	23506	23508	23508	Marianne	85	" And who is Miss Williams ? "
23510	23565	23569	23569	her	85	" What ! do not you know who Miss Williams is ? I am sure you must have heard of her before . She is a relation of the Colonel s , my dear ; a very near relation . We will not say how near , for fear of shocking the young ladies . "
23579	23586	23574	23574	she	85	" She is his natural daughter . "
23587	23590	23569	23569	her	85	" Indeed ! "
23591	23617	23574	23574	she	85	" Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare . I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune . "
23890	23911	23870	23870	she	98	" I have found you out in spite of all your tricks . I know where you spent the morning . "
23920	23925	23912	23912	Marianne	85	" Where , pray ? "
23926	23932	23934	23934	Willoughby	101	" Did not you know , "
23936	23946	23934	23934	Willoughby	101	" that we had been out in my curricle ? "
23947	24028	23912	23912	Marianne	85	" Yes , yes , Mr. Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out _ where _ you had been to . I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne . It is a very large one , I know ; and when I come to see you , I hope you will have new - furnished it , for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago . "
24192	24228	24169	24169	she	84	" Why should you imagine , Elinor , that we did not go there , or that we did not see the house ? Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself ? "
24229	24254	24169	24169	she	84	" Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby . "
24255	24301	24169	24169	she	84	" Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show that house ; and as he went in an open carriage , it was impossible to have any other companion . I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life . "
24302	24307	24309	24309	Elinor	84	" I am afraid , "
24311	24325	24309	24309	Elinor	84	" that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety . "
24326	24388	24169	24169	she	84	" On the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , Elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did , I should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure . "
24389	24422	24309	24309	Elinor	84	" But , my dear Marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ? "
24423	24498	24169	24169	she	84	" If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct , we are all offending every moment of our lives . I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation . I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith s grounds , or in seeing her house . They will one day be Mr. Willoughby s , and "
24499	24523	24309	24309	Elinor	84	" If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done . "
24563	24745	24549	24549	she	859	" Perhaps , Elinor , it _ was _ rather ill - judged in me to go to Allenham ; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to show me the place ; and it is a charming house , I assure you . There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs ; of a nice comfortable size for constant use , and with modern furniture it would be delightful . It is a corner room , and has windows on two sides . On one side you look across the bowling - green , behind the house , to a beautiful hanging wood , and on the other you have a view of the church and village , and , beyond them , of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired . I did not see it to advantage , for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture , but if it were newly fitted up a couple of hundred pounds , Willoughby says , would make it one of the pleasantest summer - rooms in England . "
24887	24900	24902	24902	she	98	" Something very melancholy must be the matter , I am sure , "
24904	25146	24902	24902	she	98	" I could see it in his face . Poor man ! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad . The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year , and his brother left everything sadly involved . I do think he must have been sent for about money matters , for what else can it be ? I wonder whether it is so . I would give anything to know the truth of it . Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and , by the bye , I dare say it is , because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her . May be she is ill in town ; nothing in the world more likely , for I have a notion she is always rather sickly . I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams . It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances _ now _ , for he is a very prudent man , and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time . I wonder what it can be ! May be his sister is worse at Avignon , and has sent for him over . His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it . Well , I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart , and a good wife into the bargain . "
25649	25652	25653	25653	he	101	" What ! "
25655	25695	25622	25622	her	83	" Improve this dear cottage ! No . _ That _ I will never consent to . Not a stone must be added to its walls , not an inch to its size , if my feelings are regarded . "
25696	25702	25704	25705	Miss Dashwood	79	" Do not be alarmed , "
25707	25728	25704	25705	Miss Dashwood	79	" nothing of the kind will be done ; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it . "
25729	25737	25738	25738	he	101	" I am heartily glad of it , "
25741	25757	25738	25738	he	101	" May she always be poor , if she can employ her riches no better . "
25758	25855	25704	25705	Miss Dashwood	79	" Thank you , Willoughby . But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours , or of any one whom I loved , for all the improvements in the world . Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain , when I make up my accounts in the spring , I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you . But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it ? "
25856	25860	25862	25862	he	101	" I am , "
25864	25915	25862	25862	he	101	" To me it is faultless . Nay , more , I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable , and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down , and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage . "
25916	25930	25932	25932	Elinor	84	" With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes , I suppose , "
25934	25937	25939	25939	he	101	" Yes , "
25946	25998	25939	25939	he	101	" with all and every thing belonging to it ; in no one convenience or inconvenience about it , should the least variation be perceptible . Then , and then only , under such a roof , I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton . "
25999	26004	26006	26006	Elinor	84	" I flatter myself , "
26008	26037	26006	26006	Elinor	84	" that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase , you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this . "
26038	26044	26046	26046	Willoughby	101	" There certainly are circumstances , "
26048	26076	26046	26046	Willoughby	101	" which might greatly endear it to me ; but this place will always have one claim of my affection , which no other can possibly share . "
26104	26111	26113	26113	he	101	" How often did I wish , "
26115	26228	26113	26113	he	101	" when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth , that Barton cottage were inhabited ! I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation , and grieving that no one should live in it . How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs. Smith , when I next came into the country , would be that Barton cottage was taken : and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event , which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it , can account for . Must it not have been so , Marianne ? "
26246	26343	26243	26243	he	101	" And yet this house you would spoil , Mrs. Dashwood ? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement ! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began , and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together , you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance , and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford . "
26359	26366	26367	26367	he	101	" You are a good woman , "
26371	26440	26367	26367	he	101	" Your promise makes me easy . Extend it a little farther , and it will make me happy . Tell me that not only your house will remain the same , but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling ; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me . "
26465	26474	26476	26477	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner ? "
26485	26511	26476	26477	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" I do not ask you to come in the morning , for we must walk to the park , to call on Lady Middleton . "
26751	26759	26761	26762	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" Is anything the matter with her ? "
26766	26771	26761	26762	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" is she ill ? "
26772	26777	26778	26778	he	101	" I hope not , "
26794	26816	26778	26778	he	101	" It is I who may rather expect to be ill for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment ! "
26817	26820	26761	26762	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" Disappointment ? "
26821	26889	26778	26778	he	101	" Yes , for I am unable to keep my engagement with you . Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin , by sending me on business to London . I have just received my dispatches , and taken my farewell of Allenham ; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you . "
26890	26901	26761	26762	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" To London ! and are you going this morning ? "
26902	26907	26778	26778	he	101	" Almost this moment . "
26908	26934	26761	26762	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" This is very unfortunate . But Mrs. Smith must be obliged ; and her business will not detain you from us long I hope . "
26941	26970	26938	26938	he	898	" You are very kind , but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately . My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth . "
26971	27008	26761	26762	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" And is Mrs. Smith your only friend ? Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome ? For shame , Willoughby , can you wait for an invitation here ? "
27025	27031	27021	27021	he	898	" You are too good . "
27059	27128	27021	27021	he	898	" I have only to add , my dear Willoughby , that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome ; for I will not press you to return here immediately , because you only can judge how far _ that _ might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith ; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination . "
27129	27135	27137	27137	Willoughby	101	" My engagements at present , "
27141	27153	27137	27137	Willoughby	101	" are of such a nature that I dare not flatter myself "
27184	27216	27175	27175	Willoughby	101	" It is folly to linger in this manner . I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy . "
27490	27503	27505	27505	she	296	" Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton , Elinor , "
27514	27525	27505	27505	she	296	" and with how heavy a heart does he travel ? "
27526	27639	27479	27479	her	296	" It is all very strange . So suddenly to be gone ! It seems but the work of a moment . And last night he was with us so happy , so cheerful , so affectionate ? And now , after only ten minutes notice Gone too without intending to return ! Something more than what he owned to us must have happened . He did not speak , he did not behave like himself . _ You _ must have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be ? Can they have quarrelled ? Why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here ? "
27640	27699	27505	27505	she	296	" It was not inclination that he wanted , Elinor ; I could plainly see _ that _ . He had not the power of accepting it . I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you . "
27700	27706	27479	27479	her	296	" Can you , indeed ! "
27707	27937	27505	27505	she	296	" Yes . I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way ; but you , Elinor , who love to doubt where you can it will not satisfy _ you _ , I know ; but you shall not talk _ me _ out of my trust in it . I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him , ) and on that account is eager to get him away ; and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him . This is what I believe to have happened . He is , moreover , aware that she _ does _ disapprove the connection , he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne , and he feels himself obliged , from his dependent situation , to give into her schemes , and absent himself from Devonshire for a while . You will tell me , I know , that this may or may _ not _ have happened ; but I will listen to no cavil , unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this . And now , Elinor , what have you to say ? "
27938	27948	27479	27479	her	296	" Nothing , for you have anticipated my answer . "
27949	28120	27505	27505	she	296	" Then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened . Oh , Elinor , how incomprehensible are your feelings ! You had rather take evil upon credit than good . You had rather look out for misery for Marianne , and guilt for poor Willoughby , than an apology for the latter . You are resolved to think him blameable , because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shown . And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ? Are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ? Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love , and no reason in the world to think ill of ? To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves , though unavoidably secret for a while ? And , after all , what is it you suspect him of ? "
28121	28239	27479	27479	her	296	" I can hardly tell myself . But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him . There is great truth , however , in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him , and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body . Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct , and I will hope that he has . But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once . Secrecy may be advisable ; but still I can not help wondering at its being practiced by him . "
28240	28284	27505	27505	she	296	" Do not blame him , however , for departing from his character , where the deviation is necessary . But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence ? I am happy and he is acquitted . "
28285	28343	27479	27479	her	296	" Not entirely . It may be proper to conceal their engagement ( if they _ are _ engaged ) from Mrs. Smith and if that is the case , it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present . But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us . "
28344	28380	27505	27505	she	296	" Concealing it from us ! my dear child , do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment ? This is strange indeed , when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness . "
28381	28390	28392	28392	Elinor	84	" I want no proof of their affection , "
28394	28402	28392	28392	Elinor	84	" but of their engagement I do . "
28403	28411	27505	27505	she	296	" I am perfectly satisfied of both . "
28412	28431	28392	28392	Elinor	84	" Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject , by either of them . "
28432	28586	27505	27505	she	296	" I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly . Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us , for at least the last fortnight , declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife , and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation ? Have we not perfectly understood each other ? Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks , his manner , his attentive and affectionate respect ? My Elinor , is it possible to doubt their engagement ? How could such a thought occur to you ? How is it to be supposed that Willoughby , persuaded as he must be of your sister s love , should leave her , and leave her perhaps for months , without telling her of his affection ; that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence ? "
28587	28591	28593	28593	Elinor	84	" I confess , "
28595	28634	28593	28593	Elinor	84	" that every circumstance except _ one _ is in favour of their engagement ; but that _ one _ is the total silence of both on the subject , and with me it almost outweighs every other . "
28635	28699	27505	27505	she	296	" How strange this is ! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby , if , after all that has openly passed between them , you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together . Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time ? Do you suppose him really indifferent to her ? "
28700	28719	28593	28593	Elinor	84	" No , I can not think that . He must and does love her I am sure . "
28720	28750	27505	27505	she	296	" But with a strange kind of tenderness , if he can leave her with such indifference , such carelessness of the future , as you attribute to him . "
28751	28810	28593	28593	Elinor	84	" You must remember , my dear mother , that I have never considered this matter as certain . I have had my doubts , I confess ; but they are fainter than they were , and they may soon be entirely done away . If we find they correspond , every fear of mine will be removed . "
28811	28922	27505	27505	she	296	" A mighty concession indeed ! If you were to see them at the altar , you would suppose they were going to be married . Ungracious girl ! But _ I _ require no such proof . Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt ; no secrecy has been attempted ; all has been uniformly open and unreserved . You can not doubt your sister s wishes . It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect . But why ? Is he not a man of honour and feeling ? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm ? can he be deceitful ? "
28923	28932	28934	28934	Elinor	84	" I hope not , I believe not , "
28936	29178	28934	28934	Elinor	84	" I love Willoughby , sincerely love him ; and suspicion of his integrity can not be more painful to yourself than to me . It has been involuntary , and I will not encourage it . I was startled , I confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning ; he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality . But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed . He had just parted from my sister , had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction ; and if he felt obliged , from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith , to resist the temptation of returning here soon , and yet aware that by declining your invitation , by saying that he was going away for some time , he should seem to act an ungenerous , a suspicious part by our family , he might well be embarrassed and disturbed . In such a case , a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think , as well as more consistent with his general character ; but I will not raise objections against any one s conduct on so illiberal a foundation , as a difference in judgment from myself , or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent . "
29179	29302	29352	29352	she	85	" You speak very properly . Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected . Though _ we _ have not known him long , he is no stranger in this part of the world ; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage ? Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately , it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once : but this is not the case . It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun , for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance ; and even secrecy , as far as it can be observed , may now be very advisable . "
29928	29933	29935	29935	she	83	" Remember , Elinor , "
29937	29989	29935	29935	she	83	" how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post , and carries them to it . We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary , and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through Sir John s hands . "
30057	30067	30069	30069	she	83	" Why do you not ask Marianne at once , "
30071	30130	30069	30069	she	83	" whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby ? From you , her mother , and so kind , so indulgent a mother , the question could not give offence . It would be the natural result of your affection for her . She used to be all unreserve , and to you more especially . "
30131	30269	30054	30055	her mother	296	" I would not ask such a question for the world . Supposing it possible that they are not engaged , what distress would not such an enquiry inflict ! At any rate it would be most ungenerous . I should never deserve her confidence again , after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one . I know Marianne s heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible . I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one ; of a child much less ; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct . "
30369	30416	30441	30441	she	83	" We have never finished Hamlet , Marianne ; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it . We will put it by , that when he comes again ... But it may be months , perhaps , before _ that _ happens . "
30417	30420	30422	30422	Marianne	85	" Months ! "
30428	30434	30422	30422	Marianne	85	" No nor many weeks . "
30750	30764	30746	30746	Marianne	85	" It is he ; it is indeed ; I know it is ! "
30777	30808	30746	30746	Marianne	85	" Indeed , Marianne , I think you are mistaken . It is not Willoughby . The person is not tall enough for him , and has not his air . "
30809	30816	30818	30818	Marianne	85	" He has , he has , "
30820	30844	30818	30818	Marianne	85	" I am sure he has . His air , his coat , his horse . I knew how soon he would come . "
31257	31261	31262	31262	she	85	" A fortnight ! "
31301	31309	31311	31311	Elinor	84	" Have you been lately in Sussex ? "
31313	31323	31287	31287	he	89	" I was at Norland about a month ago . "
31324	31334	31336	31336	Marianne	85	" And how does dear , dear Norland look ? "
31338	31344	31346	31346	Elinor	84	" Dear , dear Norland , "
31348	31373	31346	31346	Elinor	84	" probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year . The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves . "
31374	31377	31379	31379	Marianne	85	" Oh , "
31381	31458	31379	31379	Marianne	85	" with what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall ! How have I delighted , as I walked , to see them driven in showers about me by the wind ! What feelings have they , the season , the air altogether inspired ! Now there is no one to regard them . They are seen only as a nuisance , swept hastily off , and driven as much as possible from the sight . "
31459	31466	31468	31468	Elinor	84	" It is not every one , "
31470	31479	31468	31468	Elinor	84	" who has your passion for dead leaves . "
31480	31501	31503	31503	she	84	" No ; my feelings are not often shared , not often understood . But _ sometimes _ they are . "
31522	31527	31529	31529	she	84	" Now , Edward , "
31538	31608	31529	31529	she	84	" here is Barton valley . Look up to it , and be tranquil if you can . Look at those hills ! Did you ever see their equals ? To the left is Barton park , amongst those woods and plantations . You may see the end of the house . And there , beneath that farthest hill , which rises with such grandeur , is our cottage . "
31609	31616	31617	31617	he	967	" It is a beautiful country , "
31620	31630	31617	31617	he	967	" but these bottoms must be dirty in winter . "
31631	31645	31529	31529	she	84	" How can you think of dirt , with such objects before you ? "
31646	31649	31651	31651	he	967	" Because , "
31655	31672	31651	31651	he	967	" among the rest of the objects before me , I see a very dirty lane . "
31673	31677	31679	31679	Marianne	85	" How strange ! "
31687	31701	31651	31651	he	967	" Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here ? Are the Middletons pleasant people ? "
31702	31708	31710	31710	Marianne	85	" No , not all , "
31712	31721	31710	31710	Marianne	85	" we could not be more unfortunately situated . "
31722	31725	31727	31728	her sister	301	" Marianne , "
31730	31780	31727	31728	her sister	301	" how can you say so ? How can you be so unjust ? They are a very respectable family , Mr. Ferrars ; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner . Have you forgot , Marianne , how many pleasant days we have owed to them ? "
31781	31784	31786	31786	Marianne	85	" No , "
31793	31800	31786	31786	Marianne	85	" nor how many painful moments . "
32110	32124	32126	32126	she	83	" What are Mrs. Ferrars s views for you at present , Edward ? "
32140	32154	32126	32126	she	83	" are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself ? "
32155	32178	32106	32108	all selfish parents	980	" No . I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life ! "
32179	32227	32126	32126	she	83	" But how is your fame to be established ? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family ; and with no inclination for expense , no affection for strangers , no profession , and no assurance , you may find it a difficult matter . "
32228	32266	32106	32108	all selfish parents	980	" I shall not attempt it . I have no wish to be distinguished ; and have every reason to hope I never shall . Thank Heaven ! I can not be forced into genius and eloquence . "
32267	32283	32126	32126	she	83	" You have no ambition , I well know . Your wishes are all moderate . "
32284	32333	32106	32108	all selfish parents	980	" As moderate as those of the rest of the world , I believe . I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy ; but , like every body else it must be in my own way . Greatness will not make me so . "
32334	32340	32342	32342	Marianne	85	" Strange that it would ! "
32344	32355	32342	32342	Marianne	85	" What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness ? "
32356	32362	32364	32364	Elinor	84	" Grandeur has but little , "
32366	32376	32364	32364	Elinor	84	" but wealth has much to do with it . "
32377	32383	32385	32385	Marianne	85	" Elinor , for shame ! "
32387	32421	32385	32385	Marianne	85	" money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it . Beyond a competence , it can afford no real satisfaction , as far as mere self is concerned . "
32422	32425	32427	32427	Elinor	84	" Perhaps , "
32431	32498	32427	32427	Elinor	84	" we may come to the same point . _ Your _ competence and _ my _ wealth are very much alike , I dare say ; and without them , as the world goes now , we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting . Your ideas are only more noble than mine . Come , what is your competence ? "
32499	32516	32613	32613	her	84	" About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year ; not more than _ that _ . "
32520	32542	32517	32517	Elinor	84	" _ two _ thousand a year ! _ one _ is my wealth ! I guessed how it would end . "
32543	32557	32559	32559	Marianne	85	" And yet two thousand a - year is a very moderate income , "
32561	32606	32559	32559	Marianne	85	" A family can not well be maintained on a smaller . I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands . A proper establishment of servants , a carriage , perhaps two , and hunters , can not be supported on less . "
32625	32628	32630	32630	Edward	89	" Hunters ! "
32631	32645	32630	32630	Edward	89	" but why must you have hunters ? Every body does not hunt . "
32652	32658	32646	32646	Marianne	85	" But most people do . "
32659	32663	32665	32665	Margaret	86	" I wish , "
32673	32685	32665	32665	Margaret	86	" that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece ! "
32686	32692	32694	32694	Marianne	85	" Oh that they would ! "
32714	32726	32728	32728	Elinor	84	" We are all unanimous in that wish , I suppose , "
32730	32739	32728	32728	Elinor	84	" in spite of the insufficiency of wealth . "
32740	32744	32746	32746	Margaret	86	" Oh dear ! "
32748	32764	32746	32746	Margaret	86	" how happy I should be ! I wonder what I should do with it ! "
32777	32790	32792	32793	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself , "
32795	32808	32792	32793	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" if my children were all to be rich without my help . "
32809	32819	32821	32821	Elinor	84	" You must begin your improvements on this house , "
32823	32831	32821	32821	Elinor	84	" and your difficulties will soon vanish . "
32832	32844	32846	32846	Edward	89	" What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London , "
32848	32998	32846	32846	Edward	89	" in such an event ! What a happy day for booksellers , music - sellers , and print - shops ! You , Miss Dashwood , would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you and as for Marianne , I know her greatness of soul , there would not be music enough in London to content her . And books ! Thomson , Cowper , Scott she would buy them all over and over again : she would buy up every copy , I believe , to prevent their falling into unworthy hands ; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree . Should not you , Marianne ? Forgive me , if I am very saucy . But I was willing to show you that I had not forgot our old disputes . "
32999	33068	32792	32793	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" I love to be reminded of the past , Edward whether it be melancholy or gay , I love to recall it and you will never offend me by talking of former times . You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent some of it , at least my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books . "
33069	33089	32846	32846	Edward	89	" And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs . "
33090	33105	32792	32793	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" No , Edward , I should have something else to do with it . "
33106	33156	32846	32846	Edward	89	" Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ? "
33157	33187	32792	32793	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" Undoubtedly . At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed . It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them . "
33188	33199	33201	33201	Elinor	84	" Marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see , "
33203	33211	33201	33201	Elinor	84	" she is not at all altered . "
33212	33225	32792	32793	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" She is only grown a little more grave than she was . "
33226	33231	33233	33233	Marianne	85	" Nay , Edward , "
33235	33251	33233	33233	Marianne	85	" _ you _ need not reproach me . You are not very gay yourself . "
33252	33259	33261	33261	he	983	" Why should you think so ! "
33267	33280	33261	33261	he	983	" But gaiety never was a part of _ my _ character . "
33281	33293	33295	33295	Elinor	84	" Nor do I think it a part of Marianne s , "
33297	33334	33295	33295	Elinor	84	" I should hardly call her a lively girl she is very earnest , very eager in all she does sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation but she is not often really merry . "
33335	33342	33343	33343	he	983	" I believe you are right , "
33346	33360	33343	33343	he	983	" and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl . "
33361	33373	33375	33375	Elinor	84	" I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes , "
33377	33452	33375	33375	Elinor	84	" in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave , or ingenious or stupid than they really are , and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated . Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves , and very frequently by what other people say of them , without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge . "
33453	33463	33465	33465	Marianne	85	" But I thought it was right , Elinor , "
33467	33506	33465	33465	Marianne	85	" to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people . I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours . This has always been your doctrine , I am sure . "
33507	33587	33375	33375	Elinor	84	" No , Marianne , never . My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding . All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour . You must not confound my meaning . I am guilty , I confess , of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention ; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters ? "
33588	33606	33465	33465	Marianne	85	" You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility , "
33612	33619	33465	33465	Marianne	85	" Do you gain no ground ? "
33620	33625	33627	33627	Elinor	84	" Quite the contrary , "
33634	33638	33639	33639	he	89	" My judgment , "
33642	33726	33639	33639	he	89	" is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister s. I never wish to offend , but I am so foolishly shy , that I often seem negligent , when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness . I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company , I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility ! "
33727	33739	33741	33741	Elinor	84	" Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers , "
33743	33755	33757	33757	Edward	89	" She knows her own worth too well for false shame , "
33759	33796	33757	33757	Edward	89	" Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other . If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful , I should not be shy . "
33797	33805	33807	33807	Marianne	85	" But you would still be reserved , "
33809	33815	33807	33807	Marianne	85	" and that is worse . "
33818	33827	33757	33757	Edward	89	" Reserved ! Am I reserved , Marianne ? "
33828	33833	33757	33757	Edward	89	" Yes , very . "
33834	33841	33843	33843	he	89	" I do not understand you , "
33847	33868	33843	33843	he	89	" Reserved ! how , in what manner ? What am I to tell you ? What can you suppose ? "
33889	33930	33884	33884	she	84	" Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ? Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ? "
34129	34141	34143	34143	he	89	" I am going into the village to see my horses , "
34145	34162	34143	34143	he	89	" as you are not yet ready for breakfast ; I shall be back again presently . "
34266	34468	34260	34260	Edward	89	" You must not enquire too far , Marianne remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque , and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars . I shall call hills steep , which ought to be bold ; surfaces strange and uncouth , which ought to be irregular and rugged ; and distant objects out of sight , which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere . You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give . I call it a very fine country the hills are steep , the woods seem full of fine timber , and the valley looks comfortable and snug with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there . It exactly answers my idea of a fine country , because it unites beauty with utility and I dare say it is a picturesque one too , because you admire it ; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories , grey moss and brush wood , but these are all lost on me . I know nothing of the picturesque . "
34469	34479	34481	34481	Marianne	85	" I am afraid it is but too true , "
34483	34492	34481	34481	Marianne	85	" but why should you boast of it ? "
34493	34497	34499	34499	Elinor	84	" I suspect , "
34501	34569	34499	34499	Elinor	84	" that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another . Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses . He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own . "
34570	34576	34578	34578	Marianne	85	" It is very true , "
34580	34656	34578	34578	Marianne	85	" that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon . Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was . I detest jargon of every kind , and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself , because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning . "
34657	34662	34664	34664	Edward	89	" I am convinced , "
34666	34796	34664	34664	Edward	89	" that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel . But , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess . I like a fine prospect , but not on picturesque principles . I do not like crooked , twisted , blasted trees . I admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing . I do not like ruined , tattered cottages . I am not fond of nettles or thistles , or heath blossoms . I have more pleasure in a snug farm - house than a watch - tower and a troop of tidy , happy villagers please me better than the finest banditti in the world . "
34882	34894	34895	34895	she	85	" I never saw you wear a ring before , Edward , "
34898	34925	34895	34895	she	85	" Is that Fanny s hair ? I remember her promising to give you some . But I should have thought her hair had been darker . "
34974	34997	34959	34959	He	89	" Yes ; it is my sister s hair . The setting always casts a different shade on it , you know . "
35371	35383	35385	35385	he	94	" You _ must _ drink tea with us to night , "
35387	35411	35385	35385	he	94	" for we shall be quite alone and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us , for we shall be a large party . "
35418	35429	35431	35431	she	98	" And who knows but you may raise a dance , "
35433	35445	35431	35431	she	98	" And that will tempt _ you _ , Miss Marianne . "
35446	35450	35452	35452	Marianne	85	" A dance ! "
35454	35462	35452	35452	Marianne	85	" Impossible ! Who is to dance ? "
35463	35497	35431	35431	she	98	" Who ! why yourselves , and the Careys , and Whitakers to be sure . What ! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone ! "
35498	35506	35508	35509	Sir John	94	" I wish with all my soul , "
35511	35519	35508	35509	Sir John	94	" that Willoughby were among us again . "
35533	35539	35541	35541	he	89	" And who is Willoughby ? "
35617	35630	35604	35604	he	89	" I have been guessing . Shall I tell you my guess ? "
35631	35637	35604	35604	he	89	" What do you mean ? "
35638	35644	35604	35604	he	89	" Shall I tell you ? "
35645	35648	35604	35604	he	89	" Certainly . "
35649	35660	35604	35604	he	89	" Well then ; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts . "
35690	35715	35678	35678	his	89	" Oh , Edward ! How can you ? But the time will come I hope ... I am sure you will like him . "
35716	35723	35725	35725	he	89	" I do not doubt it , "
36305	36311	36313	36314	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" I think , Edward , "
36325	36404	36313	36314	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions . Some inconvenience to your friends , indeed , might result from it you would not be able to give them so much of your time . But ( with a smile ) you would be materially benefited in one particular at least you would know where to go when you left them . "
36405	36411	36412	36412	he	1022	" I do assure you , "
36415	36727	36412	36412	he	1022	" that I have long thought on this point , as you think now . It has been , and is , and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me , that I have had no necessary business to engage me , no profession to give me employment , or afford me any thing like independence . But unfortunately my own nicety , and the nicety of my friends , have made me what I am , an idle , helpless being . We never could agree in our choice of a profession . I always preferred the church , as I still do . But that was not smart enough for my family . They recommended the army . That was a great deal too smart for me . The law was allowed to be genteel enough ; many young men , who had chambers in the Temple , made a very good appearance in the first circles , and drove about town in very knowing gigs . But I had no inclination for the law , even in this less abstruse study of it , which my family approved . As for the navy , it had fashion on its side , but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it and , at length , as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all , as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one , idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable , and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing . I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since . "
36728	36740	36742	36743	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" The consequence of which , I suppose , will be , "
36745	36776	36742	36743	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" since leisure has not promoted your own happiness , that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits , employments , professions , and trades as Columella s. "
36777	36784	36786	36786	he	1023	" They will be brought up , "
36793	36816	36786	36786	he	1023	" to be as unlike myself as is possible . In feeling , in action , in condition , in every thing . "
36817	36954	36742	36743	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" Come , come ; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits , Edward . You are in a melancholy humour , and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy . But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times , whatever be their education or state . Know your own happiness . You want nothing but patience or give it a more fascinating name , call it hope . Your mother will secure to you , in time , that independence you are so anxious for ; it is her duty , and it will , it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent . How much may not a few months do ? "
36955	36959	36961	36961	Edward	89	" I think , "
36963	36977	36961	36961	Edward	89	" that I may defy many months to produce any good to me . "
37665	37668	37670	37670	he	94	" Well , "
37672	37686	37670	37670	he	94	" we have brought you some strangers . How do you like them ? "
37687	37695	37748	37748	she	84	" Hush ! they will hear you . "
37696	37729	37670	37670	he	94	" Never mind if they do . It is only the Palmers . Charlotte is very pretty , I can tell you . You may see her if you look this way . "
37754	37775	37748	37748	she	84	" Where is Marianne ? Has she run away because we are come ? I see her instrument is open . "
37776	37784	37748	37748	she	84	" She is walking , I believe . "
37820	37946	37813	37813	She	98	" How do you do , my dear ? How does Mrs. Dashwood do ? And where are your sisters ? What ! all alone ! you will be glad of a little company to sit with you . I have brought my other son and daughter to see you . Only think of their coming so suddenly ! I thought I heard a carriage last night , while we were drinking our tea , but it never entered my head that it could be them . I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again "
38241	38327	38201	38202	Mrs. Palmer	120	" Well ! what a delightful room this is ! I never saw anything so charming ! Only think , Mama , how it is improved since I was here last ! I always thought it such a sweet place , ma am ! ( turning to Mrs. Dashwood ) but you have made it so charming ! Only look , sister , how delightful every thing is ! How I should like such a house for myself ! Should not you , Mr. Palmer ? "
38346	38354	38356	38356	she	120	" Mr. Palmer does not hear me , "
38360	38371	38356	38356	she	120	" he never does sometimes . It is so ridiculous ! "
38479	38492	38494	38495	Mrs. Jennings	98	" You may believe how glad we all were to see them , "
38531	38618	38521	38521	they	1061	" but , however , I can t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation . I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning , but she would come with us ; she longed so much to see you all ! "
38633	38642	38644	38645	Mrs. Jennings	98	" She expects to be confined in February , "
38674	38681	38682	38682	he	121	" No , none at all , "
38689	38694	38696	38697	Sir John	94	" Here comes Marianne , "
38699	38712	38696	38697	Sir John	94	" Now , Palmer , you shall see a monstrous pretty girl . "
38813	38852	38787	38787	his	121	" Oh ! dear , how beautiful these are ! Well ! how delightful ! Do but look , mama , how sweet ! I declare they are quite charming ; I could look at them for ever . "
38900	38909	38911	38912	his wife	245	" My love , have you been asleep ? "
39123	39130	39132	39132	Marianne	85	" Why should they ask us ? "
39141	39183	39132	39132	Marianne	85	" The rent of this cottage is said to be low ; but we have it on very hard terms , if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them , or with us . "
39184	39198	39200	39200	Elinor	84	" They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now , "
39202	39245	39200	39200	Elinor	84	" by these frequent invitations , than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago . The alteration is not in them , if their parties are grown tedious and dull . We must look for the change elsewhere . "
39306	39315	39317	39317	she	120	" I am so glad to see you ! "
39326	39447	39317	39317	she	120	" for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come , which would be a shocking thing , as we go away again tomorrow . We must go , for the Westons come to us next week you know . It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all , and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door , and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton . He is so droll ! He never tells me any thing ! I am so sorry we can not stay longer ; however we shall meet again in town very soon , I hope . "
39460	39466	39468	39469	Mrs. Palmer	120	" Not go to town ! "
39475	39544	39468	39469	Mrs. Palmer	120	" I shall be quite disappointed if you do not . I could get the nicest house in the world for you , next door to ours , in Hanover - square . You must come , indeed . I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined , if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public . "
39558	39564	39566	39567	Mrs. Palmer	120	" Oh , my love , "
39578	39595	39566	39567	Mrs. Palmer	120	" you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter . "
39616	39623	39625	39625	he	282	" How horrid all this is ! "
39627	39694	39625	39625	he	282	" Such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting . Dullness is as much produced within doors as without , by rain . It makes one detest all one s acquaintance . What the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house ? How few people know what comfort is ! Sir John is as stupid as the weather . "
39704	39712	39714	39715	Sir John	94	" I am afraid , Miss Marianne , "
39717	39732	39714	39715	Sir John	94	" you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today . "
39741	39752	39754	39755	Mrs. Palmer	120	" Oh , don t be so sly before us , "
39757	39810	39754	39755	Mrs. Palmer	120	" for we know all about it , I assure you ; and I admire your taste very much , for I think he is extremely handsome . We do not live a great way from him in the country , you know . Not above ten miles , I dare say . "
39811	39816	39818	39819	her husband	282	" Much nearer thirty , "
39821	39849	39754	39755	Mrs. Palmer	120	" Ah , well ! there is not much difference . I never was at his house ; but they say it is a sweet pretty place . "
39850	39863	39865	39866	Mr. Palmer	121	" As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life , "
39884	39890	39892	39893	Mrs. Palmer	120	" Is it very ugly ? "
39894	39909	39892	39893	Mrs. Palmer	120	" then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose . "
39932	39936	39938	39938	he	121	" My dear , "
39943	39968	39938	39938	he	121	" it is very provoking that we should be so few . Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today ? "
39969	40001	39925	39925	they	1092	" Did not I tell you , Sir John , when you spoke to me about it before , that it could not be done ? They dined with us last . "
40002	40010	40012	40013	Mrs. Jennings	98	" You and I , Sir John , "
40015	40023	40012	40013	Mrs. Jennings	98	" should not stand upon such ceremony . "
40024	40034	40036	40037	Mr. Palmer	121	" Then you would be very ill - bred , "
40039	40047	40052	40052	her	245	" My love you contradict every body , "
40056	40066	40052	40052	her	245	" Do you know that you are quite rude ? "
40067	40084	40012	40013	Mrs. Jennings	98	" I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill - bred . "
40085	40096	40098	40103	the good - natured old lady	1096	" Ay , you may abuse me as you please , "
40105	40132	40098	40103	the good - natured old lady	1096	" you have taken Charlotte off my hands , and can not give her back again . So there I have the whip hand of you . "
40222	40229	40231	40231	she	119	" Mr. Palmer is so droll ! "
40240	40248	40231	40231	she	119	" He is always out of humour . "
40422	40430	40432	40433	Mrs. Palmer	120	" Oh , my dear Miss Dashwood , "
40437	40497	40432	40433	Mrs. Palmer	120	" I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister . Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas ? Now , pray do , and come while the Westons are with us . You can not think how happy I shall be ! It will be quite delightful ! My love , "
40503	40517	40432	40433	Mrs. Palmer	120	" don t you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland ? "
40518	40521	40522	40522	he	282	" Certainly , "
40528	40538	40432	40433	Mrs. Palmer	120	" I came into Devonshire with no other view . "
40539	40543	40545	40546	his lady	560	" There now , "
40548	40564	40545	40546	his lady	560	" you see Mr. Palmer expects you ; so you can not refuse to come . "
40574	40683	40545	40546	his lady	560	" But indeed you must and shall come . I am sure you will like it of all things . The Westons will be with us , and it will be quite delightful . You can not think what a sweet place Cleveland is ; and we are so gay now , for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election ; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before , it is quite charming ! But , poor fellow ! it is very fatiguing to him ! for he is forced to make every body like him . "
40701	40708	40710	40710	Charlotte	119	" How charming it will be , "
40712	40771	40710	40710	Charlotte	119	" when he is in Parliament ! won t it ? How I shall laugh ! It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M.P. But do you know , he says , he will never frank for me ? He declares he won t. Don t you , Mr. Palmer ? "
40780	40790	40791	40791	she	84	" He can not bear writing , you know , "
40793	40801	40791	40791	she	84	" he says it is quite shocking . "
40802	40805	40807	40807	he	121	" No , "
40809	40829	40807	40807	he	121	" I never said any thing so irrational . Don t palm all your abuses of language upon me . "
40830	40879	40791	40791	she	84	" There now ; you see how droll he is . This is always the way with him ! Sometimes he won t speak to me for half a day together , and then he comes out with something so droll all about any thing in the world . "
40906	40909	40911	40911	Elinor	84	" Certainly , "
40913	40919	40911	40911	Elinor	84	" he seems very agreeable . "
40920	40984	40898	40898	she	84	" Well I am so glad you do . I thought you would , he is so pleasant ; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you , and you can t think how disappointed he will be if you don t come to Cleveland . I can t imagine why you should object to it . "
41098	41110	41112	41113	Mrs. Palmer	120	" Oh dear , yes ; I know him extremely well , "
41115	41289	41112	41113	Mrs. Palmer	120	" Not that I ever spoke to him , indeed ; but I have seen him for ever in town . Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was at Allenham . Mama saw him here once before ; but I was with my uncle at Weymouth . However , I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire , if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together . He is very little at Combe , I believe ; but if he were ever so much there , I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him , for he is in the opposition , you know , and besides it is such a way off . I know why you inquire about him , very well ; your sister is to marry him . I am monstrous glad of it , for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know . "
41290	41295	41297	41297	Elinor	84	" Upon my word , "
41299	41322	41297	41297	Elinor	84	" you know much more of the matter than I do , if you have any reason to expect such a match . "
41323	41355	41112	41113	Mrs. Palmer	120	" Don t pretend to deny it , because you know it is what every body talks of . I assure you I heard of it in my way through town . "
41356	41362	41297	41297	Elinor	84	" My dear Mrs. Palmer ! "
41363	41395	41112	41113	Mrs. Palmer	120	" Upon my honour I did . I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in Bond - street , just before we left town , and he told me of it directly . "
41396	41448	41297	41297	Elinor	84	" You surprise me very much . Colonel Brandon tell you of it ! Surely you must be mistaken . To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do . "
41449	41574	41112	41113	Mrs. Palmer	120	" But I do assure you it was so , for all that , and I will tell you how it happened . When we met him , he turned back and walked with us ; and so we began talking of my brother and sister , and one thing and another , and I said to him , So , Colonel , there is a new family come to Barton cottage , I hear , and mama sends me word they are very pretty , and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna . Is it true , pray ? for of course you must know , as you have been in Devonshire so lately . "
41575	41583	41297	41297	Elinor	84	" And what did the Colonel say ? "
41584	41631	41112	41113	Mrs. Palmer	120	" Oh he did not say much ; but he looked as if he knew it to be true , so from that moment I set it down as certain . It will be quite delightful , I declare ! When is it to take place ? "
41632	41641	41297	41297	Elinor	84	" Mr. Brandon was very well I hope ? "
41642	41667	41112	41113	Mrs. Palmer	120	" Oh ! yes , quite well ; and so full of your praises , he did nothing but say fine things of you . "
41668	41689	41297	41297	Elinor	84	" I am flattered by his commendation . He seems an excellent man ; and I think him uncommonly pleasing . "
41690	41752	41112	41113	Mrs. Palmer	120	" So do I. He is such a charming man , that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull . Mama says _ he _ was in love with your sister too . I assure you it was a great compliment if he was , for he hardly ever falls in love with any body . "
41753	41765	41767	41767	Elinor	84	" Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire ? "
41769	41921	41937	41937	his	101	" Oh ! yes , extremely well ; that is , I do not believe many people are acquainted with him , because Combe Magna is so far off ; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you . Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes , and so you may tell your sister . She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her . However , I don t think her hardly at all handsomer than you , I assure you ; for I think you both excessively pretty , and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure , though we could not get him to own it last night . "
41948	41960	41962	41962	Charlotte	119	" I am so glad we are got acquainted at last , "
41964	42046	41962	41962	Charlotte	119	" And now I hope we shall always be great friends . You can t think how much I longed to see you ! It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage ! Nothing can be like it , to be sure ! And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married ! I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna . It is a sweet place , by all accounts . "
42047	42061	41946	41946	her	120	" You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon , have not you ? "
42062	42087	42088	42088	she	1114	" Yes , a great while ; ever since my sister married . He was a particular friend of Sir John s. I believe , "
42095	42152	42088	42088	she	1114	" he would have been very glad to have had me , if he could . Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much . But mama did not think the match good enough for me , otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel , and we should have been married immediately . "
42153	42181	41946	41946	her	120	" Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John s proposal to your mother before it was made ? Had he never owned his affection to yourself ? "
42182	42245	42088	42088	she	1114	" Oh , no ; but if mama had not objected to it , I dare say he would have liked it of all things . He had not seen me then above twice , for it was before I left school . However , I am much happier as I am . Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like . "
42824	42829	42831	42831	he	94	" Do come now , "
42832	42994	42831	42831	he	94	" pray come you must come I declare you shall come You can t think how you will like them . Lucy is monstrous pretty , and so good humoured and agreeable ! The children are all hanging about her already , as if she was an old acquaintance . And they both long to see you of all things , for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world ; and I have told them it is all very true , and a great deal more . You will be delighted with them I am sure . They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children . How can you be so cross as not to come ? Why they are your cousins , you know , after a fashion . _ You _ are my cousins , and they are my wife s , so you must be related . "
43438	43446	43448	43448	she	95	" John is in such spirits today ! "
43465	43473	43493	43493	she	95	" He is full of monkey tricks . "
43497	43503	43493	43493	she	95	" How playful William is ! "
43504	43513	43514	43514	she	95	" And here is my sweet little Annamaria , "
43539	43557	43514	43514	she	95	" And she is always so gentle and quiet Never was there such a quiet little thing ! "
43861	43866	43868	43869	Miss Steele	128	" Poor little creatures ! "
43878	43888	43868	43869	Miss Steele	128	" It might have been a very sad accident . "
43889	43896	43898	43898	Marianne	85	" Yet I hardly know how , "
43900	43931	43898	43898	Marianne	85	" unless it had been under totally different circumstances . But this is the usual way of heightening alarm , where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality . "
43932	43941	43943	43944	Lucy Steele	128	" What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is ! "
44015	44021	44023	44025	the elder sister	1184	" And Sir John too , "
44027	44035	44023	44025	the elder sister	1184	" what a charming man he is ! "
44068	44107	44060	44060	he	1185	" And what a charming little family they have ! I never saw such fine children in my life . I declare I quite doat upon them already , and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children . "
44108	44114	44116	44116	Elinor	84	" I should guess so , "
44122	44131	44116	44116	Elinor	84	" from what I have witnessed this morning . "
44132	44138	44140	44140	Lucy	128	" I have a notion , "
44142	44199	44140	44140	Lucy	128	" you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged ; perhaps they may be the outside of enough ; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton ; and for my part , I love to see children full of life and spirits ; I can not bear them if they are tame and quiet . "
44200	44204	44206	44206	Elinor	84	" I confess , "
44208	44229	44206	44206	Elinor	84	" that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence . "
44260	44281	44242	44243	Miss Steele	128	" And how do you like Devonshire , Miss Dashwood ? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex . "
44310	44322	44324	44325	Miss Steele	128	" Norland is a prodigious beautiful place , is not it ? "
44327	44337	44339	44339	Lucy	128	" We have heard Sir John admire it excessively , "
44355	44366	44368	44368	Elinor	84	" I think every one _ must _ admire it , "
44370	44395	44368	44368	Elinor	84	" who ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do . "
44396	44434	44352	44353	her sister	301	" And had you a great many smart beaux there ? I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world ; for my part , I think they are a vast addition always . "
44435	44442	44444	44444	Lucy	128	" But why should you think , "
44452	44467	44444	44444	Lucy	128	" that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex ? "
44468	44666	44352	44353	her sister	301	" Nay , my dear , I m sure I don t pretend to say that there an t. I m sure there s a vast many smart beaux in Exeter ; but you know , how could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland ; and I was only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton , if they had not so many as they used to have . But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux , and had as lief be without them as with them . For my part , I think they are vastly agreeable , provided they dress smart and behave civil . But I can t bear to see them dirty and nasty . Now there s Mr. Rose at Exeter , a prodigious smart young man , quite a beau , clerk to Mr. Simpson , you know , and yet if you do but meet him of a morning , he is not fit to be seen . I suppose your brother was quite a beau , Miss Dashwood , before he married , as he was so rich ? "
44667	44672	44674	44674	Elinor	84	" Upon my word , "
44676	44726	44674	44674	Elinor	84	" I can not tell you , for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word . But this I can say , that if he ever was a beau before he married , he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him . "
44727	44748	44352	44353	her sister	301	" Oh ! dear ! one never thinks of married men s being beaux they have something else to do . "
44749	44754	44756	44757	her sister	301	" Lord ! Anne , "
44759	44780	44756	44757	her sister	301	" you can talk of nothing but beaux ; you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else . "
45134	45150	45152	45152	she	84	" Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure , "
45154	45192	45152	45152	she	84	" and I hear he is quite a beau , and prodigious handsome . And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon , but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already . "
45409	45415	45417	45417	he	94	" His name is Ferrars , "
45425	45440	45417	45417	he	94	" but pray do not tell it , for it s a great secret . "
45441	45444	45446	45447	Miss Steele	128	" Ferrars ! "
45449	45489	45446	45447	Miss Steele	128	" Mr. Ferrars is the happy man , is he ? What ! your sister - in - law s brother , Miss Dashwood ? a very agreeable young man to be sure ; I know him very well . "
45490	45499	45501	45501	Lucy	128	" How can you say so , Anne ? "
45515	45542	45501	45501	Lucy	128	" Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle s , it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well . "
45552	45569	45543	45543	Elinor	84	" And who was this uncle ? Where did he live ? How came they acquainted ? "
46024	46038	46040	46040	Lucy	128	" You will think my question an odd one , I dare say , "
46057	46078	46040	46040	Lucy	128	" but pray , are you personally acquainted with your sister - in - law s mother , Mrs. Ferrars ? "
46108	46111	46113	46113	Lucy	93	" Indeed ! "
46115	46150	46113	46113	Lucy	93	" I wonder at that , for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes . Then , perhaps , you can not tell me what sort of a woman she is ? "
46151	46154	46156	46156	Elinor	84	" No , "
46180	46187	46113	46113	Lucy	93	" I know nothing of her . "
46188	46207	46209	46209	Lucy	93	" I am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way , "
46218	46252	46209	46209	Lucy	93	" but perhaps there may be reasons I wish I might venture ; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent . "
46289	46397	46275	46275	Lucy	93	" I can not bear to have you think me impertinently curious . I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours . And I am sure I should not have the smallest fear of trusting _ you ; _ indeed , I should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable situation as I am ; but , however , there is no occasion to trouble _ you _ . I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars . "
46398	46408	46410	46410	Elinor	84	" I am sorry I do _ not _ , "
46416	46468	46410	46410	Elinor	84	" if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her . But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family , and therefore I am a little surprised , I confess , at so serious an inquiry into her character . "
46469	46538	46543	46543	she	1220	" I dare say you are , and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it . But if I dared tell you all , you would not be so much surprised . Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present but the time _ may _ come how soon it will come must depend upon herself when we may be very intimately connected . "
46565	46569	46571	46571	Elinor	84	" Good heavens ! "
46573	46591	46571	46571	Elinor	84	" what do you mean ? Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars ? Can you be ? "
46611	46614	46616	46616	Lucy	93	" No , "
46618	46636	46638	46638	her	93	" not to Mr. _ Robert _ Ferrars I never saw him in my life ; but , "
46643	46649	46638	46638	her	93	" to his eldest brother . "
46727	46734	46736	46736	Lucy	93	" You may well be surprised , "
46738	46913	46914	46914	She	1223	" for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before ; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family ; because it was always meant to be a great secret , and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour . Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne , and I never should have mentioned it to you , if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy ; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars must seem so odd , that it ought to be explained . And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased , when he knows I have trusted you , because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family , and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters . "
46968	46980	46952	46952	she	84	" May I ask if your engagement is of long standing ? "
46981	46990	46952	46952	she	84	" We have been engaged these four years . "
46991	46995	46952	46952	she	84	" Four years ! "
46996	46999	46952	46952	she	84	" Yes . "
47013	47019	47021	47021	she	84	" I did not know , "
47023	47034	47021	47021	she	84	" that you were even acquainted till the other day . "
47035	47062	46952	46952	she	84	" Our acquaintance , however , is of many years date . He was under my uncle s care , you know , a considerable while . "
47063	47067	47021	47021	she	84	" Your uncle ! "
47068	47084	46952	46952	she	84	" Yes ; Mr. Pratt . Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt ? "
47085	47091	47093	47093	Elinor	84	" I think I have , "
47109	47259	46952	46952	she	84	" He was four years with my uncle , who lives at Longstaple , near Plymouth . It was there our acquaintance begun , for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle , and it was there our engagement was formed , though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil ; but he was almost always with us afterwards . I was very unwilling to enter into it , as you may imagine , without the knowledge and approbation of his mother ; but I was too young , and loved him too well , to be so prudent as I ought to have been . Though you do not know him so well as me , Miss Dashwood , you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him . "
47260	47263	47265	47265	Elinor	84	" Certainly , "
47298	47345	47280	47280	she	84	" Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars ! I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me , that really I beg your pardon ; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name . We can not mean the same Mr. Ferrars . "
47346	47353	47355	47355	Lucy	93	" We can mean no other , "
47359	47420	47355	47355	Lucy	93	" Mr. Edward Ferrars , the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars , of Park Street , and brother of your sister - in - law , Mrs. John Dashwood , is the person I mean ; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends . "
47421	47426	47428	47428	Elinor	84	" It is strange , "
47436	47449	47428	47428	Elinor	84	" that I should never have heard him even mention your name . "
47450	47530	47355	47355	Lucy	93	" No ; considering our situation , it was not strange . Our first care has been to keep the matter secret . You knew nothing of me , or my family , and , therefore , there could be no _ occasion _ for ever mentioning my name to you ; and , as he was always particularly afraid of his sister s suspecting any thing , _ that _ was reason enough for his not mentioning it . "
47551	47559	47561	47561	she	84	" Four years you have been engaged , "
47567	47593	47603	47603	she	84	" Yes ; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait . Poor Edward ! It puts him quite out of heart . "
47606	47662	47603	47603	she	84	" To prevent the possibility of mistake , be so good as to look at this face . It does not do him justice , to be sure , but yet I think you can not be deceived as to the person it was drew for . I have had it above these three years . "
47726	47733	47735	47735	Lucy	93	" I have never been able , "
47737	47778	47735	47735	Lucy	93	" to give him my picture in return , which I am very much vexed at , for he has been always so anxious to get it ! But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity . "
47779	47787	47789	47789	Elinor	84	" You are quite in the right , "
47805	47810	47812	47812	she	84	" I am sure , "
47814	47877	47812	47812	she	84	" I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say . I shall have no fortune , and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman . "
47878	47887	47889	47889	Elinor	84	" I certainly did not seek your confidence , "
47891	47949	47889	47889	Elinor	84	" but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on . Your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication . You must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety . "
47991	48007	48009	48009	she	84	" I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you , "
48011	48274	48009	48009	she	84	" in telling you all this . I have not known you long to be sure , personally at least , but I have known you and all your family by description a great while ; and as soon as I saw you , I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance . Besides in the present case , I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward s mother ; and I am so unfortunate , that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask . Anne is the only person that knows of it , and she has no judgment at all ; indeed , she does me a great deal more harm than good , for I am in constant fear of her betraying me . She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t other day , when Edward s name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all . You can t think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether . I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward s sake these last four years . Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty ; and seeing him so seldom we can hardly meet above twice a - year . I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke . "
48290	48293	48295	48295	Lucy	93	" Sometimes . "
48302	48321	48295	48295	Lucy	93	" I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely . "
48334	48418	48327	48327	she	1225	" But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it . I can not bear the thoughts of making him so miserable , as I know the very mention of such a thing would do . And on my own account too so dear as he is to me I don t think I could be equal to it . What would you advise me to do in such a case , Miss Dashwood ? What would you do yourself ? "
48419	48423	48425	48425	Elinor	84	" Pardon me , "
48432	48451	48425	48425	Elinor	84	" but I can give you no advice under such circumstances . Your own judgment must direct you . "
48452	48457	48459	48459	Lucy	93	" To be sure , "
48470	48533	48459	48459	Lucy	93	" his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor Edward is so cast down by it ! Did you not think him dreadful low - spirited when he was at Barton ? He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple , to go to you , that I was afraid you would think him quite ill . "
48534	48550	48425	48425	Elinor	84	" Did he come from your uncle s , then , when he visited us ? "
48551	48574	48459	48459	Lucy	93	" Oh , yes ; he had been staying a fortnight with us . Did you think he came directly from town ? "
48575	48578	48580	48580	Elinor	84	" No , "
48596	48616	48617	48617	She	93	" I remember he told us , that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth . "
48648	48659	48661	48661	Lucy	93	" Did not you think him sadly out of spirits ? "
48663	48676	48617	48617	She	93	" We did , indeed , particularly so when he first arrived . "
48677	48752	48757	48757	her	93	" I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter ; but it made him so melancholy , not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us , and seeing me so much affected . Poor fellow ! I am afraid it is just the same with him now ; for he writes in wretched spirits . I heard from him just before I left Exeter ; "
48767	48815	48757	48757	her	93	" You know his hand , I dare say , a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual . He was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible . "
48932	48938	48940	48940	Lucy	93	" Writing to each other , "
48949	49046	48940	48940	Lucy	93	" is the only comfort we have in such long separations . Yes , _ I _ have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even _ that _ . If he had but my picture , he says he should be easy . I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture . Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him ? "
49047	49051	49053	49053	Elinor	84	" I did , "
51103	51108	51110	51111	Lady Middleton	95	" I am glad , "
51115	51173	51110	51111	Lady Middleton	95	" you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria s basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight . And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to - morrow , and then I hope she will not much mind it . "
51186	51256	51179	51179	Lucy	128	" Indeed you are very much mistaken , Lady Middleton ; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me , or I should have been at my filigree already . I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world : and if you want me at the card - table now , I am resolved to finish the basket after supper . "
51257	51321	51360	51361	Lady Middleton	95	" You are very good , I hope it won t hurt your eyes will you ring the bell for some working candles ? My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed , I know , if the basket was not finished tomorrow , for though I told her it certainly would not , I am sure she depends upon having it done . "
51393	51430	51377	51377	Marianne	85	" Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse _ me _ you know I detest cards . I shall go to the piano - forte ; I have not touched it since it was tuned . "
51465	51480	51482	51482	Elinor	84	" Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know , ma am , "
51491	51515	51482	51482	Elinor	84	" and I do not much wonder at it ; for it is the very best toned piano - forte I ever heard . "
51526	51529	51531	51531	Elinor	84	" Perhaps , "
51533	51608	51531	51531	Elinor	84	" if I should happen to cut out , I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele , in rolling her papers for her ; and there is so much still to be done to the basket , that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly , to finish it this evening . I should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it . "
51609	51623	51625	51625	Lucy	128	" Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help , "
51627	51659	51625	51625	Lucy	128	" for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was ; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all . "
51660	51670	51672	51673	Miss Steele	128	" Oh ! that would be terrible , indeed , "
51675	51686	51672	51673	Miss Steele	128	" Dear little soul , how I do love her ! "
51687	51693	51695	51696	Lady Middleton	95	" You are very kind , "
51700	51732	51695	51696	Lady Middleton	95	" and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ? "
51897	51939	51893	51893	Elinor	84	" I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with , if I felt no desire for its continuance , or no farther curiosity on its subject . I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again . "
51940	51944	51946	51946	Lucy	128	" Thank you , "
51949	51984	51946	51946	Lucy	128	" for breaking the ice ; you have set my heart at ease by it ; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday . "
51985	51998	52000	52000	Elinor	84	" Offended me ! How could you suppose so ? Believe me , "
52008	52042	52000	52000	Elinor	84	" nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea . Could you have a motive for the trust , that was not honourable and flattering to me ? "
52043	52051	52053	52053	Lucy	128	" And yet I do assure you , "
52063	52182	52053	52053	Lucy	128	" there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable . I felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs . But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy , and that you really do not blame me . If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life , your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure . "
52183	52267	52000	52000	Elinor	84	" Indeed , I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you , to acknowledge your situation to me , and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it . Your case is a very unfortunate one ; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties , and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them . Mr. Ferrars , I believe , is entirely dependent on his mother . "
52268	52399	52053	52053	Lucy	128	" He has only two thousand pounds of his own ; it would be madness to marry upon that , though for my own part , I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh . I have been always used to a very small income , and could struggle with any poverty for him ; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him , perhaps , of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her . We must wait , it may be for many years . With almost every other man in the world , it would be an alarming prospect ; but Edward s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know . "
52400	52459	52000	52000	Elinor	84	" That conviction must be every thing to you ; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your s. If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed , as between many people , and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years engagement , your situation would have been pitiable , indeed . "
52485	52492	52494	52494	Lucy	128	" Edward s love for me , "
52496	52559	52494	52494	Lucy	128	" has been pretty well put to the test , by our long , very long absence since we were first engaged , and it has stood the trial so well , that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now . I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment s alarm on that account from the first . "
52576	52717	52572	52572	Lucy	128	" I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature , and from our different situations in life , from his being so much more in the world than me , and our continual separation , I was enough inclined for suspicion , to have found out the truth in an instant , if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met , or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for , or if he had talked more of one lady than another , or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be . I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick - sighted in general , but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived . "
52718	52722	52724	52724	Elinor	84	" All this , "
52726	52740	52724	52724	Elinor	84	" is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us . "
52741	52745	52747	52747	she	1274	" But what , "
52753	52823	52747	52747	she	1274	" are your views ? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars s death , which is a melancholy and shocking extremity ? Is her son determined to submit to this , and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you , rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth ? "
52824	52889	52724	52724	Elinor	84	" If we could be certain that it would be only for a while ! But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to Robert , and the idea of that , for Edward s sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures . "
52890	52907	52747	52747	she	1274	" And for your own sake too , or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason . "
52918	52926	52928	52928	Elinor	84	" Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars ? "
52930	52954	52724	52724	Elinor	84	" Not at all I never saw him ; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother silly and a great coxcomb . "
52955	52960	52962	52963	Miss Steele	128	" A great coxcomb ! "
52980	52995	52962	52963	Miss Steele	128	" Oh , they are talking of their favourite beaux , I dare say . "
52996	53000	53002	53002	Lucy	128	" No sister , "
53004	53020	53002	53002	Lucy	128	" you are mistaken there , our favourite beaux are _ not _ great coxcombs . "
53021	53034	53036	53037	Mrs. Jennings	98	" I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood s is not , "
53042	53083	53036	53037	Mrs. Jennings	98	" for he is one of the modestest , prettiest behaved young men I ever saw ; but as for Lucy , she is such a sly little creature , there is no finding out who _ she _ likes . "
53084	53087	53089	53090	Miss Steele	128	" Oh , "
53098	53116	53089	53090	Miss Steele	128	" I dare say Lucy s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood s. "
53174	53339	53442	53442	Lucy	128	" I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned . I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession ; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can , and then through your interest , which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him , and I hope out of some regard to me , your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living ; which I understand is a very good one , and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while . That would be enough for us to marry upon , and we might trust to time and chance for the rest . "
53340	53347	53349	53349	Elinor	84	" I should always be happy , "
53351	53400	53349	53349	Elinor	84	" to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ? He is brother to Mrs. John Dashwood _ that _ must be recommendation enough to her husband . "
53401	53417	53442	53442	Lucy	128	" But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward s going into orders . "
53418	53431	53349	53349	Elinor	84	" Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little . "
53449	53514	53442	53442	Lucy	128	" I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement . We seem so beset with difficulties on every side , that though it would make us miserable for a time , we should be happier perhaps in the end . But you will not give me your advice , Miss Dashwood ? "
53515	53518	53520	53520	Elinor	84	" No , "
53532	53566	53520	53520	Elinor	84	" on such a subject I certainly will not . You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes . "
53567	53573	53575	53575	Lucy	128	" Indeed you wrong me , "
53581	53650	53575	53575	Lucy	128	" I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you , I should resolve upon doing it immediately . "
53665	53709	53651	53651	Elinor	84	" This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one . It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person . "
53710	53719	53721	53721	Lucy	128	" Tis because you are an indifferent person , "
53736	53772	53721	53721	Lucy	128	" that your judgment might justly have such weight with me . If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings , your opinion would not be worth having . "
53833	53845	53847	53847	she	128	" Shall you be in town this winter , Miss Dashwood ? "
53854	53858	53847	53847	she	128	" Certainly not . "
53859	53866	53868	53869	the other	738	" I am sorry for that , "
53879	53919	53872	53872	her	738	" it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there ! But I dare say you will go for all that . To be sure , your brother and sister will ask you to come to them . "
53920	53936	53847	53847	she	128	" It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do . "
53937	54012	53872	53872	her	738	" How unlucky that is ! I had quite depended upon meeting you there . Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years ! But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward . He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it . "
54559	54780	54555	54555	her	98	" Oh , Lord ! I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I _ do _ beg you will favour me with your company , for I ve quite set my heart upon it . Don t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me , for I shan t put myself at all out of my way for you . It will only be sending Betty by the coach , and I hope I can afford _ that _ . We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise ; and when we are in town , if you do not like to go wherever I do , well and good , you may always go with one of my daughters . I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I don t get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault . I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men , you may depend upon it . "
54781	54787	54789	54790	Sir John	94	" I have a notion , "
54792	54865	54789	54790	Sir John	94	" that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme , if her elder sister would come into it . It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure , because Miss Dashwood does not wish it . So I would advise you two , to set off for town , when you are tired of Barton , without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it . "
54866	54869	54871	54872	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Nay , "
54874	55022	54871	54872	Mrs. Jennings	98	" I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne s company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my odd ways behind my back . But one or the other , if not both of them , I must have . Lord bless me ! how do you think I can live poking by myself , I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me . Come , Miss Marianne , let us strike hands upon the bargain , and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye , why so much the better . "
55023	55035	55037	55037	Marianne	85	" I thank you , ma am , sincerely thank you , "
55042	55135	55037	55037	Marianne	85	" your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever , and it would give me such happiness , yes , almost the greatest happiness I am capable of , to be able to accept it . But my mother , my dearest , kindest mother , I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged , and if she were to be made less happy , less comfortable by our absence Oh ! no , nothing should tempt me to leave her . It should not , must not be a struggle . "
55476	55484	55485	55485	she	83	" I am delighted with the plan , "
55488	55674	55485	55485	she	83	" it is exactly what I could wish . Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves . When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music ! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again ! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one . It is very right that you _ should _ go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London . You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman , of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt . And in all probability you will see your brother , and whatever may be his faults , or the faults of his wife , when I consider whose son he is , I can not bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other . "
55675	55685	55687	55687	Elinor	84	" Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness , "
55689	55723	55687	55687	Elinor	84	" you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you , there is still one objection which , in my opinion , can not be so easily removed . "
55729	55733	55735	55736	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" And what , "
55738	55771	55735	55736	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest ? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward ? Do not let me hear a word about the expense of it . "
55772	55809	55724	55724	Marianne	85	" My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings s heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence . "
55810	55816	55818	55819	her mother	296	" That is very true , "
55821	55855	55818	55819	her mother	296	" but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton . "
55856	55869	55871	55871	Marianne	85	" If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings , "
55873	55910	55871	55871	Marianne	85	" at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation . I have no such scruples , and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort . "
56049	56059	56061	56062	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" I will have you _ both _ go , "
56064	56128	56061	56062	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" these objections are nonsensical . You will have much pleasure in being in London , and especially in being together ; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment , she would foresee it there from a variety of sources ; she would , perhaps , expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister - in - law s family . "
56193	56239	56190	56190	she	84	" I like Edward Ferrars very much , and shall always be glad to see him ; but as to the rest of the family , it is a matter of perfect indifference to me , whether I am ever known to them or not . "
57304	57314	57316	57316	Elinor	84	" _ I _ am writing home , Marianne , "
57318	57332	57316	57316	Elinor	84	" had not you better defer your letter for a day or two ? "
57333	57346	57348	57348	Marianne	85	" I am _ not _ going to write to my mother , "
57734	57747	57728	57728	she	85	" Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is ! "
57872	57878	57880	57880	he	101	" Is your sister ill ? "
58062	58065	58066	58066	he	101	" Yes , "
58073	58104	58066	58066	he	101	" almost ever since ; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to Barton . "
58170	58175	58177	58177	she	84	" Oh ! Colonel , "
58185	58299	58177	58177	she	84	" I am monstrous glad to see you sorry I could not come before beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with . Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner ! But pray , Colonel , how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today ? "
58300	58319	58177	58177	she	84	" I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer s , where I have been dining . "
58320	58355	58177	58177	she	84	" Oh , you did ; well , and how do they all do at their house ? How does Charlotte do ? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time . "
58356	58381	58177	58177	she	84	" Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well , and I am commissioned to tell you , that you will certainly see her to - morrow . "
58382	58558	58177	58177	she	84	" Ay , to be sure , I thought as much . Well , Colonel , I have brought two young ladies with me , you see that is , you see but one of them now , but there is another somewhere . Your friend , Miss Marianne , too which you will not be sorry to hear . I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby will do between you about her . Ay , it is a fine thing to be young and handsome . Well ! I was young once , but I never was very handsome worse luck for me . However , I got a very good husband , and I don t know what the greatest beauty can do more . Ah ! poor man ! he has been dead these eight years and better . But Colonel , where have you been to since we parted ? And how does your business go on ? Come , come , let s have no secrets among friends . "
58781	58792	58794	58794	she	1373	" Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you , "
58796	58826	58794	58794	she	1373	" What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mama ? I forget what it was now , but it was something so droll ! "
59131	59145	59147	59147	she	84	" Has no letter been left here for me since we went out ? "
59165	59173	59174	59174	she	84	" Are you quite sure of it ? "
59177	59194	59174	59174	she	84	" Are you certain that no servant , no porter has left any letter or note ? "
59202	59207	59209	59209	she	84	" How very odd ! "
59226	59232	59234	59234	Elinor	84	" How odd , indeed ! "
59244	59348	59234	59234	Elinor	84	" If she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him , as she did ; she would have written to Combe Magna ; and if he is in town , how odd that he should neither come nor write ! Oh ! my dear mother , you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young , a man so little known , to be carried on in so doubtful , so mysterious a manner ! _ I _ long to inquire ; and how will _ my _ interference be borne . "
59564	59573	59575	59576	Mrs. Jennings	98	" If this open weather holds much longer , "
59587	59632	59575	59576	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week ; tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day s pleasure . Poor souls ! I always pity them when they do ; they seem to take it so much to heart . "
59633	59638	59640	59640	Marianne	85	" That is true , "
59661	59681	59640	59640	Marianne	85	" I had not thought of _ that _ . This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country . "
59697	59708	59709	59709	she	84	" It is charming weather for _ them _ indeed , "
59725	59734	59709	59709	she	84	" How much they must enjoy it ! But "
59743	59813	59709	59709	she	84	" it can not be expected to last long . At this time of the year , and after such a series of rain , we shall certainly have very little more of it . Frosts will soon set in , and in all probability with severity . In another day or two perhaps ; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer nay , perhaps it may freeze tonight ! "
59814	59819	59821	59821	Elinor	84	" At any rate , "
59840	59861	59837	59837	she	84	" I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week . "
59862	59882	59830	59830	her	84	" Ay , my dear , I ll warrant you we do . Mary always has her own way . "
59883	59887	59890	59890	Elinor	84	" And now , "
59892	59904	59890	59890	Elinor	84	" she will write to Combe by this day s post . "
60046	60115	60116	60116	Elinor	84	" Don t you find it colder than it was in the morning , Elinor ? There seems to me a very decided difference . I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff . It was not so yesterday , I think . The clouds seem parting too , the sun will be out in a moment , and we shall have a clear afternoon . "
60427	60431	60433	60433	Marianne	85	" Good God ! "
60435	60445	60446	60446	Elinor	84	" he has been here while we were out . "
60463	60474	60481	60481	her	84	" Depend upon it , he will call again tomorrow . "
60625	60629	60631	60631	Marianne	85	" For me ! "
60637	60647	60631	60631	Marianne	85	" No , ma am , for my mistress . "
60659	60670	60631	60631	Marianne	85	" It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings ; how provoking ! "
60671	60680	60682	60682	Elinor	84	" You are expecting a letter , then ? "
60690	60698	60631	60631	Marianne	85	" Yes , a little not much . "
60704	60714	60631	60631	Marianne	85	" You have no confidence in me , Marianne . "
60715	60734	60631	60631	Marianne	85	" Nay , Elinor , this reproach from _ you _ you who have confidence in no one ! "
60735	60738	60740	60740	Elinor	84	" Me ! "
60745	60756	60740	60740	Elinor	84	" indeed , Marianne , I have nothing to tell . "
60757	60761	60763	60763	Marianne	85	" Nor I , "
60767	60800	60763	60763	Marianne	85	" our situations then are alike . We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing . "
61302	61311	61313	61313	he	121	" I thought you were both in Devonshire , "
61315	61319	61321	61321	Elinor	84	" Did you ? "
61323	61331	61289	61289	himself	99	" When do you go back again ? "
61332	61338	61342	61342	their	1431	" I do not know . "
61383	61388	61390	61391	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Aye , aye , "
61393	61449	61390	61391	Mrs. Jennings	98	" we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited . "
61450	61453	61455	61455	Marianne	85	" Invited ! "
61457	61479	61480	61480	Marianne	85	" So my daughter Middleton told me , for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning . "
61813	61822	61833	61833	he	99	" your sister looks unwell to - day , "
61824	61832	61833	61833	he	99	" your sister seems out of spirits , "
61928	61941	61920	61920	He	99	" your sister s engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known . "
61942	61950	61952	61952	Elinor	84	" It can not be generally known , "
61954	61964	61952	61952	Elinor	84	" for her own family do not know it . "
61971	62008	61965	61965	He	99	" I beg your pardon , I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent ; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended , as they openly correspond , and their marriage is universally talked of . "
62009	62024	61920	61920	He	99	" How can that be ? By whom can you have heard it mentioned ? "
62025	62223	61965	61965	He	99	" By many by some of whom you know nothing , by others with whom you are most intimate , Mrs. Jennings , Mrs. Palmer , and the Middletons . But still I might not have believed it , for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced , it will always find something to support its doubts , if I had not , when the servant let me in today , accidentally seen a letter in his hand , directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister s writing . I came to inquire , but I was convinced before I could ask the question . Is every thing finally settled ? Is it impossible to ? But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding . Excuse me , Miss Dashwood . I believe I have been wrong in saying so much , but I hardly know what to do , and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence . Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on , that any attempt , that in short concealment , if concealment be possible , is all that remains . "
62459	62479	62447	62447	his	101	" to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her , "
63006	63010	63011	63011	she	1466	" Good heavens ! "
63014	63039	63011	63011	she	1466	" he is there he is there Oh ! why does he not look at me ? why can not I speak to him ? "
63040	63047	63049	63049	Elinor	84	" Pray , pray be composed , "
63051	63072	63049	63049	Elinor	84	" and do not betray what you feel to every body present . Perhaps he has not observed you yet . "
63247	63275	63236	63236	she	1466	" Good God ! Willoughby , what is the meaning of this ? Have you not received my letters ? Will you not shake hands with me ? "
63335	63377	63330	63330	he	101	" I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday , and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home . My card was not lost , I hope . "
63378	63387	63389	63389	Marianne	85	" But have you not received my notes ? "
63395	63432	63389	63389	Marianne	85	" Here is some mistake I am sure some dreadful mistake . What can be the meaning of it ? Tell me , Willoughby ; for heaven s sake tell me , what is the matter ? "
63484	63511	63475	63475	he	101	" Yes , I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town , which you were so good as to send me , "
63569	63576	63577	63577	she	85	" Go to him , Elinor , "
63587	63639	63577	63577	she	85	" and force him to come to me . Tell him I must see him again must speak to him instantly . I can not rest I shall not have a moment s peace till this is explained some dreadful misapprehension or other . Oh , go to him this moment . "
63640	63670	63681	63681	herself	85	" How can that be done ? No , my dearest Marianne , you must wait . This is not the place for explanations . Wait only till tomorrow . "
64346	64353	64326	64326	her	85	" Marianne , may I ask ? "
64354	64359	64360	64360	she	85	" No , Elinor , "
64363	64373	64360	64360	she	85	" ask nothing ; you will soon know all . "
64848	64940	64845	64845	she	84	" Upon my word , I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life ! _ My _ girls were nothing to her , and yet they used to be foolish enough ; but as for Miss Marianne , she is quite an altered creature . I hope , from the bottom of my heart , he won t keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn . Pray , when are they to be married ? "
64974	65054	64955	64955	herself	84	" And have you really , Ma am , talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister s being engaged to Mr. Willoughby ? I thought it had been only a joke , but so serious a question seems to imply more ; and I must beg , therefore , that you will not deceive yourself any longer . I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married . "
65055	65200	64955	64955	herself	84	" For shame , for shame , Miss Dashwood ! how can you talk so ? Don t we all know that it must be a match , that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met ? Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day , and all day long ; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes ? Come , come , this won t do . Because you are so sly about it yourself , you think nobody else has any senses ; but it is no such thing , I can tell you , for it has been known all over town this ever so long . I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte . "
65201	65207	65209	65209	Elinor	84	" Indeed , Ma am , "
65214	65248	65209	65209	Elinor	84	" you are mistaken . Indeed , you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report , and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now . "
65462	65467	65765	65765	she	79	" Bond Street , January .
65472	65721	65468	65468	MY	9	" I have just had the honour of receiving your letter , for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments . I am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation ; and though I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you , I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional . I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure , and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions . My esteem for your whole family is very sincere ; but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt , or meant to express , I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem . That I should ever have meant more you will allow to be impossible , when you understand that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere , and it will not be many weeks , I believe , before this engagement is fulfilled . It is with great regret that I obey your commands in returning the letters with which I have been honoured from you , and the lock of hair , which you so obligingly bestowed on me .
65722	65729	65730	65730	Your	1501	" I am , dear Madam , "
65733	65737	65738	65739	JOHN WILLOUGHBY	144	" humble servant , "
65741	65741	65738	65739	JOHN WILLOUGHBY	144	"
66339	66349	66323	66323	she	301	" Poor Elinor ! how unhappy I make you ! "
66350	66355	66357	66358	her sister	301	" I only wish , "
66360	66379	66357	66358	her sister	301	" there were any thing I _ could _ do , which might be of comfort to you . "
66408	66419	66421	66421	her	85	" Oh ! Elinor , I am miserable , indeed , "
66442	66449	66450	66450	she	301	" Exert yourself , dear Marianne , "
66453	66489	66450	66450	she	301	" if you would not kill yourself and all who love you . Think of your mother ; think of her misery while _ you _ suffer : for her sake you must exert yourself . "
66490	66499	66501	66501	Marianne	85	" I can not , I can not , "
66503	66568	66501	66501	Marianne	85	" leave me , leave me , if I distress you ; leave me , hate me , forget me ! but do not torture me so . Oh ! how easy for those , who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion ! Happy , happy Elinor , _ you _ can not have an idea of what I suffer . "
66569	66602	66450	66450	she	301	" Do you call _ me _ happy , Marianne ? Ah ! if you knew ! And can you believe me to be so , while I see you so wretched ! "
66603	66610	66612	66612	her	1513	" Forgive me , forgive me , "
66620	66661	66612	66612	her	1513	" I know you feel for me ; I know what a heart you have ; but yet you are you must be happy ; Edward loves you what , oh what , can do away such happiness as that ? "
66662	66668	66670	66670	Elinor	84	" Many , many circumstances , "
66674	66681	66683	66683	Marianne	85	" No , no , no , "
66686	66703	66683	66683	Marianne	85	" he loves you , and only you . You _ can _ have no grief . "
66704	66718	66612	66612	her	1513	" I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state . "
66719	66738	66683	66683	Marianne	85	" And you will never see me otherwise . Mine is a misery which nothing can do away . "
66739	66840	66612	66612	her	1513	" You must not talk so , Marianne . Have you no comforts ? no friends ? Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation ? Much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it . Every additional day of unhappy confidence , on your side , would have made the blow more dreadful . "
66841	66844	66846	66846	Marianne	85	" Engagement ! "
66848	66855	66846	66846	Marianne	85	" there has been no engagement . "
66856	66860	66612	66612	her	1513	" No engagement ! "
66861	66882	66846	66846	Marianne	85	" No , he is not so unworthy as you believe him . He has broken no faith with me . "
66883	66893	66612	66612	her	1513	" But he told you that he loved you . "
66894	66923	66846	66846	Marianne	85	" Yes no never absolutely . It was every day implied , but never professedly declared . Sometimes I thought it had been , but it never was . "
66924	66931	66612	66612	her	1513	" Yet you wrote to him ? "
66932	66951	66846	66846	Marianne	85	" Yes : could that be wrong after all that had passed ? But I can not talk . "
67009	67100	67104	67104	Her	301	" How surprised you will be , Willoughby , on receiving this ; and I think you will feel something more than surprise , when you know that I am in town . An opportunity of coming hither , though with Mrs. Jennings , was a temptation we could not resist . I wish you may receive this in time to come here to - night , but I will not depend on it . At any rate I shall expect you to - morrow . For the present , adieu .
67101	67103	66988	66988	her	84	" M.D. "
67127	67302	67104	67104	Her	301	" I can not express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday , nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week ago . I have been expecting to hear from you , and still more to see you , every hour of the day . Pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain . You had better come earlier another time , because we are generally out by one . We were last night at Lady Middleton s , where there was a dance . I have been told that you were asked to be of the party . But could it be so ? You must be very much altered indeed since we parted , if that could be the case , and you not there . But I will not suppose this possible , and I hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise .
67303	67305	67104	67104	Her	301	" M.D. "
67317	67600	67104	67104	Her	301	" What am I to imagine , Willoughby , by your behaviour last night ? Again I demand an explanation of it . I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced , with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared to me to justify . I was repulsed indeed ! I have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting ; but though I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour , I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it . You have perhaps been misinformed , or purposely deceived , in something concerning me , which may have lowered me in your opinion . Tell me what it is , explain the grounds on which you acted , and I shall be satisfied , in being able to satisfy you . It would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you ; but if I am to do it , if I am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you , that your regard for us all was insincere , that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive , let it be told as soon as possible . My feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision ; I wish to acquit you , but certainty on either side will be ease to what I now suffer . If your sentiments are no longer what they were , you will return my notes , and the lock of my hair which is in your possession .
67601	67603	67313	67313	him	1520	" M.D. "
67716	67721	67722	67722	she	84	" I felt myself , "
67725	67747	67722	67722	she	84	" to be as solemnly engaged to him , as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other . "
67748	67754	67756	67756	Elinor	84	" I can believe it , "
67758	67768	67756	67756	Elinor	84	" but unfortunately he did not feel the same . "
67769	67914	67934	67934	she	1523	" He _ did _ feel the same , Elinor for weeks and weeks he felt it . I know he did . Whatever may have changed him now , ( and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it ) , I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish . This lock of hair , which now he can so readily give up , was begged of me with the most earnest supplication . Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment ! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton ? The morning that we parted too ! When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again his distress can I ever forget his distress ? "
67942	67956	67934	67934	she	1523	" Elinor , I have been cruelly used ; but not by Willoughby . "
67957	67973	67934	67934	she	1523	" Dearest Marianne , who but himself ? By whom can he have been instigated ? "
67974	68079	67934	67934	she	1523	" By all the world , rather than by his own heart . I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion , than believe his nature capable of such cruelty . This woman of whom he writes whoever she be or any one , in short , but your own dear self , mama , and Edward , may have been so barbarous to bely me . Beyond you three , is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby , whose heart I know so well ? "
68089	68141	68080	68080	Elinor	84	" Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy , let them be cheated of their malignant triumph , my dear sister , by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits . It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence . "
68142	68147	68149	68149	Marianne	145	" No , no , "
68151	68232	68149	68149	Marianne	145	" misery such as mine has no pride . I care not who knows that I am wretched . The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world . Elinor , Elinor , they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like may resist insult , or return mortification but I can not . I must feel I must be wretched and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can . "
68233	68242	68080	68080	Elinor	84	" But for my mother s sake and mine "
68243	68269	68149	68149	Marianne	145	" I would do more than for my own . But to appear happy when I am so miserable Oh ! who can require it ? "
68350	68464	68758	68758	she	1525	" It is too much ! Oh , Willoughby , Willoughby , could this be yours ! Cruel , cruel nothing can acquit you . Elinor , nothing can . Whatever he might have heard against me ought he not to have suspended his belief ? ought he not to have told me of it , to have given me the power of clearing myself ? The lock of hair , ( repeating it from the letter , ) which you so obligingly bestowed on me That is unpardonable . Willoughby , where was your heart when you wrote those words ? Oh , barbarously insolent ! Elinor , can he be justified ? "
68465	68475	68324	68324	her	145	" No , Marianne , in no possible way . "
68476	68546	68758	68758	she	1525	" And yet this woman who knows what her art may have been ? how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her ! Who is she ? Who can she be ? Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance ? Oh ! no one , no one he talked to me only of myself . "
68561	68585	68758	68758	she	1525	" Elinor , I must go home . I must go and comfort mama . Can not we be gone to - morrow ? "
68586	68593	68758	68758	she	1525	" To - morrow , Marianne ! "
68594	68621	68758	68758	she	1525	" Yes , why should I stay here ? I came only for Willoughby s sake and now who cares for me ? Who regards me ? "
68622	68657	68758	68758	she	1525	" It would be impossible to go to - morrow . We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility ; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that . "
68658	68725	68758	68758	she	1525	" Well then , another day or two , perhaps ; but I can not stay here long , I can not stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people . The Middletons and Palmers how am I to bear their pity ? The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton ! Oh , what would _ he _ say to that ! "
68875	68883	68885	68885	she	98	" How do you do my dear ? "
68905	69179	68885	68885	she	98	" How is she , Miss Dashwood ? Poor thing ! she looks very bad . No wonder . Ay , it is but too true . He is to be married very soon a good - for - nothing fellow ! I have no patience with him . Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago , and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself , else I am sure I should not have believed it ; and I was almost ready to sink as it was . Well , said I , all I can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out . And so I shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it . I have no notion of men s going on in this way ; and if ever I meet him again , I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day . But there is one comfort , my dear Miss Marianne ; he is not the only young man in the world worth having ; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers . Well , poor thing ! I won t disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with . The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know , and that will amuse her . "
69231	69255	69256	69256	Elinor	84	" no , she would go down ; she could bear it very well , and the bustle about her would be less . "
69647	69651	69653	69654	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Poor soul ! "
69663	69778	69653	69654	Mrs. Jennings	98	" how it grieves me to see her ! And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine ! And the dried cherries too ! Lord ! nothing seems to do her any good . I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like , I would send all over the town for it . Well , it is the oddest thing to me , that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill ! But when there is plenty of money on one side , and next to none on the other , Lord bless you ! they care no more about such things ! "
69779	69794	69636	69636	she	84	" The lady then Miss Grey I think you called her is very rich ? "
69795	70020	69653	69654	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Fifty thousand pounds , my dear . Did you ever see her ? a smart , stylish girl they say , but not handsome . I remember her aunt very well , Biddy Henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man . But the family are all rich together . Fifty thousand pounds ! and by all accounts , it won t come before it s wanted ; for they say he is all to pieces . No wonder ! dashing about with his curricle and hunters ! Well , it don t signify talking ; but when a young man , be who he will , comes and makes love to a pretty girl , and promises marriage , he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor , and a richer girl is ready to have him . Why don t he , in such a case , sell his horses , let his house , turn off his servants , and make a thorough reform at once ? I warrant you , Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round . But that won t do now - a - days ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age . "
70021	70041	69636	69636	she	84	" Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is ? Is she said to be amiable ? "
70042	70103	69653	69654	Mrs. Jennings	98	" I never heard any harm of her ; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned ; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning , that one day Miss Walker hinted to her , that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married , for she and Mrs. Ellison could never agree . "
70104	70111	69636	69636	she	84	" And who are the Ellisons ? "
70112	70142	69653	69654	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Her guardians , my dear . But now she is of age and may choose for herself ; and a pretty choice she has made ! What now , "
70147	70233	69653	69654	Mrs. Jennings	98	" your poor sister is gone to her own room , I suppose , to moan by herself . Is there nothing one can get to comfort her ? Poor dear , it seems quite cruel to let her be alone . Well , by - and - by we shall have a few friends , and that will amuse her a little . What shall we play at ? She hates whist I know ; but is there no round game she cares for ? "
70234	70281	69653	69654	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Dear ma am , this kindness is quite unnecessary . Marianne , I dare say , will not leave her room again this evening . I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed , for I am sure she wants rest . "
70282	70467	69653	69654	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Aye , I believe that will be best for her . Let her name her own supper , and go to bed . Lord ! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two , for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that . And so the letter that came today finished it ! Poor soul ! I am sure if I had had a notion of it , I would not have joked her about it for all my money . But then you know , how should I guess such a thing ? I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter , and you know young people like to be laughed at about them . Lord ! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it ! If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street in my way home , and told them of it . But I shall see them tomorrow . "
70468	70563	69653	69654	Mrs. Jennings	98	" It would be unnecessary I am sure , for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister . Their own good - nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present ; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject , the more my feelings will be spared , as you my dear madam will easily believe . "
70564	70688	69653	69654	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Oh ! Lord ! yes , that I do indeed . It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of ; and as for your sister , I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world . You saw I did not all dinner time . No more would Sir John , nor my daughters , for they are all very thoughtful and considerate ; especially if I give them a hint , as I certainly will . For my part , I think the less that is said about such things , the better , the sooner tis blown over and forgot . And what good does talking ever do you know ? "
70689	70759	69653	69654	Mrs. Jennings	98	" In this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation . I must do _ this _ justice to Mr. Willoughby he has broken no positive engagement with my sister . "
70760	70799	69653	69654	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Law , my dear ! Don t pretend to defend him . No positive engagement indeed ! after taking her all over Allenham House , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter ! "
70870	71257	70857	70858	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Well , my dear , tis a true saying about an ill - wind , for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon . He will have her at last ; aye , that he will . Mind me , now , if they an t married by Mid - summer . Lord ! how he ll chuckle over this news ! I hope he will come tonight . It will be all to one a better match for your sister . Two thousand a year without debt or drawback except the little love - child , indeed ; aye , I had forgot her ; but she may be prenticed out at a small cost , and then what does it signify ? Delaford is a nice place , I can tell you ; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place , full of comforts and conveniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit - trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner ! Lord ! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there ! Then , there is a dove - cote , some delightful stew - ponds , and a very pretty canal ; and every thing , in short , that one could wish for ; and , moreover , it is close to the church , and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike - road , so tis never dull , for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house , you may see all the carriages that pass along . Oh ! tis a nice place ! A butcher hard by in the village , and the parsonage - house within a stone s throw . To my fancy , a thousand times prettier than Barton Park , where they are forced to send three miles for their meat , and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother . Well , I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can . One shoulder of mutton , you know , drives another down . If we _ can _ but put Willoughby out of her head ! "
71258	71272	71274	71274	Elinor	84	" Ay , if we can do _ that _ , Ma am , "
71276	71288	71274	71274	Elinor	84	" we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon . "
71340	71347	71353	71354	her sister	301	" You had better leave me , "
71359	71365	71367	71367	Elinor	84	" I will leave you , "
71369	71377	71367	71367	Elinor	84	" if you will go to bed . "
71476	71480	71482	71482	she	98	" My dear , "
71486	71565	71482	71482	she	98	" I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted , so I have brought a glass of it for your sister . My poor husband ! how fond he was of it ! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout , he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world . Do take it to your sister . "
71566	71571	71573	71573	Elinor	84	" Dear Ma am , "
71588	71641	71573	71573	Elinor	84	" how good you are ! But I have just left Marianne in bed , and , I hope , almost asleep ; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest , if you will give me leave , I will drink the wine myself . "
71800	71824	71783	71783	she	98	" The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see . He knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear . "
71854	71860	71862	71862	she	84	" Marianne is not well , "
71864	71882	71862	71862	she	84	" She has been indisposed all day , and we have persuaded her to go to bed . "
71883	71888	71889	71889	he	99	" Perhaps , then , "
71893	71916	71889	71889	he	99	" what I heard this morning may be there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first . "
71917	71923	71851	71852	her sister	301	" What did you hear ? "
71924	71973	71889	71889	he	99	" That a gentleman , whom I had reason to think in short , that a man , whom I _ knew _ to be engaged but how shall I tell you ? If you know it already , as surely you must , I may be spared . "
71974	71978	71980	71980	Elinor	84	" You mean , "
71986	72037	71980	71980	Elinor	84	" Mr. Willoughby s marriage with Miss Grey . Yes , we _ do _ know it all . This seems to have been a day of general elucidation , for this very morning first unfolded it to us . Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable ! Where did you hear it ? "
72038	72255	71889	71889	he	99	" In a stationer s shop in Pall Mall , where I had business . Two ladies were waiting for their carriage , and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match , in a voice so little attempting concealment , that it was impossible for me not to hear all . The name of Willoughby , John Willoughby , frequently repeated , first caught my attention ; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey it was no longer to be a secret it would take place even within a few weeks , with many particulars of preparations and other matters . One thing , especially , I remember , because it served to identify the man still more : as soon as the ceremony was over , they were to go to Combe Magna , his seat in Somersetshire . My astonishment ! but it would be impossible to describe what I felt . The communicative lady I learnt , on inquiry , for I stayed in the shop till they were gone , was a Mrs. Ellison , and that , as I have been since informed , is the name of Miss Grey s guardian . "
72256	72287	71980	71980	Elinor	84	" It is . But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds ? In that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation . "
72288	72302	72303	72303	he	1554	" It may be so ; but Willoughby is capable at least I think "
72319	72326	72303	72303	he	1554	" And your sister how did she "
72327	72412	71980	71980	Elinor	84	" Her sufferings have been very severe . I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short . It has been , it is a most cruel affliction . Till yesterday , I believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps but _ I _ am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her . He has been very deceitful ! and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him . "
72413	72416	72418	72419	Colonel Brandon	99	" Ah ! "
72421	72446	72418	72419	Colonel Brandon	99	" there is , indeed ! But your sister does not I think you said so she does not consider quite as you do ? "
72447	72467	72303	72303	he	1554	" You know her disposition , and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could . "
72789	72801	72802	72802	she	84	" No , no , no , it can not be , "
72805	72843	72802	72802	she	84	" she can not feel . Her kindness is not sympathy ; her good - nature is not tenderness . All that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because I supply it . "
73058	73077	73051	73051	she	98	" Now , my dear , I bring you something that I am sure will do you good . "
73662	73668	73670	73670	Elinor	84	" Who can this be ? "
73672	73686	73670	73670	Elinor	84	" So early too ! I thought we _ had _ been safe . "
73693	73699	73701	73701	she	85	" It is Colonel Brandon ! "
73706	73716	73701	73701	she	85	" We are never safe from _ him _ . "
73717	73731	73776	73776	her	85	" He will not come in , as Mrs. Jennings is from home . "
73732	73742	73745	73745	her	85	" I will not trust to _ that _ , "
73749	73772	73745	73745	her	85	" A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others . "
73847	73856	73858	73858	he	99	" I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street , "
73865	74022	74023	74023	He	1583	" and she encouraged me to come on ; and I was the more easily encouraged , because I thought it probable that I might find you alone , which I was very desirous of doing . My object my wish my sole wish in desiring it I hope , I believe it is is to be a means of giving comfort ; no , I must not say comfort not present comfort but conviction , lasting conviction to your sister s mind . My regard for her , for yourself , for your mother will you allow me to prove it , by relating some circumstances which nothing but a _ very _ sincere regard nothing but an earnest desire of being useful I think I am justified though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right , is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong ? "
74026	74031	74033	74033	Elinor	84	" I understand you , "
74035	74105	74033	74033	Elinor	84	" You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby , that will open his character farther . Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown Marianne . _ My _ gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end , and _ hers _ must be gained by it in time . Pray , pray let me hear it . "
74106	74183	73858	73858	he	99	" You shall ; and , to be brief , when I quitted Barton last October , but this will give you no idea I must go farther back . You will find me a very awkward narrator , Miss Dashwood ; I hardly know where to begin . A short account of myself , I believe , will be necessary , and it _ shall _ be a short one . On such a subject , "
74187	74197	73858	73858	he	99	" can I have little temptation to be diffuse . "
74215	74278	73858	73858	he	99	" You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation ( it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you ) a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park it was the evening of a dance in which I alluded to a lady I had once known , as resembling , in some measure , your sister Marianne . "
74279	74282	74284	74284	Elinor	84	" Indeed , "
74286	74295	74284	74284	Elinor	84	" I have _ not _ forgotten it . "
74306	74916	74917	74917	he	1585	" If I am not deceived by the uncertainty , the partiality of tender recollection , there is a very strong resemblance between them , as well in mind as person . The same warmth of heart , the same eagerness of fancy and spirits . This lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father . Our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends . I can not remember the time when I did not love Eliza ; and my affection for her , as we grew up , was such , as perhaps , judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity , you might think me incapable of having ever felt . Hers , for me , was , I believe , fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was , though from a different cause , no less unfortunate . At seventeen she was lost to me for ever . She was married married against her inclination to my brother . Her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered . And this , I fear , is all that can be said for the conduct of one , who was at once her uncle and guardian . My brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her . I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty , and for some time it did ; but at last the misery of her situation , for she experienced great unkindness , overcame all her resolution , and though she had promised me that nothing but how blindly I relate ! I have never told you how this was brought on . We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland . The treachery , or the folly , of my cousin s maid betrayed us . I was banished to the house of a relation far distant , and she was allowed no liberty , no society , no amusement , till my father s point was gained . I had depended on her fortitude too far , and the blow was a severe one but had her marriage been happy , so young as I then was , a few months must have reconciled me to it , or at least I should not have now to lament it . This however was not the case . My brother had no regard for her ; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been , and from the first he treated her unkindly . The consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon s , was but too natural . She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation ; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned . But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ? Had I remained in England , perhaps but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange . The shock which her marriage had given me , "
74927	74969	74917	74917	he	1585	" was of trifling weight was nothing to what I felt when I heard , about two years afterwards , of her divorce . It was _ that _ which threw this gloom , even now the recollection of what I suffered "
75044	75427	75008	75008	her	84	" It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned to England . My first care , when I _ did _ arrive , was of course to seek for her ; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy . I could not trace her beyond her first seducer , and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin . Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person . He imagined , and calmly could he imagine it , that her extravagance , and consequent distress , had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief . At last , however , and after I had been six months in England , I _ did _ find her . Regard for a former servant of my own , who had since fallen into misfortune , carried me to visit him in a spunging - house , where he was confined for debt ; and there , in the same house , under a similar confinement , was my unfortunate sister . So altered so faded worn down by acute suffering of every kind ! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom I had once doted . What I endured in so beholding her but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it I have pained you too much already . That she was , to all appearance , in the last stage of a consumption , was yes , in such a situation it was my greatest comfort . Life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given . I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life : I was with her in her last moments . "
75455	75467	75469	75469	he	1587	" Your sister , I hope , can not be offended , "
75471	76057	75469	75469	he	1587	" by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation . Their fates , their fortunes , can not be the same ; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind , or a happier marriage , she might have been all that you will live to see the other be . But to what does all this lead ? I seem to have been distressing you for nothing . Ah ! Miss Dashwood a subject such as this untouched for fourteen years it is dangerous to handle it at all ! I _ will _ be more collected more concise . She left to my care her only child , a little girl , the offspring of her first guilty connection , who was then about three years old . She loved the child , and had always kept it with her . It was a valued , a precious trust to me ; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense , by watching over her education myself , had the nature of our situations allowed it ; but I had no family , no home ; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school . I saw her there whenever I could , and after the death of my brother , ( which happened about five years ago , and which left to me the possession of the family property , ) she visited me at Delaford . I called her a distant relation ; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her . It is now three years ago ( she had just reached her fourteenth year , ) that I removed her from school , to place her under the care of a very respectable woman , residing in Dorsetshire , who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life ; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation . But last February , almost a twelvemonth back , she suddenly disappeared . I had allowed her , ( imprudently , as it has since turned out , ) at her earnest desire , to go to Bath with one of her young friends , who was attending her father there for his health . I knew him to be a very good sort of man , and I thought well of his daughter better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill - judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all . He , her father , a well - meaning , but not a quick - sighted man , could really , I believe , give no information ; for he had been generally confined to the house , while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose ; and he tried to convince me , as thoroughly as he was convinced himself , of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business . In short , I could learn nothing but that she was gone ; all the rest , for eight long months , was left to conjecture . What I thought , what I feared , may be imagined ; and what I suffered too . "
76058	76062	76064	76064	Elinor	84	" Good heavens ! "
76066	76073	76064	76064	Elinor	84	" could it be could Willoughby ! "
76074	76084	76085	76085	he	1589	" The first news that reached me of her , "
76088	76306	76085	76085	he	1589	" came in a letter from herself , last October . It was forwarded to me from Delaford , and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell ; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly , which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body , and which I believe gave offence to some . Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine , I suppose , when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party , that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable ; but _ had _ he known it , what would it have availed ? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister ? No , he had already done that , which no man who _ can _ feel for another would do . He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced , in a situation of the utmost distress , with no creditable home , no help , no friends , ignorant of his address ! He had left her , promising to return ; he neither returned , nor wrote , nor relieved her . "
76307	76314	76316	76316	Elinor	84	" This is beyond every thing ! "
76318	76734	76085	76085	he	1589	" His character is now before you ; expensive , dissipated , and worse than both . Knowing all this , as I have now known it many weeks , guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever , and on being assured that she was to marry him : guess what I must have felt for all your sakes . When I came to you last week and found you alone , I came determined to know the truth ; though irresolute what to do when it _ was _ known . My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it . To suffer you all to be so deceived ; to see your sister but what could I do ? I had no hope of interfering with success ; and sometimes I thought your sister s influence might yet reclaim him . But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her . Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless _ will _ turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self - reproach , which must attend her through life . Surely this comparison must have its use with her . She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing . They proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace . On the contrary , every friend must be made still more her friend by them . Concern for her unhappiness , and respect for her fortitude under it , must strengthen every attachment . Use your own discretion , however , in communicating to her what I have told you . You must know best what will be its effect ; but had I not seriously , and from my heart believed it might be of service , might lessen her regrets , I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions , with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others . "
76766	76773	76775	76775	she	84	" I have been more pained , "
76777	76829	76830	76830	she	84	" by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do . Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier . Have you , "
76838	76850	76830	76830	she	84	" ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton ? "
76851	76854	76855	76855	he	1590	" Yes , "
76859	76869	76855	76855	he	1590	" once I have . One meeting was unavoidable . "
76884	76892	76830	76830	she	84	" What ? have you met him to "
76893	76962	76979	76979	she	84	" I could meet him no other way . Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct . We returned unwounded , and the meeting , therefore , never got abroad . "
76986	76989	76991	76992	Colonel Brandon	99	" Such , "
76998	77021	76991	76992	Colonel Brandon	99	" has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter ! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust ! "
77022	77029	76979	76979	she	84	" Is she still in town ? "
77030	77067	76991	76992	Colonel Brandon	99	" No ; as soon as she recovered from her lying - in , for I found her near her delivery , I removed her and her child into the country , and there she remains . "
78163	78298	78153	78154	Sir John	94	" A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well ! Such a good - natured fellow ! He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England ! It was an unaccountable business . He wished him at the devil with all his heart . He would not speak another word to him , meet him where he might , for all the world ! No , not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert , and they were kept watching for two hours together . Such a scoundrel of a fellow ! such a deceitful dog ! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly s puppies ! and this was the end of it ! "
78310	78401	78299	78300	Mrs. Palmer	120	" She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all . She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland ; but it did not signify , for it was a great deal too far off to visit ; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again , and she should tell everybody she saw , how good - for - nothing he was . "
78628	78636	78602	78603	Lady Middleton	95	" It is very shocking , indeed ! "
79326	79344	79346	79346	she	84	" I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here _ still _ , "
79357	79476	79346	79346	she	84	" But I always thought I _ should _ . I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile ; though you _ told _ me , you know , at Barton , that you should not stay above a _ month _ . But I thought , at the time , that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point . It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came . And now to be sure you will be in no _ hurry _ to be gone . I am amazingly glad you did not keep to _ your word _ . "
79503	79509	79511	79512	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Well , my dear , "
79514	79521	79511	79512	Mrs. Jennings	98	" and how did you travel ? "
79522	79532	79534	79535	Miss Steele	128	" Not in the stage , I assure you , "
79541	79597	79534	79535	Miss Steele	128	" we came post all the way , and had a very smart beau to attend us . Dr. Davies was coming to town , and so we thought we d join him in a post - chaise ; and he behaved very genteelly , and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did . "
79598	79603	79605	79606	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Oh , oh ! "
79608	79626	79605	79606	Mrs. Jennings	98	" very pretty , indeed ! and the Doctor is a single man , I warrant you . "
79627	79631	79633	79634	Miss Steele	128	" There now , "
79639	79737	79633	79634	Miss Steele	128	" everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor , and I can not think why . My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest ; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour s end to another . Lord ! here comes your beau , Nancy , my cousin said t other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house . My beau , indeed ! said I I can not think who you mean . The Doctor is no beau of mine . "
79738	79762	79804	79804	she	1647	" Aye , aye , that is very pretty talking but it won t do the Doctor is the man , I see . "
79763	79768	79770	79771	her cousin	1648	" No , indeed ! "
79777	79794	79770	79771	her cousin	1648	" and I beg you will contradict it , if you ever hear it talked of . "
79819	79842	79844	79844	Lucy	128	" I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister , Miss Dashwood , when they come to town , "
79859	79869	79770	79771	her cousin	1648	" No , I do not think we shall . "
79870	79881	79804	79804	she	1647	" Oh , yes , I dare say you will . "
79891	79912	79804	79804	she	1647	" What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together ! "
79913	79920	79922	79923	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Long a time , indeed ! "
79925	79935	79922	79923	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Why , their visit is but just begun ! "
79940	79954	79956	79957	Miss Steele	128	" I am sorry we can not see your sister , Miss Dashwood , "
79959	79967	79956	79957	Miss Steele	128	" I am sorry she is not well "
79978	80021	79956	79957	Miss Steele	128	" You are very good . My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head - aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation . "
80022	80062	79956	79957	Miss Steele	128	" Oh , dear , that is a great pity ! but such old friends as Lucy and me ! I think she might see _ us ; _ and I am sure we would not speak a word . "
80098	80106	80108	80109	Miss Steele	128	" Oh , if that s all , "
80111	80124	80108	80109	Miss Steele	128	" we can just as well go and see _ her _ . "
80841	80852	80854	80854	he	1667	" I wished very much to call upon you yesterday , "
80856	81024	80854	80854	he	1667	" but it was impossible , for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars . Harry was vastly pleased . _ This _ morning I had fully intended to call on you , if I could possibly find a spare half hour , but one has always so much to do on first coming to town . I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal . But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street , and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings . I understand she is a woman of very good fortune . And the Middletons too , you must introduce me to _ them _ . As my mother - in - law s relations , I shall be happy to show them every respect . They are excellent neighbours to you in the country , I understand . "
81025	81048	81194	81194	him	304	" Excellent indeed . Their attention to our comfort , their friendliness in every particular , is more than I can express . "
81049	81172	80854	80854	he	1667	" I am extremely glad to hear it , upon my word ; extremely glad indeed . But so it ought to be ; they are people of large fortune , they are related to you , and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected . And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing ! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place : the most complete thing of its kind , he said , that ever was , and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing . It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it , I assure you . "
81284	81306	81307	81308	Mrs. Jennings	98	" but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where . "
81473	81486	81455	81455	she	84	" Who is Colonel Brandon ? Is he a man of fortune ? "
81487	81498	81455	81455	she	84	" Yes ; he has very good property in Dorsetshire . "
81499	81534	81455	81455	she	84	" I am glad of it . He seems a most gentlemanlike man ; and I think , Elinor , I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life . "
81535	81545	81455	81455	she	84	" Me , brother ! what do you mean ? "
81546	81570	81455	81455	she	84	" He likes you . I observed him narrowly , and am convinced of it . What is the amount of his fortune ? "
81571	81580	81455	81455	she	84	" I believe about two thousand a year . "
81581	81588	81592	81592	himself	1685	" Two thousand a - year ; "
81604	81625	81601	81601	he	1685	" Elinor , I wish with all my heart it were _ twice _ as much , for your sake . "
81626	81632	81634	81634	Elinor	84	" Indeed I believe you , "
81636	81656	81634	81634	Elinor	84	" but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying _ me _ . "
81657	81841	81843	81843	his	1686	" You are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken . A very little trouble on your side secures him . Perhaps just at present he may be undecided ; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back ; his friends may all advise him against it . But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself . And there can be no reason why you should not try for him . It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side in short , you know as to an attachment of that kind , it is quite out of the question , the objections are insurmountable you have too much sense not to see all that . Colonel Brandon must be the man ; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family . It is a match that must give universal satisfaction . In short , it is a kind of thing that "
81849	81860	81862	81862	himself	1686	" will be exceedingly welcome to _ all parties _ . "
81869	81939	81866	81866	he	1686	" That is , I mean to say your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled ; Fanny particularly , for she has your interest very much at heart , I assure you . And her mother too , Mrs. Ferrars , a very good - natured woman , I am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day . "
81947	81956	81957	81957	he	1686	" It would be something remarkable , now , "
81960	81988	81957	81957	he	1686	" something droll , if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time . And yet it is not very unlikely . "
81989	81995	81997	81997	Elinor	84	" Is Mr. Edward Ferrars , "
82002	82008	81997	81997	Elinor	84	" going to be married ? "
82009	82202	81957	81957	he	1686	" It is not actually settled , but there is such a thing in agitation . He has a most excellent mother . Mrs. Ferrars , with the utmost liberality , will come forward , and settle on him a thousand a year , if the match takes place . The lady is the Hon . Miss Morton , only daughter of the late Lord Morton , with thirty thousand pounds . A very desirable connection on both sides , and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time . A thousand a - year is a great deal for a mother to give away , to make over for ever ; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit . To give you another instance of her liberality : The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds . And extremely acceptable it is , for we must live at a great expense while we are here . "
82218	82239	81957	81957	he	1686	" Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable ; but your income is a large one . "
82240	82393	81957	81957	he	1686	" Not so large , I dare say , as many people suppose . I do not mean to complain , however ; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one , and I hope will in time be better . The enclosure of Norland Common , now carrying on , is a most serious drain . And then I have made a little purchase within this half year ; East Kingham Farm , you must remember the place , where old Gibson used to live . The land was so very desirable for me in every respect , so immediately adjoining my own property , that I felt it my duty to buy it . I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands . A man must pay for his convenience ; and it _ has _ cost me a vast deal of money . "
82394	82405	81957	81957	he	1686	" More than you think it really and intrinsically worth . "
82406	82486	81957	81957	he	1686	" Why , I hope not that . I might have sold it again , the next day , for more than I gave : but , with regard to the purchase - money , I might have been very unfortunate indeed ; for the stocks were at that time so low , that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker s hands , I must have sold out to very great loss . "
82492	82624	81957	81957	he	1686	" Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland . Our respected father , as you well know , bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland ( and very valuable they were ) to your mother . Far be it from me to repine at his doing so ; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose , but , in consequence of it , we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen , china , & c. to supply the place of what was taken away . You may guess , after all these expenses , how very far we must be from being rich , and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars s kindness is . "
82625	82628	82630	82630	Elinor	84	" Certainly , "
82632	82651	82630	82630	Elinor	84	" and assisted by her liberality , I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances . "
82652	82663	82664	82664	he	1689	" Another year or two may do much towards it , "
82668	82707	82664	82664	he	1689	" but however there is still a great deal to be done . There is not a stone laid of Fanny s green - house , and nothing but the plan of the flower - garden marked out . "
82708	82718	82630	82630	Elinor	84	" Where is the green - house to be ? "
82719	82788	82664	82664	he	1689	" Upon the knoll behind the house . The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it . It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park , and the flower - garden will slope down just before it , and be exceedingly pretty . We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow . "
82874	82973	82868	82869	a friend	1251	" She seems a most valuable woman indeed . Her house , her style of living , all bespeak an exceeding good income ; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto , but in the end may prove materially advantageous . Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour ; and indeed , it speaks altogether so great a regard for you , that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten . She must have a great deal to leave . "
82974	82998	82868	82869	a friend	1251	" Nothing at all , I should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children . "
82999	83038	82868	82869	a friend	1251	" But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income . Few people of common prudence will do _ that _ and whatever she saves , she will be able to dispose of . "
83039	83061	82868	82869	a friend	1251	" And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters , than to us ? "
83062	83155	82868	82869	a friend	1251	" Her daughters are both exceedingly well married , and therefore I can not perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther . Whereas , in my opinion , by her taking so much notice of you , and treating you in this kind of way , she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration , which a conscientious woman would not disregard . Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour ; and she can hardly do all this , without being aware of the expectation it raises . "
83156	83182	82868	82869	a friend	1251	" But she raises none in those most concerned . Indeed , brother , your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far . "
83183	83190	83192	83192	he	1693	" Why , to be sure , "
83199	83244	83192	83192	he	1693	" people have little , have very little in their power . But , my dear Elinor , what is the matter with Marianne ? she looks very unwell , has lost her colour , and is grown quite thin . Is she ill ? "
83245	83263	82868	82869	a friend	1251	" She is not well , she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks . "
83264	83466	83192	83192	he	1693	" I am sorry for that . At her time of life , any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever ! Hers has been a very short one ! She was as handsome a girl last September , as I ever saw ; and as likely to attract the man . There was something in her style of beauty , to please them particularly . I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did ; not but what she is exceedingly fond of _ you _ , but so it happened to strike her . She will be mistaken , however . I question whether Marianne _ now _ , will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a - year , at the utmost , and I am very much deceived if _ you _ do not do better . Dorsetshire ! I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors . "
83663	83675	83677	83677	he	80	" I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny , "
83687	83829	83677	83677	he	80	" Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman ! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know . And Mrs. Jennings too , an exceedingly well - behaved woman , though not so elegant as her daughter . Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting _ her _ , which , to say the truth , has been a little the case , and very naturally ; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way ; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed , that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with . But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both . "
84910	84918	84920	84920	Lucy	93	" Pity me , dear Miss Dashwood ! "
84950	84995	84940	84940	they	1737	" there is nobody here but you , that can feel for me . I declare I can hardly stand . Good gracious ! In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on that is to be my mother ! "
85999	86008	86010	86010	he	99	" These are done by my eldest sister , "
86012	86061	86010	86010	he	99	" and you , as a man of taste , will , I dare say , be pleased with them . I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before , but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well . "
86165	86167	86169	86170	Mrs. Ferrars	93	" Hum "
86171	86175	86169	86170	Mrs. Ferrars	93	" very pretty , "
86214	86226	86210	86210	she	88	" They are very pretty , ma am an t they ? "
86253	86288	86249	86249	she	88	" Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton s style of painting , Ma am ? _ She does _ paint most delightfully ! How beautifully her last landscape is done ! "
86289	86302	86249	86249	she	88	" Beautifully indeed ! But _ she _ does every thing well . "
86354	86393	86398	86398	she	85	" This is admiration of a very particular kind ! what is Miss Morton to us ? who knows , or who cares , for her ? it is Elinor of whom _ we _ think and speak . "
86446	86455	86432	86432	herself	93	" Miss Morton is Lord Morton s daughter . "
86630	86651	86618	86618	hers	93	" Dear , dear Elinor , don t mind them . Don t let them make _ you _ unhappy . "
86713	86719	86706	86707	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Ah ! poor dear , "
86812	86816	86818	86819	her brother	304	" Poor Marianne ! "
86838	86923	86818	86819	her brother	304	" She has not such good health as her sister , she is very nervous , she has not Elinor s constitution ; and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who _ has been _ a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions . You would not think it perhaps , but Marianne _ was _ remarkably handsome a few months ago ; quite as handsome as Elinor . Now you see it is all gone . "
87250	87255	87257	87257	Lucy	93	" My dear friend , "
87267	87363	87257	87257	Lucy	93	" I come to talk to you of my happiness . Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars s way of treating me yesterday ? So exceeding affable as she was ! You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her ; but the very moment I was introduced , there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say , she had quite took a fancy to me . Now was not it so ? You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ? "
87364	87373	87438	87438	she	84	" She was certainly very civil to you . "
87374	87421	87257	87257	Lucy	93	" Civil ! Did you see nothing but only civility ? I saw a vast deal more . Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me ! No pride , no hauteur , and your sister just the same all sweetness and affability ! "
87453	87463	87465	87465	she	93	" Undoubtedly , if they had known your engagement , "
87467	87486	87465	87465	she	93	" nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you ; but as that was not the case "
87487	87495	87497	87497	Lucy	93	" I guessed you would say so , "
87499	87600	87465	87465	she	93	" but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me , if she did not , and her liking me is every thing . You shan t talk me out of my satisfaction . I am sure it will all end well , and there will be no difficulties at all , to what I used to think . Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman , and so is your sister . They are both delightful women , indeed ! I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was ! "
87616	87638	87726	87726	she	93	" Are you ill , Miss Dashwood ? you seem low you don t speak ; sure you an t well . "
87639	87647	87726	87726	she	93	" I never was in better health . "
87648	87703	87726	87726	she	93	" I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it . I should be sorry to have _ you _ ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world ! Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship . "
87730	87877	87726	87726	she	93	" Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me , and next to Edward s love , it is the greatest comfort I have . Poor Edward ! But now there is one good thing , we shall be able to meet , and meet pretty often , for Lady Middleton s delighted with Mrs. Dashwood , so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street , I dare say , and Edward spends half his time with his sister besides , Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now ; and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once , they should always be glad to see me . They are such charming women ! I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her , you can not speak too high . "
87900	88009	87897	87897	Lucy	93	" I am sure I should have seen it in a moment , if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me . If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way you know what I mean if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair . I could not have stood it . For where she _ does _ dislike , I know it is most violent . "
88634	88638	88639	88639	she	85	" Dear Edward ! "
88642	88660	88639	88639	she	85	" this is a moment of great happiness ! This would almost make amends for every thing ! "
88766	88775	88776	88776	she	85	" Oh , don t think of me ! "
88793	88818	88776	88776	she	85	" don t think of _ my _ health . Elinor is well , you see . That must be enough for us both . "
88852	88858	88860	88860	Edward	89	" Do you like London ? "
88873	88917	88920	88921	no one	280	" Not at all . I expected much pleasure in it , but I have found none . The sight of you , Edward , is the only comfort it has afforded ; and thank Heaven ! you are what you always were ! "
88924	88930	88931	88931	she	85	" I think , Elinor , "
88935	88981	88931	88931	she	85	" we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton . In a week or two , I suppose , we shall be going ; and , I trust , Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge . "
89030	89070	89077	89077	she	85	" We spent such a day , Edward , in Harley Street yesterday ! So dull , so wretchedly dull ! But I have much to say to you on that head , which can not be said now . "
89109	89125	89077	89077	she	85	" But why were you not there , Edward ? Why did you not come ? "
89126	89132	89099	89100	his mother	234	" I was engaged elsewhere . "
89133	89149	89077	89077	she	85	" Engaged ! But what was that , when such friends were to be met ? "
89150	89156	89158	89158	Lucy	93	" Perhaps , Miss Marianne , "
89168	89193	89158	89158	Lucy	93	" you think young men never stand upon engagements , if they have no mind to keep them , little as well as great . "
89213	89352	89209	89209	she	85	" Not so , indeed ; for , seriously speaking , I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street . And I really believe he _ has _ the most delicate conscience in the world ; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement , however minute , and however it may make against his interest or pleasure . He is the most fearful of giving pain , of wounding expectation , and the most incapable of being selfish , of any body I ever saw . Edward , it is so , and I will say it . What ! are you never to hear yourself praised ! Then you must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation . "
89401	89406	89408	89408	Marianne	85	" Going so soon ! "
89410	89420	89408	89408	Marianne	85	" my dear Edward , this must not be . "
89472	89481	89483	89483	Marianne	85	" What can bring her here so often ? "
89490	89506	89483	89483	Marianne	85	" Could not she see that we wanted her gone ! how teazing to Edward ! "
89507	89545	89488	89488	them	1837	" Why so ? we were all his friends , and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any . It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves . "
89555	89627	89546	89546	Marianne	85	" You know , Elinor , that this is a kind of talking which I can not bear . If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted , as I must suppose to be the case , you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it . I can not descend to be tricked out of assurances , that are not really wanted . "
91184	91205	91175	91175	she	85	" her word she looked vastly smart , and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests . "
91739	91744	91745	91745	he	132	" Upon my soul , "
91748	91886	91745	91745	he	132	" I believe it is nothing more ; and so I often tell my mother , when she is grieving about it . My dear Madam , I always say to her , you must make yourself easy . The evil is now irremediable , and it has been entirely your own doing . Why would you be persuaded by my uncle , Sir Robert , against your own judgment , to place Edward under private tuition , at the most critical time of his life ? If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself , instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt s , all this would have been prevented . This is the way in which I always consider the matter , and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error . "
91928	91937	91939	91939	his	1911	" You reside in Devonshire , I think , "
91943	91950	91939	91939	his	1911	" in a cottage near Dawlish . "
91991	91997	91999	91999	he	1911	" For my own part , "
92001	92168	91999	91999	he	1911	" I am excessively fond of a cottage ; there is always so much comfort , so much elegance about them . And I protest , if I had any money to spare , I should buy a little land and build one myself , within a short distance of London , where I might drive myself down at any time , and collect a few friends about me , and be happy . I advise every body who is going to build , to build a cottage . My friend Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice , and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi s. I was to decide on the best of them . My dear Courtland , said I , immediately throwing them all into the fire , do not adopt either of them , but by all means build a cottage . And that I fancy , will be the end of it .
92169	92402	92410	92410	she	84	" Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations , no space in a cottage ; but this is all a mistake . I was last month at my friend Elliott s , near Dartford . Lady Elliott wished to give a dance . But how can it be done ? said she ; my dear Ferrars , do tell me how it is to be managed . There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple , and where can the supper be ? _ I _ immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it , so I said , My dear Lady Elliott , do not be uneasy . The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease ; card - tables may be placed in the drawing - room ; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments ; and let the supper be set out in the saloon . Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought . We measured the dining - room , and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple , and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan . So that , in fact , you see , if people do but know how to set about it , every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling . "
92558	92569	92571	92571	she	88	" I do not see how it can be done , "
92573	92638	92571	92571	she	88	" without affronting Lady Middleton , for they spend every day with her ; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it . You know I am always ready to pay them any attention in my power , as my taking them out this evening shows . But they are Lady Middleton s visitors . How can I ask them away from her ? "
92656	92690	92653	92653	her	88	" They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit Street , and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations . "
92705	92838	92691	92691	Fanny	88	" My love , I would ask them with all my heart , if it was in my power . But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us . They are very well behaved , good kind of girls ; and I think the attention is due to them , as their uncle did so very well by Edward . We can ask your sisters some other year , you know ; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more . I am sure you will like them ; indeed , you _ do _ like them , you know , very much already , and so does my mother ; and they are such favourites with Harry ! "
93464	93478	93447	93447	her	84	" Lord ! my dear Miss Dashwood ! have you heard the news ? "
93479	93489	93447	93447	her	84	" No , ma am . What is it ? "
93490	93770	93447	93447	her	84	" Something so strange ! But you shall hear it all . When I got to Mr. Palmer s , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child . She was sure it was very ill it cried , and fretted , and was all over pimples . So I looked at it directly , and , Lord ! my dear , says I , it is nothing in the world , but the red gum ; and nurse said just the same . But Charlotte , she would not be satisfied , so Mr. Donavan was sent for ; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street , so he stepped over directly , and as soon as ever he saw the child , he said just as we did , that it was nothing in the world but the red gum , and then Charlotte was easy . And so , just as he was going away again , it came into my head , I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it , but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news . So upon that , he smirked , and simpered , and looked grave , and seemed to know something or other , and at last he said in a whisper , For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister s indisposition , I think it advisable to say , that I believe there is no great reason for alarm ; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will do very well . "
93771	93778	93447	93447	her	84	" What ! is Fanny ill ? "
93779	94745	93447	93447	her	84	" That is exactly what I said , my dear . Lord ! says I , is Mrs. Dashwood ill ? So then it all came out ; and the long and the short of the matter , by all I can learn , seems to be this . Mr. Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ) , Mr. Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy ! There s for you , my dear ! And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy ! Could you have believed such a thing possible ? There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it ! _ That _ is strange ! I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it out directly . Well , and so this was kept a great secret , for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter : till this very morning , poor Nancy , who , you know , is a well - meaning creature , but no conjurer , popt it all out . Lord ! thinks she to herself , they are all so fond of Lucy , to be sure they will make no difficulty about it ; and so , away she went to your sister , who was sitting all alone at her carpet - work , little suspecting what was to come for she had just been saying to your brother , only five minutes before , that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord s daughter or other , I forget who . So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride . She fell into violent hysterics immediately , with such screams as reached your brother s ears , as he was sitting in his own dressing - room down stairs , thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country . So up he flew directly , and a terrible scene took place , for Lucy was come to them by that time , little dreaming what was going on . Poor soul ! I pity _ her _ . And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit . Nancy , she fell upon her knees , and cried bitterly ; and your brother , he walked about the room , and said he did not know what to do . Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon _ his _ knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes . _ Then _ she fell into hysterics again , and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan , and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar . The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad . I declare , I have no patience with your sister ; and I hope , with all my heart , it will be a match in spite of her . Lord ! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it ! To have his love used so scornfully ! for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may . I should not wonder , if he was to be in the greatest passion ! and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same . He and I had a great deal of talk about it ; and the best of all is , that he is gone back again to Harley Street , that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it , for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house , for your sister was sure _ she _ would be in hysterics too ; and so she may , for what I care . I have no pity for either of them . I have no notion of people s making such a to - do about money and greatness . There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry ; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son , and though Lucy has next to nothing herself , she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing ; I dare say , if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a - year , she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight . Lord ! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours or a little bigger with two maids , and two men ; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid , for my Betty has a sister out of place , that would fit them exactly . "
95516	95534	95587	95587	she	85	" How long has this been known to you , Elinor ? has he written to you ? "
95535	95563	95587	95587	she	85	" I have known it these four months . When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November , she told me in confidence of her engagement . "
95589	95601	95587	95587	she	85	" Four months ! Have you known of this four months ? "
95606	95633	95587	95587	she	85	" What ! while attending me in all my misery , has this been on your heart ? And I have reproached you for being happy ! "
95634	95651	95587	95587	she	85	" It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse ! "
95652	95656	95658	95658	Marianne	85	" Four months ! "
95661	95674	95658	95658	Marianne	85	" So calm ! so cheerful ! How have you been supported ? "
95675	95744	95587	95587	she	85	" By feeling that I was doing my duty . My promise to Lucy , obliged me to be secret . I owed it to her , therefore , to avoid giving any hint of the truth ; and I owed it to my family and friends , not to create in them a solicitude about me , which it could not be in my power to satisfy . "
95750	95763	95765	95765	Elinor	84	" I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother , "
95767	95790	95765	95765	Elinor	84	" and once or twice I have attempted it ; but without betraying my trust , I never could have convinced you . "
95791	95801	95587	95587	she	85	" Four months ! and yet you loved him ! "
95802	96066	95765	95765	Elinor	84	" Yes . But I did not love only him ; and while the comfort of others was dear to me , I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt . Now , I can think and speak of it with little emotion . I would not have you suffer on my account ; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself . I have many things to support me . I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own , I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther . I acquit Edward of essential misconduct . I wish him very happy ; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty , that though now he may harbour some regret , in the end he must become so . Lucy does not want sense , and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built . And after all , Marianne , after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment , and all that can be said of one s happiness depending entirely on any particular person , it is not meant it is not fit it is not possible that it should be so . Edward will marry Lucy ; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex ; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to _ her _ . "
96067	96076	96078	96078	Marianne	85	" If such is your way of thinking , "
96080	96128	96078	96078	Marianne	85	" if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else , your resolution , your self - command , are , perhaps , a little less to be wondered at . They are brought more within my comprehension . "
96129	96511	95765	95765	Elinor	84	" I understand you . You do not suppose that I have ever felt much . For four months , Marianne , I have had all this hanging on my mind , without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature ; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you , yet unable to prepare you for it in the least . It was told me , it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself , whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects ; and told me , as I thought , with triumph . This person s suspicions , therefore , I have had to oppose , by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested ; and it has not been only once ; I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again . I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever , without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection . Nothing has proved him unworthy ; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me . I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister , and the insolence of his mother ; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment , without enjoying its advantages . And all this has been going on at a time , when , as you know too well , it has not been my only unhappiness . If you can think me capable of ever feeling , surely you may suppose that I have suffered _ now _ . The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that I have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion ; they did not spring up of themselves ; they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first . No , Marianne . _ Then _ , if I had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely not even what I owed to my dearest friends from openly showing that I was _ very _ unhappy . "
96517	96522	96523	96523	she	85	" Oh ! Elinor , "
96526	96605	96523	96523	she	85	" you have made me hate myself for ever . How barbarous have I been to you ! you , who have been my only comfort , who have borne with me in all my misery , who have seemed to be only suffering for me ! Is this my gratitude ? Is this the only return I can make you ? Because your merit cries out upon myself , I have been trying to do it away . "
96765	96771	96775	96775	her	98	" Yes , ma am . "
96864	96872	96874	96874	he	293	" You have heard , I suppose , "
96886	96900	96874	96874	he	293	" of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday . "
96916	96920	96921	96921	he	293	" Your sister , "
96924	97170	96921	96921	he	293	" has suffered dreadfully . Mrs. Ferrars too in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome . Poor Fanny ! she was in hysterics all yesterday . But I would not alarm you too much . Donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended ; her constitution is a good one , and her resolution equal to any thing . She has borne it all , with the fortitude of an angel ! She says she never shall think well of anybody again ; and one can not wonder at it , after being so deceived ! meeting with such ingratitude , where so much kindness had been shown , so much confidence had been placed ! It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart , that she had asked these young women to her house ; merely because she thought they deserved some attention , were harmless , well - behaved girls , and would be pleasant companions ; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us , while your kind friend there , was attending her daughter . And now to be so rewarded ! I wish , with all my heart , says poor Fanny in her affectionate way , that we had asked your sisters instead of them . "
97186	97535	97182	97182	he	1959	" What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered , when first Fanny broke it to her , is not to be described . While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him , was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person ! such a suspicion could never have entered her head ! If she suspected _ any _ prepossession elsewhere , it could not be in _ that _ quarter . _ There _ , to be sure , said she , I might have thought myself safe . She was quite in an agony . We consulted together , however , as to what should be done , and at last she determined to send for Edward . He came . But I am sorry to relate what ensued . All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement , assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments , and Fanny s entreaties , was of no avail . Duty , affection , every thing was disregarded . I never thought Edward so stubborn , so unfeeling before . His mother explained to him her liberal designs , in case of his marrying Miss Morton ; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate , which , clear of land - tax , brings in a good thousand a - year ; offered even , when matters grew desperate , to make it twelve hundred ; and in opposition to this , if he still persisted in this low connection , represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match . His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all ; she would never see him again ; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance , that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support , she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it . "
97553	97562	97537	97537	Marianne	85	" Gracious God ! can this be possible ! "
97563	97571	97573	97574	her brother	304	" Well may you wonder , Marianne , "
97576	97594	97573	97574	her brother	304	" at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these . Your exclamation is very natural . "
97610	97616	97617	97617	he	304	" All this , however , "
97620	97667	97617	97617	he	304	" was urged in vain . Edward said very little ; but what he did say , was in the most determined manner . Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement . He would stand to it , cost him what it might . "
97668	97671	97673	97674	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Then , "
97686	97763	97673	97674	Mrs. Jennings	98	" he has acted like an honest man ! I beg your pardon , Mr. Dashwood , but if he had done otherwise , I should have thought him a rascal . I have some little concern in the business , as well as yourself , for Lucy Steele is my cousin , and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world , nor one who more deserves a good husband . "
97803	97971	97795	97795	He	1961	" I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours , madam . Miss Lucy Steele is , I dare say , a very deserving young woman , but in the present case you know , the connection must be impossible . And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle s care , the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars , is perhaps , altogether a little extraordinary . In short , I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for , Mrs. Jennings . We all wish her extremely happy ; and Mrs. Ferrars s conduct throughout the whole , has been such as every conscientious , good mother , in like circumstances , would adopt . It has been dignified and liberal . Edward has drawn his own lot , and I fear it will be a bad one . "
98006	98011	98013	98014	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Well , sir , "
98016	98023	98013	98014	Mrs. Jennings	98	" and how did it end ? "
98024	98087	97998	98004	a woman who could not reward him	1965	" I am sorry to say , ma am , in a most unhappy rupture : Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother s notice . He left her house yesterday , but where he is gone , or whether he is still in town , I do not know ; for _ we _ of course can make no inquiry . "
98088	98101	98013	98014	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Poor young man ! and what is to become of him ? "
98102	98228	97998	98004	a woman who could not reward him	1965	" What , indeed , ma am ! It is a melancholy consideration . Born to the prospect of such affluence ! I can not conceive a situation more deplorable . The interest of two thousand pounds how can a man live on it ? and when to that is added the recollection , that he might , but for his own folly , within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand , five hundred a - year ( for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds , ) I can not picture to myself a more wretched condition . We must all feel for him ; and the more so , because it is totally out of our power to assist him . "
98229	98234	98236	98237	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Poor young man ! "
98239	98289	98236	98237	Mrs. Jennings	98	" I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house ; and so I would tell him if I could see him . It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now , at lodgings and taverns . "
98313	98325	98327	98328	John Dashwood	83	" If he would only have done as well by himself , "
98330	98440	98327	98328	John Dashwood	83	" as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing . But as it is , it must be out of anybody s power to assist him . And there is one thing more preparing against him , which must be worse than all his mother has determined , with a very natural kind of spirit , to settle _ that _ estate upon Robert immediately , which might have been Edward s , on proper conditions . I left her this morning with her lawyer , talking over the business . "
98441	98444	98446	98447	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Well ! "
98449	98486	98446	98447	Mrs. Jennings	98	" that is _ her _ revenge . Everybody has a way of their own . But I don t think mine would be , to make one son independent , because another had plagued me . "
98496	98509	98511	98511	John	83	" Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man , "
98513	98541	98511	98511	John	83	" than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own ? Poor Edward ! I feel for him sincerely . "
99280	99310	99273	99274	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Get it all out of her , my dear . She will tell you any thing if you ask . You see I can not leave Mrs. Clarke . "
99347	99356	99358	99359	Miss Steele	128	" I am so glad to meet you ; "
99367	99381	99385	99385	her	98	" for I wanted to see you of all things in the world . "
99388	99403	99385	99385	her	98	" I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it . Is she angry ? "
99404	99415	99385	99385	her	98	" Not at all , I believe , with you . "
99416	99433	99385	99385	her	98	" That is a good thing . And Lady Middleton , is _ she _ angry ? "
99434	99446	99385	99385	her	98	" I can not suppose it possible that she should be . "
99447	99638	99385	99385	her	98	" I am monstrous glad of it . Good gracious ! I have had such a time of it ! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life . She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet , nor do any thing else for me again , so long as she lived ; but now she is quite come to , and we are as good friends as ever . Look , she made me this bow to my hat , and put in the feather last night . There now , _ you _ are going to laugh at me too . But why should not I wear pink ribbons ? I do not care if it _ is _ the Doctor s favourite colour . I am sure , for my part , I should never have known he _ did _ like it better than any other colour , if he had not happened to say so . My cousins have been so plaguing me ! I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them . "
99670	99677	99385	99385	her	98	" Well , but Miss Dashwood , "
99681	99752	99385	99385	her	98	" people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars s declaring he would not have Lucy , for it is no such thing I can tell you ; and it is quite a shame for such ill - natured reports to be spread abroad . Whatever Lucy might think about it herself , you know , it was no business of other people to set it down for certain . "
99753	99770	99772	99772	Elinor	84	" I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before , I assure you , "
99774	100553	99385	99385	her	98	" Oh , did not you ? But it _ was _ said , I know , very well , and by more than one ; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks , that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton , with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune , for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all ; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself . And besides that , my cousin Richard said himself , that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off ; and when Edward did not come near us for three days , I could not tell what to think myself ; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost ; for we came away from your brother s Wednesday , and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday , Friday , and Saturday , and did not know what was become of him . Once Lucy thought to write to him , but then her spirits rose against that . However this morning he came just as we came home from church ; and then it all came out , how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street , and been talked to by his mother and all of them , and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy , and nobody but Lucy would he have . And how he had been so worried by what passed , that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house , he had got upon his horse , and rid into the country , some where or other ; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday , on purpose to get the better of it . And after thinking it all over and over again , he said , it seemed to him as if , now he had no fortune , and no nothing at all , it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement , because it must be for her loss , for he had nothing but two thousand pounds , and no hope of any thing else ; and if he was to go into orders , as he had some thoughts , he could get nothing but a curacy , and how was they to live upon that ? He could not bear to think of her doing no better , and so he begged , if she had the least mind for it , to put an end to the matter directly , and leave him shift for himself . I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be . And it was entirely for _ her _ sake , and upon _ her _ account , that he said a word about being off , and not upon his own . I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her , or of wishing to marry Miss Morton , or any thing like it . But , to be sure , Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking ; so she told him directly ( with a great deal about sweet and love , you know , and all that Oh , la ! one can t repeat such kind of things you know ) she told him directly , she had not the least mind in the world to be off , for she could live with him upon a trifle , and how little so ever he might have , she should be very glad to have it all , you know , or something of the kind . So then he was monstrous happy , and talked on some time about what they should do , and they agreed he should take orders directly , and they must wait to be married till he got a living . And just then I could not hear any more , for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach , and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens ; so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them , to ask Lucy if she would like to go , but she did not care to leave Edward ; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons . "
100554	100566	100568	100568	Elinor	84	" I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them , "
100570	100584	100568	100568	Elinor	84	" you were all in the same room together , were not you ? "
100585	100658	99385	99385	her	98	" No , indeed , not us . La ! Miss Dashwood , do you think people make love when any body else is by ? Oh , for shame ! To be sure you must know better than that . ( Laughing affectedly . ) No , no ; they were shut up in the drawing - room together , and all I heard was only by listening at the door . "
100659	100662	100664	100664	Elinor	84	" How ! "
100666	100728	100664	100664	Elinor	84	" have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door ? I am sorry I did not know it before ; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself . How could you behave so unfairly by your sister ? "
100729	100813	99385	99385	her	98	" Oh , la ! there is nothing in _ that _ . I only stood at the door , and heard what I could . And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me ; for a year or two back , when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together , she never made any bones of hiding in a closet , or behind a chimney - board , on purpose to hear what we said . "
100843	100852	100854	100854	she	128	" Edward talks of going to Oxford soon , "
100856	101128	100854	100854	she	128	" but now he is lodging at No . , Pall Mall . What an ill - natured woman his mother is , an t she ? And your brother and sister were not very kind ! However , I shan t say anything against them to _ you ; _ and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot , which was more than I looked for . And for my part , I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before ; but , however , nothing was said about them , and I took care to keep mine out of sight . Edward have got some business at Oxford , he says ; so he must go there for a time ; and after _ that _ , as soon as he can light upon a Bishop , he will be ordained . I wonder what curacy he will get ! Good gracious ! ( giggling as she spoke ) I d lay my life I know what my cousins will say , when they hear of it . They will tell me I should write to the Doctor , to get Edward the curacy of his new living . I know they will ; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world . La ! I shall say directly , I wonder how you could think of such a thing ? _ I _ write to the Doctor , indeed ! "
101129	101132	101134	101134	Elinor	84	" Well , "
101136	101155	101134	101134	Elinor	84	" it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst . You have got your answer ready . "
101179	101371	101374	101374	her	1982	" Oh , la ! here come the Richardsons . I had a vast deal more to say to you , but I must not stay away from them not any longer . I assure you they are very genteel people . He makes a monstrous deal of money , and they keep their own coach . I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes . I suppose Lady Middleton won t ask us any more this bout . Good - by ; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here . Remember me kindly to her . La ! if you have not got your spotted muslin on ! I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn . "
101608	101752	102242	102242	she	84	" Wait for his having a living ! ay , we all know how _ that _ will end : they will wait a twelvemonth , and finding no good comes of it , will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a - year , with the interest of his two thousand pounds , and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her . Then they will have a child every year ! and Lord help em ! how poor they will be ! I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house . Two maids and two men , indeed ! as I talked of t other day . No , no , they must get a stout girl of all works . Betty s sister would never do for them _ now _ . "
101775	101781	102242	102242	she	84	" Bartlett s Building , March .
101782	102223	102242	102242	she	84	" I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her ; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward , after all the troubles we have went through lately , therefore will make no more apologies , but proceed to say that , thank God ! though we have suffered dreadfully , we are both quite well now , and as happy as we must always be in one another s love . We have had great trials , and great persecutions , but however , at the same time , gratefully acknowledge many friends , yourself not the least among them , whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember , as will Edward too , who I have told of it . I am sure you will be glad to hear , as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings , I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon , he would not hear of our parting , though earnestly did I , as I thought my duty required , urge him to it for prudence sake , and would have parted for ever on the spot , would he consent to it ; but he said it should never be , he did not regard his mother s anger , while he could have my affections ; our prospects are not very bright , to be sure , but we must wait , and hope for the best ; he will be ordained shortly ; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow , am very sure you will not forget us , and dear Mrs. Jennings too , trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John , or Mr. Palmer , or any friend that may be able to assist us . Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did , but she did it for the best , so I say nothing ; hope Mrs. Jennings won t think it too much trouble to give us a call , should she come this way any morning , twould be a great kindness , and my cousins would be proud to know her . My paper reminds me to conclude ; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her , and to Sir John , and Lady Middleton , and the dear children , when you chance to see them , and love to Miss Marianne ,
102224	102230	102242	102242	she	84	" I am , & c. "
102274	102415	102242	102242	she	84	" Very well indeed ! how prettily she writes ! aye , that was quite proper to let him be off if he would . That was just like Lucy . Poor soul ! I wish I _ could _ get him a living , with all my heart . She calls me dear Mrs. Jennings , you see . She is a good - hearted girl as ever lived . Very well upon my word . That sentence is very prettily turned . Yes , yes , I will go and see her , sure enough . How attentive she is , to think of every body ! Thank you , my dear , for showing it me . It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw , and does Lucy s head and heart great credit . "
102709	102712	102713	102713	she	98	" Cleveland ! "
102720	102730	102713	102713	she	98	" No , I can not go to Cleveland . "
102731	102735	102737	102737	Elinor	84	" You forget , "
102740	102754	102737	102737	Elinor	84	" that its situation is not that it is not in the neighbourhood of "
102755	102791	102713	102713	she	98	" But it is in Somersetshire . I can not go into Somersetshire . There , where I looked forward to going ... No , Elinor , you can not expect me to go there . "
103052	103072	103074	103075	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Ah ! Colonel , I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods ; "
103093	103134	103074	103075	Mrs. Jennings	98	" for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers ; and how forlorn we shall be , when I come back ! Lord ! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats . "
103473	103485	103467	103468	the Colonel	635	" I am afraid it can not take place very soon . "
103505	103513	103497	103497	she	84	" Lord ! what should hinder it ? "
103526	103541	103497	103497	she	84	" This is very strange ! sure he need not wait to be older . "
103602	103614	103599	103599	she	84	" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you . "
103693	103698	103700	103700	he	635	" I have heard , "
103706	103759	103700	103700	he	635	" of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family ; for if I understand the matter right , he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman . Have I been rightly informed ? Is it so ? ; "
103767	103775	103776	103776	he	635	" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty , "
103783	104048	103776	103776	he	635	" of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible . Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing what she may drive her son to . I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street , and am much pleased with him . He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time , but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake , and as a friend of yours , I wish it still more . I understand that he intends to take orders . Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford , now just vacant , as I am informed by this day s post , is his , if he think it worth his acceptance ; but _ that _ , perhaps , so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now , it may be nonsense to appear to doubt ; I only wish it were more valuable . It is a rectory , but a small one ; the late incumbent , I believe , did not make more than 200 per annum , and though it is certainly capable of improvement , I fear , not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income . Such as it is , however , my pleasure in presenting it to him , will be very great . Pray assure him of it . "
104440	104447	104449	104449	she	84	" The smallness of the house , "
104451	104473	104449	104449	she	84	" I can not imagine any inconvenience to them , for it will be in proportion to their family and income . "
104534	104690	104530	104530	he	89	" This little rectory _ can _ do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it can not enable him to marry . I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive . If , however , by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther , I must think very differently of him from what I now do , if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present . What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness . His marriage must still be a distant good ; at least , I am afraid it can not take place very soon . "
104770	104776	104778	104779	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Well , Miss Dashwood , "
104792	104860	104778	104779	Mrs. Jennings	98	" I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you ; for though , upon my honour , I _ tried _ to keep out of hearing , I could not help catching enough to understand his business . And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life , and I wish you joy of it with all my heart . "
104861	104868	104870	104870	Elinor	84	" Thank you , ma am , "
104872	104927	104870	104870	Elinor	84	" It _ is _ a matter of great joy to me ; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly . There are not many men who would act as he has done . Few people who have so compassionate a heart ! I never was more astonished in my life . "
104928	104967	104778	104779	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Lord ! my dear , you are very modest . I an t the least astonished at it in the world , for I have often thought of late , there was nothing more likely to happen . "
104968	104997	104870	104870	Elinor	84	" You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel s general benevolence ; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur . "
104998	105001	105003	105004	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Opportunity ! "
105005	105075	105003	105004	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Oh ! as to that , when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing , somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity . Well , my dear , I wish you joy of it again and again ; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world , I think I shall soon know where to look for them . "
105076	105088	105090	105090	Elinor	84	" You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose , "
105097	105142	104870	104870	Elinor	84	" Aye , my dear , that I do , indeed . And as to the house being a bad one , I do not know what the Colonel would be at , for it is as good a one as ever I saw . "
105143	105153	104870	104870	Elinor	84	" He spoke of its being out of repair . "
105154	105177	104870	104870	Elinor	84	" Well , and whose fault is that ? why don t he repair it ? who should do it but himself ? "
105206	105287	105197	105198	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Well , my dear , I must be gone before I have had half my talk out . But , however , we may have it all over in the evening ; for we shall be quite alone . I do not ask you to go with me , for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company ; and besides , you must long to tell your sister all about it . "
105298	105324	104870	104870	Elinor	84	" Certainly , ma am , I shall tell Marianne of it ; but I shall not mention it at present to any body else . "
105325	105331	105333	105334	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Oh ! very well , "
105338	105363	105333	105334	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy , for I think of going as far as Holborn to - day . "
105364	105444	104870	104870	Elinor	84	" No , ma am , not even Lucy if you please . One day s delay will not be very material ; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars , I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else . I shall do _ that _ directly . It is of importance that no time should be lost with him , for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination . "
105493	105574	105490	105490	she	98	" Oh , ho ! I understand you . Mr. Ferrars is to be the man . Well , so much the better for him . Ay , to be sure , he must be ordained in readiness ; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you . But , my dear , is not this rather out of character ? Should not the Colonel write himself ? sure , he is the proper person . "
105605	105630	105704	105704	she	84	" Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man , that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself . "
105631	105701	105704	105704	she	84	" And so _ you _ are forced to do it . Well _ that _ is an odd kind of delicacy ! However , I will not disturb you ( seeing her preparing to write . ) You know your own concerns best . So goodby , my dear . I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed . "
105714	105786	105704	105704	she	84	" I have just been thinking of Betty s sister , my dear . I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress . But whether she would do for a lady s maid , I am sure I can t tell . She is an excellent housemaid , and works very well at her needle . However , you will think of all that at your leisure . "
105787	105793	105795	105795	Elinor	84	" Certainly , ma am , "
106155	106161	106163	106163	he	89	" Mrs. Jennings told me , "
106165	106247	106163	106163	he	89	" that you wished to speak with me , at least I understood her so or I certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner ; though at the same time , I should have been extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister ; especially as it will most likely be some time it is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again . I go to Oxford tomorrow . "
106248	106257	106259	106259	Elinor	84	" You would not have gone , however , "
106279	106467	106270	106270	she	84	" without receiving our good wishes , even if we had not been able to give them in person . Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said . I have something of consequence to inform you of , which I was on the point of communicating by paper . I am charged with a most agreeable office ( breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke . ) Colonel Brandon , who was here only ten minutes ago , has desired me to say , that understanding you mean to take orders , he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant , and only wishes it were more valuable . Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well - judging a friend , and to join in his wish that the living it is about two hundred a - year were much more considerable , and such as might better enable you to as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself such , in short , as might establish all your views of happiness . "
106524	106528	106517	106517	he	89	" Colonel Brandon ! "
106529	106532	106534	106534	Elinor	84	" Yes , "
106548	106623	106534	106534	Elinor	84	" Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you a concern which I am sure Marianne , myself , and all your friends , must share ; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character , and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion . "
106624	106639	106517	106517	he	89	" Colonel Brandon give _ me _ a living ! Can it be possible ? "
106640	106657	106534	106534	Elinor	84	" The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where . "
106658	106661	106663	106663	he	2040	" No , "
106669	106720	106663	106663	he	2040	" not to find it in _ you ; _ for I can not be ignorant that to you , to your goodness , I owe it all . I feel it I would express it if I could but , as you well know , I am no orator . "
106721	106843	106857	106857	she	2041	" You are very much mistaken . I do assure you that you owe it entirely , at least almost entirely , to your own merit , and Colonel Brandon s discernment of it . I have had no hand in it . I did not even know , till I understood his design , that the living was vacant ; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift . As a friend of mine , of my family , he may , perhaps indeed I know he _ has _ , still greater pleasure in bestowing it ; but , upon my word , you owe nothing to my solicitation . "
106928	106974	106925	106925	he	89	" Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability . I have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother I know esteems him highly . He is undoubtedly a sensible man , and in his manners perfectly the gentleman . "
106975	106978	106980	106980	Elinor	84	" Indeed , "
106982	107042	106925	106925	he	89	" I believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house , ) it is particularly important that he _ should _ be all this . "
107093	107106	107108	107108	he	89	" Colonel Brandon , I think , lodges in St. James Street , "
107127	107166	107108	107108	he	89	" I must hurry away then , to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give _ you ; _ to assure him that he has made me a very an exceedingly happy man . "
107230	107237	107239	107239	Elinor	84	" When I see him again , "
107250	107260	107239	107239	Elinor	84	" I shall see him the husband of Lucy . "
107365	107371	107372	107372	she	84	" Well , my dear , "
107375	107410	107372	107372	she	84	" I sent you up the young man . Did not I do right ? And I suppose you had no great difficulty You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal ? "
107411	107425	107354	107354	she	98	" No , ma am ; _ that _ was not very likely . "
107426	107446	107372	107372	she	84	" Well , and how soon will he be ready ? For it seems all to depend upon that . "
107447	107450	107452	107452	Elinor	84	" Really , "
107454	107493	107452	107452	Elinor	84	" I know so little of these kind of forms , that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time , or the preparation necessary ; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination . "
107494	107500	107502	107503	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Two or three months ! "
107505	107598	107502	107503	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Lord ! my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months ! Lord bless me ! I am sure it would put _ me _ quite out of patience ! And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars , I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him . Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well ; somebody that is in orders already . "
107599	107605	107607	107607	Elinor	84	" My dear ma am , "
107609	107633	107607	107607	Elinor	84	" what can you be thinking of ? Why , Colonel Brandon s only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . "
107634	107667	107502	107503	Mrs. Jennings	98	" Lord bless you , my dear ! Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars ! "
107724	107737	107739	107739	she	98	" Aye , aye , the parsonage is but a small one , "
107752	107857	107739	107739	she	98	" and very likely _ may _ be out of repair ; but to hear a man apologising , as I thought , for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground - floor , and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds ! and to you too , that had been used to live in Barton cottage ! It seems quite ridiculous . But , my dear , we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before Lucy goes to it . "
107858	107881	107956	107956	her	84	" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living s being enough to allow them to marry . "
107882	107951	107739	107739	she	98	" The Colonel is a ninny , my dear ; because he has two thousand a - year himself , he thinks that nobody else can marry on less . Take my word for it , that , if I am alive , I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas ; and I am sure I shan t go if Lucy an t there . "
108542	108553	108555	108555	he	282	" Fanny is in her own room , I suppose , "
108557	108617	108555	108555	he	282	" I will go to her presently , for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing _ you _ . Very far from it , indeed . _ Now _ especially there can not be but however , you and Marianne were always great favourites . Why would not Marianne come ? "
108627	108637	108638	108638	he	282	" I am not sorry to see you alone , "
108641	108692	108638	108638	he	282	" for I have a good deal to say to you . This living of Colonel Brandon s can it be true ? has he really given it to Edward ? I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it . "
108693	108710	108622	108622	she	84	" It is perfectly true . Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward . "
108711	108745	108638	108638	he	282	" Really ! Well , this is very astonishing ! no relationship ! no connection between them ! and now that livings fetch such a price ! what was the value of this ? "
108746	108753	108622	108622	she	84	" About two hundred a year . "
108754	108929	108638	108638	he	282	" Very well and for the next presentation to a living of that value supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly , and likely to vacate it soon he might have got I dare say fourteen hundred pounds . And how came he not to have settled that matter before this person s death ? _ Now _ , indeed it would be too late to sell it , but a man of Colonel Brandon s sense ! I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common , such natural , concern ! Well , I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character . I suppose , however on recollection that the case may probably be _ this _ . Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation , is old enough to take it . Aye , aye , that is the fact , depend upon it . "
108980	108986	108987	108987	he	89	" It is truly astonishing ! "
108995	109004	108993	108993	she	84	" what could be the Colonel s motive ? "
109005	109018	108993	108993	she	84	" A very simple one to be of use to Mr. Ferrars . "
109019	109075	108993	108993	she	84	" Well , well ; whatever Colonel Brandon may be , Edward is a very lucky man . You will not mention the matter to Fanny , however , for though I have broke it to her , and she bears it vastly well , she will not like to hear it much talked of . "
109116	109120	109122	109122	he	304	" Mrs. Ferrars , "
109136	109179	109125	109125	his	304	" knows nothing about it at present , and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be . When the marriage takes place , I fear she must hear of it all . "
109180	109336	109125	109125	his	304	" But why should such precaution be used ? Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon , for _ that _ must be quite out of the question ; yet why , upon her late behaviour , is she supposed to feel at all ? She has done with her son , she cast him off for ever , and has made all those over whom she had any influence , cast him off likewise . Surely , after doing so , she can not be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account : she can not be interested in any thing that befalls him . She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child , and yet retain the anxiety of a parent ! "
109337	109342	109344	109344	John	83	" Ah ! Elinor , "
109346	109421	109344	109344	John	83	" your reasoning is very good , but it is founded on ignorance of human nature . When Edward s unhappy match takes place , depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him ; and , therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event , must be concealed from her as much as possible . Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son . "
109422	109443	109125	109125	his	304	" You surprise me ; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by _ this _ time . "
109444	109463	109344	109344	John	83	" You wrong her exceedingly . Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world . "
109468	109475	109477	109478	Mr. Dashwood	80	" We think _ now _ , "
109485	109495	109477	109478	Mr. Dashwood	80	" of _ Robert s _ marrying Miss Morton . "
109514	109528	109125	109125	his	304	" The lady , I suppose , has no choice in the affair . "
109529	109537	109344	109344	John	83	" Choice ! how do you mean ? "
109538	109567	109125	109125	his	304	" I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert . "
109568	109620	109344	109344	John	83	" Certainly , there can be no difference ; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son ; and as to any thing else , they are both very agreeable young men : I do not know that one is superior to the other . "
109641	109652	109655	109655	her	84	" Of _ one _ thing , my dear sister , "
109665	109960	109655	109655	her	84	" I may assure you ; and I _ will _ do it , because I know it must gratify you . I have good reason to think indeed I have it from the best authority , or I should not repeat it , for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it , but I have it from the very best authority , not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself but her daughter _ did _ , and I have it from her , that in short , whatever objections there might be against a certain a certain connection , you understand me , it would have been far preferable to her , it would not have given her half the vexation that _ this _ does . I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light ; a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all . It would have been beyond comparison , she said , the least evil of the two , and she would be glad to compound _ now _ for nothing worse . But however , all that is quite out of the question , not to be thought of or mentioned as to any attachment you know , it never could be : all that is gone by . But I thought I would just tell you of this , because I knew how much it must please you . Not that you have any reason to regret , my dear Elinor . There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well , quite as well , or better , perhaps , all things considered . Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately ? "
110358	110367	110369	110369	he	132	" We may treat it as a joke , "
110391	110714	110369	110369	he	132	" but , upon my soul , it is a most serious business . Poor Edward ! he is ruined for ever . I am extremely sorry for it ; for I know him to be a very good - hearted creature ; as well - meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world . You must not judge of him , Miss Dashwood , from _ your _ slight acquaintance . Poor Edward ! His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature . But we are not all born , you know , with the same powers , the same address . Poor fellow ! to see him in a circle of strangers ! To be sure it was pitiable enough ; but upon my soul , I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom ; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life , as when it all burst forth . I could not believe it . My mother was the first person who told me of it ; and I , feeling myself called on to act with resolution , immediately said to her , My dear madam , I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion , but as for myself , I must say , that if Edward does marry this young woman , _ I _ never will see him again . That was what I said immediately . I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed ! Poor Edward ! he has done for himself completely , shut himself out for ever from all decent society ! But , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected . My poor mother was half frantic . "
110715	110723	110369	110369	he	132	" Have you ever seen the lady ? "
110724	110987	110369	110369	he	132	" Yes ; once , while she was staying in this house , I happened to drop in for ten minutes ; and I saw quite enough of her . The merest awkward country girl , without style , or elegance , and almost without beauty . I remember her perfectly . Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward . I offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late _ then _ , I found , to do any thing , for unluckily , I was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere . But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier , I think it is most probable that something might have been hit on . I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light . My dear fellow , I should have said , consider what you are doing . You are making a most disgraceful connection , and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving . I can not help thinking , in short , that means might have been found . But now it is all too late . He must be starved , you know , that is certain ; absolutely starved . "
113468	113470	113473	113473	his	99	" infection "
114761	114766	114857	114857	she	85	" Is mama coming ? "
114767	114771	114773	114774	the other	738	" Not yet , "
114788	114817	114782	114782	Marianne	85	" but she will be here , I hope , before it is long . It is a great way , you know , from hence to Barton . "
114818	114828	114830	114830	Marianne	85	" But she must not go round by London , "
114838	114851	114830	114830	Marianne	85	" I shall never see her , if she goes by London . "
117262	117279	117246	117246	his	101	" Miss Dashwood , for half an hour for ten minutes I entreat you to stay . "
117280	117285	117286	117286	she	84	" No , sir , "
117291	117328	117286	117286	she	84	" I shall _ not _ stay . Your business can not be with _ me _ . The servants , I suppose , forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house . "
117329	117335	117336	117336	he	101	" Had they told me , "
117341	117374	117336	117336	he	101	" that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil , it would not have turned me from the door . My business is with you , and only you . "
117375	117379	117286	117286	she	84	" With me ! "
117384	117398	117336	117336	he	101	" well , sir , be quick and if you can less violent . "
117399	117409	117336	117336	he	101	" Sit down , and I will be both . "
117508	117515	117517	117517	Elinor	84	" Pray be quick , sir , "
117521	117529	117517	117517	Elinor	84	" I have no time to spare . "
117547	117551	117553	117553	he	101	" Your sister , "
117561	117588	117553	117553	he	101	" is out of danger . I heard it from the servant . God be praised ! But is it true ? is it really true ? "
117603	117622	117553	117553	he	101	" For God s sake tell me , is she out of danger , or is she not ? "
117623	117629	117553	117553	he	101	" We hope she is . "
117640	117659	117666	117666	he	101	" Had I known as much half an hour ago ; but since I _ am _ here , "
117672	117709	117666	117666	he	101	" what does it signify ? For once , Miss Dashwood it will be the last time , perhaps let us be cheerful together . I am in a fine mood for gaiety . Tell me honestly "
117717	117729	117666	117666	he	101	" do you think me most a knave or a fool ? "
117778	117822	117772	117772	she	84	" Mr. Willoughby , I advise you at present to return to Combe . I am not at leisure to remain with you longer . Whatever your business may be with me , it will be better recollected and explained to - morrow . "
117823	117828	117829	117829	he	101	" I understand you , "
117843	117869	117829	117829	he	101	" yes , I am very drunk . A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was enough to over - set me . "
117870	117874	117876	117876	Elinor	84	" At Marlborough ! "
117892	117927	117829	117829	he	101	" Yes , I left London this morning at eight o clock , and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough . "
117975	118029	117966	117966	she	84	" Mr. Willoughby , you _ ought _ to feel , and I certainly _ do _ , that after what has passed , your coming here in this manner , and forcing yourself upon my notice , requires a very particular excuse . What is it , that you mean by it ? "
118030	118034	118036	118036	he	101	" I mean , "
118042	118121	118036	118036	he	101	" if I can , to make you hate me one degree less than you do _ now _ . I mean to offer some kind of explanation , some kind of apology , for the past ; to open my whole heart to you , and by convincing you , that though I have been always a blockhead , I have not been always a rascal , to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma from your sister . "
118122	118132	118166	118166	him	101	" Is this the real reason of your coming ? "
118133	118140	118142	118142	his	101	" Upon my soul it is , "
118169	118195	118166	118166	him	101	" If that is all , you may be satisfied already ; for Marianne _ does _ , she has _ long _ forgiven you . "
118196	118200	118201	118201	he	101	" Has she ? "
118210	118246	118201	118201	he	101	" Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it . But she shall forgive me again , and on more reasonable grounds . _ Now _ will you listen to me ? "
118252	118258	118260	118260	he	101	" I do not know , "
118277	118497	118260	118260	he	101	" how _ you _ may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister , or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me . Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me , it is worth the trial however , and you shall hear every thing . When I first became intimate in your family , I had no other intention , no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire , more pleasantly than I had ever done before . Your sister s lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me ; and her behaviour to me almost from the first , was of a kind it is astonishing , when I reflect on what it was , and what _ she _ was , that my heart should have been so insensible ! But at first I must confess , my vanity only was elevated by it . Careless of her happiness , thinking only of my own amusement , giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging , I endeavoured , by every means in my power , to make myself pleasing to her , without any design of returning her affection . "
118522	118573	118498	118499	Miss Dashwood	79	" It is hardly worth while , Mr. Willoughby , for you to relate , or for me to listen any longer . Such a beginning as this can not be followed by any thing . Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject . "
118574	118585	118586	118586	he	2300	" I insist on you hearing the whole of it , "
118589	118889	118586	118586	he	2300	" My fortune was never large , and I had always been expensive , always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself . Every year since my coming of age , or even before , I believe , had added to my debts ; and though the death of my old cousin , Mrs. Smith , was to set me free ; yet that event being uncertain , and possibly far distant , it had been for some time my intention to re - establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune . To attach myself to your sister , therefore , was not a thing to be thought of ; and with a meanness , selfishness , cruelty , which no indignant , no contemptuous look , even of yours , Miss Dashwood , can ever reprobate too much , I was acting in this manner , trying to engage her regard , without a thought of returning it . But one thing may be said for me : even in that horrid state of selfish vanity , I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated , because I did not _ then _ know what it was to love . But have I ever known it ? Well may it be doubted ; for , had I really loved , could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity , to avarice ? or , what is more , could I have sacrificed hers ? But I have done it . To avoid a comparative poverty , which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors , I have , by raising myself to affluence , lost every thing that could make it a blessing . "
118890	118895	118897	118897	Elinor	84	" You did then , "
118903	118913	118897	118897	Elinor	84	" believe yourself at one time attached to her ? "
118914	119207	119209	119209	he	2301	" To have resisted such attractions , to have withstood such tenderness ! Is there a man on earth who could have done it ? Yes , I found myself , by insensible degrees , sincerely fond of her ; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable , and my feelings blameless . Even _ then _ , however , when fully determined on paying my addresses to her , I allowed myself most improperly to put off , from day to day , the moment of doing it , from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed . I will not reason here nor will I stop for _ you _ to expatiate on the absurdity , and the worse than absurdity , of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound . The event has proved , that I was a cunning fool , providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever . At last , however , my resolution was taken , and I had determined , as soon as I could engage her alone , to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her , and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display . But in the interim in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass , before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private a circumstance occurred an unlucky circumstance , to ruin all my resolution , and with it all my comfort . A discovery took place , "
119215	119257	119258	119258	he	2301	" Mrs. Smith had somehow or other been informed , I imagine by some distant relation , whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour , of an affair , a connection but I need not explain myself farther , "
119273	119287	119258	119258	he	2301	" your particular intimacy you have probably heard the whole story long ago . "
119288	119292	119294	119294	Elinor	84	" I have , "
119310	119340	119301	119301	her	84	" I have heard it all . And how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business , I confess is beyond my comprehension . "
119341	119344	119346	119346	Willoughby	101	" Remember , "
119348	119541	119346	119346	Willoughby	101	" from whom you received the account . Could it be an impartial one ? I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me . I do not mean to justify myself , but at the same time can not leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge that because she was injured she was irreproachable , and because _ I _ was a libertine , _ she _ must be a saint . If the violence of her passions , the weakness of her understanding I do not mean , however , to defend myself . Her affection for me deserved better treatment , and I often , with great self - reproach , recall the tenderness which , for a very short time , had the power of creating any return . I wish I heartily wish it had never been . But I have injured more than herself ; and I have injured one , whose affection for me ( may I say it ? ) was scarcely less warm than hers ; and whose mind Oh ! how infinitely superior ! "
119542	119640	119258	119258	he	2301	" Your indifference , however , towards that unfortunate girl I must say it , unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her . Do not think yourself excused by any weakness , any natural defect of understanding on her side , in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours . You must have known , that while you were enjoying yourself in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes , always gay , always happy , she was reduced to the extremest indigence . "
119641	119656	119657	119657	he	2303	" But , upon my soul , I did _ not _ know it , "
119661	119689	119657	119657	he	2303	" I did not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction ; and common sense might have told her how to find it out . "
119690	119701	119301	119301	her	84	" Well , sir , and what said Mrs. Smith ? "
119702	120118	119657	119657	he	2303	" She taxed me with the offence at once , and my confusion may be guessed . The purity of her life , the formality of her notions , her ignorance of the world every thing was against me . The matter itself I could not deny , and vain was every endeavour to soften it . She was previously disposed , I believe , to doubt the morality of my conduct in general , and was moreover discontented with the very little attention , the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her , in my present visit . In short , it ended in a total breach . By one measure I might have saved myself . In the height of her morality , good woman ! she offered to forgive the past , if I would marry Eliza . That could not be and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house . The night following this affair I was to go the next morning was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be . The struggle was great but it ended too soon . My affection for Marianne , my thorough conviction of her attachment to me it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty , or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches , which I was naturally inclined to feel , and expensive society had increased . I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife , if I chose to address her , and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do . A heavy scene however awaited me , before I could leave Devonshire ; I was engaged to dine with you on that very day ; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement . But whether I should write this apology , or deliver it in person , was a point of long debate . To see Marianne , I felt , would be dreadful , and I even doubted whether I could see her again , and keep to my resolution . In that point , however , I undervalued my own magnanimity , as the event declared ; for I went , I saw her , and saw her miserable , and left her miserable and left her hoping never to see her again . "
120119	120128	120130	120130	Elinor	84	" Why did you call , Mr. Willoughby ? "
120134	120150	120130	120130	Elinor	84	" a note would have answered every purpose . Why was it necessary to call ? "
120151	120393	119657	119657	he	2303	" It was necessary to my own pride . I could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you , or the rest of the neighbourhood , to suspect any part of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage , in my way to Honiton . The sight of your dear sister , however , was really dreadful ; and , to heighten the matter , I found her alone . You were all gone I do not know where . I had left her only the evening before , so fully , so firmly resolved within my self on doing right ! A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever ; and I remember how happy , how gay were my spirits , as I walked from the cottage to Allenham , satisfied with myself , delighted with every body ! But in this , our last interview of friendship , I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling . Her sorrow , her disappointment , her deep regret , when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately I never shall forget it united too with such reliance , such confidence in me ! Oh , God ! what a hard - hearted rascal I was ! "
120407	120418	119657	119657	he	2303	" Did you tell her that you should soon return ? "
120419	120429	120430	120430	he	2305	" I do not know what I told her , "
120435	120640	120430	120430	he	2305	" less than was due to the past , beyond a doubt , and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future . I can not think of it . It won t do . Then came your dear mother to torture me farther , with all her kindness and confidence . Thank Heaven ! it _ did _ torture me . I was miserable . Miss Dashwood , you can not have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery . I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid , rascally folly of my own heart , that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now . Well , I went , left all that I loved , and went to those to whom , at best , I was only indifferent . My journey to town travelling with my own horses , and therefore so tediously no creature to speak to my own reflections so cheerful when I looked forward every thing so inviting ! when I looked back at Barton , the picture so soothing ! oh , it was a blessed journey ! "
120644	120649	120651	120651	Elinor	84	" Well , sir , "
120665	120671	120651	120651	Elinor	84	" and this is all ? "
120672	120695	120872	120872	her	84	" All ! no : have you forgot what passed in town ? That infamous letter ? Did she show it you ? "
120696	120706	120651	120651	Elinor	84	" Yes , I saw every note that passed . "
120707	120845	120872	120872	her	84	" When the first of hers reached me ( as it immediately did , for I was in town the whole time , ) what I felt is in the common phrase , not to be expressed ; in a more simple one perhaps too simple to raise any emotion my feelings were very , very painful . Every line , every word was in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer , were she here , would forbid a dagger to my heart . To know that Marianne was in town was in the same language a thunderbolt . Thunderbolts and daggers ! what a reproof would she have given me ! her taste , her opinions I believe they are better known to me than my own , and I am sure they are dearer . "
120885	120914	120872	120872	her	84	" This is not right , Mr. Willoughby . Remember that you are married . Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear . "
120915	121217	120872	120872	her	84	" Marianne s note , by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse . I say awakened , because time and London , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and I had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me ; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married . But this note made me know myself better . I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world , and that I was using her infamously . But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me . To retreat was impossible . All that I had to do , was to avoid you both . I sent no answer to Marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street ; but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , I watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name . "
121218	121226	120872	120872	her	84	" Watched us out of the house ! "
121227	121789	120872	120872	her	84	" Even so . You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you , how often I was on the point of falling in with you . I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight , as the carriage drove by . Lodging as I did in Bond Street , there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you ; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side , a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight , could have separated us so long . I avoided the Middletons as much as possible , as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common . Not aware of their being in town , however , I blundered on Sir John , I believe , the first day of his coming , and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings s. He asked me to a party , a dance at his house in the evening . Had he _ not _ told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there , I should have felt it too certain a thing , to trust myself near him . The next morning brought another short note from Marianne still affectionate , open , artless , confiding everything that could make _ my _ conduct most hateful . I could not answer it . I tried but could not frame a sentence . But I thought of her , I believe , every moment of the day . If you _ can _ pity me , Miss Dashwood , pity my situation as it was _ then _ . With my head and heart full of your sister , I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman ! Those three or four weeks were worse than all . Well , at last , as I need not tell you , you were forced on me ; and what a sweet figure I cut ! what an evening of agony it was ! Marianne , beautiful as an angel on one side , calling me Willoughby in such a tone ! Oh , God ! holding out her hand to me , asking me for an explanation , with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face ! and Sophia , jealous as the devil on the other hand , looking all that was Well , it does not signify ; it is over now . Such an evening ! I ran away from you all as soon as I could ; but not before I had seen Marianne s sweet face as white as death . _ That _ was the last , last look I ever had of her ; the last manner in which she appeared to me . It was a horrid sight ! yet when I thought of her to - day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world . She was before me , constantly before me , as I travelled , in the same look and hue . "
121807	121829	121801	121801	himself	101	" Well , let me make haste and be gone . Your sister is certainly better , certainly out of danger ? "
121830	121837	121801	121801	himself	101	" We are assured of it . "
121838	121849	121801	121801	himself	101	" Your poor mother , too ! doting on Marianne . "
121850	121871	121801	121801	himself	101	" But the letter , Mr. Willoughby , your own letter ; have you any thing to say about that ? "
121872	122093	121801	121801	himself	101	" Yes , yes , _ that _ in particular . Your sister wrote to me again , you know , the very next morning . You saw what she said . I was breakfasting at the Ellisons , and her letter , with some others , was brought to me there from my lodgings . It happened to catch Sophia s eye before it caught mine and its size , the elegance of the paper , the hand - writing altogether , immediately gave her a suspicion . Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire , and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was , and made her more jealous than ever . Affecting that air of playfulness , therefore , which is delightful in a woman one loves , she opened the letter directly , and read its contents . She was well paid for her impudence . She read what made her wretched . Her wretchedness I could have borne , but her passion her malice At all events it must be appeased . And , in short what do you think of my wife s style of letter - writing ? delicate tender truly feminine was it not ? "
122094	122108	121801	121801	himself	101	" Your wife ! The letter was in your own hand - writing . "
122109	122429	121801	121801	himself	101	" Yes , but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to . The original was all her own her own happy thoughts and gentle diction . But what could I do ! we were engaged , every thing in preparation , the day almost fixed But I am talking like a fool . Preparation ! Day ! In honest words , her money was necessary to me , and in a situation like mine , any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture . And after all , what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends , in what language my answer was couched ? It must have been only to one end . My business was to declare myself a scoundrel , and whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance . I am ruined for ever in their opinion , said I to myself : I am shut out for ever from their society , they already think me an unprincipled fellow , this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one . Such were my reasonings , as , in a sort of desperate carelessness , I copied my wife s words , and parted with the last relics of Marianne . Her three notes , unluckily they were all in my pocketbook , or I should have denied their existence , and hoarded them for ever , I was forced to put them up , and could not even kiss them . And the lock of hair that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket - book , which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence , the dear lock , all , every memento was torn from me . "
122430	122442	122444	122444	Elinor	84	" You are very wrong , Mr. Willoughby , very blamable , "
122460	122551	122444	122444	Elinor	84	" you ought not to speak in this way , either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister . You had made your own choice . It was not forced on you . Your wife has a claim to your politeness , to your respect , at least . She must be attached to you , or she would not have married you . To treat her with unkindness , to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience . "
122552	122562	122564	122564	he	2308	" Do not talk to me of my wife , "
122570	122673	122564	122564	he	2308	" she does not deserve your compassion . She knew I had no regard for her when we married . Well , married we were , and came down to Combe Magna to be happy , and afterwards returned to town to be gay . And now do you pity me , Miss Dashwood ? Or have I said all this to no purpose ? Am I , be it only one degree , am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before ? My intentions were not always wrong . Have I explained away any part of my guilt ? "
122674	122734	122444	122444	Elinor	84	" Yes , you have certainly removed something a little . You have proved yourself , on the whole , less faulty than I had believed you . You have proved your heart less wicked , much less wicked . But I hardly know the misery that you have inflicted I hardly know what could have made it worse . "
122735	122855	122564	122564	he	2308	" Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered , what I have been telling you ? Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours . You tell me that she has forgiven me already . Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart , and of my present feelings , will draw from her a more spontaneous , more natural , more gentle , less dignified , forgiveness . Tell her of my misery and my penitence tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her , and if you will , that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever . "
122856	122898	122444	122444	Elinor	84	" I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification . But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now , nor how you heard of her illness . "
122899	123214	122564	122564	he	2308	" Last night , in Drury Lane lobby , I ran against Sir John Middleton , and when he saw who I was , for the first time these two months , he spoke to me . That he had cut me ever since my marriage , I had seen without surprise or resentment . Now , however , his good - natured , honest , stupid soul , full of indignation against me , and concern for your sister , could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to , though probably he did not think it _ would _ , vex me horridly . As bluntly as he could speak it , therefore , he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent the Palmers are all gone off in a fright , & c. I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John . His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill - will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy . What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying , and dying too , believing me the greatest villain upon earth , scorning , hating me in her latest moments for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed ? _ One _ person I was sure would represent me as capable of anything What I felt was dreadful ! My resolution was soon made , and at eight o clock this morning I was in my carriage . Now you know all . "
123471	123485	123448	123448	Willoughby	101	" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off . "
123486	123494	123448	123448	Willoughby	101	" Are you going back to town ? "
123495	123519	123448	123448	Willoughby	101	" No to Combe Magna . I have business there ; from thence to town in a day or two . Good bye . "
123541	123556	123558	123558	he	2309	" And you _ do _ think something better of me than you did ? "
123623	123628	123630	123630	he	2309	" As to that , "
123632	123719	123630	123630	he	2309	" I must rub through the world as well as I can . Domestic happiness is out of the question . If , however , I am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions , it may be the means it may put me on my guard at least , it may be something to live for . Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever . Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again "
123727	123730	123731	123731	he	2309	" Well , "
123733	123752	123630	123630	he	2309	" once more good bye . I shall now go away and live in dread of one event . "
123753	123759	123877	123877	her	84	" What do you mean ? "
123760	123766	123630	123630	he	2309	" Your sister s marriage . "
123767	123786	123877	123877	her	84	" You are very wrong . She can never be more lost to you than she is now . "
123787	123852	123630	123630	he	2309	" But she will be gained by some one else . And if that some one should be the very he whom , of all others , I could least bear but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill , by showing that where I have most injured I can least forgive . Good bye , God bless you ! "
124614	124618	124612	124612	Willoughby	101	" poor Willoughby , "
125019	125050	125051	125052	Her daughter	371	" At last we are alone . My Elinor , you do not yet know all my happiness . Colonel Brandon loves Marianne . He has told me so himself . "
125072	125138	125051	125052	Her daughter	371	" You are never like me , dear Elinor , or I should wonder at your composure now . Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family , I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon s marrying one of you as the object most desirable . And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two . "
125204	125326	125196	125196	she	296	" He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled . It came out quite unawares , quite undesignedly . I , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child ; he could not conceal his distress ; I saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy or rather , not thinking at all , I suppose giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for Marianne . He has loved her , my Elinor , ever since the first moment of seeing her . "
125367	125455	125196	125196	she	296	" His regard for her , infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned , as much more warm , as more sincere or constant which ever we are to call it has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne s unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man ! and without selfishness without encouraging a hope ! could he have seen her happy with another Such a noble mind ! such openness , such sincerity ! no one can be deceived in _ him _ . "
125456	125462	125464	125464	Elinor	84	" Colonel Brandon s character , "
125466	125476	125464	125464	Elinor	84	" as an excellent man , is well established . "
125477	125483	125485	125486	her mother	296	" I know it is , "
125489	125545	125485	125486	her mother	296	" or after such a warning , _ I _ should be the last to encourage such affection , or even to be pleased by it . But his coming for me as he did , with such active , such ready friendship , is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men . "
125546	125552	125554	125554	Elinor	84	" His character , however , "
125556	125681	125554	125554	Elinor	84	" does not rest on _ one _ act of kindness , to which his affection for Marianne , were humanity out of the case , would have prompted him . To Mrs. Jennings , to the Middletons , he has been long and intimately known ; they equally love and respect him ; and even my own knowledge of him , though lately acquired , is very considerable ; and so highly do _ I _ value and esteem him , that if Marianne can be happy with him , I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world . What answer did you give him ? Did you allow him to hope ? "
125682	125847	125485	125486	her mother	296	" Oh ! my love , I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself . Marianne might at that moment be dying . But he did not ask for hope or encouragement . His was an involuntary confidence , an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend , not an application to a parent . Yet after a time I _ did _ say , for at first I was quite overcome , that if she lived , as I trusted she might , my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage ; and since our arrival , since our delightful security , I have repeated it to him more fully , have given him every encouragement in my power . Time , a very little time , I tell him , will do everything ; Marianne s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby . His own merits must soon secure it . "
125848	125868	125554	125554	Elinor	84	" To judge from the Colonel s spirits , however , you have not yet made him equally sanguine . "
125869	126044	125485	125486	her mother	296	" No . He thinks Marianne s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time , and even supposing her heart again free , is too diffident of himself to believe , that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her . There , however , he is quite mistaken . His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage , as to make his character and principles fixed ; and his disposition , I am well convinced , is exactly the very one to make your sister happy . And his person , his manners too , are all in his favour . My partiality does not blind me ; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby ; but at the same time , there is something much more pleasing in his countenance . There was always a something , if you remember , in Willoughby s eyes at times , which I did not like . "
126065	126187	126054	126055	her mother	296	" And his manners , the Colonel s manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby s ever were , but they are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching to Marianne . Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness , often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other . I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with _ him _ as she will be with Colonel Brandon . "
126213	126227	126229	126230	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" At Delaford , she will be within an easy distance of me , "
126232	126281	126229	126230	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" even if I remain at Barton ; and in all probability , for I hear it is a large village , indeed there certainly _ must _ be some small house or cottage close by , that would suit us quite as well as our present situation . "
126302	126348	126229	126230	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" His fortune too ! for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about _ that ; _ and though I neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , I am sure it must be a good one . "
127553	127567	127569	127569	she	85	" When the weather is settled , and I have recovered my strength , "
127571	127793	127569	127569	she	85	" we will take long walks together every day . We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down , and see how the children go on ; we will walk to Sir John s new plantations at Barton Cross , and the Abbeyland ; and we will often go to the old ruins of the Priory , and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached . I know we shall be happy . I know the summer will pass happily away . I mean never to be later in rising than six , and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading . I have formed my plan , and am determined to enter on a course of serious study . Our own library is too well known to me , to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement . But there are many works well worth reading at the Park ; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon . By reading only six hours a - day , I shall gain in the course of a twelve - month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want . "
128072	128078	128068	128068	Marianne	85	" There , exactly there , "
128084	128101	128068	128068	Marianne	85	" on that projecting mound , there I fell ; and there I first saw Willoughby . "
128115	128143	128112	128112	she	85	" I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot ! shall we ever talk on that subject , Elinor ? "
128149	128174	128112	128112	she	85	" Or will it be wrong ? I _ can _ talk of it now , I hope , as I ought to do . "
128183	128188	128190	128190	Marianne	85	" As for regret , "
128192	128303	128190	128190	Marianne	85	" I have done with that , as far as _ he _ is concerned . I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him , but what they are _ now _ . At present , if I could be satisfied on one point , if I could be allowed to think that he was not _ always _ acting a part , not _ always _ deceiving me ; but above all , if I could be assured that he never was so _ very _ wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him , since the story of that unfortunate girl "
128316	128332	128313	128313	she	84	" If you could be assured of that , you think you should be easy . "
128333	128402	128313	128313	she	84	" Yes . My peace of mind is doubly involved in it ; for not only is it horrible to suspect a person , who has been what _ he _ has been to _ me _ , of such designs , but what must it make me appear to myself ? What in a situation like mine , but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to "
128403	128407	128409	128410	her sister	301	" How then , "
128412	128420	128409	128410	her sister	301	" would you account for his behaviour ? "
128421	128444	128460	128460	her	84	" I would suppose him , Oh , how gladly would I suppose him , only fickle , very , very fickle . "
128485	128495	128497	128497	Marianne	85	" I am not wishing him too much good , "
128504	128527	128497	128497	Marianne	85	" when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own . He will suffer enough in them . "
128528	128537	128475	128475	they	2406	" Do you compare your conduct with his ? "
128538	128558	128497	128497	Marianne	85	" No . I compare it with what it ought to have been ; I compare it with yours . "
128559	128567	128475	128475	they	2406	" Our situations have borne little resemblance . "
128568	129167	128497	128497	Marianne	85	" They have borne more than our conduct . Do not , my dearest Elinor , let your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure . My illness has made me think . It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection . Long before I was enough recovered to talk , I was perfectly able to reflect . I considered the past : I saw in my own behaviour , since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn , nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself , and want of kindness to others . I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings , and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave . My illness , I well knew , had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health , as I had felt even at the time to be wrong . Had I died , it would have been self - destruction . I did not know my danger till the danger was removed ; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me , I wonder at my recovery , wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live , to have time for atonement to my God , and to you all , did not kill me at once . Had I died , in what peculiar misery should I have left you , my nurse , my friend , my sister ! You , who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days ; who had known all the murmurings of my heart ! How should I have lived in _ your _ remembrance ! My mother too ! How could you have consoled her ! I can not express my own abhorrence of myself . Whenever I looked towards the past , I saw some duty neglected , or some failing indulged . Every body seemed injured by me . The kindness , the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings , I had repaid with ungrateful contempt . To the Middletons , to the Palmers , the Steeles , to every common acquaintance even , I had been insolent and unjust ; with a heart hardened against their merits , and a temper irritated by their very attention . To John , to Fanny , yes , even to them , little as they deserve , I had given less than their due . But you , you above all , above my mother , had been wronged by me . I , and only I , knew your heart and its sorrows ; yet to what did it influence me ? not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself . Your example was before me ; but to what avail ? Was I more considerate of you and your comfort ? Did I imitate your forbearance , or lessen your restraints , by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone ? No ; not less when I knew you to be unhappy , than when I had believed you at ease , did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship ; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me , regretting only _ that _ heart which had deserted and wronged me , and leaving you , for whom I professed an unbounded affection , to be miserable for my sake . "
129217	129418	129210	129210	Marianne	85	" You are very good . The future must be my proof . I have laid down my plan , and if I am capable of adhering to it my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved . They shall no longer worry others , nor torture myself . I shall now live solely for my family . You , my mother , and Margaret , must henceforth be all the world to me ; you will share my affections entirely between you . From you , from my home , I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move ; and if I do mix in other society , it will be only to show that my spirit is humbled , my heart amended , and that I can practise the civilities , the lesser duties of life , with gentleness and forbearance . As for Willoughby to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him , would be idle . His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions . But it shall be regulated , it shall be checked by religion , by reason , by constant employment . "
129428	129444	129419	129419	She	2408	" If I could but know _ his _ heart , everything would become easy . "
129712	129716	129696	129696	Marianne	85	" Tell mama , "
130087	130095	130097	130097	she	85	" I wish to assure you both , "
130099	130113	130097	130097	she	85	" that I see every thing as you can desire me to do . "
130153	130178	130191	130191	she	85	" It is a great relief to me what Elinor told me this morning I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear . "
130200	130257	130191	130191	she	85	" I am now perfectly satisfied , I wish for no change . I never could have been happy with him , after knowing , as sooner or later I must have known , all this . I should have had no confidence , no esteem . Nothing could have done it away to my feelings . "
130258	130266	130268	130269	her mother	296	" I know it I know it , "
130271	130338	130268	130269	her mother	296	" Happy with a man of libertine practices ! With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends , and the best of men ! No my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man ! Her conscience , her sensitive conscience , would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt . "
130345	130352	130339	130339	Marianne	85	" I wish for no change . "
130353	130359	130361	130361	Elinor	84	" You consider the matter , "
130363	130665	130361	130361	Elinor	84	" exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it ; and I dare say you perceive , as well as myself , not only in this , but in many other circumstances , reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments , in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection , on his side , much less certain . Had you married , you must have been always poor . His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself , and his whole conduct declares that self - denial is a word hardly understood by him . His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the _ less _ grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before . _ Your _ sense of honour and honesty would have led you , I know , when aware of your situation , to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible : and , perhaps , as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort , you might have been suffered to practice it , but beyond that and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage ? Beyond _ that _ , had you endeavoured , however reasonably , to abridge _ his _ enjoyments , is it not to be feared , that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it , you would have lessened your own influence on his heart , and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties ? "
130676	130679	130672	130672	she	85	" Selfish ? "
130685	130693	130672	130672	she	85	" do you really think him selfish ? "
130694	130701	130703	130703	Elinor	84	" The whole of his behaviour , "
130705	130778	130703	130703	Elinor	84	" from the beginning to the end of the affair , has been grounded on selfishness . It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections ; which afterwards , when his own were engaged , made him delay the confession of it , and which finally carried him from Barton . His own enjoyment , or his own ease , was , in every particular , his ruling principle . "
130779	130794	130672	130672	she	85	" It is very true . _ My _ happiness never was his object . "
130795	130799	130801	130801	Elinor	84	" At present , "
130803	130974	130801	130801	Elinor	84	" he regrets what he has done . And why does he regret it ? Because he finds it has not answered towards himself . It has not made him happy . His circumstances are now unembarrassed he suffers from no evil of that kind ; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself . But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy ? The inconveniences would have been different . He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing . He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint , but he would have been always necessitous always poor ; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance , even to domestic happiness , than the mere temper of a wife . "
130975	130984	130986	130986	Marianne	85	" I have not a doubt of it , "
130988	131001	130986	130986	Marianne	85	" and I have nothing to regret nothing but my own folly . "
131002	131013	131015	131016	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" Rather say your mother s imprudence , my child , "
131018	131026	131015	131016	Mrs. Dashwood	83	" _ she _ must be answerable . "
131073	131131	131061	131061	she	84	" _ One _ observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story that all Willoughby s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams . That crime has been the origin of every lesser one , and of all his present discontents . "
131362	131391	131406	131406	his	89	" We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward , and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject , but conclude him to be still at Oxford ; "
131480	131495	131476	131476	his	89	" I suppose you know , ma am , that Mr. Ferrars is married . "
131706	131718	131659	131659	her	84	" Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married , Thomas ? "
131719	131916	131659	131659	her	84	" I see Mr. Ferrars myself , ma am , this morning in Exeter , and his lady too , Miss Steele as was . They was stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn , as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother , who is one of the post - boys . I happened to look up as I went by the chaise , and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele ; so I took off my hat , and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars s , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they d make sure to come and see you . "
131917	131929	131659	131659	her	84	" But did she tell you she was married , Thomas ? "
131930	131982	131659	131659	her	84	" Yes , ma am . She smiled , and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts . She was always a very affable and free - spoken young lady , and very civil behaved . So , I made free to wish her joy . "
131983	131993	131659	131659	her	84	" Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her ? "
131994	132025	131659	131659	her	84	" Yes , ma am , I just see him leaning back in it , but he did not look up ; he never was a gentleman much for talking . "
132048	132058	131659	131659	her	84	" Was there no one else in the carriage ? "
132059	132069	131659	131659	her	84	" No , ma am , only they two . "
132070	132079	131659	131659	her	84	" Do you know where they came from ? "
132080	132095	131659	131659	her	84	" They come straight from town , as Miss Lucy Mrs. Ferrars told me . "
132096	132104	131659	131659	her	84	" And are they going farther westward ? "
132105	132133	131659	131659	her	84	" Yes , ma am but not to bide long . They will soon be back again , and then they d be sure and call here . "
132214	132226	132198	132198	Thomas	169	" Did you see them off , before you came away ? "
132227	132254	132198	132198	Thomas	169	" No , ma am the horses were just coming out , but I could not bide any longer ; I was afraid of being late . "
132255	132262	132198	132198	Thomas	169	" Did Mrs. Ferrars look well ? "
132263	132295	132198	132198	Thomas	169	" Yes , ma am , she said how she was very well ; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady and she seemed vastly contented . "
133061	133073	133167	133167	she	84	" When do you write to Colonel Brandon , ma am ? "
133091	133142	133167	133167	she	84	" I wrote to him , my love , last week , and rather expect to see , than to hear from him again . I earnestly pressed his coming to us , and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow , or any day . "
133275	133303	133268	133268	She	84	" He comes from Mr. Pratt s purposely to see us . I _ will _ be calm ; I _ will _ be mistress of myself . "
133738	133745	133731	133731	her	84	" Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple ? "
133746	133750	133751	133751	he	2475	" At Longstaple ! "
133760	133769	133751	133751	he	2475	" No , my mother is in town . "
133770	133774	133776	133776	Elinor	84	" I meant , "
133786	133796	133776	133776	Elinor	84	" to enquire for Mrs. _ Edward _ Ferrars . "
133832	133847	133815	133815	He	2475	" Perhaps you mean my brother you mean Mrs. Mrs. _ Robert _ Ferrars . "
133848	133853	133859	133860	her mother	296	" Mrs. Robert Ferrars ! "
133946	133973	133936	133936	he	2475	" Perhaps you do not know : you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to to the youngest to Miss Lucy Steele . "
134011	134014	134016	134016	he	2475	" Yes , "
134018	134031	134016	134016	he	2475	" they were married last week , and are now at Dawlish . "
134620	134632	134634	134634	he	2475	" It was a foolish , idle inclination on my side , "
134636	135009	134634	134634	he	2475	" the consequence of ignorance of the world , and want of employment . Had my mother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr. Pratt , I think , nay , I am sure , it would never have happened ; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought , at the time , a most unconquerable preference for his niece , yet had I then had any pursuit , any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months , I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment , especially by mixing more with the world , as in such case I must have done . But instead of having any thing to do , instead of having any profession chosen for me , or being allowed to chuse any myself , I returned home to be completely idle ; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment , which belonging to the university would have given me ; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen . I had therefore nothing in the world to do , but to fancy myself in love ; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable , as I had no friend , no companion in my brother , and disliked new acquaintance , it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple , where I always felt myself at home , and was always sure of a welcome ; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen : Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging . She was pretty too at least I thought so _ then ; _ and I had seen so little of other women , that I could make no comparisons , and see no defects . Considering everything , therefore , I hope , foolish as our engagement was , foolish as it has since in every way been proved , it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly . "
135686	135695	135697	135697	his	2502	" _ That _ was exactly like Robert , "
135701	135707	135708	135708	he	2502	" And _ that _ , "
135712	135752	135708	135708	he	2502	" might perhaps be in _ his _ head when the acquaintance between them first began . And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour . Other designs might afterward arise . "
135892	135896	135883	135883	He	2502	" DEAR SIR , "
136080	136092	136093	136094	LUCY FERRARS	93	" Your sincere well - wisher , friend , and sister , "
136096	136131	136093	136094	LUCY FERRARS	93	" I have burnt all your letters , and will return your picture the first opportunity . Please to destroy my scrawls but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep . "
136141	136154	136156	136156	Edward	202	" I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition , "
136158	136245	136156	136156	Edward	202	" For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by _ you _ in former days . In a sister it is bad enough , but in a wife ! how I have blushed over the pages of her writing ! and I believe I may say that since the first half year of our foolish business this is the only letter I ever received from her , of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style . "
136246	136254	136256	136256	Elinor	84	" However it may have come about , "
136262	136360	136256	136256	Elinor	84	" they are certainly married . And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment . The independence she settled on Robert , through resentment against you , has put it in his power to make his own choice ; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a - year , to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do . She will hardly be less hurt , I suppose , by Robert s marrying Lucy , than she would have been by your marrying her . "
136361	136396	136416	136419	any of his family	2529	" She will be more hurt by it , for Robert always was her favourite . She will be more hurt by it , and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner . "
136786	136793	136795	136795	he	2530	" I thought it my duty , "
136797	136959	136795	136795	he	2530	" independent of my feelings , to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not , when I was renounced by my mother , and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me . In such a situation as that , where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature , how could I suppose , when she so earnestly , so warmly insisted on sharing my fate , whatever it might be , that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement ? And even now , I can not comprehend on what motive she acted , or what fancied advantage it could be to her , to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard , and who had only two thousand pounds in the world . She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living . "
136960	137051	137085	137085	him	2538	" No ; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour ; that your own family might in time relent . And at any rate , she lost nothing by continuing the engagement , for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions . The connection was certainly a respectable one , and probably gained her consideration among her friends ; and , if nothing more advantageous occurred , it would be better for her to marry _ you _ than be single . "
137118	137126	137128	137128	she	84	" Your behaviour was certainly very wrong , "
137130	137168	137128	137128	she	84	" because to say nothing of my own conviction , our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect _ what _ , as you were _ then _ situated , could never be . "
137191	137333	137128	137128	she	84	" I was simple enough to think , that because my _ faith _ was plighted to another , there could be no danger in my being with you ; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour . I felt that I admired you , but I told myself it was only friendship ; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and Lucy , I did not know how far I was got . After that , I suppose , I _ was _ wrong in remaining so much in Sussex , and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it , were no better than these : The danger is my own ; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself . "
137389	137395	137397	137397	he	2541	" Which , at present , "
137399	137423	137397	137397	he	2541	" after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion , he must think I have never forgiven him for offering . "
138179	138184	138185	138185	she	98	" I do think , "
138188	138400	138185	138185	she	98	" nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me . Not a soul suspected anything of the matter , not even Nancy , who , poor soul ! came crying to me the day after , in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars , as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth ; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married , on purpose we suppose to make a show with , and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world ; so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter , where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess , in hopes , as I tell her , to fall in with the Doctor again . And I must say that Lucy s crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all . Poor Mr. Edward ! I can not get him out of my head , but you must send for him to Barton , and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him . "
138587	138718	138583	138583	He	80	" Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward s name , which does not surprise us ; but , to our great astonishment , not a line has been received from him on the occasion . Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shown to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars s heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children . "
138755	138762	138764	138764	he	2572	" A letter of proper submission ! "
138766	138839	138764	138764	he	2572	" would they have me beg my mother s pardon for Robert s ingratitude to _ her _ , and breach of honour to _ me ? _ I can make no submission . I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed . I am grown very happy ; but that would not interest . I know of no submission that _ is _ proper for me to make . "
138840	138849	138851	138851	Elinor	84	" You may certainly ask to be forgiven , "
138853	138891	138851	138851	Elinor	84	" because you have offended ; and I should think you might _ now _ venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother s anger . "
138898	138931	138764	138764	he	2572	" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in _ her _ eyes as the first . "
139008	139019	139021	139021	Marianne	85	" And if they really _ do _ interest themselves , "
139030	139051	139021	139021	Marianne	85	" in bringing about a reconciliation , I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit . "
139934	139948	139950	139950	John	83	" I will not say that I am disappointed , my dear sister , "
139966	140161	139950	139950	John	83	" _ that _ would be saying too much , for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world , as it is . But , I confess , it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother . His property here , his place , his house , every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition ! And his woods , I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire , as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger ! And though , perhaps , Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him , yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you , for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home , nobody can tell what may happen ; for , when people are much thrown together , and see little of anybody else , and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage , and so forth . In short , you may as well give her a chance : you understand me . "
