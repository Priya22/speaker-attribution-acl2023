3055	3059	3061	3062	the stranger	152	" None whatever , "
3064	3070	3071	3071	he	161	" Though , I understand , "
3078	3093	3071	3071	he	161	" that this room is really to be mine for my own private use . "
3094	3100	3102	3103	Mrs. Hall	71	" I thought , sir , "
3105	3111	3102	3103	Mrs. Hall	71	" you d prefer the clock "
3112	3115	3117	3118	the stranger	152	" Certainly , "

3202	3206	3207	3207	he	152	" And presently , "
3210	3239	3207	3207	he	152	" when the clock - mending is over , I think I should like to have some tea . But not till the clock - mending is over . "
3310	3319	3320	3320	he	74	" You are certain that is the earliest ? "
3332	3337	3338	3338	he	74	" I should explain , "
3341	3361	3338	3338	he	74	" what I was really too cold and fatigued to do before , that I am an experimental investigator . "
3362	3367	3369	3370	Mrs. Hall	71	" Indeed , sir , "
3375	3384	3338	3338	he	74	" And my baggage contains apparatus and appliances . "
3385	3395	3397	3398	Mrs. Hall	71	" Very useful things indeed they are , sir , "
3400	3414	3338	3338	he	74	" And I m very naturally anxious to get on with my inquiries . "
3415	3421	3338	3338	he	74	" Of course , sir . "
3422	3430	3431	3431	he	74	" My reason for coming to Iping , "
3441	3468	3431	3431	he	74	" was ... a desire for solitude . I do not wish to be disturbed in my work . In addition to my work , an accident "
3469	3475	3477	3478	Mrs. Hall	71	" I thought as much , "
3482	3558	3431	3431	he	74	" necessitates a certain retirement . My eyes are sometimes so weak and painful that I have to shut myself up in the dark for hours together . Lock myself up . Sometimes now and then . Not at present , certainly . At such times the slightest disturbance , the entry of a stranger into the room , is a source of excruciating annoyance to me it is well these things should be understood . "
3559	3564	3566	3567	Mrs. Hall	71	" Certainly , sir , "
3569	3580	3566	3567	Mrs. Hall	71	" And if I might make so bold as to ask "
3581	3589	3591	3592	the stranger	152	" That I think , is all , "
3893	3896	3897	3897	he	74	" The weather "
3900	3909	3911	3913	the rigid figure	215	" Why don t you finish and go ? "
3924	3946	3911	3913	the rigid figure	215	" All you ve got to do is to fix the hour - hand on its axle . You re simply humbugging "
3947	3957	3959	3960	Mr. Henfrey	74	" Certainly , sir one minute more . I overlooked "
3972	3976	3978	3979	Mr. Henfrey	74	" Damn it ! "
3992	4004	3978	3979	Mr. Henfrey	74	" a man must do a clock at times , surely . "
4008	4019	3978	3979	Mr. Henfrey	74	" Can t a man look at you ? Ugly ! "
4024	4043	3978	3979	Mr. Henfrey	74	" Seemingly not . If the police was wanting you you couldn t be more wropped and bandaged . "

4225	4252	4223	4223	Henfrey	74	" But women are that trustful where strangers are concerned . He s took your rooms and he ain t even given a name , Hall . "
4253	4260	4262	4262	Hall	71	" You don t say so ! "
4272	4275	4277	4277	Teddy	74	" Yes , "
4279	4329	4277	4277	Teddy	74	" By the week . Whatever he is , you can t get rid of him under the week . And he s got a lot of luggage coming to - morrow , so he says . Let s hope it won t be stones in boxes , Hall . "

5580	5590	5592	5593	Mr. Huxter	80	" He ought to have it cauterised at once , "

6197	6226	6175	6175	he	152	" Perhaps you did . But in my investigations my really very urgent and necessary investigations the slightest disturbance , the jar of a door I must ask you "
6227	6249	6175	6175	he	152	" Certainly , sir . You can turn the lock if you re like that , you know . Any time . "
6250	6256	6258	6259	the stranger	152	" A very good idea , "
6261	6276	6175	6175	he	152	" This stror , sir , if I might make so bold as to remark "
6277	6292	6294	6294	he	152	" Don t. If the straw makes trouble put it down in the bill . "
6342	6358	6336	6336	she	71	" In which case , I should like to know , sir , what you consider "

6374	6379	6381	6382	Mrs. Hall	71	" So be it , "
6399	6407	6381	6382	Mrs. Hall	71	" If you re satisfied , of course "
6486	6492	6493	6493	she	71	" something was the matter , "

You d have expected a sort of pinky to show , wouldn t you ? Well there wasn t none . Just blackness . I tell you , he s as black as my hat . "
6829	6833	6835	6835	Henfrey	74	" My sakes ! "
6837	6855	6835	6835	Henfrey	74	" It s a rummy case altogether . Why , his nose is as pink as paint ! "
6856	6861	6863	6863	Fearenside	79	" That s true , "
6865	6945	6863	6863	Fearenside	79	" I knows that . And I tell ee what I m thinking . That marn s a piebald , Teddy . Black here and white there in patches . And he s ashamed of it . He s a kind of half - breed , and the colour s come off patchy instead of mixing . I ve heard of such things before . And it s the common way with horses , as any one can see . "
7102	7108	7110	7111	Mrs. Hall	71	" Wait till the summer , "
7114	7151	7110	7111	Mrs. Hall	71	" when the artisks are beginning to come . Then we ll see . He may be a bit overbearing , but bills settled punctual is bills settled punctual , whatever you d like to say . "

8624	8628	8629	8629	he	82	" Went in , "
8632	8946	8629	8629	he	82	" and began to demand a subscription for that Nurse Fund . He d stuck his hands in his pockets as I came in , and he sat down lumpily in his chair . Sniffed . I told him I d heard he took an interest in scientific things . He said yes . Sniffed again . Kept on sniffing all the time ; evidently recently caught an infernal cold . No wonder , wrapped up like that ! I developed the nurse idea , and all the while kept my eyes open . Bottles chemicals everywhere . Balance , test - tubes in stands , and a smell of evening primrose . Would he subscribe ? Said he d consider it . Asked him , point - blank , was he researching . Said he was . A long research ? Got quite cross . A damnable long research , said he , blowing the cork out , so to speak . Oh , said I. And out came the grievance . The man was just on the boil , and my question boiled him over . He had been given a prescription , most valuable prescription what for he wouldn t say . Was it medical ? Damn you ! What are you fishing after ? I apologised . Dignified sniff and cough . He resumed . He d read it . Five ingredients . Put it down ; turned his head . Draught of air from window lifted the paper . Swish , rustle . He was working in a room with an open fireplace , he said . Saw a flicker , and there was the prescription burning and lifting chimneyward . Rushed towards it just as it whisked up the chimney . So ! Just at that point , to illustrate his story , out came his arm . "
8947	8950	8613	8613	he	82	" Well ? "
8951	9085	8629	8629	he	82	" No hand just an empty sleeve . Lord ! I thought , _ that s _ a deformity ! Got a cork arm , I suppose , and has taken it off . Then , I thought , there s something odd in that . What the devil keeps that sleeve up and open , if there s nothing in it ? There was nothing in it , I tell you . Nothing down it , right down to the joint . I could see right down it to the elbow , and there was a glimmer of light shining through a tear of the cloth . Good God ! I said . Then he stopped . Stared at me with those black goggles of his , and then at his sleeve . "
9086	9089	8613	8613	he	82	" Well ? "
9090	9163	8629	8629	he	82	" That s all . He never said a word ; just glared , and put his sleeve back in his pocket quickly . I was saying , said he , that there was the prescription burning , wasn t I ? Interrogative cough . How the devil , said I , can you move an empty sleeve like that ? Empty sleeve ? Yes , said I , an empty sleeve . "
9164	9245	8613	8613	he	82	" It s an empty sleeve , is it ? You saw it was an empty sleeve ? He stood up right away . I stood up too . He came towards me in three very slow steps , and stood quite close . Sniffed venomously . I didn t flinch , though I m hanged if that bandaged knob of his , and those blinkers , aren t enough to unnerve any one , coming quietly up to you . "
9246	9338	8629	8629	he	82	" You said it was an empty sleeve ? he said . Certainly , I said . At staring and saying nothing a barefaced man , unspectacled , starts scratch . Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket again , and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me again . He did it very , very slowly . I looked at it . Seemed an age . Well ? said I , clearing my throat , there s nothing in it . "
9339	9397	8613	8613	he	82	" Had to say something . I was beginning to feel frightened . I could see right down it . He extended it straight towards me , slowly , slowly just like that until the cuff was six inches from my face . Queer thing to see an empty sleeve come at you like that ! And then "
9398	9401	8629	8629	he	82	" Well ? "
9402	9416	8613	8613	he	82	" Something exactly like a finger and thumb it felt nipped my nose . "

9442	9445	9433	9433	his	82	" there . "
9446	9485	9529	9529	Cuss	82	" It s all very well for you to laugh , but I tell you I was so startled , I hit his cuff hard , and turned around , and cut out of the room I left him "
9520	9527	9529	9529	Cuss	82	" When I hit his cuff , "
9531	9560	9529	9529	Cuss	82	" I tell you , it felt exactly like hitting an arm . And there wasn t an arm ! There wasn t the ghost of an arm ! "
9573	9581	9582	9582	he	90	" It s a most remarkable story , "
9593	9598	9600	9601	Mr. Bunting	90	" It s really , "

And you .... We can do such things ... But to - morrow . Now , Kemp , I feel as though I must sleep or perish . "

33911	33916	33918	33920	the Invisible Man	105	" Fit of temper , "
33922	33932	33918	33920	the Invisible Man	105	" Forgot this arm ; and it s sore . "
33933	33944	33838	33838	his	105	" You re rather liable to that sort of thing . "
33945	33949	33918	33920	the Invisible Man	105	" I am . "
33964	33973	33975	33975	Kemp	121	" All the facts are out about you , "
33986	34016	33975	33975	Kemp	121	" all that happened in Iping , and down the hill . The world has become aware of its invisible citizen . But no one knows you are here . "
34022	34054	33975	33975	Kemp	121	" The secret s out . I gather it was a secret . I don t know what your plans are , but of course I m anxious to help you . "
34064	34070	34072	34072	Kemp	121	" There s breakfast upstairs , "
34104	34112	34114	34114	Kemp	121	" Before we can do anything else , "
34116	34129	34114	34114	Kemp	121	" I must understand a little more about this invisibility of yours . "
34199	34208	34210	34210	Griffin	131	" It s simple enough and credible enough , "
34226	34234	34235	34235	Kemp	121	" No doubt , to you , but "
34238	34278	34571	34571	Kemp	121	" Well , yes ; to me it seemed wonderful at first , no doubt . But now , great God ! ... But we will do great things yet ! I came on the stuff first at Chesilstowe . "
34279	34282	34571	34571	Kemp	121	" Chesilstowe ? "
34283	34315	34571	34571	Kemp	121	" I went there after I left London . You know I dropped medicine and took up physics ? No ; well , I did . _ Light _ fascinated me . "
34316	34319	34571	34571	Kemp	121	" Ah ! "
34320	34382	34571	34571	Kemp	121	" Optical density ! The whole subject is a network of riddles a network with solutions glimmering elusively through . And being but two - and - twenty and full of enthusiasm , I said , I will devote my life to this . This is worth while . You know what fools we are at two - and - twenty ? "
34383	34390	34392	34392	Kemp	121	" Fools then or fools now , "
34394	34406	34571	34571	Kemp	121	" As though knowing could be any satisfaction to a man ! "
34407	34565	34571	34571	Kemp	121	" But I went to work like a slave . And I had hardly worked and thought about the matter six months before light came through one of the meshes suddenly blindingly ! I found a general principle of pigments and refraction a formula , a geometrical expression involving four dimensions . Fools , common men , even common mathematicians , do not know anything of what some general expression may mean to the student of molecular physics . In the books the books that tramp has hidden there are marvels , miracles ! But this was not a method , it was an idea , that might lead to a method by which it would be possible , without changing any other property of matter except , in some instances colours to lower the refractive index of a substance , solid or liquid , to that of air so far as all practical purposes are concerned . "
34566	34569	34571	34571	Kemp	121	" Phew ! "
34573	34606	34571	34571	Kemp	121	" That s odd ! But still I don t see quite ... I can understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone , but personal invisibility is a far cry . "
34607	34610	34612	34612	Griffin	131	" Precisely , "
34614	34963	34612	34612	Griffin	131	" But consider , visibility depends on the action of the visible bodies on light . Either a body absorbs light , or it reflects or refracts it , or does all these things . If it neither reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light , it can not of itself be visible . You see an opaque red box , for instance , because the colour absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest , all the red part of the light , to you . If it did not absorb any particular part of the light , but reflected it all , then it would be a shining white box . Silver ! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor reflect much from the general surface , but just here and there where the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and refracted , so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing reflections and translucencies a sort of skeleton of light . A glass box would not be so brilliant , nor so clearly visible , as a diamond box , because there would be less refraction and reflection . See that ? From certain points of view you would see quite clearly through it . Some kinds of glass would be more visible than others , a box of flint glass would be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass . A box of very thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light , because it would absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little . And if you put a sheet of common white glass in water , still more if you put it in some denser liquid than water , it would vanish almost altogether , because light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or reflected or indeed affected in any way . It is almost as invisible as a jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air . And for precisely the same reason ! "
34964	34967	34969	34969	Kemp	121	" Yes , "
34971	34978	34969	34969	Kemp	121	" that is pretty plain sailing . "
34979	35129	34571	34571	Kemp	121	" And here is another fact you will know to be true . If a sheet of glass is smashed , Kemp , and beaten into a powder , it becomes much more visible while it is in the air ; it becomes at last an opaque white powder . This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the glass at which refraction and reflection occur . In the sheet of glass there are only two surfaces ; in the powder the light is reflected or refracted by each grain it passes through , and very little gets right through the powder . But if the white powdered glass is put into water , it forthwith vanishes . The powdered glass and water have much the same refractive index ; that is , the light undergoes very little refraction or reflection in passing from one to the other . "
35130	35226	34969	34969	Kemp	121	" You make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly the same refractive index ; a transparent thing becomes invisible if it is put in any medium of almost the same refractive index . And if you will consider only a second , you will see also that the powder of glass might be made to vanish in air , if its refractive index could be made the same as that of air ; for then there would be no refraction or reflection as the light passed from glass to air . "
35227	35232	35234	35234	Kemp	121	" Yes , yes , "
35236	35245	35234	35234	Kemp	121	" But a man s not powdered glass ! "
35246	35249	35251	35251	Griffin	131	" No , "
35253	35259	35251	35251	Griffin	131	" He s more transparent ! "
35260	35263	34969	34969	Kemp	121	" Nonsense ! "
35264	35476	35251	35251	Griffin	131	" That from a doctor ! How one forgets ! Have you already forgotten your physics , in ten years ? Just think of all the things that are transparent and seem not to be so . Paper , for instance , is made up of transparent fibres , and it is white and opaque only for the same reason that a powder of glass is white and opaque . Oil white paper , fill up the interstices between the particles with oil so that there is no longer refraction or reflection except at the surfaces , and it becomes as transparent as glass . And not only paper , but cotton fibre , linen fibre , wool fibre , woody fibre , and _ bone _ , Kemp , _ flesh _ , Kemp , _ hair _ , Kemp , _ nails _ and _ nerves _ , Kemp , in fact the whole fabric of a man except the red of his blood and the black pigment of hair , are all made up of transparent , colourless tissue . So little suffices to make us visible one to the other . For the most part the fibres of a living creature are no more opaque than water . "
35477	35481	35483	35483	Kemp	121	" Great Heavens ! "
35485	35508	35483	35483	Kemp	121	" Of course , of course ! I was thinking only last night of the sea larvae and all jelly - fish ! "
35509	35677	35251	35251	Griffin	131	" _ Now _ you have me ! And all that I knew and had in mind a year after I left London six years ago . But I kept it to myself . I had to do my work under frightful disadvantages . Oliver , my professor , was a scientific bounder , a journalist by instinct , a thief of ideas he was always prying ! And you know the knavish system of the scientific world . I simply would not publish , and let him share my credit . I went on working ; I got nearer and nearer making my formula into an experiment , a reality . I told no living soul , because I meant to flash my work upon the world with crushing effect and become famous at a blow . I took up the question of pigments to fill up certain gaps . And suddenly , not by design but by accident , I made a discovery in physiology . "
35678	35681	35483	35483	Kemp	121	" Yes ? "
35682	35708	35251	35251	Griffin	131	" You know the red colouring matter of blood ; it can be made white colourless and remain with all the functions it has now ! "
35728	35875	35717	35719	The Invisible Man	105	" You may well exclaim . I remember that night . It was late at night in the daytime one was bothered with the gaping , silly students and I worked then sometimes till dawn . It came suddenly , splendid and complete in my mind . I was alone ; the laboratory was still , with the tall lights burning brightly and silently . In all my great moments I have been alone . One could make an animal a tissue transparent ! One could make it invisible ! All except the pigments I could be invisible ! I said , suddenly realising what it meant to be an albino with such knowledge . It was overwhelming . I left the filtering I was doing , and went and stared out of the great window at the stars . I could be invisible ! I repeated .
35876	36046	35251	35251	Griffin	131	" To do such a thing would be to transcend magic . And I beheld , unclouded by doubt , a magnificent vision of all that invisibility might mean to a man the mystery , the power , the freedom . Drawbacks I saw none . You have only to think ! And I , a shabby , poverty - struck , hemmed - in demonstrator , teaching fools in a provincial college , might suddenly become this . I ask you , Kemp if _ you _ ... Anyone , I tell you , would have flung himself upon that research . And I worked three years , and every mountain of difficulty I toiled over showed another from its summit . The infinite details ! And the exasperation ! A professor , a provincial professor , always prying . When are you going to publish this work of yours ? was his everlasting question . And the students , the cramped means ! Three years I had of it
36047	36067	35717	35719	The Invisible Man	105	" And after three years of secrecy and exasperation , I found that to complete it was impossible impossible . "
36068	36071	36073	36073	Kemp	121	" How ? "
36075	36078	36080	36082	the Invisible Man	105	" Money , "
36099	36109	36094	36094	He	121	" I robbed the old man robbed my father . "
36110	36122	35717	35719	The Invisible Man	105	" The money was not his , and he shot himself . "
36179	36184	36185	36185	he	121	" You are tired , "
36188	36202	36185	36185	he	121	" and while I sit , you walk about . Have my chair . "
36226	36235	36236	36236	he	131	" I had left the Chesilstowe cottage already , "
36239	36396	36236	36236	he	131	" when that happened . It was last December . I had taken a room in London , a large unfurnished room in a big ill - managed lodging - house in a slum near Great Portland Street . The room was soon full of the appliances I had bought with his money ; the work was going on steadily , successfully , drawing near an end . I was like a man emerging from a thicket , and suddenly coming on some unmeaning tragedy . I went to bury him . My mind was still on this research , and I did not lift a finger to save his character . I remember the funeral , the cheap hearse , the scant ceremony , the windy frost - bitten hillside , and the old college friend of his who read the service over him a shabby , black , bent old man with a snivelling cold .
36397	36492	36222	36222	he	131	" I remember walking back to the empty house , through the place that had once been a village and was now patched and tinkered by the jerry builders into the ugly likeness of a town . Every way the roads ran out at last into the desecrated fields and ended in rubble heaps and rank wet weeds . I remember myself as a gaunt black figure , going along the slippery , shiny pavement , and the strange sense of detachment I felt from the squalid respectability , the sordid commercialism of the place .
36493	36537	36236	36236	he	131	" I did not feel a bit sorry for my father . He seemed to me to be the victim of his own foolish sentimentality . The current ca nt required my attendance at his funeral , but it was really not my affair .
36538	36572	36222	36222	he	131	" But going along the High Street , my old life came back to me for a space , for I met the girl I had known ten years since . Our eyes met .
36573	36591	36236	36236	he	131	" Something moved me to turn back and talk to her . She was a very ordinary person .
36592	36695	36222	36222	he	131	" It was all like a dream , that visit to the old places . I did not feel then that I was lonely , that I had come out from the world into a desolate place . I appreciated my loss of sympathy , but I put it down to the general inanity of things . Re - entering my room seemed like the recovery of reality . There were the things I knew and loved . There stood the apparatus , the experiments arranged and waiting . And now there was scarcely a difficulty left , beyond the planning of details .
36696	36887	36236	36236	he	131	" I will tell you , Kemp , sooner or later , all the complicated processes . We need not go into that now . For the most part , saving certain gaps I chose to remember , they are written in cypher in those books that tramp has hidden . We must hunt him down . We must get those books again . But the essential phase was to place the transparent object whose refractive index was to be lowered between two radiating centres of a sort of ethereal vibration , of which I will tell you more fully later . No , not those R ntgen vibrations I don t know that these others of mine have been described . Yet they are obvious enough . I needed two little dynamos , and these I worked with a cheap gas engine . My first experiment was with a bit of white wool fabric . It was the strangest thing in the world to see it in the flicker of the flashes soft and white , and then to watch it fade like a wreath of smoke and vanish . "
36888	36937	36222	36222	he	131	" I could scarcely believe I had done it . I put my hand into the emptiness , and there was the thing as solid as ever . I felt it awkwardly , and threw it on the floor . I had a little trouble finding it again . "
36938	37093	36236	36236	he	131	" And then came a curious experience . I heard a miaow behind me , and turning , saw a lean white cat , very dirty , on the cistern cover outside the window . A thought came into my head . Everything ready for you , I said , and went to the window , opened it , and called softly . She came in , purring the poor beast was starving and I gave her some milk . All my food was in a cupboard in the corner of the room . After that she went smelling round the room , evidently with the idea of making herself at home . The invisible rag upset her a bit ; you should have seen her spit at it ! But I made her comfortable on the pillow of my truckle - bed . And I gave her butter to get her to wash . "
37094	37100	36222	36222	he	131	" And you processed her ? "
37101	37123	36236	36236	he	131	" I processed her . But giving drugs to a cat is no joke , Kemp ! And the process failed . "
37124	37127	36222	36222	he	131	" Failed ! "
37128	37159	36236	36236	he	131	" In two particulars . These were the claws and the pigment stuff , what is it ? at the back of the eye in a cat . You know ? "
37160	37165	36222	36222	he	131	" _ Tapetum _ . "
37166	37237	36236	36236	he	131	" Yes , the _ tapetum _ . It didn t go . After I d given the stuff to bleach the blood and done certain other things to her , I gave the beast opium , and put her and the pillow she was sleeping on , on the apparatus . And after all the rest had faded and vanished , there remained two little ghosts of her eyes . "
37238	37241	36222	36222	he	131	" Odd ! "
37242	37417	36236	36236	he	131	" I can t explain it . She was bandaged and clamped , of course so I had her safe ; but she woke while she was still misty , and miaowed dismally , and someone came knocking . It was an old woman from downstairs , who suspected me of vivisecting a drink - sodden old creature , with only a white cat to care for in all the world . I whipped out some chloroform , applied it , and answered the door . Did I hear a cat ? she asked . My cat ? Not here , said I , very politely . She was a little doubtful and tried to peer past me into the room ; strange enough to her no doubt bare walls , uncurtained windows , truckle - bed , with the gas engine vibrating , and the seethe of the radiant points , and that faint ghastly stinging of chloroform in the air . She had to be satisfied at last and went away again . "
37418	37425	37427	37427	Kemp	121	" How long did it take ? "
37429	37484	36236	36236	he	131	" Three or four hours the cat . The bones and sinews and the fat were the last to go , and the tips of the coloured hairs . And , as I say , the back part of the eye , tough , iridescent stuff it is , wouldn t go at all . "
37485	37753	36236	36236	he	131	" It was night outside long before the business was over , and nothing was to be seen but the dim eyes and the claws . I stopped the gas engine , felt for and stroked the beast , which was still insensible , and then , being tired , left it sleeping on the invisible pillow and went to bed . I found it hard to sleep . I lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff , going over the experiment over and over again , or dreaming feverishly of things growing misty and vanishing about me , until everything , the ground I stood on , vanished , and so I came to that sickly falling nightmare one gets . About two , the cat began miaowing about the room . I tried to hush it by talking to it , and then I decided to turn it out . I remember the shock I had when striking a light there were just the round eyes shining green and nothing round them . I would have given it milk , but I hadn t any . It wouldn t be quiet , it just sat down and miaowed at the door . I tried to catch it , with an idea of putting it out of the window , but it wouldn t be caught , it vanished . Then it began miaowing in different parts of the room . At last I opened the window and made a bustle . I suppose it went out at last . I never saw any more of it . "
37754	37802	36236	36236	he	131	" Then Heaven knows why I fell thinking of my father s funeral again , and the dismal windy hillside , until the day had come . I found sleeping was hopeless , and , locking my door after me , wandered out into the morning streets . "
37803	37818	37820	37820	Kemp	121	" You don t mean to say there s an invisible cat at large ! "
37822	37830	37832	37834	the Invisible Man	105	" If it hasn t been killed , "
37836	37840	37832	37834	the Invisible Man	105	" Why not ? "
37841	37845	37847	37847	Kemp	121	" Why not ? "
37849	37857	37847	37847	Kemp	121	" I didn t mean to interrupt . "
37858	37866	37868	37870	the Invisible Man	150	" It s very probably been killed , "
37872	37909	37868	37870	the Invisible Man	150	" It was alive four days after , I know , and down a grating in Great Titchfield Street ; because I saw a crowd round the place , trying to see whence the miaowing came . "
37926	38011	37922	37922	he	121	" I remember that morning before the change very vividly . I must have gone up Great Portland Street . I remember the barracks in Albany Street , and the horse soldiers coming out , and at last I found the summit of Primrose Hill . It was a sunny day in January one of those sunny , frosty days that came before the snow this year . My weary brain tried to formulate the position , to plot out a plan of action . "
38012	38139	37922	37922	he	121	" I was surprised to find , now that my prize was within my grasp , how inconclusive its attainment seemed . As a matter of fact I was worked out ; the intense stress of nearly four years continuous work left me incapable of any strength of feeling . I was apathetic , and I tried in vain to recover the enthusiasm of my first inquiries , the passion of discovery that had enabled me to compass even the downfall of my father s grey hairs . Nothing seemed to matter . I saw pretty clearly this was a transient mood , due to overwork and want of sleep , and that either by drugs or rest it would be possible to recover my energies . "
38140	38255	37922	37922	he	121	" All I could think clearly was that the thing had to be carried through ; the fixed idea still ruled me . And soon , for the money I had was almost exhausted . I looked about me at the hillside , with children playing and girls watching them , and tried to think of all the fantastic advantages an invisible man would have in the world . After a time I crawled home , took some food and a strong dose of strychnine , and went to sleep in my clothes on my unmade bed . Strychnine is a grand tonic , Kemp , to take the flabbiness out of a man . "
38256	38262	38264	38264	Kemp	121	" It s the devil , "
38266	38275	38264	38264	Kemp	121	" It s the palaeolithic in a bottle . "
38276	38288	37922	37922	he	121	" I awoke vastly invigorated and rather irritable . You know ? "
38289	38295	38264	38264	Kemp	121	" I know the stuff . "
38296	38561	37922	37922	he	121	" And there was someone rapping at the door . It was my landlord with threats and inquiries , an old Polish Jew in a long grey coat and greasy slippers . I had been tormenting a cat in the night , he was sure the old woman s tongue had been busy . He insisted on knowing all about it . The laws in this country against vivisection were very severe he might be liable . I denied the cat . Then the vibration of the little gas engine could be felt all over the house , he said . That was true , certainly . He edged round me into the room , peering about over his German - silver spectacles , and a sudden dread came into my mind that he might carry away something of my secret . I tried to keep between him and the concentrating apparatus I had arranged , and that only made him more curious . What was I doing ? Why was I always alone and secretive ? Was it legal ? Was it dangerous ? I paid nothing but the usual rent . His had always been a most respectable house in a disreputable neighbourhood . Suddenly my temper gave way . I told him to get out . He began to protest , to jabber of his right of entry . In a moment I had him by the collar ; something ripped , and he went spinning out into his own passage . I slammed and locked the door and sat down quivering .
38562	38580	38264	38264	Kemp	121	" He made a fuss outside , which I disregarded , and after a time he went away .
38581	38662	37922	37922	he	121	" But this brought matters to a crisis . I did not know what he would do , nor even what he had the power to do . To move to fresh apartments would have meant delay ; altogether I had barely twenty pounds left in the world , for the most part in a bank and I could not afford that . Vanish ! It was irresistible . Then there would be an inquiry , the sacking of my room .
38663	38824	38264	38264	Kemp	121	" At the thought of the possibility of my work being exposed or interrupted at its very climax , I became very angry and active . I hurried out with my three books of notes , my cheque - book the tramp has them now and directed them from the nearest Post Office to a house of call for letters and parcels in Great Portland Street . I tried to go out noiselessly . Coming in , I found my landlord going quietly upstairs ; he had heard the door close , I suppose . You would have laughed to see him jump aside on the landing as I came tearing after him . He glared at me as I went by him , and I made the house quiver with the slamming of my door . I heard him come shuffling up to my floor , hesitate , and go down . I set to work upon my preparations forthwith .
38825	38912	37922	37922	he	121	" It was all done that evening and night . While I was still sitting under the sickly , drowsy influence of the drugs that decolourise blood , there came a repeated knocking at the door . It ceased , footsteps went away and returned , and the knocking was resumed . There was an attempt to push something under the door a blue paper . Then in a fit of irritation I rose and went and flung the door wide open . Now then ? said I.
38913	38951	38264	38264	Kemp	121	" It was my landlord , with a notice of ejectment or something . He held it out to me , saw something odd about my hands , I expect , and lifted his eyes to my face .
38952	39014	37922	37922	he	121	" For a moment he gaped . Then he gave a sort of inarticulate cry , dropped candle and writ together , and went blundering down the dark passage to the stairs . I shut the door , locked it , and went to the looking - glass . Then I understood his terror .... My face was white like white stone .
39015	39117	38264	38264	Kemp	121	" But it was all horrible . I had not expected the suffering . A night of racking anguish , sickness and fainting . I set my teeth , though my skin was presently afire , all my body afire ; but I lay there like grim death . I understood now how it was the cat had howled until I chloroformed it . Lucky it was I lived alone and untended in my room . There were times when I sobbed and groaned and talked . But I stuck to it .... I became insensible and woke languid in the darkness .
39118	39250	37922	37922	he	121	" The pain had passed . I thought I was killing myself and I did not care . I shall never forget that dawn , and the strange horror of seeing that my hands had become as clouded glass , and watching them grow clearer and thinner as the day went by , until at last I could see the sickly disorder of my room through them , though I closed my transparent eyelids . My limbs became glassy , the bones and arteries faded , vanished , and the little white nerves went last . I gritted my teeth and stayed there to the end . At last only the dead tips of the fingernails remained , pallid and white , and the brown stain of some acid upon my fingers .
39251	39328	38264	38264	Kemp	121	" I struggled up . At first I was as incapable as a swathed infant stepping with limbs I could not see . I was weak and very hungry . I went and stared at nothing in my shaving - glass , at nothing save where an attenuated pigment still remained behind the retina of my eyes , fainter than mist . I had to hang on to the table and press my forehead against the glass .
39329	39351	37922	37922	he	121	" It was only by a frantic effort of will that I dragged myself back to the apparatus and completed the process .
39352	39538	38264	38264	Kemp	121	" I slept during the forenoon , pulling the sheet over my eyes to shut out the light , and about midday I was awakened again by a knocking . My strength had returned . I sat up and listened and heard a whispering . I sprang to my feet and as noiselessly as possible began to detach the connections of my apparatus , and to distribute it about the room , so as to destroy the suggestions of its arrangement . Presently the knocking was renewed and voices called , first my landlord s , and then two others . To gain time I answered them . The invisible rag and pillow came to hand and I opened the window and pitched them out on to the cistern cover . As the window opened , a heavy crash came at the door . Someone had charged it with the idea of smashing the lock . But the stout bolts I had screwed up some days before stopped him . That startled me , made me angry . I began to tremble and do things hurriedly .
39539	39694	37922	37922	he	121	" I tossed together some loose paper , straw , packing paper and so forth , in the middle of the room , and turned on the gas . Heavy blows began to rain upon the door . I could not find the matches . I beat my hands on the wall with rage . I turned down the gas again , stepped out of the window on the cistern cover , very softly lowered the sash , and sat down , secure and invisible , but quivering with anger , to watch events . They split a panel , I saw , and in another moment they had broken away the staples of the bolts and stood in the open doorway . It was the landlord and his two step - sons , sturdy young men of three or four and twenty . Behind them fluttered the old hag of a woman from downstairs .
39695	39869	38264	38264	Kemp	121	" You may imagine their astonishment to find the room empty . One of the younger men rushed to the window at once , flung it up and stared out . His staring eyes and thick - lipped bearded face came a foot from my face . I was half minded to hit his silly countenance , but I arrested my doubled fist . He stared right through me . So did the others as they joined him . The old man went and peered under the bed , and then they all made a rush for the cupboard . They had to argue about it at length in Yiddish and Cockney English . They concluded I had not answered them , that their imagination had deceived them . A feeling of extraordinary elation took the place of my anger as I sat outside the window and watched these four people for the old lady came in , glancing suspiciously about her like a cat , trying to understand the riddle of my behaviour .
39870	39998	37922	37922	he	121	" The old man , so far as I could understand his _ patois _ , agreed with the old lady that I was a vivisectionist . The sons protested in garbled English that I was an electrician , and appealed to the dynamos and radiators . They were all nervous about my arrival , although I found subsequently that they had bolted the front door . The old lady peered into the cupboard and under the bed , and one of the young men pushed up the register and stared up the chimney . One of my fellow lodgers , a coster - monger who shared the opposite room with a butcher , appeared on the landing , and he was called in and told incoherent things .
39999	40081	38264	38264	Kemp	121	" It occurred to me that the radiators , if they fell into the hands of some acute well - educated person , would give me away too much , and watching my opportunity , I came into the room and tilted one of the little dynamos off its fellow on which it was standing , and smashed both apparatus . Then , while they were trying to explain the smash , I dodged out of the room and went softly downstairs .
40082	40181	37922	37922	he	121	" I went into one of the sitting - rooms and waited until they came down , still speculating and argumentative , all a little disappointed at finding no horrors , and all a little puzzled how they stood legally towards me . Then I slipped up again with a box of matches , fired my heap of paper and rubbish , put the chairs and bedding thereby , led the gas to the affair , by means of an india - rubber tube , and waving a farewell to the room left it for the last time . "
40182	40188	40190	40190	Kemp	121	" You fired the house ! "
40192	40270	37922	37922	he	121	" Fired the house . It was the only way to cover my trail and no doubt it was insured . I slipped the bolts of the front door quietly and went out into the street . I was invisible , and I was only just beginning to realise the extraordinary advantage my invisibility gave me . My head was already teeming with plans of all the wild and wonderful things I had now impunity to do . "
40277	40329	37922	37922	he	121	" In going downstairs the first time I found an unexpected difficulty because I could not see my feet ; indeed I stumbled twice , and there was an unaccustomed clumsiness in gripping the bolt . By not looking down , however , I managed to walk on the level passably well .
40330	40397	37922	37922	he	121	" My mood , I say , was one of exaltation . I felt as a seeing man might do , with padded feet and noiseless clothes , in a city of the blind . I experienced a wild impulse to jest , to startle people , to clap men on the back , fling people s hats astray , and generally revel in my extraordinary advantage .
40398	40512	37922	37922	he	121	" But hardly had I emerged upon Great Portland Street , however ( my lodging was close to the big draper s shop there ) , when I heard a clashing concussion and was hit violently behind , and turning saw a man carrying a basket of soda - water syphons , and looking in amazement at his burden . Although the blow had really hurt me , I found something so irresistible in his astonishment that I laughed aloud . The devil s in the basket , I said , and suddenly twisted it out of his hand . He let go incontinently , and I swung the whole weight into the air .
40513	40706	37922	37922	he	121	" But a fool of a cabman , standing outside a public house , made a sudden rush for this , and his extending fingers took me with excruciating violence under the ear . I let the whole down with a smash on the cabman , and then , with shouts and the clatter of feet about me , people coming out of shops , vehicles pulling up , I realised what I had done for myself , and cursing my folly , backed against a shop window and prepared to dodge out of the confusion . In a moment I should be wedged into a crowd and inevitably discovered . I pushed by a butcher boy , who luckily did not turn to see the nothingness that shoved him aside , and dodged behind the cab - man s four - wheeler . I do not know how they settled the business . I hurried straight across the road , which was happily clear , and hardly heeding which way I went , in the fright of detection the incident had given me , plunged into the afternoon throng of Oxford Street .
40707	40895	37922	37922	he	121	" I tried to get into the stream of people , but they were too thick for me , and in a moment my heels were being trodden upon . I took to the gutter , the roughness of which I found painful to my feet , and forthwith the shaft of a crawling hansom dug me forcibly under the shoulder blade , reminding me that I was already bruised severely . I staggered out of the way of the cab , avoided a perambulator by a convulsive movement , and found myself behind the hansom . A happy thought saved me , and as this drove slowly along I followed in its immediate wake , trembling and astonished at the turn of my adventure . And not only trembling , but shivering . It was a bright day in January and I was stark naked and the thin slime of mud that covered the road was freezing . Foolish as it seems to me now , I had not reckoned that , transparent or not , I was still amenable to the weather and all its consequences .
40896	41006	37922	37922	he	121	" Then suddenly a bright idea came into my head . I ran round and got into the cab . And so , shivering , scared , and sniffing with the first intimations of a cold , and with the bruises in the small of my back growing upon my attention , I drove slowly along Oxford Street and past Tottenham Court Road . My mood was as different from that in which I had sallied forth ten minutes ago as it is possible to imagine . This invisibility indeed ! The one thought that possessed me was how was I to get out of the scrape I was in .
41007	41126	37922	37922	he	121	" We crawled past Mudie s , and there a tall woman with five or six yellow - labelled books hailed my cab , and I sprang out just in time to escape her , shaving a railway van narrowly in my flight . I made off up the roadway to Bloomsbury Square , intending to strike north past the Museum and so get into the quiet district . I was now cruelly chilled , and the strangeness of my situation so unnerved me that I whimpered as I ran . At the northward corner of the Square a little white dog ran out of the Pharmaceutical Society s offices , and incontinently made for me , nose down .
41127	41226	37922	37922	he	121	" I had never realised it before , but the nose is to the mind of a dog what the eye is to the mind of a seeing man . Dogs perceive the scent of a man moving as men perceive his vision . This brute began barking and leaping , showing , as it seemed to me , only too plainly that he was aware of me . I crossed Great Russell Street , glancing over my shoulder as I did so , and went some way along Montague Street before I realised what I was running towards .
41227	41357	37922	37922	he	121	" Then I became aware of a blare of music , and looking along the street saw a number of people advancing out of Russell Square , red shirts , and the banner of the Salvation Army to the fore . Such a crowd , chanting in the roadway and scoffing on the pavement , I could not hope to penetrate , and dreading to go back and farther from home again , and deciding on the spur of the moment , I ran up the white steps of a house facing the museum railings , and stood there until the crowd should have passed . Happily the dog stopped at the noise of the band too , hesitated , and turned tail , running back to Bloomsbury Square again .
41358	41454	37922	37922	he	121	" On came the band , bawling with unconscious irony some hymn about When shall we see His face ? and it seemed an interminable time to me before the tide of the crowd washed along the pavement by me . Thud , thud , thud , came the drum with a vibrating resonance , and for the moment I did not notice two urchins stopping at the railings by me . See em , said one . See what ? said the other . Why them footmarks bare . Like what you makes in mud .
41455	41557	37922	37922	he	121	" I looked down and saw the youngsters had stopped and were gaping at the muddy footmarks I had left behind me up the newly whitened steps . The passing people elbowed and jostled them , but their confounded intelligence was arrested . Thud , thud , thud , when , thud , shall we see , thud , his face , thud , thud . There s a barefoot man gone up them steps , or I don t know nothing , said one . And he ain t never come down again . And his foot was a - bleeding .
41558	41621	37922	37922	he	121	" The thick of the crowd had already passed . Looky there , Ted , quoth the younger of the detectives , with the sharpness of surprise in his voice , and pointed straight to my feet . I looked down and saw at once the dim suggestion of their outline sketched in splashes of mud . For a moment I was paralysed .
41622	41767	37922	37922	he	121	" Why , that s rum , said the elder . Dashed rum ! It s just like the ghost of a foot , ain t it ? He hesitated and advanced with outstretched hand . A man pulled up short to see what he was catching , and then a girl . In another moment he would have touched me . Then I saw what to do . I made a step , the boy started back with an exclamation , and with a rapid movement I swung myself over into the portico of the next house . But the smaller boy was sharp - eyed enough to follow the movement , and before I was well down the steps and upon the pavement , he had recovered from his momentary astonishment and was shouting out that the feet had gone over the wall .
41768	41802	37922	37922	he	121	" They rushed round and saw my new footmarks flash into being on the lower step and upon the pavement . What s up ? asked someone . Feet ! Look ! Feet running !
41803	41896	37922	37922	he	121	" Everybody in the road , except my three pursuers , was pouring along after the Salvation Army , and this blow not only impeded me but them . There was an eddy of surprise and interrogation . At the cost of bowling over one young fellow I got through , and in another moment I was rushing headlong round the circuit of Russell Square , with six or seven astonished people following my footmarks . There was no time for explanation , or else the whole host would have been after me .
41897	42004	37922	37922	he	121	" Twice I doubled round corners , thrice I crossed the road and came back upon my tracks , and then , as my feet grew hot and dry , the damp impressions began to fade . At last I had a breathing space and rubbed my feet clean with my hands , and so got away altogether . The last I saw of the chase was a little group of a dozen people perhaps , studying with infinite perplexity a slowly drying footprint that had resulted from a puddle in Tavistock Square , a footprint as isolated and incomprehensible to them as Crusoe s solitary discovery .
42005	42189	37922	37922	he	121	" This running warmed me to a certain extent , and I went on with a better courage through the maze of less frequented roads that runs hereabouts . My back had now become very stiff and sore , my tonsils were painful from the cabman s fingers , and the skin of my neck had been scratched by his nails ; my feet hurt exceedingly and I was lame from a little cut on one foot . I saw in time a blind man approaching me , and fled limping , for I feared his subtle intuitions . Once or twice accidental collisions occurred and I left people amazed , with unaccountable curses ringing in their ears . Then came something silent and quiet against my face , and across the Square fell a thin veil of slowly falling flakes of snow . I had caught a cold , and do as I would I could not avoid an occasional sneeze . And every dog that came in sight , with its pointing nose and curious sniffing , was a terror to me .
42190	42303	37922	37922	he	121	" Then came men and boys running , first one and then others , and shouting as they ran . It was a fire . They ran in the direction of my lodging , and looking back down a street I saw a mass of black smoke streaming up above the roofs and telephone wires . It was my lodging burning ; my clothes , my apparatus , all my resources indeed , except my cheque - book and the three volumes of memoranda that awaited me in Great Portland Street , were there . Burning ! I had burnt my boats if ever a man did ! The place was blazing . "
42319	42322	42323	42323	he	121	" Yes ? "
42326	42330	42323	42323	he	121	" Go on . "
42337	42523	37922	37922	he	121	" So last January , with the beginning of a snowstorm in the air about me and if it settled on me it would betray me ! weary , cold , painful , inexpressibly wretched , and still but half convinced of my invisible quality , I began this new life to which I am committed . I had no refuge , no appliances , no human being in the world in whom I could confide . To have told my secret would have given me away made a mere show and rarity of me . Nevertheless , I was half - minded to accost some passer - by and throw myself upon his mercy . But I knew too clearly the terror and brutal cruelty my advances would evoke . I made no plans in the street . My sole object was to get shelter from the snow , to get myself covered and warm ; then I might hope to plan . But even to me , an Invisible Man , the rows of London houses stood latched , barred , and bolted impregnably .
42524	42545	37922	37922	he	121	" Only one thing could I see clearly before me the cold exposure and misery of the snowstorm and the night .
42546	42705	37922	37922	he	121	" And then I had a brilliant idea . I turned down one of the roads leading from Gower Street to Tottenham Court Road , and found myself outside Omniums , the big establishment where everything is to be bought you know the place : meat , grocery , linen , furniture , clothing , oil paintings even a huge meandering collection of shops rather than a shop . I had thought I should find the doors open , but they were closed , and as I stood in the wide entrance a carriage stopped outside , and a man in uniform you know the kind of personage with Omnium on his cap flung open the door . I contrived to enter , and walking down the shop it was a department where they were selling ribbons and gloves and stockings and that kind of thing came to a more spacious region devoted to picnic baskets and wicker furniture .
42706	42916	37922	37922	he	121	" I did not feel safe there , however ; people were going to and fro , and I prowled restlessly about until I came upon a huge section in an upper floor containing multitudes of bedsteads , and over these I clambered , and found a resting - place at last among a huge pile of folded flock mattresses . The place was already lit up and agreeably warm , and I decided to remain where I was , keeping a cautious eye on the two or three sets of shopmen and customers who were meandering through the place , until closing time came . Then I should be able , I thought , to rob the place for food and clothing , and disguised , prowl through it and examine its resources , perhaps sleep on some of the bedding . That seemed an acceptable plan . My idea was to procure clothing to make myself a muffled but acceptable figure , to get money , and then to recover my books and parcels where they awaited me , take a lodging somewhere and elaborate plans for the complete realisation of the advantages my invisibility gave me ( as I still imagined ) over my fellow - men .
42917	43286	37922	37922	he	121	" Closing time arrived quickly enough . It could not have been more than an hour after I took up my position on the mattresses before I noticed the blinds of the windows being drawn , and customers being marched doorward . And then a number of brisk young men began with remarkable alacrity to tidy up the goods that remained disturbed . I left my lair as the crowds diminished , and prowled cautiously out into the less desolate parts of the shop . I was really surprised to observe how rapidly the young men and women whipped away the goods displayed for sale during the day . All the boxes of goods , the hanging fabrics , the festoons of lace , the boxes of sweets in the grocery section , the displays of this and that , were being whipped down , folded up , slapped into tidy receptacles , and everything that could not be taken down and put away had sheets of some coarse stuff like sacking flung over them . Finally all the chairs were turned up on to the counters , leaving the floor clear . Directly each of these young people had done , he or she made promptly for the door with such an expression of animation as I have rarely observed in a shop assistant before . Then came a lot of youngsters scattering sawdust and carrying pails and brooms . I had to dodge to get out of the way , and as it was , my ankle got stung with the sawdust . For some time , wandering through the swathed and darkened departments , I could hear the brooms at work . And at last a good hour or more after the shop had been closed , came a noise of locking doors . Silence came upon the place , and I found myself wandering through the vast and intricate shops , galleries , show - rooms of the place , alone . It was very still ; in one place I remember passing near one of the Tottenham Court Road entrances and listening to the tapping of boot - heels of the passers - by .
43287	43436	37922	37922	he	121	" My first visit was to the place where I had seen stockings and gloves for sale . It was dark , and I had the devil of a hunt after matches , which I found at last in the drawer of the little cash desk . Then I had to get a candle . I had to tear down wrappings and ransack a number of boxes and drawers , but at last I managed to turn out what I sought ; the box label called them lambswool pants , and lambswool vests . Then socks , a thick comforter , and then I went to the clothing place and got trousers , a lounge jacket , an overcoat and a slouch hat a clerical sort of hat with the brim turned down . I began to feel a human being again , and my next thought was food .
43437	43612	37922	37922	he	121	" Upstairs was a refreshment department , and there I got cold meat . There was coffee still in the urn , and I lit the gas and warmed it up again , and altogether I did not do badly . Afterwards , prowling through the place in search of blankets I had to put up at last with a heap of down quilts I came upon a grocery section with a lot of chocolate and candied fruits , more than was good for me indeed and some white burgundy . And near that was a toy department , and I had a brilliant idea . I found some artificial noses dummy noses , you know , and I thought of dark spectacles . But Omniums had no optical department . My nose had been a difficulty indeed I had thought of paint . But the discovery set my mind running on wigs and masks and the like . Finally I went to sleep in a heap of down quilts , very warm and comfortable .
43613	43798	37922	37922	he	121	" My last thoughts before sleeping were the most agreeable I had had since the change . I was in a state of physical serenity , and that was reflected in my mind . I thought that I should be able to slip out unobserved in the morning with my clothes upon me , muffling my face with a white wrapper I had taken , purchase , with the money I had taken , spectacles and so forth , and so complete my disguise . I lapsed into disorderly dreams of all the fantastic things that had happened during the last few days . I saw the ugly little Jew of a landlord vociferating in his rooms ; I saw his two sons marvelling , and the wrinkled old woman s gnarled face as she asked for her cat . I experienced again the strange sensation of seeing the cloth disappear , and so I came round to the windy hillside and the sniffing old clergyman mumbling Earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust , at my father s open grave .
43799	43915	37922	37922	he	121	" You also , said a voice , and suddenly I was being forced towards the grave . I struggled , shouted , appealed to the mourners , but they continued stonily following the service ; the old clergyman , too , never faltered droning and sniffing through the ritual . I realised I was invisible and inaudible , that overwhelming forces had their grip on me . I struggled in vain , I was forced over the brink , the coffin rang hollow as I fell upon it , and the gravel came flying after me in spadefuls . Nobody heeded me , nobody was aware of me . I made convulsive struggles and awoke .
43916	43998	37922	37922	he	121	" The pale London dawn had come , the place was full of a chilly grey light that filtered round the edges of the window blinds . I sat up , and for a time I could not think where this ample apartment , with its counters , its piles of rolled stuff , its heap of quilts and cushions , its iron pillars , might be . Then , as recollection came back to me , I heard voices in conversation .
43999	44169	37922	37922	he	121	" Then far down the place , in the brighter light of some department which had already raised its blinds , I saw two men approaching . I scrambled to my feet , looking about me for some way of escape , and even as I did so the sound of my movement made them aware of me . I suppose they saw merely a figure moving quietly and quickly away . Who s that ? cried one , and Stop there ! shouted the other . I dashed around a corner and came full tilt a faceless figure , mind you ! on a lanky lad of fifteen . He yelled and I bowled him over , rushed past him , turned another corner , and by a happy inspiration threw myself behind a counter . In another moment feet went running past and I heard voices shouting , All hands to the doors ! asking what was up , and giving one another advice how to catch me .
44170	44246	37922	37922	he	121	" Lying on the ground , I felt scared out of my wits . But odd as it may seem it did not occur to me at the moment to take off my clothes as I should have done . I had made up my mind , I suppose , to get away in them , and that ruled me . And then down the vista of the counters came a bawling of Here he is !
44247	44328	37922	37922	he	121	" I sprang to my feet , whipped a chair off the counter , and sent it whirling at the fool who had shouted , turned , came into another round a corner , sent him spinning , and rushed up the stairs . He kept his footing , gave a view hallo , and came up the staircase hot after me . Up the staircase were piled a multitude of those bright - coloured pot things what are they ? "
44329	44333	44335	44335	Kemp	121	" Art pots , "
44337	44560	37922	37922	he	121	" That s it ! Art pots . Well , I turned at the top step and swung round , plucked one out of a pile and smashed it on his silly head as he came at me . The whole pile of pots went headlong , and I heard shouting and footsteps running from all parts . I made a mad rush for the refreshment place , and there was a man in white like a man cook , who took up the chase . I made one last desperate turn and found myself among lamps and ironmongery . I went behind the counter of this , and waited for my cook , and as he bolted in at the head of the chase , I doubled him up with a lamp . Down he went , and I crouched down behind the counter and began whipping off my clothes as fast as I could . Coat , jacket , trousers , shoes were all right , but a lambswool vest fits a man like a skin . I heard more men coming , my cook was lying quiet on the other side of the counter , stunned or scared speechless , and I had to make another dash for it , like a rabbit hunted out of a wood - pile .
44561	44667	37922	37922	he	121	" This way , policeman ! I heard someone shouting . I found myself in my bedstead storeroom again , and at the end of a wilderness of wardrobes . I rushed among them , went flat , got rid of my vest after infinite wriggling , and stood a free man again , panting and scared , as the policeman and three of the shopmen came round the corner . They made a rush for the vest and pants , and collared the trousers . He s dropping his plunder , said one of the young men . He _ must _ be somewhere here .
44668	44678	37922	37922	he	121	" But they did not find me all the same .
44679	44729	37922	37922	he	121	" I stood watching them hunt for me for a time , and cursing my ill - luck in losing the clothes . Then I went into the refreshment - room , drank a little milk I found there , and sat down by the fire to consider my position .
44730	44889	37922	37922	he	121	" In a little while two assistants came in and began to talk over the business very excitedly and like the fools they were . I heard a magnified account of my depredations , and other speculations as to my whereabouts . Then I fell to scheming again . The insurmountable difficulty of the place , especially now it was alarmed , was to get any plunder out of it . I went down into the warehouse to see if there was any chance of packing and addressing a parcel , but I could not understand the system of checking . About eleven o clock , the snow having thawed as it fell , and the day being finer and a little warmer than the previous one , I decided that the Emporium was hopeless , and went out again , exasperated at my want of success , with only the vaguest plans of action in my mind . "
44896	44904	44906	44908	the Invisible Man	105	" But you begin now to realise , "
44910	44966	44906	44908	the Invisible Man	105	" the full disadvantage of my condition . I had no shelter no covering to get clothing was to forego all my advantage , to make myself a strange and terrible thing . I was fasting ; for to eat , to fill myself with unassimilated matter , would be to become grotesquely visible again . "
44967	44974	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" I never thought of that , "
44978	45104	37922	37922	he	121	" Nor had I. And the snow had warned me of other dangers . I could not go abroad in snow it would settle on me and expose me . Rain , too , would make me a watery outline , a glistening surface of a man a bubble . And fog I should be like a fainter bubble in a fog , a surface , a greasy glimmer of humanity . Moreover , as I went abroad in the London air I gathered dirt about my ankles , floating smuts and dust upon my skin . I did not know how long it would be before I should become visible from that cause also . But I saw clearly it could not be for long .
45105	45112	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" Not in London at any rate .
45113	45278	37922	37922	he	121	" I went into the slums towards Great Portland Street , and found myself at the end of the street in which I had lodged . I did not go that way , because of the crowd halfway down it opposite to the still smoking ruins of the house I had fired . My most immediate problem was to get clothing . What to do with my face puzzled me . Then I saw in one of those little miscellaneous shops news , sweets , toys , stationery , belated Christmas tomfoolery , and so forth an array of masks and noses . I realised that problem was solved . In a flash I saw my course . I turned about , no longer aimless , and went circuitously in order to avoid the busy ways , towards the back streets north of the Strand ; for I remembered , though not very distinctly where , that some theatrical costumiers had shops in that district .
45279	45431	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" The day was cold , with a nipping wind down the northward running streets . I walked fast to avoid being overtaken . Every crossing was a danger , every passenger a thing to watch alertly . One man as I was about to pass him at the top of Bedford Street , turned upon me abruptly and came into me , sending me into the road and almost under the wheel of a passing hansom . The verdict of the cab - rank was that he had had some sort of stroke . I was so unnerved by this encounter that I went into Covent Garden Market and sat down for some time in a quiet corner by a stall of violets , panting and trembling . I found I had caught a fresh cold , and had to turn out after a time lest my sneezes should attract attention .
45432	45577	37922	37922	he	121	" At last I reached the object of my quest , a dirty , fly - blown little shop in a by - way near Drury Lane , with a window full of tinsel robes , sham jewels , wigs , slippers , dominoes and theatrical photographs . The shop was old - fashioned and low and dark , and the house rose above it for four storeys , dark and dismal . I peered through the window and , seeing no one within , entered . The opening of the door set a clanking bell ringing . I left it open , and walked round a bare costume stand , into a corner behind a cheval glass . For a minute or so no one came . Then I heard heavy feet striding across a room , and a man appeared down the shop .
45578	45650	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" My plans were now perfectly definite . I proposed to make my way into the house , secrete myself upstairs , watch my opportunity , and when everything was quiet , rummage out a wig , mask , spectacles , and costume , and go into the world , perhaps a grotesque but still a credible figure . And incidentally of course I could rob the house of any available money .
45651	45760	37922	37922	he	121	" The man who had just entered the shop was a short , slight , hunched , beetle - browed man , with long arms and very short bandy legs . Apparently I had interrupted a meal . He stared about the shop with an expression of expectation . This gave way to surprise , and then to anger , as he saw the shop empty . Damn the boys ! he said . He went to stare up and down the street . He came in again in a minute , kicked the door to with his foot spitefully , and went muttering back to the house door .
45761	45800	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" I came forward to follow him , and at the noise of my movement he stopped dead . I did so too , startled by his quickness of ear . He slammed the house door in my face .
45801	45871	37922	37922	he	121	" I stood hesitating . Suddenly I heard his quick footsteps returning , and the door reopened . He stood looking about the shop like one who was still not satisfied . Then , murmuring to himself , he examined the back of the counter and peered behind some fixtures . Then he stood doubtful . He had left the house door open and I slipped into the inner room .
45872	45998	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" It was a queer little room , poorly furnished and with a number of big masks in the corner . On the table was his belated breakfast , and it was a confoundedly exasperating thing for me , Kemp , to have to sniff his coffee and stand watching while he came in and resumed his meal . And his table manners were irritating . Three doors opened into the little room , one going upstairs and one down , but they were all shut . I could not get out of the room while he was there ; I could scarcely move because of his alertness , and there was a draught down my back . Twice I strangled a sneeze just in time .
45999	46227	37922	37922	he	121	" The spectacular quality of my sensations was curious and novel , but for all that I was heartily tired and angry long before he had done his eating . But at last he made an end and putting his beggarly crockery on the black tin tray upon which he had had his teapot , and gathering all the crumbs up on the mustard stained cloth , he took the whole lot of things after him . His burden prevented his shutting the door behind him as he would have done ; I never saw such a man for shutting doors and I followed him into a very dirty underground kitchen and scullery . I had the pleasure of seeing him begin to wash up , and then , finding no good in keeping down there , and the brick floor being cold on my feet , I returned upstairs and sat in his chair by the fire . It was burning low , and scarcely thinking , I put on a little coal . The noise of this brought him up at once , and he stood aglare . He peered about the room and was within an ace of touching me . Even after that examination , he scarcely seemed satisfied . He stopped in the doorway and took a final inspection before he went down .
46228	46258	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" I waited in the little parlour for an age , and at last he came up and opened the upstairs door . I just managed to get by him .
46259	46322	37922	37922	he	121	" On the staircase he stopped suddenly , so that I very nearly blundered into him . He stood looking back right into my face and listening . I could have sworn , he said . His long hairy hand pulled at his lower lip . His eye went up and down the staircase . Then he grunted and went on up again .
46323	46440	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" His hand was on the handle of a door , and then he stopped again with the same puzzled anger on his face . He was becoming aware of the faint sounds of my movements about him . The man must have had diabolically acute hearing . He suddenly flashed into rage . If there s anyone in this house he cried with an oath , and left the threat unfinished . He put his hand in his pocket , failed to find what he wanted , and rushing past me went blundering noisily and pugnaciously downstairs . But I did not follow him . I sat on the head of the staircase until his return .
46441	46470	37922	37922	he	121	" Presently he came up again , still muttering . He opened the door of the room , and before I could enter , slammed it in my face .
46471	46653	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" I resolved to explore the house , and spent some time in doing so as noiselessly as possible . The house was very old and tumble - down , damp so that the paper in the attics was peeling from the walls , and rat infested . Some of the door handles were stiff and I was afraid to turn them . Several rooms I did inspect were unfurnished , and others were littered with theatrical lumber , bought second - hand , I judged , from its appearance . In one room next to his I found a lot of old clothes . I began routing among these , and in my eagerness forgot again the evident sharpness of his ears . I heard a stealthy footstep and , looking up just in time , saw him peering in at the tumbled heap and holding an old - fashioned revolver in his hand . I stood perfectly still while he stared about open - mouthed and suspicious . It must have been her , he said slowly . Damn her !
46654	46774	37922	37922	he	121	" He shut the door quietly , and immediately I heard the key turn in the lock . Then his footsteps retreated . I realised abruptly that I was locked in . For a minute I did not know what to do . I walked from door to window and back , and stood perplexed . A gust of anger came upon me . But I decided to inspect the clothes before I did anything further , and my first attempt brought down a pile from an upper shelf . This brought him back , more sinister than ever . That time he actually touched me , jumped back with amazement and stood astonished in the middle of the room .
46775	46891	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" Presently he calmed a little . Rats , he said in an undertone , fingers on lips . He was evidently a little scared . I edged quietly out of the room , but a plank creaked . Then the infernal little brute started going all over the house , revolver in hand and locking door after door and pocketing the keys . When I realised what he was up to I had a fit of rage I could hardly control myself sufficiently to watch my opportunity . By this time I knew he was alone in the house , and so I made no more ado , but knocked him on the head . "
46892	46899	46901	46901	Kemp	121	" Knocked him on the head ? "
46903	46936	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" Yes stunned him as he was going downstairs . Hit him from behind with a stool that stood on the landing . He went downstairs like a bag of old boots . "
46937	46947	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" But I say ! The common conventions of humanity "
46948	47011	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" Are all very well for common people . But the point was , Kemp , that I had to get out of that house in a disguise without his seeing me . I couldn t think of any other way of doing it . And then I gagged him with a Louis Quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet . "
47012	47020	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" Tied him up in a sheet ! "
47021	47100	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" Made a sort of bag of it . It was rather a good idea to keep the idiot scared and quiet , and a devilish hard thing to get out of head away from the string . My dear Kemp , it s no good your sitting glaring as though I was a murderer . It had to be done . He had his revolver . If once he saw me he would be able to describe me "
47101	47105	47107	47107	Kemp	121	" But still , "
47109	47132	47107	47107	Kemp	121	" in England to - day . And the man was in his own house , and you were well , robbing . "
47133	47170	44976	44976	Kemp	121	" Robbing ! Confound it ! You ll call me a thief next ! Surely , Kemp , you re not fool enough to dance on the old strings . Can t you see my position ? "
47171	47176	47178	47178	Kemp	121	" And his too , "
47187	47195	47180	47182	The Invisible Man	150	" What do you mean to say ? "
47213	47220	47221	47221	he	121	" I suppose , after all , "
47230	47246	47221	47221	he	121	" the thing had to be done . You were in a fix . But still "
47247	47302	47196	47196	Kemp	121	" Of course I was in a fix an infernal fix . And he made me wild too hunting me about the house , fooling about with his revolver , locking and unlocking doors . He was simply exasperating . You don t blame me , do you ? You don t blame me ? "
47303	47309	47311	47311	Kemp	121	" I never blame anyone , "
47313	47327	47311	47311	Kemp	121	" It s quite out of fashion . What did you do next ? "
47328	47507	47196	47196	Kemp	121	" I was hungry . Downstairs I found a loaf and some rank cheese more than sufficient to satisfy my hunger . I took some brandy and water , and then went up past my impromptu bag he was lying quite still to the room containing the old clothes . This looked out upon the street , two lace curtains brown with dirt guarding the window . I went and peered out through their interstices . Outside the day was bright by contrast with the brown shadows of the dismal house in which I found myself , dazzlingly bright . A brisk traffic was going by , fruit carts , a hansom , a four - wheeler with a pile of boxes , a fishmonger s cart . I turned with spots of colour swimming before my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind me . My excitement was giving place to a clear apprehension of my position again . The room was full of a faint scent of benzoline , used , I suppose , in cleaning the garments .
47508	47583	47311	47311	Kemp	121	" I began a systematic search of the place . I should judge the hunchback had been alone in the house for some time . He was a curious person . Everything that could possibly be of service to me I collected in the clothes storeroom , and then I made a deliberate selection . I found a handbag I thought a suitable possession , and some powder , rouge , and sticking - plaster .
47584	47763	47196	47196	Kemp	121	" I had thought of painting and powdering my face and all that there was to show of me , in order to render myself visible , but the disadvantage of this lay in the fact that I should require turpentine and other appliances and a considerable amount of time before I could vanish again . Finally I chose a mask of the better type , slightly grotesque but not more so than many human beings , dark glasses , greyish whiskers , and a wig . I could find no underclothing , but that I could buy subsequently , and for the time I swathed myself in calico dominoes and some white cashmere scarfs . I could find no socks , but the hunchback s boots were rather a loose fit and sufficed . In a desk in the shop were three sovereigns and about thirty shillings worth of silver , and in a locked cupboard I burst in the inner room were eight pounds in gold . I could go forth into the world again , equipped .
47764	47866	47311	47311	Kemp	121	" Then came a curious hesitation . Was my appearance really credible ? I tried myself with a little bedroom looking - glass , inspecting myself from every point of view to discover any forgotten chink , but it all seemed sound . I was grotesque to the theatrical pitch , a stage miser , but I was certainly not a physical impossibility . Gathering confidence , I took my looking - glass down into the shop , pulled down the shop blinds , and surveyed myself from every point of view with the help of the cheval glass in the corner .
47867	47934	47196	47196	Kemp	121	" I spent some minutes screwing up my courage and then unlocked the shop door and marched out into the street , leaving the little man to get out of his sheet again when he liked . In five minutes a dozen turnings intervened between me and the costumier s shop . No one appeared to notice me very pointedly . My last difficulty seemed overcome . "
47939	47949	47951	47951	Kemp	121	" And you troubled no more about the hunchback ? "
47953	47956	47958	47960	the Invisible Man	150	" No , "
47962	47988	47958	47960	the Invisible Man	150	" Nor have I heard what became of him . I suppose he untied himself or kicked himself out . The knots were pretty tight . "
48001	48012	47196	47196	Kemp	121	" What happened when you went out into the Strand ? "
48013	48200	47989	47989	He	1042	" Oh ! disillusionment again . I thought my troubles were over . Practically I thought I had impunity to do whatever I chose , everything save to give away my secret . So I thought . Whatever I did , whatever the consequences might be , was nothing to me . I had merely to fling aside my garments and vanish . No person could hold me . I could take my money where I found it . I decided to treat myself to a sumptuous feast , and then put up at a good hotel , and accumulate a new outfit of property . I felt amazingly confident ; it s not particularly pleasant recalling that I was an ass . I went into a place and was already ordering lunch , when it occurred to me that I could not eat unless I exposed my invisible face . I finished ordering the lunch , told the man I should be back in ten minutes , and went out exasperated . I don t know if you have ever been disappointed in your appetite . "
48201	48207	48209	48209	Kemp	121	" Not quite so badly , "
48211	48218	48209	48209	Kemp	121	" but I can imagine it . "
48219	48321	47989	47989	He	1042	" I could have smashed the silly devils . At last , faint with the desire for tasteful food , I went into another place and demanded a private room . I am disfigured , I said . Badly . They looked at me curiously , but of course it was not their affair and so at last I got my lunch . It was not particularly well served , but it sufficed ; and when I had had it , I sat over a cigar , trying to plan my line of action . And outside a snowstorm was beginning . "
48322	48492	48209	48209	Kemp	121	" The more I thought it over , Kemp , the more I realised what a helpless absurdity an Invisible Man was in a cold and dirty climate and a crowded civilised city . Before I made this mad experiment I had dreamt of a thousand advantages . That afternoon it seemed all disappointment . I went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable . No doubt invisibility made it possible to get them , but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got . Ambition what is the good of pride of place when you can not appear there ? What is the good of the love of woman when her name must needs be Delilah ? I have no taste for politics , for the blackguardisms of fame , for philanthropy , for sport . What was I to do ? And for this I had become a wrapped - up mystery , a swathed and bandaged caricature of a man ! "
48507	48516	48518	48518	Kemp	121	" But how did you get to Iping ? "
48528	48601	48209	48209	Kemp	121	" I went there to work . I had one hope . It was a half idea ! I have it still . It is a full blown idea now . A way of getting back ! Of restoring what I have done . When I choose . When I have done all I mean to do invisibly . And that is what I chiefly want to talk to you about now . "
48602	48609	48209	48209	Kemp	121	" You went straight to Iping ? "
48610	48688	48209	48209	Kemp	121	" Yes . I had simply to get my three volumes of memoranda and my cheque - book , my luggage and underclothing , order a quantity of chemicals to work out this idea of mine I will show you the calculations as soon as I get my books and then I started . Jove ! I remember the snowstorm now , and the accursed bother it was to keep the snow from damping my pasteboard nose . "
48689	48694	48696	48696	Kemp	121	" At the end , "
48698	48717	48696	48696	Kemp	121	" the day before yesterday , when they found you out , you rather to judge by the papers "
48718	48733	48209	48209	Kemp	121	" I did . Rather . Did I kill that fool of a constable ? "
48734	48737	48739	48739	Kemp	121	" No , "
48741	48748	48739	48739	Kemp	121	" He s expected to recover . "
48749	48779	48209	48209	Kemp	121	" That s his luck , then . I clean lost my temper , the fools ! Why couldn t they leave me alone ? And that grocer lout ? "
48780	48787	48789	48789	Kemp	121	" There are no deaths expected , "
48791	48802	48804	48806	the Invisible Man	150	" I don t know about that tramp of mine , "
48813	48873	48209	48209	Kemp	121	" By Heaven , Kemp , you don t know what rage _ is _ ! ... To have worked for years , to have planned and plotted , and then to get some fumbling purblind idiot messing across your course ! ... Every conceivable sort of silly creature that has ever been created has been sent to cross me .
48874	48892	48960	48960	he	121	" If I have much more of it , I shall go wild I shall start mowing em .
48893	48908	48209	48209	Kemp	121	" As it is , they ve made things a thousand times more difficult . "
48909	48916	48918	48918	Kemp	121	" No doubt it s exasperating , "
48929	48933	48935	48935	Kemp	121	" But now , "
48946	48953	48935	48935	Kemp	121	" what are we to do ? "
48997	49019	48976	48985	the three men who were advancing up the hill road	1048	" What were you planning to do when you were heading for Port Burdock ? _ Had _ you any plan ? "
49020	49176	48976	48985	the three men who were advancing up the hill road	1048	" I was going to clear out of the country . But I have altered that plan rather since seeing you . I thought it would be wise , now the weather is hot and invisibility possible , to make for the South . Especially as my secret was known , and everyone would be on the lookout for a masked and muffled man . You have a line of steamers from here to France . My idea was to get aboard one and run the risks of the passage . Thence I could go by train into Spain , or else get to Algiers . It would not be difficult . There a man might always be invisible and yet live . And do things . I was using that tramp as a money box and luggage carrier , until I decided how to get my books and things sent over to meet me . "
49177	49182	48976	48985	the three men who were advancing up the hill road	1048	" That s clear . "
49183	49219	48976	48985	the three men who were advancing up the hill road	1048	" And then the filthy brute must needs try and rob me ! He _ has _ hidden my books , Kemp . Hidden my books ! If I can lay my hands on him ! "
49220	49232	48976	48985	the three men who were advancing up the hill road	1048	" Best plan to get the books out of him first . "
49233	49243	48976	48985	the three men who were advancing up the hill road	1048	" But where is he ? Do you know ? "
49244	49269	48976	48985	the three men who were advancing up the hill road	1048	" He s in the town police station , locked up , by his own request , in the strongest cell in the place . "
49270	49273	49275	49277	the Invisible Man	105	" Cur ! "
49279	49289	48976	48985	the three men who were advancing up the hill road	1048	" But that hangs up your plans a little . "
49290	49302	48976	48985	the three men who were advancing up the hill road	1048	" We must get those books ; those books are vital . "
49303	49306	49308	49308	Kemp	121	" Certainly , "
49321	49346	49308	49308	Kemp	121	" Certainly we must get those books . But that won t be difficult , if he doesn t know they re for you . "
49347	49350	49352	49354	the Invisible Man	105	" No , "
49381	49389	49390	49390	he	150	" Blundering into your house , Kemp , "
49393	49443	49390	49390	he	150	" changes all my plans . For you are a man that can understand . In spite of all that has happened , in spite of this publicity , of the loss of my books , of what I have suffered , there still remain great possibilities , huge possibilities "
49444	49454	49455	49455	he	150	" You have told no one I am here ? "
49462	49467	49468	49468	he	121	" That was implied , "
49471	49475	49477	49477	Griffin	131	" No one ? "
49479	49484	49500	49500	akimbo	1051	" Not a soul . "
49485	49489	49490	49492	The Invisible Man	105	" Ah ! Now "
49507	49563	49500	49500	akimbo	1051	" I made a mistake , Kemp , a huge mistake , in carrying this thing through alone . I have wasted strength , time , opportunities . Alone it is wonderful how little a man can do alone ! To rob a little , to hurt a little , and there is the end . "
49564	49622	49500	49500	akimbo	1051	" What I want , Kemp , is a goal - keeper , a helper , and a hiding - place , an arrangement whereby I can sleep and eat and rest in peace , and unsuspected . I must have a confederate . With a confederate , with food and rest a thousand things are possible . "
49623	49765	49500	49500	akimbo	1051	" Hitherto I have gone on vague lines . We have to consider all that invisibility means , all that it does not mean . It means little advantage for eavesdropping and so forth one makes sounds . It s of little help a little help perhaps in housebreaking and so forth . Once you ve caught me you could easily imprison me . But on the other hand I am hard to catch . This invisibility , in fact , is only good in two cases : It s useful in getting away , it s useful in approaching . It s particularly useful , therefore , in killing . I can walk round a man , whatever weapon he has , choose my point , strike as I like . Dodge as I like . Escape as I like . "
49780	49791	49500	49500	akimbo	1051	" And it is killing we must do , Kemp . "
49792	49800	49802	49802	Kemp	121	" It is killing we must do , "
49804	49827	49802	49802	Kemp	121	" I m listening to your plan , Griffin , but I m not agreeing , mind . _ Why _ killing ? "
49828	49948	49500	49500	akimbo	1051	" Not wanton killing , but a judicious slaying . The point is , they know there is an Invisible Man as well as we know there is an Invisible Man . And that Invisible Man , Kemp , must now establish a Reign of Terror . Yes ; no doubt it s startling . But I mean it . A Reign of Terror . He must take some town like your Burdock and terrify and dominate it . He must issue his orders . He can do that in a thousand ways scraps of paper thrust under doors would suffice . And all who disobey his orders he must kill , and kill all who would defend them . "
49949	49952	49954	49954	Kemp	121	" Humph ! "
49973	49981	49982	49982	he	121	" It seems to me , Griffin , "
49991	50002	49982	49982	he	121	" that your confederate would be in a difficult position . "
50003	50013	50015	50017	the Invisible Man	105	" No one would know he was a confederate , "
50025	50033	49982	49982	he	121	" Hush ! What s that downstairs ? "
50034	50037	50039	50039	Kemp	121	" Nothing , "
50050	50060	50061	50061	he	121	" I don t agree to this , Griffin , "
50064	50125	50061	50061	he	121	" Understand me , I don t agree to this . Why dream of playing a game against the race ? How can you hope to gain happiness ? Don t be a lone wolf . Publish your results ; take the world take the nation at least into your confidence . Think what you might do with a million helpers "
50133	50140	50141	50141	he	105	" There are footsteps coming upstairs , "
50148	50151	50153	50153	Kemp	121	" Nonsense , "
50155	50160	50162	50164	the Invisible Man	105	" Let me see , "
50203	50206	50208	50209	the Voice	601	" Traitor ! "
50657	50661	50663	50663	Kemp	121	" My God ! "
50665	50675	50663	50663	Kemp	121	" the game s up ! He s gone ! "
50735	50740	50742	50742	Kemp	121	" He is mad , "
50744	50813	50742	50742	Kemp	121	" inhuman . He is pure selfishness . He thinks of nothing but his own advantage , his own safety . I have listened to such a story this morning of brutal self - seeking .... He has wounded men . He will kill them unless we can prevent him . He will create a panic . Nothing can stop him . He is going out now furious ! "
50814	50820	50822	50822	Adye	133	" He must be caught , "
50824	50829	50822	50822	Adye	133	" That is certain . "
50830	50834	50836	50836	Kemp	121	" But how ? "
50845	50967	50836	50836	Kemp	121	" You must begin at once . You must set every available man to work ; you must prevent his leaving this district . Once he gets away , he may go through the countryside as he wills , killing and maiming . He dreams of a reign of terror ! A reign of terror , I tell you . You must set a watch on trains and roads and shipping . The garrison must help . You must wire for help . The only thing that may keep him here is the thought of recovering some books of notes he counts of value . I will tell you of that ! There is a man in your police station Marvel . "
50968	50972	50974	50974	Adye	133	" I know , "
50976	50988	50974	50974	Adye	133	" I know . Those books yes . But the tramp .... "
50989	51109	50836	50836	Kemp	121	" Says he hasn t them . But he thinks the tramp has . And you must prevent him from eating or sleeping ; day and night the country must be astir for him . Food must be locked up and secured , all food , so that he will have to break his way to it . The houses everywhere must be barred against him . Heaven send us cold nights and rain ! The whole country - side must begin hunting and keep hunting . I tell you , Adye , he is a danger , a disaster ; unless he is pinned and secured , it is frightful to think of the things that may happen . "
51110	51117	51119	51119	Adye	133	" What else can we do ? "
51121	51191	51119	51119	Adye	133	" I must go down at once and begin organising . But why not come ? Yes you come too ! Come , and we must hold a sort of council of war get Hopps to help and the railway managers . By Jove ! it s urgent . Come along tell me as we go . What else is there we can do ? Put that stuff down . "
51218	51226	51228	51228	one	214	" He s got away , sir , "
51230	51241	51243	51243	Adye	133	" We must go to the central station at once , "
51245	51272	51243	51243	Adye	133	" One of you go on down and get a cab to come up and meet us quickly . And now , Kemp , what else ? "
51273	51276	51278	51278	Kemp	121	" Dogs , "
51280	51298	51278	51278	Kemp	121	" Get dogs . They don t see him , but they wind him . Get dogs . "
51299	51302	51304	51304	Adye	133	" Good , "
51306	51331	51304	51304	Adye	133	" It s not generally known , but the prison officials over at Halstead know a man with bloodhounds . Dogs . What else ? "
51332	51337	51339	51339	Kemp	121	" Bear in mind , "
51341	51416	51339	51339	Kemp	121	" his food shows . After eating , his food shows until it is assimilated . So that he has to hide after eating . You must keep on beating . Every thicket , every quiet corner . And put all weapons all implements that might be weapons , away . He can t carry such things for long . And what he can snatch up and strike men with must be hidden away . "
51417	51421	51423	51423	Adye	133	" Good again , "
51425	51432	51423	51423	Adye	133	" We shall have him yet ! "
51433	51439	51441	51441	Kemp	121	" And on the roads , "
51446	51449	51451	51451	Adye	133	" Yes ? "
51453	51457	51459	51459	Kemp	121	" Powdered glass , "
51461	51477	51459	51459	Kemp	121	" It s cruel , I know . But think of what he may do ! "
51488	51513	51485	51485	his	133	" It s unsportsmanlike . I don t know . But I ll have powdered glass got ready . If he goes too far .... "
51514	51525	51527	51527	Kemp	121	" The man s become inhuman , I tell you , "
51529	51588	51527	51527	Kemp	121	" I am as sure he will establish a reign of terror so soon as he has got over the emotions of this escape as I am sure I am talking to you . Our only chance is to be ahead . He has cut himself off from his kind . His blood be upon his own head . "
52635	52637	52632	52634	the murdered man	1135	" trotting "
53387	53396	53354	53354	his	150	" You have been amazingly energetic and clever , "
53401	53674	53354	53354	his	150	" though what you stand to gain by it I can not imagine . You are against me . For a whole day you have chased me ; you have tried to rob me of a night s rest . But I have had food in spite of you , I have slept in spite of you , and the game is only beginning . The game is only beginning . There is nothing for it , but to start the Terror . This announces the first day of the Terror . Port Burdock is no longer under the Queen , tell your Colonel of Police , and the rest of them ; it is under me the Terror ! This is day one of year one of the new epoch the Epoch of the Invisible Man . I am Invisible Man the First . To begin with the rule will be easy . The first day there will be one execution for the sake of example a man named Kemp . Death starts for him to - day . He may lock himself away , hide himself away , get guards about him , put on armour if he likes Death , the unseen Death , is coming . Let him take precautions ; it will impress my people . Death starts from the pillar box by midday . The letter will fall in as the postman comes along , then off ! The game begins . Death starts . Help him not , my people , lest Death fall upon you also . To - day Kemp is to die . "
53681	53687	53688	53688	he	121	" It s no hoax , "
53691	53702	53675	53675	Kemp	121	" That s his voice ! And he means it . "

53858	53864	53865	53865	he	121	" There is no danger , "

53911	53917	53918	53918	he	121	" We will have him ! "
53921	53934	53918	53918	he	121	" and I am the bait . He will come too far . "
53949	53955	53956	53956	he	121	" It s a game , "
53959	53990	53956	53956	he	121	" an odd game but the chances are all for me , Mr. Griffin , in spite of your invisibility . Griffin _ contra mundum _ ... with a vengeance . "
54002	54047	53991	53991	He	121	" He must get food every day and I don t envy him . Did he really sleep last night ? Out in the open somewhere secure from collisions . I wish we could get some good cold wet weather instead of the heat . "
54048	54056	53956	53956	he	121	" He may be watching me now . "
54081	54087	54089	54089	Kemp	121	" I m getting nervous , "
54104	54112	54113	54113	he	121	" It must have been a sparrow , "

54178	54181	54183	54183	Kemp	121	" What ! "
54185	54206	54172	54172	he	133	" Had that note of yours taken away from her . He s close about here . Let me in . "
54239	54271	54223	54223	He	133	" Note was snatched out of her hand . Scared her horribly . She s down at the station . Hysterics . He s close here . What was it about ? "
54275	54282	54284	54284	Kemp	121	" What a fool I was , "
54286	54304	54284	54284	Kemp	121	" I might have known . It s not an hour s walk from Hintondean . Already ? "
54305	54310	54312	54312	Adye	133	" What s up ? "

54354	54362	54364	54364	Kemp	121	" Proposed a trap like a fool , "
54366	54380	54364	54364	Kemp	121	" and sent my proposal out by a maid servant . To him . "
54387	54393	54395	54395	Adye	133	" He ll clear out , "
54397	54401	54403	54403	Kemp	121	" Not he , "
54430	54438	54440	54440	Kemp	121	" It s a window , upstairs ! "
54542	54548	54550	54550	Adye	133	" What s this for ? "
54552	54558	54560	54560	Kemp	121	" It s a beginning , "
