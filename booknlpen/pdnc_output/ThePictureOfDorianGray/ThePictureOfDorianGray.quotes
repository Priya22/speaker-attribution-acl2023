829	846	848	849	Lord Henry	120	" It is your best work , Basil , the best thing you have ever done , "
852	928	848	849	Lord Henry	120	" You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor . The Academy is too large and too vulgar . Whenever I have gone there , there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures , which was dreadful , or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people , which was worse . The Grosvenor is really the only place . "
929	940	941	941	he	389	" I don t think I shall send it anywhere , "
964	974	945	945	his	389	" No , I won t send it anywhere . "
1009	1123	975	976	Lord Henry	120	" Not send it anywhere ? My dear fellow , why ? Have you any reason ? What odd chaps you painters are ! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation . As soon as you have one , you seem to want to throw it away . It is silly of you , for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about , and that is not being talked about . A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England , and make the old men quite jealous , if old men are ever capable of any emotion . "
1124	1133	1134	1134	he	389	" I know you will laugh at me , "
1137	1156	1134	1134	he	389	" but I really can t exhibit it . I have put too much of myself into it . "
1168	1186	975	976	Lord Henry	120	" Yes , I knew you would ; but it is quite true , all the same . "
1187	1484	975	976	Lord Henry	120	" Too much of yourself in it ! Upon my word , Basil , I didn t know you were so vain ; and I really can t see any resemblance between you , with your rugged strong face and your coal - black hair , and this young Adonis , who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose - leaves . Why , my dear Basil , he is a Narcissus , and you well , of course you have an intellectual expression and all that . But beauty , real beauty , ends where an intellectual expression begins . Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration , and destroys the harmony of any face . The moment one sits down to think , one becomes all nose , or all forehead , or something horrid . Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions . How perfectly hideous they are ! Except , of course , in the Church . But then in the Church they don t think . A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen , and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful . Your mysterious young friend , whose name you have never told me , but whose picture really fascinates me , never thinks . I feel quite sure of that . He is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at , and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence . Don t flatter yourself , Basil : you are not in the least like him . "
1485	1494	1496	1497	the artist	357	" You don t understand me , Harry , "
1499	1692	1496	1497	the artist	357	" Of course I am not like him . I know that perfectly well . Indeed , I should be sorry to look like him . You shrug your shoulders ? I am telling you the truth . There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction , the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings . It is better not to be different from one s fellows . The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world . They can sit at their ease and gape at the play . If they know nothing of victory , they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat . They live as we all should live undisturbed , indifferent , and without disquiet . They neither bring ruin upon others , nor ever receive it from alien hands . Your rank and wealth , Harry ; my brains , such as they are my art , whatever it may be worth ; Dorian Gray s good looks we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us , suffer terribly . "
1693	1702	1704	1705	Lord Henry	120	" Dorian Gray ? Is that his name ? "
1715	1733	975	976	Lord Henry	120	" Yes , that is his name . I didn t intend to tell it to you . "
1734	1739	975	976	Lord Henry	120	" But why not ? "
1740	1870	975	976	Lord Henry	120	" Oh , I can t explain . When I like people immensely , I never tell their names to any one . It is like surrendering a part of them . I have grown to love secrecy . It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us . The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it . When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going . If I did , I would lose all my pleasure . It is a silly habit , I dare say , but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one s life . I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it ? "
1871	1876	1878	1879	Lord Henry	120	" Not at all , "
1881	2030	1878	1879	Lord Henry	120	" not at all , my dear Basil . You seem to forget that I am married , and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties . I never know where my wife is , and my wife never knows what I am doing . When we meet we do meet occasionally , when we dine out together , or go down to the Duke s we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces . My wife is very good at it much better , in fact , than I am . She never gets confused over her dates , and I always do . But when she does find me out , she makes no row at all . I sometimes wish she would ; but she merely laughs at me . "
2031	2045	2047	2048	Basil Hallward	121	" I hate the way you talk about your married life , Harry , "
2060	2111	2047	2048	Basil Hallward	121	" I believe that you are really a very good husband , but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues . You are an extraordinary fellow . You never say a moral thing , and you never do a wrong thing . Your cynicism is simply a pose . "
2112	2128	2130	2131	Lord Henry	120	" Being natural is simply a pose , and the most irritating pose I know , "
2193	2204	2205	2205	he	120	" I am afraid I must be going , Basil , "
2208	2229	2205	2205	he	120	" and before I go , I insist on your answering a question I put to you some time ago . "
2230	2235	2237	2238	the painter	389	" What is that ? "
2248	2254	2205	2205	he	120	" You know quite well . "
2255	2262	2241	2241	his	389	" I do not , Harry . "
2263	2297	2205	2205	he	120	" Well , I will tell you what it is . I want you to explain to me why you won t exhibit Dorian Gray s picture . I want the real reason . "
2298	2306	2241	2241	his	389	" I told you the real reason . "
2307	2334	2205	2205	he	120	" No , you did not . You said it was because there was too much of yourself in it . Now , that is childish . "
2335	2338	2340	2341	Basil Hallward	121	" Harry , "
2350	2432	2340	2341	Basil Hallward	121	" every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist , not of the sitter . The sitter is merely the accident , the occasion . It is not he who is revealed by the painter ; it is rather the painter who , on the coloured canvas , reveals himself . The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul . "
2437	2443	2444	2444	he	120	" And what is that ? "
2447	2453	2455	2455	Hallward	121	" I will tell you , "
2467	2475	2477	2478	his companion	397	" I am all expectation , Basil , "
2484	2497	2499	2500	the painter	389	" Oh , there is really very little to tell , Harry , "
2502	2520	2499	2500	the painter	389	" and I am afraid you will hardly understand it . Perhaps you will hardly believe it . "
2542	2552	2553	2553	he	120	" I am quite sure I shall understand it , "
2568	2587	2553	2553	he	120	" and as for believing things , I can believe anything , provided that it is quite incredible . "
2666	2673	2675	2676	the painter	389	" The story is simply this , "
2681	3000	2675	2676	the painter	389	" Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon s. You know we poor artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time , just to remind the public that we are not savages . With an evening coat and a white tie , as you told me once , anybody , even a stock - broker , can gain a reputation for being civilized . Well , after I had been in the room about ten minutes , talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians , I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me . I turned half - way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time . When our eyes met , I felt that I was growing pale . A curious sensation of terror came over me . I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that , if I allowed it to do so , it would absorb my whole nature , my whole soul , my very art itself . I did not want any external influence in my life . You know yourself , Harry , how independent I am by nature . I have always been my own master ; had at least always been so , till I met Dorian Gray . Then but I don t know how to explain it to you . Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life . I had a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows . I grew afraid and turned to quit the room . It was not conscience that made me do so : it was a sort of cowardice . I take no credit to myself for trying to escape . "
3001	3027	2675	2676	the painter	389	" Conscience and cowardice are really the same things , Basil . Conscience is the trade - name of the firm . That is all . "
3028	3108	2675	2676	the painter	389	" I don t believe that , Harry , and I don t believe you do either . However , whatever was my motive and it may have been pride , for I used to be very proud I certainly struggled to the door . There , of course , I stumbled against Lady Brandon . You are not going to run away so soon , Mr. Hallward ? she screamed out . You know her curiously shrill voice ? "
3109	3121	3123	3124	Lord Henry	120	" Yes ; she is a peacock in everything but beauty , "
3137	3335	2675	2676	the painter	389	" I could not get rid of her . She brought me up to royalties , and people with stars and garters , and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses . She spoke of me as her dearest friend . I had only met her once before , but she took it into her head to lionize me . I believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time , at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers , which is the nineteenth - century standard of immortality . Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me . We were quite close , almost touching . Our eyes met again . It was reckless of me , but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him . Perhaps it was not so reckless , after all . It was simply inevitable . We would have spoken to each other without any introduction . I am sure of that . Dorian told me so afterwards . He , too , felt that we were destined to know each other . "
3336	3348	3350	3351	his companion	397	" And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man ? "
3353	3469	3350	3351	his companion	397	" I know she goes in for giving a rapid _ pr cis _ of all her guests . I remember her bringing me up to a truculent and red - faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons , and hissing into my ear , in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room , the most astounding details . I simply fled . I like to find out people for myself . But Lady Brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods . She either explains them entirely away , or tells one everything about them except what one wants to know . "
3470	3483	3485	3485	Hallward	121	" Poor Lady Brandon ! You are hard on her , Harry ! "
3488	3529	3350	3351	his companion	397	" My dear fellow , she tried to found a _ salon _ , and only succeeded in opening a restaurant . How could I admire her ? But tell me , what did she say about Mr. Dorian Gray ? "
3530	3588	3350	3351	his companion	397	" Oh , something like , Charming boy poor dear mother and I absolutely inseparable . Quite forget what he does afraid he doesn t do anything oh , yes , plays the piano or is it the violin , dear Mr. Gray ? Neither of us could help laughing , and we became friends at once . "
3589	3612	3614	3616	the young lord	402	" Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship , and it is far the best ending for one , "
3627	3638	3639	3639	he	121	" You don t understand what friendship is , Harry , "
3641	3668	3350	3351	his companion	397	" or what enmity is , for that matter . You like every one ; that is to say , you are indifferent to every one . "
3669	3676	3678	3679	Lord Henry	120	" How horribly unjust of you ! "
3713	3807	3678	3679	Lord Henry	120	" Yes ; horribly unjust of you . I make a great difference between people . I choose my friends for their good looks , my acquaintances for their good characters , and my enemies for their good intellects . A man can not be too careful in the choice of his enemies . I have not got one who is a fool . They are all men of some intellectual power , and consequently they all appreciate me . Is that very vain of me ? I think it is rather vain . "
3808	3829	3350	3351	his companion	397	" I should think it was , Harry . But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance . "
3830	3844	3678	3679	Lord Henry	120	" My dear old Basil , you are much more than an acquaintance . "
3845	3861	3350	3351	his companion	397	" And much less than a friend . A sort of brother , I suppose ? "
3862	3892	3678	3679	Lord Henry	120	" Oh , brothers ! I don t care for brothers . My elder brother won t die , and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else . "
3893	3896	3898	3898	Hallward	121	" Harry ! "
3902	4033	3678	3679	Lord Henry	120	" My dear fellow , I am not quite serious . But I can t help detesting my relations . I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves . I quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders . The masses feel that drunkenness , stupidity , and immorality should be their own special property , and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself , he is poaching on their preserves . When poor Southwark got into the divorce court , their indignation was quite magnificent . And yet I don t suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly . "
4034	4064	3350	3351	his companion	397	" I don t agree with a single word that you have said , and , what is more , Harry , I feel sure you don t either . "
4088	4269	4065	4066	Lord Henry	120	" How English you are Basil ! That is the second time you have made that observation . If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman always a rash thing to do he never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong . The only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself . Now , the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it . Indeed , the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is , the more purely intellectual will the idea be , as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants , his desires , or his prejudices . However , I don t propose to discuss politics , sociology , or metaphysics with you . I like persons better than principles , and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world . Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray . How often do you see him ? "
4270	4295	4065	4066	Lord Henry	120	" Every day . I couldn t be happy if I didn t see him every day . He is absolutely necessary to me . "
4296	4312	4065	4066	Lord Henry	120	" How extraordinary ! I thought you would never care for anything but your art . "
4313	4323	4325	4326	the painter	389	" He is all my art to me now , "
4329	4823	4325	4326	the painter	389	" I sometimes think , Harry , that there are only two eras of any importance in the world s history . The first is the appearance of a new medium for art , and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also . What the invention of oil - painting was to the Venetians , the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture , and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me . It is not merely that I paint from him , draw from him , sketch from him . Of course , I have done all that . But he is much more to me than a model or a sitter . I won t tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him , or that his beauty is such that art can not express it . There is nothing that art can not express , and I know that the work I have done , since I met Dorian Gray , is good work , is the best work of my life . But in some curious way I wonder will you understand me ? his personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art , an entirely new mode of style . I see things differently , I think of them differently . I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before . A dream of form in days of thought who is it who says that ? I forget ; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me . The merely visible presence of this lad for he seems to me little more than a lad , though he is really over twenty his merely visible presence ah ! I wonder can you realize all that that means ? Unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school , a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit , all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek . The harmony of soul and body how much that is ! We in our madness have separated the two , and have invented a realism that is vulgar , an ideality that is void . Harry ! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me ! You remember that landscape of mine , for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but which I would not part with ? It is one of the best things I have ever done . And why is it so ? Because , while I was painting it , Dorian Gray sat beside me . Some subtle influence passed from him to me , and for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for and always missed . "
4824	4837	5215	5216	The painter	389	" Basil , this is extraordinary ! I must see Dorian Gray . "
4859	4862	4863	4863	he	121	" Harry , "
4866	4946	4863	4863	he	121	" Dorian Gray is to me simply a motive in art . You might see nothing in him . I see everything in him . He is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there . He is a suggestion , as I have said , of a new manner . I find him in the curves of certain lines , in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours . That is all . "
4947	4957	4959	4960	Lord Henry	120	" Then why won t you exhibit his portrait ? "
4962	5058	4863	4863	he	121	" Because , without intending it , I have put into it some expression of all this curious artistic idolatry , of which , of course , I have never cared to speak to him . He knows nothing about it . He shall never know anything about it . But the world might guess it , and I will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes . My heart shall never be put under their microscope . There is too much of myself in the thing , Harry too much of myself ! "
5059	5088	4863	4863	he	121	" Poets are not so scrupulous as you are . They know how useful passion is for publication . Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions . "
5089	5096	5098	5098	Hallward	121	" I hate them for it , "
5100	5175	5098	5098	Hallward	121	" An artist should create beautiful things , but should put nothing of his own life into them . We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography . We have lost the abstract sense of beauty . Some day I will show the world what it is ; and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray . "
5176	5214	4863	4863	he	121	" I think you are wrong , Basil , but I won t argue with you . It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue . Tell me , is Dorian Gray very fond of you ? "
5223	5228	5229	5229	he	389	" He likes me , "
5235	5365	5229	5229	he	389	" I know he likes me . Of course I flatter him dreadfully . I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall be sorry for having said . As a rule , he is charming to me , and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things . Now and then , however , he is horribly thoughtless , and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain . Then I feel , Harry , that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat , a bit of decoration to charm his vanity , an ornament for a summer s day . "
5366	5378	5380	5381	Lord Henry	120	" Days in summer , Basil , are apt to linger , "
5383	5649	5380	5381	Lord Henry	120	" Perhaps you will tire sooner than he will . It is a sad thing to think of , but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty . That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over - educate ourselves . In the wild struggle for existence , we want to have something that endures , and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts , in the silly hope of keeping our place . The thoroughly well - informed man that is the modern ideal . And the mind of the thoroughly well - informed man is a dreadful thing . It is like a _ bric- -brac _ shop , all monsters and dust , with everything priced above its proper value . I think you will tire first , all the same . Some day you will look at your friend , and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing , or you won t like his tone of colour , or something . You will bitterly reproach him in your own heart , and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you . The next time he calls , you will be perfectly cold and indifferent . It will be a great pity , for it will alter you . What you have told me is quite a romance , a romance of art one might call it , and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic . "
5650	5687	5229	5229	he	389	" Harry , don t talk like that . As long as I live , the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me . You can t feel what I feel . You change too often . "
5688	5726	5380	5381	Lord Henry	120	" Ah , my dear Basil , that is exactly why I can feel it . Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love : it is the faithless who know love s tragedies . "
5983	5993	5976	5976	He	120	" My dear fellow , I have just remembered . "
5994	6000	5966	5967	his aunt	418	" Remembered what , Harry ? "
6001	6011	5976	5976	He	120	" Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray . "
6012	6017	6019	6019	Hallward	121	" Where was it ? "
6026	6152	5966	5967	his aunt	418	" Don t look so angry , Basil . It was at my aunt , Lady Agatha s. She told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her in the East End , and that his name was Dorian Gray . I am bound to state that she never told me he was good - looking . Women have no appreciation of good looks ; at least , good women have not . She said that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature . I at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair , horribly freckled , and tramping about on huge feet . I wish I had known it was your friend . "
6153	6164	6273	6273	he	2023	" I am very glad you didn t , Harry . "
6165	6168	5966	5967	his aunt	418	" Why ? "
6169	6179	6273	6273	he	2023	" I don t want you to meet him . "
6180	6190	5966	5967	his aunt	418	" You don t want me to meet him ? "
6191	6194	6273	6273	he	2023	" No . "
6195	6206	6208	6209	the butler	419	" Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio , sir , "
6216	6223	6225	6226	Lord Henry	120	" You must introduce me now , "
6244	6262	6263	6264	The man	2023	" Ask Mr. Gray to wait , Parker : I shall be in in a few moments . "
6279	6287	6288	6288	he	2023	" Dorian Gray is my dearest friend , "
6291	6380	6288	6288	he	2023	" He has a simple and a beautiful nature . Your aunt was quite right in what she said of him . Don t spoil him . Don t try to influence him . Your influence would be bad . The world is wide , and has many marvellous people in it . Don t take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses : my life as an artist depends on him . Mind , Harry , I trust you . "
6399	6405	6407	6408	Lord Henry	120	" What nonsense you talk ! "
6461	6465	6446	6446	his	117	" Forest Scenes . "
6466	6475	6476	6476	he	117	" You must lend me these , Basil , "
6479	6491	6476	6476	he	117	" I want to learn them . They are perfectly charming . "
6492	6506	6446	6446	his	117	" That entirely depends on how you sit to - day , Dorian . "
6507	6529	6531	6532	the lad	427	" Oh , I am tired of sitting , and I don t want a life - sized portrait of myself , "
6571	6591	6567	6567	he	117	" I beg your pardon , Basil , but I didn t know you had any one with you . "
6592	6628	6531	6532	the lad	427	" This is Lord Henry Wotton , Dorian , an old Oxford friend of mine . I have just been telling him what a capital sitter you were , and now you have spoiled everything . "
6629	6643	6645	6646	Lord Henry	120	" You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you , Mr. Gray , "
6655	6685	6645	6646	Lord Henry	120	" My aunt has often spoken to me about you . You are one of her favourites , and , I am afraid , one of her victims also . "
6686	6698	6700	6700	Dorian	117	" I am in Lady Agatha s black books at present , "
6708	6764	6700	6700	Dorian	117	" I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel with her last Tuesday , and I really forgot all about it . We were to have played a duet together three duets , I believe . I don t know what she will say to me . I am far too frightened to call . "
6765	6825	6855	6855	he	428	" Oh , I will make your peace with my aunt . She is quite devoted to you . And I don t think it really matters about your not being there . The audience probably thought it was a duet . When Aunt Agatha sits down to the piano , she makes quite enough noise for two people . "
6826	6841	6843	6843	Dorian	428	" That is very horrid to her , and not very nice to me , "
6928	6945	6947	6948	Lord Henry	120	" You are too charming to go in for philanthropy , Mr. Gray far too charming . "
7005	7034	6991	6991	he	389	" Harry , I want to finish this picture to - day . Would you think it awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away ? "
7044	7053	7035	7036	Lord Henry	120	" Am I to go , Mr. Gray ? "
7057	7106	6991	6991	he	389	" Oh , please don t , Lord Henry . I see that Basil is in one of his sulky moods , and I can t bear him when he sulks . Besides , I want you to tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy . "
7107	7184	6991	6991	he	389	" I don t know that I shall tell you that , Mr. Gray . It is so tedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it . But I certainly shall not run away , now that you have asked me to stop . You don t really mind , Basil , do you ? You have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to . "
7190	7213	7185	7185	Hallward	433	" If Dorian wishes it , of course you must stay . Dorian s whims are laws to everybody , except himself . "
7223	7294	7214	7215	Lord Henry	120	" You are very pressing , Basil , but I am afraid I must go . I have promised to meet a man at the Orleans . Good - bye , Mr. Gray . Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon Street . I am nearly always at home at five o clock . Write to me when you are coming . I should be sorry to miss you . "
7295	7298	7300	7301	Dorian Gray	117	" Basil , "
7303	7351	7300	7301	Dorian Gray	117	" if Lord Henry Wotton goes , I shall go , too . You never open your lips while you are painting , and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant . Ask him to stay . I insist upon it . "
7352	7366	7368	7368	Hallward	121	" Stay , Harry , to oblige Dorian , and to oblige me , "
7376	7412	7368	7368	Hallward	121	" It is quite true , I never talk when I am working , and never listen either , and it must be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters . I beg you to stay . "
7413	7423	7300	7301	Dorian Gray	117	" But what about my man at the Orleans ? "
7428	7494	7424	7425	The painter	389	" I don t think there will be any difficulty about that . Sit down again , Harry . And now , Dorian , get up on the platform , and don t move about too much , or pay any attention to what Lord Henry says . He has a very bad influence over all his friends , with the single exception of myself . "
7562	7580	7557	7557	he	117	" Have you really a very bad influence , Lord Henry ? As bad as Basil says ? "
7581	7607	7546	7546	he	120	" There is no such thing as a good influence , Mr. Gray . All influence is immoral immoral from the scientific point of view . "
7608	7611	7557	7557	he	117	" Why ? "
7612	7815	7546	7546	he	120	" Because to influence a person is to give him one s own soul . He does not think his natural thoughts , or burn with his natural passions . His virtues are not real to him . His sins , if there are such things as sins , are borrowed . He becomes an echo of some one else s music , an actor of a part that has not been written for him . The aim of life is self - development . To realize one s nature perfectly that is what each of us is here for . People are afraid of themselves , nowadays . They have forgotten the highest of all duties , the duty that one owes to one s self . Of course , they are charitable . They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar . But their own souls starve , and are naked . Courage has gone out of our race . Perhaps we never really had it . The terror of society , which is the basis of morals , the terror of God , which is the secret of religion these are the two things that govern us . And yet "
7816	7835	7837	7838	the painter	389	" Just turn your head a little more to the right , Dorian , like a good boy , "
7865	7869	7871	7872	Lord Henry	120	" And yet , "
7907	8214	7899	7899	he	120	" I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely , were to give form to every feeling , expression to every thought , reality to every dream I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of medi valism , and return to the Hellenic ideal to something finer , richer than the Hellenic ideal , it may be . But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself . The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self - denial that mars our lives . We are punished for our refusals . Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us . The body sins once , and has done with its sin , for action is a mode of purification . Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure , or the luxury of a regret . The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it . Resist it , and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself , with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful . It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain . It is in the brain , and the brain only , that the great sins of the world take place also . You , Mr. Gray , you yourself , with your rose - red youth and your rose - white boyhood , you have had passions that have made you afraid , thoughts that have filled you with terror , day - dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame "
8215	8218	8220	8221	Dorian Gray	117	" Stop ! "
8223	8271	8220	8221	Dorian Gray	117	" stop ! you bewilder me . I don t know what to say . There is some answer to you , but I can not find it . Don t speak . Let me think . Or , rather , let me try not to think . "
8672	8681	8683	8684	Dorian Gray	117	" Basil , I am tired of standing , "
8687	8704	8683	8684	Dorian Gray	117	" I must go out and sit in the garden . The air is stifling here . "
8705	8803	8630	8631	the lad	427	" My dear fellow , I am so sorry . When I am painting , I can t think of anything else . But you never sat better . You were perfectly still . And I have caught the effect I wanted the half - parted lips and the bright look in the eyes . I don t know what Harry has been saying to you , but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression . I suppose he has been paying you compliments . You mustn t believe a word that he says . "
8804	8830	8683	8684	Dorian Gray	117	" He has certainly not been paying me compliments . Perhaps that is the reason that I don t believe anything he has told me . "
8831	8839	8841	8842	Lord Henry	120	" You know you believe it all , "
8853	8888	8841	8842	Lord Henry	120	" I will go out to the garden with you . It is horribly hot in the studio . Basil , let us have something iced to drink , something with strawberries in it . "
8889	8967	9009	9009	his	120	" Certainly , Harry . Just touch the bell , and when Parker comes I will tell him what you want . I have got to work up this background , so I will join you later on . Don t keep Dorian too long . I have never been in better form for painting than I am to - day . This is going to be my masterpiece . It is my masterpiece as it stands . "
9015	9024	9025	9025	he	120	" You are quite right to do that , "
9028	9049	9025	9025	he	120	" Nothing can cure the soul but the senses , just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul . "
9117	9120	9122	9123	Lord Henry	120	" Yes , "
9125	9180	9122	9123	Lord Henry	120	" that is one of the great secrets of life to cure the soul by means of the senses , and the senses by means of the soul . You are a wonderful creation . You know more than you think you know , just as you know less than you want to know . "
9361	9371	9373	9374	Lord Henry	120	" Let us go and sit in the shade , "
9376	9423	9373	9374	Lord Henry	120	" Parker has brought out the drinks , and if you stay any longer in this glare , you will be quite spoiled , and Basil will never paint you again . You really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt . It would be unbecoming . "
9424	9430	9432	9433	Dorian Gray	117	" What can it matter ? "
9451	9462	9373	9374	Lord Henry	120	" It should matter everything to you , Mr. Gray . "
9463	9466	9373	9374	Lord Henry	120	" Why ? "
9467	9485	9373	9374	Lord Henry	120	" Because you have the most marvellous youth , and youth is the one thing worth having . "
9486	9496	9373	9374	Lord Henry	120	" I don t feel that , Lord Henry . "
9497	10208	9373	9374	Lord Henry	120	" No , you don t feel it now . Some day , when you are old and wrinkled and ugly , when thought has seared your forehead with its lines , and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires , you will feel it , you will feel it terribly . Now , wherever you go , you charm the world . Will it always be so ? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face , Mr. Gray . Don t frown . You have . And beauty is a form of genius is higher , indeed , than genius , as it needs no explanation . It is of the great facts of the world , like sunlight , or spring - time , or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon . It can not be questioned . It has its divine right of sovereignty . It makes princes of those who have it . You smile ? Ah ! when you have lost it you won t smile .... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial . That may be so , but at least it is not so superficial as thought is . To me , beauty is the wonder of wonders . It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances . The true mystery of the world is the visible , not the invisible .... Yes , Mr. Gray , the gods have been good to you . But what the gods give they quickly take away . You have only a few years in which to live really , perfectly , and fully . When your youth goes , your beauty will go with it , and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you , or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats . Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful . Time is jealous of you , and wars against your lilies and your roses . You will become sallow , and hollow - cheeked , and dull - eyed . You will suffer horribly .... Ah ! realize your youth while you have it . Don t squander the gold of your days , listening to the tedious , trying to improve the hopeless failure , or giving away your life to the ignorant , the common , and the vulgar . These are the sickly aims , the false ideals , of our age . Live ! Live the wonderful life that is in you ! Let nothing be lost upon you . Be always searching for new sensations . Be afraid of nothing .... A new Hedonism that is what our century wants . You might be its visible symbol . With your personality there is nothing you could not do . The world belongs to you for a season .... The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are , of what you really might be . There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself . I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted . For there is such a little time that your youth will last such a little time . The common hill - flowers wither , but they blossom again . The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now . In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis , and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars . But we never get back our youth . The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish . Our limbs fail , our senses rot . We degenerate into hideous puppets , haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid , and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to . Youth ! Youth ! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth ! "
10383	10388	10389	10389	he	389	" I am waiting , "
10392	10410	10389	10389	he	389	" Do come in . The light is quite perfect , and you can bring your drinks . "
10450	10462	10464	10465	Lord Henry	120	" You are glad you have met me , Mr. Gray , "
10471	10487	10464	10465	Lord Henry	120	" Yes , I am glad now . I wonder shall I always be glad ? "
10488	10554	10464	10465	Lord Henry	120	" Always ! That is a dreadful word . It makes me shudder when I hear it . Women are so fond of using it . They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever . It is a meaningless word , too . The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer . "
10572	10584	10585	10585	he	117	" In that case , let our friendship be a caprice , "
10729	10735	10736	10736	he	121	" It is quite finished , "
10787	10798	10799	10799	he	120	" My dear fellow , I congratulate you most warmly , "
10802	10822	10799	10799	he	120	" It is the finest portrait of modern times . Mr. Gray , come over and look at yourself . "
10834	10840	10841	10841	he	120	" Is it really finished ? "
10850	10854	10856	10857	the painter	389	" Quite finished , "
10859	10876	10856	10857	the painter	389	" And you have sat splendidly to - day . I am awfully obliged to you . "
10877	10885	10888	10889	Lord Henry	120	" That is entirely due to me , "
10891	10899	10888	10889	Lord Henry	120	" Isn t it , Mr. Gray ? "
11219	11226	11228	11228	Hallward	121	" Don t you like it ? "
11247	11254	11256	11257	Lord Henry	120	" Of course he likes it , "
11259	11294	11256	11257	Lord Henry	120	" Who wouldn t like it ? It is one of the greatest things in modern art . I will give you anything you like to ask for it . I must have it . "
11295	11304	11236	11237	the lad	427	" It is not my property , Harry . "
11305	11311	11256	11257	Lord Henry	120	" Whose property is it ? "
11312	11319	11321	11322	the painter	389	" Dorian s , of course , "
11324	11332	11256	11257	Lord Henry	120	" He is a very lucky fellow . "
11333	11339	11341	11342	Dorian Gray	117	" How sad it is ! "
11353	11449	11341	11342	Dorian Gray	117	" How sad it is ! I shall grow old , and horrible , and dreadful . But this picture will remain always young . It will never be older than this particular day of June .... If it were only the other way ! If it were I who was to be always young , and the picture that was to grow old ! For that for that I would give everything ! Yes , there is nothing in the whole world I would not give ! I would give my soul for that ! "
11450	11462	11464	11465	Lord Henry	120	" You would hardly care for such an arrangement , Basil , "
11469	11480	11464	11465	Lord Henry	120	" It would be rather hard lines on your work . "
11481	11490	11492	11492	Hallward	121	" I should object very strongly , Harry , "
11502	11539	11494	11495	Dorian Gray	117	" I believe you would , Basil . You like your art better than your friends . I am no more to you than a green bronze figure . Hardly as much , I dare say . "
11574	11577	11578	11578	he	117	" Yes , "
11581	11678	11578	11578	he	117	" I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun . You will like them always . How long will you like me ? Till I have my first wrinkle , I suppose . I know , now , that when one loses one s good looks , whatever they may be , one loses everything . Your picture has taught me that . Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right . Youth is the only thing worth having . When I find that I am growing old , I shall kill myself . "
11687	11692	11693	11693	he	121	" Dorian ! Dorian ! "
11696	11741	11693	11693	he	121	" don t talk like that . I have never had such a friend as you , and I shall never have such another . You are not jealous of material things , are you ? you who are finer than any of them ! "
11742	11831	11855	11855	his	121	" I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die . I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me . Why should it keep what I must lose ? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives something to it . Oh , if it were only the other way ! If the picture could change , and I could be always what I am now ! Why did you paint it ? It will mock me some day mock me horribly ! "
11867	11875	11877	11878	the painter	389	" This is your doing , Harry , "
11887	11898	11881	11882	Lord Henry	120	" It is the real Dorian Gray that is all . "
11899	11904	11877	11878	the painter	389	" It is not . "
11905	11919	11881	11882	Lord Henry	120	" If it is not , what have I to do with it ? "
11920	11931	11932	11932	he	121	" You should have gone away when I asked you , "
11935	11943	11945	11946	Lord Henry	120	" I stayed when you asked me , "
11950	12012	12057	12057	he	117	" Harry , I can t quarrel with my two best friends at once , but between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever done , and I will destroy it . What is it but canvas and colour ? I will not let it come across our three lives and mar them . "
12151	12160	12161	12161	he	427	" Don t , Basil , don t ! "
12164	12170	12161	12161	he	427	" It would be murder ! "
12171	12184	12186	12187	the painter	389	" I am glad you appreciate my work at last , Dorian , "
12197	12204	12190	12190	he	389	" I never thought you would . "
12205	12228	12161	12161	he	427	" Appreciate it ? I am in love with it , Basil . It is part of myself . I feel that . "
12229	12261	12190	12190	he	389	" Well , as soon as you are dry , you shall be varnished , and framed , and sent home . Then you can do what you like with yourself . "
12275	12302	12263	12263	he	427	" You will have tea , of course , Dorian ? And so will you , Harry ? Or do you object to such simple pleasures ? "
12303	12309	12311	12312	Lord Henry	120	" I adore simple pleasures , "
12314	12424	12311	12312	Lord Henry	120	" They are the last refuge of the complex . But I don t like scenes , except on the stage . What absurd fellows you are , both of you ! I wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal . It was the most premature definition ever given . Man is many things , but he is not rational . I am glad he is not , after all though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture . You had much better let me have it , Basil . This silly boy doesn t really want it , and I really do . "
12425	12444	12446	12447	Dorian Gray	117	" If you let any one have it but me , Basil , I shall never forgive you ! "
12449	12463	12446	12447	Dorian Gray	117	" and I don t allow people to call me a silly boy . "
12464	12483	12263	12263	he	427	" You know the picture is yours , Dorian . I gave it to you before it existed . "
12484	12514	12446	12447	Dorian Gray	117	" And you know you have been a little silly , Mr. Gray , and that you don t really object to being reminded that you are extremely young . "
12515	12528	12263	12263	he	427	" I should have objected very strongly this morning , Lord Henry . "
12529	12541	12446	12447	Dorian Gray	117	" Ah ! this morning ! You have lived since then . "
12626	12637	12639	12640	Lord Henry	120	" Let us go to the theatre to - night , "
12642	12718	12639	12640	Lord Henry	120	" There is sure to be something on , somewhere . I have promised to dine at White s , but it is only with an old friend , so I can send him a wire to say that I am ill , or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement . I think that would be a rather nice excuse : it would have all the surprise of candour . "
12719	12733	12735	12735	Hallward	121	" It is such a bore putting on one s dress - clothes , "
12737	12751	12735	12735	Hallward	121	" And , when one has them on , they are so horrid . "
12752	12755	12757	12758	Lord Henry	120	" Yes , "
12761	12792	12757	12758	Lord Henry	120	" the costume of the nineteenth century is detestable . It is so sombre , so depressing . Sin is the only real colour - element left in modern life . "
12793	12807	12735	12735	Hallward	121	" You really must not say things like that before Dorian , Harry . "
12808	12830	12757	12758	Lord Henry	120	" Before which Dorian ? The one who is pouring out tea for us , or the one in the picture ? "
12831	12835	12735	12735	Hallward	121	" Before either . "
12836	12851	12853	12854	the lad	427	" I should like to come to the theatre with you , Lord Henry , "
12856	12875	12925	12925	his	389	" Then you shall come ; and you will come , too , Basil , won t you ? "
12876	12897	12925	12925	his	389	" I can t , really . I would sooner not . I have a lot of work to do . "
12898	12913	12925	12925	his	389	" Well , then , you and I will go alone , Mr. Gray . "
12914	12921	12925	12925	his	389	" I should like that awfully . "
12939	12948	12949	12949	he	389	" I shall stay with the real Dorian , "
12954	12961	12963	12967	the original of the portrait	482	" Is it the real Dorian ? "
12974	12981	12963	12967	the original of the portrait	482	" Am I really like that ? "
12982	12991	12925	12925	his	389	" Yes ; you are just like that . "
12992	12998	12963	12967	the original of the portrait	482	" How wonderful , Basil ! "
12999	13015	13017	13017	Hallward	121	" At least you are like it in appearance . But it will never alter , "
13019	13024	13017	13017	Hallward	121	" That is something . "
13025	13034	13036	13037	Lord Henry	120	" What a fuss people make about fidelity ! "
13039	13092	13036	13037	Lord Henry	120	" Why , even in love it is purely a question for physiology . It has nothing to do with our own will . Young men want to be faithful , and are not ; old men want to be faithless , and can not : that is all one can say . "
13093	13106	13108	13108	Hallward	121	" Don t go to the theatre to - night , Dorian , "
13110	13117	13108	13108	Hallward	121	" Stop and dine with me . "
13118	13125	13036	13037	Lord Henry	120	" I can t , Basil . "
13126	13129	13108	13108	Hallward	121	" Why ? "
13130	13143	13036	13037	Lord Henry	120	" Because I have promised Lord Henry Wotton to go with him . "
13144	13170	13108	13108	Hallward	121	" He won t like you the better for keeping your promises . He always breaks his own . I beg you not to go . "
13179	13184	13171	13172	Dorian Gray	117	" I entreat you . "
13210	13217	13218	13218	he	120	" I must go , Basil , "
13221	13225	13227	13227	Hallward	121	" Very well , "
13242	13286	13230	13230	he	121	" It is rather late , and , as you have to dress , you had better lose no time . Good - bye , Harry . Good - bye , Dorian . Come and see me soon . Come to - morrow . "
13287	13290	13218	13218	he	120	" Certainly . "
13291	13297	13230	13230	he	121	" You won t forget ? "
13298	13305	13307	13307	Dorian	485	" No , of course not , "
13309	13314	13230	13230	he	121	" And ... Harry ! "
13315	13320	13230	13230	he	121	" Yes , Basil ? "
13321	13337	13230	13230	he	121	" Remember what I asked you , when we were in the garden this morning . "
13338	13344	13230	13230	he	121	" I have forgotten it . "
13345	13350	13230	13230	he	121	" I trust you . "
13351	13359	13361	13362	Lord Henry	120	" I wish I could trust myself , "
13366	13401	13361	13362	Lord Henry	120	" Come , Mr. Gray , my hansom is outside , and I can drop you at your own place . Good - bye , Basil . It has been a most interesting afternoon . "
13831	13836	13838	13840	the old gentleman	514	" Well , Harry , "
13842	13867	13838	13840	the old gentleman	514	" what brings you out so early ? I thought you dandies never got up till two , and were not visible till five . "
13868	13889	13810	13811	his uncle	489	" Pure family affection , I assure you , Uncle George . I want to get something out of you . "
13890	13896	13898	13899	Lord Fermor	136	" Money , I suppose , "
13906	13929	13898	13899	Lord Fermor	136	" Well , sit down and tell me all about it . Young people , nowadays , imagine that money is everything . "
13930	13933	13935	13936	Lord Henry	120	" Yes , "
13947	14034	13935	13936	Lord Henry	120	" and when they grow older they know it . But I don t want money . It is only people who pay their bills who want that , Uncle George , and I never pay mine . Credit is the capital of a younger son , and one lives charmingly upon it . Besides , I always deal with Dartmoor s tradesmen , and consequently they never bother me . What I want is information : not useful information , of course ; useless information . "
14035	14131	13898	13899	Lord Fermor	136	" Well , I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book , Harry , although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense . When I was in the Diplomatic , things were much better . But I hear they let them in now by examination . What can you expect ? Examinations , sir , are pure humbug from beginning to end . If a man is a gentleman , he knows quite enough , and if he is not a gentleman , whatever he knows is bad for him . "
14132	14146	14148	14149	Lord Henry	120	" Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books , Uncle George , "
14152	14161	14163	14164	Lord Fermor	136	" Mr. Dorian Gray ? Who is he ? "
14172	14267	13935	13936	Lord Henry	120	" That is what I have come to learn , Uncle George . Or rather , I know who he is . He is the last Lord Kelso s grandson . His mother was a Devereux , Lady Margaret Devereux . I want you to tell me about his mother . What was she like ? Whom did she marry ? You have known nearly everybody in your time , so you might have known her . I am very much interested in Mr. Gray at present . I have only just met him . "
14268	14273	14275	14277	the old gentleman	514	" Kelso s grandson ! "
14279	14532	14275	14277	the old gentleman	514	" Kelso s grandson ! ... Of course .... I knew his mother intimately . I believe I was at her christening . She was an extraordinarily beautiful girl , Margaret Devereux , and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless young fellow a mere nobody , sir , a subaltern in a foot regiment , or something of that kind . Certainly . I remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday . The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few months after the marriage . There was an ugly story about it . They said Kelso got some rascally adventurer , some Belgian brute , to insult his son - in - law in public paid him , sir , to do it , paid him and that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon . The thing was hushed up , but , egad , Kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards . He brought his daughter back with him , I was told , and she never spoke to him again . Oh , yes ; it was a bad business . The girl died , too , died within a year . So she left a son , did she ? I had forgotten that . What sort of boy is he ? If he is like his mother , he must be a good - looking chap . "
14533	14541	14543	14544	Lord Henry	120	" He is very good - looking , "
14546	14556	14558	14560	the old man	516	" I hope he will fall into proper hands , "
14562	14689	14558	14560	the old man	516	" He should have a pot of money waiting for him if Kelso did the right thing by him . His mother had money , too . All the Selby property came to her , through her grandfather . Her grandfather hated Kelso , thought him a mean dog . He was , too . Came to Madrid once when I was there . Egad , I was ashamed of him . The Queen used to ask me about the English noble who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares . They made quite a story of it . I didn t dare show my face at Court for a month . I hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies . "
14690	14696	14698	14699	Lord Henry	120	" I don t know , "
14701	14739	14698	14699	Lord Henry	120	" I fancy that the boy will be well off . He is not of age yet . He has Selby , I know . He told me so . And ... his mother was very beautiful ? "
14740	14887	14558	14560	the old man	516	" Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw , Harry . What on earth induced her to behave as she did , I never could understand . She could have married anybody she chose . Carlington was mad after her . She was romantic , though . All the women of that family were . The men were a poor lot , but , egad ! the women were wonderful . Carlington went on his knees to her . Told me so himself . She laughed at him , and there wasn t a girl in London at the time who wasn t after him . And by the way , Harry , talking about silly marriages , what is this humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an American ? Ain t English girls good enough for him ? "
14888	14902	14698	14699	Lord Henry	120	" It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now , Uncle George . "
14903	14915	14917	14918	Lord Fermor	136	" I ll back English women against the world , Harry , "
14927	14935	14698	14699	Lord Henry	120	" The betting is on the Americans . "
14936	14946	14948	14949	his uncle	489	" They don t last , I am told , "
14951	14980	14698	14699	Lord Henry	120	" A long engagement exhausts them , but they are capital at a steeplechase . They take things flying . I don t think Dartmoor has a chance . "
14981	14987	14989	14991	the old gentleman	514	" Who are her people ? "
14993	14999	14989	14991	the old gentleman	514	" Has she got any ? "
15006	15026	15027	15027	he	120	" American girls are as clever at concealing their parents , as English women are at concealing their past , "
15034	15044	14698	14699	Lord Henry	120	" They are pork - packers , I suppose ? "
15045	15076	14698	14699	Lord Henry	120	" I hope so , Uncle George , for Dartmoor s sake . I am told that pork - packing is the most lucrative profession in America , after politics . "
15077	15082	14698	14699	Lord Henry	120	" Is she pretty ? "
15083	15105	14698	14699	Lord Henry	120	" She behaves as if she was beautiful . Most American women do . It is the secret of their charm . "
15106	15132	14698	14699	Lord Henry	120	" Why can t these American women stay in their own country ? They are always telling us that it is the paradise for women . "
15133	15157	15159	15160	Lord Henry	120	" It is . That is the reason why , like Eve , they are so excessively anxious to get out of it , "
15162	15210	15159	15160	Lord Henry	120	" Good - bye , Uncle George . I shall be late for lunch , if I stop any longer . Thanks for giving me the information I wanted . I always like to know everything about my new friends , and nothing about my old ones . "
15211	15219	14698	14699	Lord Henry	120	" Where are you lunching , Harry ? "
15220	15242	15159	15160	Lord Henry	120	" At Aunt Agatha s. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray . He is her latest _ prot g _ . "
15243	15291	14698	14699	Lord Henry	120	" Humph ! tell your Aunt Agatha , Harry , not to bother me any more with her charity appeals . I am sick of them . Why , the good woman thinks that I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her silly fads . "
15292	15326	15159	15160	Lord Henry	120	" All right , Uncle George , I ll tell her , but it won t have any effect . Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity . It is their distinguishing characteristic . "
16114	16121	16127	16127	her	418	" Late as usual , Harry , "
16447	16458	16460	16461	the duchess	573	" We are talking about poor Dartmoor , Lord Henry , "
16471	16484	16460	16461	the duchess	573	" Do you think he will really marry this fascinating young person ? "
16485	16501	16442	16442	them	572	" I believe she has made up her mind to propose to him , Duchess . "
16502	16506	16508	16509	Lady Agatha	131	" How dreadful ! "
16511	16519	16508	16509	Lady Agatha	131	" Really , some one should interfere . "
16520	16540	16542	16544	Sir Thomas Burdon	149	" I am told , on excellent authority , that her father keeps an American dry - goods store , "
16549	16562	16508	16509	Lady Agatha	131	" My uncle has already suggested pork - packing , Sir Thomas . "
16563	16575	16577	16578	the duchess	573	" Dry - goods ! What are American dry - goods ? "
16591	16595	16597	16598	Lord Henry	120	" American novels , "
16611	16620	16622	16623	Lady Agatha	131	" Don t mind him , my dear , "
16625	16634	16622	16623	Lady Agatha	131	" He never means anything that he says . "
16635	16641	16643	16645	the Radical member	576	" When America was discovered , "
16680	16693	16694	16694	she	573	" I wish to goodness it never had been discovered at all ! "
16697	16712	16694	16694	she	573	" Really , our girls have no chance nowadays . It is most unfair . "
16713	16725	16727	16728	Mr. Erskine	151	" Perhaps , after all , America never has been discovered , "
16730	16742	16727	16728	Mr. Erskine	151	" I myself would say that it had merely been detected . "
16743	16755	16757	16758	the duchess	573	" Oh ! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants , "
16761	16798	16757	16758	the duchess	573	" I must confess that most of them are extremely pretty . And they dress well , too . They get all their dresses in Paris . I wish I could afford to do the same . "
16799	16812	16814	16815	Sir Thomas	149	" They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris , "
16830	16844	16846	16847	the duchess	573	" Really ! And where do bad Americans go to when they die ? "
16849	16855	16857	16858	Lord Henry	120	" They go to America , "
16864	16878	16879	16879	he	120	" I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against that great country , "
16885	16921	16879	16879	he	120	" I have travelled all over it in cars provided by the directors , who , in such matters , are extremely civil . I assure you that it is an education to visit it . "
16922	16935	16937	16938	Mr. Erskine	151	" But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated ? "
16941	16951	16937	16938	Mr. Erskine	151	" I don t feel up to the journey . "
16958	17026	16952	16953	Sir Thomas	149	" Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on his shelves . We practical men like to see things , not to read about them . The Americans are an extremely interesting people . They are absolutely reasonable . I think that is their distinguishing characteristic . Yes , Mr. Erskine , an absolutely reasonable people . I assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans . "
17027	17031	17033	17034	Lord Henry	120	" How dreadful ! "
17036	17065	17033	17034	Lord Henry	120	" I can stand brute force , but brute reason is quite unbearable . There is something unfair about its use . It is hitting below the intellect . "
17066	17073	17075	17076	Sir Thomas	149	" I do not understand you , "
17082	17089	17091	17092	Mr. Erskine	151	" I do , Lord Henry , "
17098	17108	17110	17111	the baronet	581	" Paradoxes are all very well in their way .... "
17113	17119	17121	17122	Mr. Erskine	151	" Was that a paradox ? "
17124	17170	17121	17122	Mr. Erskine	151	" I did not think so . Perhaps it was . Well , the way of paradoxes is the way of truth . To test reality we must see it on the tight rope . When the verities become acrobats , we can judge them . "
17171	17175	17177	17178	Lady Agatha	131	" Dear me ! "
17180	17244	17177	17178	Lady Agatha	131	" how you men argue ! I am sure I never can make out what you are talking about . Oh ! Harry , I am quite vexed with you . Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the East End ? I assure you he would be quite invaluable . They would love his playing . "
17245	17254	17256	17257	Lord Henry	120	" I want him to play to me , "
17274	17283	17285	17286	Lady Agatha	131	" But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel , "
17288	17297	17299	17300	Lord Henry	120	" I can sympathize with everything except suffering , "
17306	17363	17299	17300	Lord Henry	120	" I can not sympathize with that . It is too ugly , too horrible , too distressing . There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain . One should sympathize with the colour , the beauty , the joy of life . The less said about life s sores , the better . "
17364	17376	17378	17379	Sir Thomas	149	" Still , the East End is a very important problem , "
17388	17392	17394	17396	the young lord	402	" Quite so , "
17398	17417	17394	17396	the young lord	402	" It is the problem of slavery , and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves . "
17425	17434	17435	17435	he	583	" What change do you propose , then ? "
17442	17456	17457	17457	he	120	" I don t desire to change anything in England except the weather , "
17460	17524	17457	17457	he	120	" I am quite content with philosophic contemplation . But , as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an over - expenditure of sympathy , I would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight . The advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray , and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional . "
17525	17533	17535	17536	Mrs. Vandeleur	152	" But we have such grave responsibilities , "
17539	17543	17545	17546	Lady Agatha	131	" Terribly grave , "
17556	17586	17548	17549	Lord Henry	120	" Humanity takes itself too seriously . It is the world s original sin . If the caveman had known how to laugh , history would have been different . "
17587	17594	17596	17597	the duchess	573	" You are really very comforting , "
17599	17644	17596	17597	the duchess	573	" I have always felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt , for I take no interest at all in the East End . For the future I shall be able to look her in the face without a blush . "
17645	17654	17656	17657	Lord Henry	120	" A blush is very becoming , Duchess , "
17659	17666	17667	17667	she	573	" Only when one is young , "
17670	17703	17667	17667	she	573	" When an old woman like myself blushes , it is a very bad sign . Ah ! Lord Henry , I wish you would tell me how to become young again . "
17710	17727	17728	17728	he	120	" Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days , Duchess ? "
17738	17746	17747	17747	she	573	" A great many , I fear , "
17750	17757	17758	17758	he	120	" Then commit them over again , "
17762	17779	17758	17758	he	120	" To get back one s youth , one has merely to repeat one s follies . "
17780	17785	17786	17786	she	573	" A delightful theory ! "
17789	17797	17786	17786	she	573	" I must put it into practice . "
17798	17803	17806	17807	Sir Thomas	149	" A dangerous theory ! "
17829	17832	17833	17833	he	120	" Yes , "
17836	17878	17833	17833	he	120	" that is one of the great secrets of life . Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense , and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one s mistakes . "
18186	18190	18191	18191	she	573	" How annoying ! "
18194	18322	18191	18191	she	573	" I must go . I have to call for my husband at the club , to take him to some absurd meeting at Willis s Rooms , where he is going to be in the chair . If I am late he is sure to be furious , and I couldn t have a scene in this bonnet . It is far too fragile . A harsh word would ruin it . No , I must go , dear Agatha . Good - bye , Lord Henry , you are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing . I am sure I don t know what to say about your views . You must come and dine with us some night . Tuesday ? Are you disengaged Tuesday ? "
18323	18334	18336	18337	Lord Henry	120	" For you I would throw over anybody , Duchess , "
18342	18356	18357	18357	she	593	" Ah ! that is very nice , and very wrong of you , "
18360	18365	18357	18357	she	593	" so mind you come "
18412	18418	18419	18419	he	151	" You talk books away , "
18422	18430	18419	18419	he	151	" why don t you write one ? "
18431	18508	18380	18382	the other ladies	595	" I am too fond of reading books to care to write them , Mr. Erskine . I should like to write a novel certainly , a novel that would be as lovely as a Persian carpet and as unreal . But there is no literary public in England for anything except newspapers , primers , and encyclopaedias . Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature . "
18509	18516	18518	18519	Mr. Erskine	151	" I fear you are right , "
18521	18572	18518	18519	Mr. Erskine	151	" I myself used to have literary ambitions , but I gave them up long ago . And now , my dear young friend , if you will allow me to call you so , may I ask if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch ? "
18573	18581	18583	18584	Lord Henry	120	" I quite forget what I said , "
18586	18593	18583	18584	Lord Henry	120	" Was it all very bad ? "
18594	18681	18380	18382	the other ladies	595	" Very bad indeed . In fact I consider you extremely dangerous , and if anything happens to our good duchess , we shall all look on you as being primarily responsible . But I should like to talk to you about life . The generation into which I was born was tedious . Some day , when you are tired of London , come down to Treadley and expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy I am fortunate enough to possess . "
18682	18709	18583	18584	Lord Henry	120	" I shall be charmed . A visit to Treadley would be a great privilege . It has a perfect host , and a perfect library . "
18710	18716	18718	18720	the old gentleman	514	" You will complete it , "
18726	18756	18718	18720	the old gentleman	514	" And now I must bid good - bye to your excellent aunt . I am due at the Athenaeum . It is the hour when we sleep there . "
18757	18765	18583	18584	Lord Henry	120	" All of you , Mr. Erskine ? "
18766	18787	18718	18720	the old gentleman	514	" Forty of us , in forty arm - chairs . We are practising for an English Academy of Letters . "
18794	18802	18803	18803	he	120	" I am going to the park , "
18823	18830	18831	18831	he	117	" Let me come with you , "
18834	18849	18851	18852	Lord Henry	120	" But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him , "
18854	18897	18818	18818	him	120	" I would sooner come with you ; yes , I feel I must come with you . Do let me . And you will promise to talk to me all the time ? No one talks so wonderfully as you do . "
18898	18911	18913	18914	Lord Henry	120	" Ah ! I have talked quite enough for to - day , "
18918	18944	18913	18914	Lord Henry	120	" All I want now is to look at life . You may come and look at it with me , if you care to . "
19205	19213	19214	19214	he	427	" How late you are , Harry ! "
19217	19229	19214	19214	he	427	" I am afraid it is not Harry , Mr. Gray , "
19245	19253	19235	19235	He	427	" I beg your pardon . I thought "
19254	19294	19328	19328	she	601	" You thought it was my husband . It is only his wife . You must let me introduce myself . I know you quite well by your photographs . I think my husband has got seventeen of them . "
19295	19302	19235	19235	He	427	" Not seventeen , Lady Henry ? "
19303	19323	19328	19328	she	601	" Well , eighteen , then . And I saw you with him the other night at the opera . "
19423	19435	19413	19413	she	601	" That was at Lohengrin , Lady Henry , I think ? "
19436	19488	19413	19413	she	601	" Yes ; it was at dear Lohengrin . I like Wagner s music better than anybody s. It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other people hearing what one says . That is a great advantage , don t you think so , Mr. Gray ? "
19523	19565	19520	19520	his	117	" I am afraid I don t think so , Lady Henry . I never talk during music at least , during good music . If one hears bad music , it is one s duty to drown it in conversation . "
19566	19834	19413	19413	she	601	" Ah ! that is one of Harry s views , isn t it , Mr. Gray ? I always hear Harry s views from his friends . It is the only way I get to know of them . But you must not think I don t like good music . I adore it , but I am afraid of it . It makes me too romantic . I have simply worshipped pianists two at a time , sometimes , Harry tells me . I don t know what it is about them . Perhaps it is that they are foreigners . They all are , ain t they ? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after a time , don t they ? It is so clever of them , and such a compliment to art . Makes it quite cosmopolitan , doesn t it ? You have never been to any of my parties , have you , Mr. Gray ? You must come . I can t afford orchids , but I spare no expense in foreigners . They make one s rooms look so picturesque . But here is Harry ! Harry , I came in to look for you , to ask you something I forget what it was and I found Mr. Gray here . We have had such a pleasant chat about music . We have quite the same ideas . No ; I think our ideas are quite different . But he has been most pleasant . I am so glad I ve seen him . "
19835	19846	19848	19849	Lord Henry	120	" I am charmed , my love , quite charmed , "
19869	19913	19852	19852	his	120	" So sorry I am late , Dorian . I went to look after a piece of old brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it . Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing . "
19914	19923	19925	19926	Lady Henry	164	" I am afraid I must be going , "
19938	19981	19925	19926	Lady Henry	164	" I have promised to drive with the duchess . Good - bye , Mr. Gray . Good - bye , Harry . You are dining out , I suppose ? So am I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury s. "
19982	19990	19992	19993	Lord Henry	120	" I dare say , my dear , "
20045	20058	20059	20059	he	120	" Never marry a woman with straw - coloured hair , Dorian , "
20066	20071	20018	20018	she	164	" Why , Harry ? "
20072	20079	20018	20018	she	164	" Because they are so sentimental . "
20080	20087	20018	20018	she	164	" But I like sentimental people . "
20088	20114	20018	20018	she	164	" Never marry at all , Dorian . Men marry because they are tired ; women , because they are curious : both are disappointed . "
20115	20157	20018	20018	she	164	" I don t think I am likely to marry , Harry . I am too much in love . That is one of your aphorisms . I am putting it into practice , as I do everything that you say . "
20158	20166	20168	20169	Lord Henry	120	" Who are you in love with ? "
20174	20179	20181	20182	Dorian Gray	117	" With an actress , "
20192	20203	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" That is a rather commonplace _ d but _ . "
20204	20217	20018	20018	she	164	" You would not say so if you saw her , Harry . "
20218	20223	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" Who is she ? "
20224	20231	20018	20018	she	164	" Her name is Sibyl Vane . "
20232	20238	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" Never heard of her . "
20239	20256	20018	20018	she	164	" No one has . People will some day , however . She is a genius . "
20257	20307	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" My dear boy , no woman is a genius . Women are a decorative sex . They never have anything to say , but they say it charmingly . Women represent the triumph of matter over mind , just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals . "
20308	20315	20018	20018	she	164	" Harry , how can you ? "
20316	20513	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" My dear Dorian , it is quite true . I am analysing women at present , so I ought to know . The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was . I find that , ultimately , there are only two kinds of women , the plain and the coloured . The plain women are very useful . If you want to gain a reputation for respectability , you have merely to take them down to supper . The other women are very charming . They commit one mistake , however . They paint in order to try and look young . Our grandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly . _ Rouge _ and _ esprit _ used to go together . That is all over now . As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter , she is perfectly satisfied . As for conversation , there are only five women in London worth talking to , and two of these can t be admitted into decent society . However , tell me about your genius . How long have you known her ? "
20514	20524	20018	20018	she	164	" Ah ! Harry , your views terrify me . "
20525	20537	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" Never mind that . How long have you known her ? "
20538	20543	20018	20018	she	164	" About three weeks . "
20544	20553	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" And where did you come across her ? "
20554	21007	20018	20018	she	164	" I will tell you , Harry , but you mustn t be unsympathetic about it . After all , it never would have happened if I had not met you . You filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life . For days after I met you , something seemed to throb in my veins . As I lounged in the park , or strolled down Piccadilly , I used to look at every one who passed me and wonder , with a mad curiosity , what sort of lives they led . Some of them fascinated me . Others filled me with terror . There was an exquisite poison in the air . I had a passion for sensations .... Well , one evening about seven o clock , I determined to go out in search of some adventure . I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours , with its myriads of people , its sordid sinners , and its splendid sins , as you once phrased it , must have something in store for me . I fancied a thousand things . The mere danger gave me a sense of delight . I remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we first dined together , about the search for beauty being the real secret of life . I don t know what I expected , but I went out and wandered eastward , soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless squares . About half - past eight I passed by an absurd little theatre , with great flaring gas - jets and gaudy play - bills . A hideous Jew , in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life , was standing at the entrance , smoking a vile cigar . He had greasy ringlets , and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt . Have a box , my Lord ? he said , when he saw me , and he took off his hat with an air of gorgeous servility . There was something about him , Harry , that amused me . He was such a monster . You will laugh at me , I know , but I really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage - box . To the present day I can t make out why I did so ; and yet if I hadn t my dear Harry , if I hadn t I should have missed the greatest romance of my life . I see you are laughing . It is horrid of you ! "
21008	21112	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" I am not laughing , Dorian ; at least I am not laughing at you . But you should not say the greatest romance of your life . You should say the first romance of your life . You will always be loved , and you will always be in love with love . A _ grande passion _ is the privilege of people who have nothing to do . That is the one use of the idle classes of a country . Don t be afraid . There are exquisite things in store for you . This is merely the beginning . "
21113	21122	21124	21125	Dorian Gray	117	" Do you think my nature so shallow ? "
21128	21138	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" No ; I think your nature so deep . "
21139	21145	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" How do you mean ? "
21146	21263	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" My dear boy , the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people . What they call their loyalty , and their fidelity , I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination . Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect simply a confession of failure . Faithfulness ! I must analyse it some day . The passion for property is in it . There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up . But I don t want to interrupt you . Go on with your story . "
21264	21379	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" Well , I found myself seated in a horrid little private box , with a vulgar drop - scene staring me in the face . I looked out from behind the curtain and surveyed the house . It was a tawdry affair , all Cupids and cornucopias , like a third - rate wedding - cake . The gallery and pit were fairly full , but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty , and there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the dress - circle . Women went about with oranges and ginger - beer , and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going on . "
21380	21395	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama . "
21396	21438	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" Just like , I should fancy , and very depressing . I began to wonder what on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play - bill . What do you think the play was , Harry ? "
21439	21508	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" I should think The Idiot Boy , or Dumb but Innocent . Our fathers used to like that sort of piece , I believe . The longer I live , Dorian , the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us . In art , as in politics , _ les grandp res ont toujours tort _ . "
21509	22207	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" This play was good enough for us , Harry . It was Romeo and Juliet . I must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare done in such a wretched hole of a place . Still , I felt interested , in a sort of way . At any rate , I determined to wait for the first act . There was a dreadful orchestra , presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a cracked piano , that nearly drove me away , but at last the drop - scene was drawn up and the play began . Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman , with corked eyebrows , a husky tragedy voice , and a figure like a beer - barrel . Mercutio was almost as bad . He was played by the low - comedian , who had introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the pit . They were both as grotesque as the scenery , and that looked as if it had come out of a country - booth . But Juliet ! Harry , imagine a girl , hardly seventeen years of age , with a little , flowerlike face , a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark - brown hair , eyes that were violet wells of passion , lips that were like the petals of a rose . She was the loveliest thing I had ever seen in my life . You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved , but that beauty , mere beauty , could fill your eyes with tears . I tell you , Harry , I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me . And her voice I never heard such a voice . It was very low at first , with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one s ear . Then it became a little louder , and sounded like a flute or a distant hautboy . In the garden - scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing . There were moments , later on , when it had the wild passion of violins . You know how a voice can stir one . Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget . When I close my eyes , I hear them , and each of them says something different . I don t know which to follow . Why should I not love her ? Harry , I do love her . She is everything to me in life . Night after night I go to see her play . One evening she is Rosalind , and the next evening she is Imogen . I have seen her die in the gloom of an Italian tomb , sucking the poison from her lover s lips . I have watched her wandering through the forest of Arden , disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap . She has been mad , and has come into the presence of a guilty king , and given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of . She has been innocent , and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike throat . I have seen her in every age and in every costume . Ordinary women never appeal to one s imagination . They are limited to their century . No glamour ever transfigures them . One knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets . One can always find them . There is no mystery in any of them . They ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea - parties in the afternoon . They have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner . They are quite obvious . But an actress ! How different an actress is ! Harry ! why didn t you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress ? "
22208	22220	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" Because I have loved so many of them , Dorian . "
22221	22235	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" Oh , yes , horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces . "
22236	22257	22259	22260	Lord Henry	120	" Don t run down dyed hair and painted faces . There is an extraordinary charm in them , sometimes , "
22262	22275	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane . "
22276	22299	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" You could not have helped telling me , Dorian . All through your life you will tell me everything you do . "
22300	22348	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" Yes , Harry , I believe that is true . I can not help telling you things . You have a curious influence over me . If I ever did a crime , I would come and confess it to you . You would understand me . "
22349	22401	20186	20187	Lord Henry	120	" People like you the wilful sunbeams of life don t commit crimes , Dorian . But I am much obliged for the compliment , all the same . And now tell me reach me the matches , like a good boy thanks what are your actual relations with Sibyl Vane ? "
22416	22424	22402	22403	Dorian Gray	117	" Harry ! Sibyl Vane is sacred ! "
22425	22439	22441	22442	Lord Henry	120	" It is only the sacred things that are worth touching , Dorian , "
22454	22515	22402	22403	Dorian Gray	117	" But why should you be annoyed ? I suppose she will belong to you some day . When one is in love , one always begins by deceiving one s self , and one always ends by deceiving others . That is what the world calls a romance . You know her , at any rate , I suppose ? "
22516	22619	22402	22403	Dorian Gray	117	" Of course I know her . On the first night I was at the theatre , the horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her . I was furious with him , and told him that Juliet had been dead for hundreds of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona . I think , from his blank look of amazement , that he was under the impression that I had taken too much champagne , or something . "
22620	22626	22402	22403	Dorian Gray	117	" I am not surprised . "
22627	22685	22402	22403	Dorian Gray	117	" Then he asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers . I told him I never even read them . He seemed terribly disappointed at that , and confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him , and that they were every one of them to be bought . "
22686	22720	22402	22403	Dorian Gray	117	" I should not wonder if he was quite right there . But , on the other hand , judging from their appearance , most of them can not be at all expensive . "
22721	22734	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" Well , he seemed to think they were beyond his means , "
22738	22866	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" By this time , however , the lights were being put out in the theatre , and I had to go . He wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly recommended . I declined . The next night , of course , I arrived at the place again . When he saw me , he made me a low bow and assured me that I was a munificent patron of art . He was a most offensive brute , though he had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare . He told me once , with an air of pride , that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to The Bard , as he insisted on calling him . He seemed to think it a distinction . "
22867	22918	22402	22403	Dorian Gray	117	" It was a distinction , my dear Dorian a great distinction . Most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life . To have ruined one s self over poetry is an honour . But when did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane ? "
22919	22990	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" The third night . She had been playing Rosalind . I could not help going round . I had thrown her some flowers , and she had looked at me at least I fancied that she had . The old Jew was persistent . He seemed determined to take me behind , so I consented . It was curious my not wanting to know her , wasn t it ? "
22991	23000	22402	22403	Dorian Gray	117	" No ; I don t think so . "
23001	23008	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" My dear Harry , why ? "
23009	23027	22402	22403	Dorian Gray	117	" I will tell you some other time . Now I want to know about the girl . "
23028	23160	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" Sibyl ? Oh , she was so shy and so gentle . There is something of a child about her . Her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her what I thought of her performance , and she seemed quite unconscious of her power . I think we were both rather nervous . The old Jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom , making elaborate speeches about us both , while we stood looking at each other like children . He would insist on calling me My Lord , so I had to assure Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind . She said quite simply to me , You look more like a prince . I must call you Prince Charming . "
23161	23176	22402	22403	Dorian Gray	117	" Upon my word , Dorian , Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments . "
23177	23240	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" You don t understand her , Harry . She regarded me merely as a person in a play . She knows nothing of life . She lives with her mother , a faded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta dressing - wrapper on the first night , and looks as if she had seen better days . "
23241	23251	23253	23254	Lord Henry	120	" I know that look . It depresses me , "
23260	23279	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" The Jew wanted to tell me her history , but I said it did not interest me . "
23280	23298	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" You were quite right . There is always something infinitely mean about other people s tragedies . "
23299	23355	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" Sibyl is the only thing I care about . What is it to me where she came from ? From her little head to her little feet , she is absolutely and entirely divine . Every night of my life I go to see her act , and every night she is more marvellous . "
23356	23396	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" That is the reason , I suppose , that you never dine with me now . I thought you must have some curious romance on hand . You have ; but it is not quite what I expected . "
23397	23423	23425	23425	Dorian	117	" My dear Harry , we either lunch or sup together every day , and I have been to the opera with you several times , "
23434	23441	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" You always come dreadfully late . "
23442	23455	23456	23456	he	117	" Well , I can t help going to see Sibyl play , "
23459	23501	23456	23456	he	117	" even if it is only for a single act . I get hungry for her presence ; and when I think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body , I am filled with awe . "
23502	23518	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" You can dine with me to - night , Dorian , can t you ? "
23524	23532	23533	23533	he	117	" To - night she is Imogen , "
23536	23547	23533	23533	he	117	" and to - morrow night she will be Juliet . "
23548	23555	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" When is she Sibyl Vane ? "
23556	23559	23533	23533	he	117	" Never . "
23560	23565	22736	22736	Dorian	608	" I congratulate you . "
23566	23689	23533	23533	he	117	" How horrid you are ! She is all the great heroines of the world in one . She is more than an individual . You laugh , but I tell you she has genius . I love her , and I must make her love me . You , who know all the secrets of life , tell me how to charm Sibyl Vane to love me ! I want to make Romeo jealous . I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter and grow sad . I want a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness , to wake their ashes into pain . My God , Harry , how I worship her ! "
23784	23793	23795	23796	Lord Henry	120	" And what do you propose to do ? "
23800	23911	23795	23796	Lord Henry	120	" I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her act . I have not the slightest fear of the result . You are certain to acknowledge her genius . Then we must get her out of the Jew s hands . She is bound to him for three years at least for two years and eight months from the present time . I shall have to pay him something , of course . When all that is settled , I shall take a West End theatre and bring her out properly . She will make the world as mad as she has made me . "
23912	23922	23795	23796	Lord Henry	120	" That would be impossible , my dear boy . "
23923	23968	23795	23796	Lord Henry	120	" Yes , she will . She has not merely art , consummate art - instinct , in her , but she has personality also ; and you have often told me that it is personalities , not principles , that move the age . "
23969	23978	23795	23796	Lord Henry	120	" Well , what night shall we go ? "
23979	24004	23795	23796	Lord Henry	120	" Let me see . To - day is Tuesday . Let us fix to - morrow . She plays Juliet to - morrow . "
24005	24022	23795	23796	Lord Henry	120	" All right . The Bristol at eight o clock ; and I will get Basil . "
24023	24059	23795	23796	Lord Henry	120	" Not eight , Harry , please . Half - past six . We must be there before the curtain rises . You must see her in the first act , where she meets Romeo . "
24060	24113	23795	23796	Lord Henry	120	" Half - past six ! What an hour ! It will be like having a meat - tea , or reading an English novel . It must be seven . No gentleman dines before seven . Shall you see Basil between this and then ? Or shall I write to him ? "
24114	24214	23795	23796	Lord Henry	120	" Dear Basil ! I have not laid eyes on him for a week . It is rather horrid of me , as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful frame , specially designed by himself , and , though I am a little jealous of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am , I must admit that I delight in it . Perhaps you had better write to him . I don t want to see him alone . He says things that annoy me . He gives me good advice . "
24219	24243	24215	24216	Lord Henry	120	" People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves . It is what I call the depth of generosity . "
24244	24281	23795	23796	Lord Henry	120	" Oh , Basil is the best of fellows , but he seems to me to be just a bit of a Philistine . Since I have known you , Harry , I have discovered that . "
24282	24432	24215	24216	Lord Henry	120	" Basil , my dear boy , puts everything that is charming in him into his work . The consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices , his principles , and his common sense . The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists . Good artists exist simply in what they make , and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are . A great poet , a really great poet , is the most unpoetical of all creatures . But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating . The worse their rhymes are , the more picturesque they look . The mere fact of having published a book of second - rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible . He lives the poetry that he can not write . The others write the poetry that they dare not realize . "
24433	24443	24445	24446	Dorian Gray	117	" I wonder is that really so , Harry ? "
24469	24503	24445	24446	Dorian Gray	117	" It must be , if you say it . And now I am off . Imogen is waiting for me . Don t forget about to - morrow . Good - bye . "
25748	25758	25760	25761	the girl	2212	" Mother , Mother , I am so happy ! "
25804	25810	25811	25811	she	2212	" I am so happy ! "
25814	25823	25811	25811	she	2212	" and you must be happy , too ! "
25842	25845	25846	25846	she	181	" Happy ! "
25849	25888	25846	25846	she	181	" I am only happy , Sibyl , when I see you act . You must not think of anything but your acting . Mr. Isaacs has been very good to us , and we owe him money . "
25896	25901	25902	25902	she	2212	" Money , Mother ? "
25905	25917	25902	25902	she	2212	" what does money matter ? Love is more than money . "
25918	25963	26013	26015	the elder woman	652	" Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to get a proper outfit for James . You must not forget that , Sibyl . Fifty pounds is a very large sum . Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate . "
25964	25983	25985	25986	the girl	2212	" He is not a gentleman , Mother , and I hate the way he talks to me , "
25999	26011	26013	26015	the elder woman	652	" I don t know how we could manage without him , "
26026	26045	26047	26047	she	168	" We don t want him any more , Mother . Prince Charming rules life for us now . "
26090	26095	26096	26096	she	168	" I love him , "
26100	26107	26096	26096	she	168	" Foolish child ! foolish child ! "
26356	26361	26362	26362	she	2212	" Mother , Mother , "
26365	26451	26362	26362	she	2212	" why does he love me so much ? I know why I love him . I love him because he is like what love himself should be . But what does he see in me ? I am not worthy of him . And yet why , I can not tell though I feel so much beneath him , I don t feel humble . I feel proud , terribly proud . Mother , did you love my father as I love Prince Charming ? "
26493	26551	26477	26477	Sybil	168	" Forgive me , Mother . I know it pains you to talk about our father . But it only pains you because you loved him so much . Don t look so sad . I am as happy to - day as you were twenty years ago . Ah ! let me be happy for ever ! "
26552	26637	26694	26700	a young lad with rough brown hair	661	" My child , you are far too young to think of falling in love . Besides , what do you know of this young man ? You don t even know his name . The whole thing is most inconvenient , and really , when James is going away to Australia , and I have so much to think of , I must say that you should have shown more consideration . However , as I said before , if he is rich ... "
26638	26650	26477	26477	Sybil	168	" Ah ! Mother , Mother , let me be happy ! "
26785	26801	26803	26804	the lad	427	" You might keep some of your kisses for me , Sibyl , I think , "
26812	26825	26826	26826	she	181	" Ah ! but you don t like being kissed , Jim , "
26829	26837	26839	26839	she	181	" You are a dreadful old bear . "
26859	26896	26848	26849	James Vane	183	" I want you to come out with me for a walk , Sibyl . I don t suppose I shall ever see this horrid London again . I am sure I don t want to . "
26897	26908	26910	26911	Mrs. Vane	181	" My son , don t say such dreadful things , "
26954	26964	26848	26849	James Vane	183	" Why not , Mother ? I mean it . "
26965	27022	26848	26849	James Vane	183	" You pain me , my son . I trust you will return from Australia in a position of affluence . I believe there is no society of any kind in the Colonies nothing that I would call society so when you have made your fortune , you must come back and assert yourself in London . "
27023	27026	27028	27029	the lad	427	" Society ! "
27031	27062	27028	27029	the lad	427	" I don t want to know anything about that . I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage . I hate it . "
27063	27068	27070	27070	Sibyl	168	" Oh , Jim ! "
27074	27162	27070	27070	Sibyl	168	" how unkind of you ! But are you really going for a walk with me ? That will be nice ! I was afraid you were going to say good - bye to some of your friends to Tom Hardy , who gave you that hideous pipe , or Ned Langton , who makes fun of you for smoking it . It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon . Where shall we go ? Let us go to the park . "
27163	27169	27170	27170	he	673	" I am too shabby , "
27175	27184	27170	27170	he	673	" Only swell people go to the park . "
27185	27190	27191	27191	she	674	" Nonsense , Jim , "
27207	27211	27212	27212	he	673	" Very well , "
27217	27226	27212	27212	he	673	" but don t be too long dressing . "
27273	27281	27282	27282	he	673	" Mother , are my things ready ? "
27285	27291	27292	27292	she	674	" Quite ready , James , "
27380	27397	27398	27398	she	674	" I hope you will be contented , James , with your sea - faring life , "
27401	27439	27398	27398	she	674	" You must remember that it is your own choice . You might have entered a solicitor s office . Solicitors are a very respectable class , and in the country often dine with the best families . "
27440	27450	27451	27451	he	682	" I hate offices , and I hate clerks , "
27454	27494	27451	27451	he	682	" But you are quite right . I have chosen my own life . All I say is , watch over Sibyl . Don t let her come to any harm . Mother , you must watch over her . "
27495	27511	27398	27398	she	674	" James , you really talk very strangely . Of course I watch over Sibyl . "
27512	27539	27451	27451	he	682	" I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to talk to her . Is that right ? What about that ? "
27540	27648	27398	27398	she	674	" You are speaking about things you don t understand , James . In the profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying attention . I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time . That was when acting was really understood . As for Sibyl , I do not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not . But there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman . He is always most polite to me . Besides , he has the appearance of being rich , and the flowers he sends are lovely . "
27649	27659	27661	27662	the lad	427	" You don t know his name , though , "
27665	27668	27677	27677	her	2191	" No , "
27680	27708	27677	27677	her	2191	" He has not yet revealed his real name . I think it is quite romantic of him . He is probably a member of the aristocracy . "
27715	27722	27723	27723	he	427	" Watch over Sibyl , Mother , "
27726	27731	27723	27723	he	427	" watch over her . "
27732	27823	27838	27838	his	427	" My son , you distress me very much . Sibyl is always under my special care . Of course , if this gentleman is wealthy , there is no reason why she should not contract an alliance with him . I trust he is one of the aristocracy . He has all the appearance of it , I must say . It might be a most brilliant marriage for Sibyl . They would make a charming couple . His good looks are really quite remarkable ; everybody notices them . "
27859	27866	27867	27867	she	168	" How serious you both are ! "
27870	27876	27867	27867	she	168	" What is the matter ? "
27877	27880	27881	27881	he	427	" Nothing , "
27884	27923	27881	27881	he	427	" I suppose one must be serious sometimes . Good - bye , Mother ; I will have my dinner at five o clock . Everything is packed , except my shirts , so you need not trouble . "
27924	27932	27933	27933	she	168	" Good - bye , my son , "
27969	27975	27977	27978	the girl	2212	" Kiss me , Mother , "
27992	27999	28001	28002	Mrs. Vane	181	" My child ! my child ! "
28016	28021	28023	28024	her brother	688	" Come , Sibyl , "
28880	28894	28896	28896	Sibyl	168	" You are not listening to a word I am saying , Jim , "
28898	28915	28896	28896	Sibyl	168	" and I am making the most delightful plans for your future . Do say something . "
28916	28925	28875	28875	he	427	" What do you want me to say ? "
28926	28941	28942	28942	she	168	" Oh ! that you will be a good boy and not forget us , "
28954	28971	28951	28951	his	427	" You are more likely to forget me than I am to forget you , Sibyl . "
28975	28983	28984	28984	she	168	" What do you mean , Jim ? "
28987	29016	28951	28951	his	427	" You have a new friend , I hear . Who is he ? Why have you not told me about him ? He means you no good . "
29017	29022	29023	29023	she	168	" Stop , Jim ! "
29026	29039	29023	29023	she	168	" You must not say anything against him . I love him . "
29040	29051	29053	29054	the lad	427	" Why , you don t even know his name , "
29056	29068	29053	29054	the lad	427	" Who is he ? I have a right to know . "
29069	29349	29023	29023	she	168	" He is called Prince Charming . Don t you like the name . Oh ! you silly boy ! you should never forget it . If you only saw him , you would think him the most wonderful person in the world . Some day you will meet him when you come back from Australia . You will like him so much . Everybody likes him , and I ... love him . I wish you could come to the theatre to - night . He is going to be there , and I am to play Juliet . Oh ! how I shall play it ! Fancy , Jim , to be in love and play Juliet ! To have him sitting there ! To play for his delight ! I am afraid I may frighten the company , frighten or enthrall them . To be in love is to surpass one s self . Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting genius to his loafers at the bar . He has preached me as a dogma ; to - night he will announce me as a revelation . I feel it . And it is all his , his only , Prince Charming , my wonderful lover , my god of graces . But I am poor beside him . Poor ? What does that matter ? When poverty creeps in at the door , love flies in through the window . Our proverbs want rewriting . They were made in winter , and it is summer now ; spring - time for me , I think , a very dance of blossoms in blue skies . "
29350	29356	29358	29359	the lad	427	" He is a gentleman , "
29362	29366	29367	29367	she	734	" A prince ! "
29371	29378	29367	29367	she	734	" What more do you want ? "
29379	29386	29023	29023	she	168	" He wants to enslave you . "
29387	29397	29367	29367	she	734	" I shudder at the thought of being free . "
29398	29407	29023	29023	she	168	" I want you to beware of him . "
29408	29425	29367	29367	she	734	" To see him is to worship him ; to know him is to trust him . "
29426	29435	29023	29023	she	168	" Sibyl , you are mad about him . "
29443	29558	29436	29436	She	734	" You dear old Jim , you talk as if you were a hundred . Some day you will be in love yourself . Then you will know what it is . Don t look so sulky . Surely you should be glad to think that , though you are going away , you leave me happier than I have ever been before . Life has been hard for us both , terribly hard and difficult . But it will be different now . You are going to a new world , and I have found one . Here are two chairs ; let us sit down and see the smart people go by . "
29710	29715	29716	29716	she	168	" There he is ! "
29719	29722	29724	29725	Jim Vane	183	" Who ? "
29727	29731	29732	29732	she	168	" Prince Charming , "
29751	29770	29771	29771	he	183	" Show him to me . Which is he ? Point him out . I must see him ! "
29809	29814	29816	29816	Sibyl	168	" He is gone , "
29819	29827	29816	29816	Sibyl	168	" I wish you had seen him . "
29828	29858	29868	29868	his	183	" I wish I had , for as sure as there is a God in heaven , if he ever does you any wrong , I shall kill him . "
29894	29903	29904	29904	she	749	" Come away , Jim ; come away , "
29958	30025	29951	29951	She	168	" You are foolish , Jim , utterly foolish ; a bad - tempered boy , that is all . How can you say such horrible things ? You don t know what you are talking about . You are simply jealous and unkind . Ah ! I wish you would fall in love . Love makes people good , and what you said was wicked . "
30026	30031	30032	30032	he	183	" I am sixteen , "
30035	30097	30032	30032	he	183	" and I know what I am about . Mother is no help to you . She doesn t understand how to look after you . I wish now that I was not going to Australia at all . I have a great mind to chuck the whole thing up . I would , if my articles hadn t been signed . "
30098	30173	30225	30225	him	753	" Oh , don t be so serious , Jim . You are like one of the heroes of those silly melodramas Mother used to be so fond of acting in . I am not going to quarrel with you . I have seen him , and oh ! to see him is perfect happiness . We won t quarrel . I know you would never harm any one I love , would you ? "
30174	30186	30225	30225	him	753	" Not as long as you love him , I suppose , "
30192	30200	30201	30201	she	752	" I shall love him for ever ! "
30204	30208	30225	30225	him	753	" And he ? "
30209	30215	30235	30235	his	753	" For ever , too ! "
30216	30221	30225	30225	him	753	" He had better . "
30588	30598	30599	30599	he	183	" Mother , I have something to ask you , "
30615	30635	30610	30610	She	2191	" Tell me the truth . I have a right to know . Were you married to my father ? "
30727	30730	30731	30731	she	2191	" No , "
30742	30750	30752	30753	the lad	427	" My father was a scoundrel then ! "
30764	30817	30761	30761	her	2191	" I knew he was not free . We loved each other very much . If he had lived , he would have made provision for us . Don t speak against him , my son . He was your father , and a gentleman . Indeed , he was highly connected . "
30825	30833	30834	30834	he	427	" I don t care for myself , "
30837	30873	30834	30834	he	427	" but don t let Sibyl .... It is a gentleman , isn t it , who is in love with her , or says he is ? Highly connected , too , I suppose . "
30899	30905	30906	30906	she	770	" Sibyl has a mother , "
30909	30914	30906	30906	she	770	" I had none . "
30933	30948	30949	30949	he	427	" I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father , "
30952	31018	30949	30949	he	427	" but I could not help it . I must go now . Good - bye . Don t forget that you will have only one child now to look after , and believe me that if this man wrongs my sister , I will find out who he is , track him down , and kill him like a dog . I swear it . "
31231	31242	31244	31245	Lord Henry	120	" I suppose you have heard the news , Basil ? "
31268	31273	31275	31276	the artist	357	" No , Harry , "
31288	31333	31275	31276	the artist	357	" What is it ? Nothing about politics , I hope ! They don t interest me . There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons worth painting , though many of them would be the better for a little whitewashing . "
31334	31343	31345	31346	Lord Henry	120	" Dorian Gray is engaged to be married , "
31360	31367	31368	31368	he	121	" Dorian engaged to be married ! "
31371	31374	31368	31368	he	121	" Impossible ! "
31375	31381	31275	31276	the artist	357	" It is perfectly true . "
31382	31386	31368	31368	he	121	" To whom ? "
31387	31395	31275	31276	the artist	357	" To some little actress or other . "
31396	31409	31368	31368	he	121	" I can t believe it . Dorian is far too sensible . "
31410	31429	31275	31276	the artist	357	" Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and then , my dear Basil . "
31430	31446	31368	31368	he	121	" Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then , Harry . "
31447	31452	31454	31455	Lord Henry	120	" Except in America , "
31458	31514	31454	31455	Lord Henry	120	" But I didn t say he was married . I said he was engaged to be married . There is a great difference . I have a distinct remembrance of being married , but I have no recollection at all of being engaged . I am inclined to think that I never was engaged . "
31515	31542	31368	31368	he	121	" But think of Dorian s birth , and position , and wealth . It would be absurd for him to marry so much beneath him . "
31543	31586	31454	31455	Lord Henry	120	" If you want to make him marry this girl , tell him that , Basil . He is sure to do it , then . Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing , it is always from the noblest motives . "
31587	31620	31368	31368	he	121	" I hope the girl is good , Harry . I don t want to see Dorian tied to some vile creature , who might degrade his nature and ruin his intellect . "
31621	31633	31635	31636	Lord Henry	120	" Oh , she is better than good she is beautiful , "
31648	31711	31635	31636	Lord Henry	120	" Dorian says she is beautiful , and he is not often wrong about things of that kind . Your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal appearance of other people . It has had that excellent effect , amongst others . We are to see her to - night , if that boy doesn t forget his appointment . "
31712	31717	31368	31368	he	121	" Are you serious ? "
31718	31745	31635	31636	Lord Henry	120	" Quite serious , Basil . I should be miserable if I thought I should ever be more serious than I am at the present moment . "
31746	31756	31758	31759	the painter	389	" But do you approve of it , Harry ? "
31772	31788	31769	31769	his	389	" You can t approve of it , possibly . It is some silly infatuation . "
31789	32048	32095	32096	Lord Henry	120	" I never approve , or disapprove , of anything now . It is an absurd attitude to take towards life . We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices . I never take any notice of what common people say , and I never interfere with what charming people do . If a personality fascinates me , whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me . Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts Juliet , and proposes to marry her . Why not ? If he wedded Messalina , he would be none the less interesting . You know I am not a champion of marriage . The real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish . And unselfish people are colourless . They lack individuality . Still , there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex . They retain their egotism , and add to it many other egos . They are forced to have more than one life . They become more highly organized , and to be highly organized is , I should fancy , the object of man s existence . Besides , every experience is of value , and whatever one may say against marriage , it is certainly an experience . I hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife , passionately adore her for six months , and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else . He would be a wonderful study . "
32049	32094	31769	31769	his	389	" You don t mean a single word of all that , Harry ; you know you don t. If Dorian Gray s life were spoiled , no one would be sorrier than yourself . You are much better than you pretend to be . "
32099	32284	32095	32096	Lord Henry	120	" The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves . The basis of optimism is sheer terror . We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us . We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account , and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets . I mean everything that I have said . I have the greatest contempt for optimism . As for a spoiled life , no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested . If you want to mar a nature , you have merely to reform it . As for marriage , of course that would be silly , but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women . I will certainly encourage them . They have the charm of being fashionable . But here is Dorian himself . He will tell you more than I can . "
32285	32300	32302	32303	the lad	427	" My dear Harry , my dear Basil , you must both congratulate me ! "
32328	32368	32369	32369	He	427	" I have never been so happy . Of course , it is sudden all really delightful things are . And yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my life . "
32382	32394	32396	32396	Hallward	121	" I hope you will always be very happy , Dorian , "
32398	32421	32396	32396	Hallward	121	" but I don t quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement . You let Harry know . "
32422	32435	32438	32439	Lord Henry	120	" And I don t forgive you for being late for dinner , "
32455	32486	32452	32452	he	120	" Come , let us sit down and try what the new _ chef _ here is like , and then you will tell us how it all came about . "
32487	32496	32498	32498	Dorian	786	" There is really not much to tell , "
32510	32986	32498	32498	Dorian	786	" What happened was simply this . After I left you yesterday evening , Harry , I dressed , had some dinner at that little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to , and went down at eight o clock to the theatre . Sibyl was playing Rosalind . Of course , the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd . But Sibyl ! You should have seen her ! When she came on in her boy s clothes , she was perfectly wonderful . She wore a moss - coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves , slim , brown , cross - gartered hose , a dainty little green cap with a hawk s feather caught in a jewel , and a hooded cloak lined with dull red . She had never seemed to me more exquisite . She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio , Basil . Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose . As for her acting well , you shall see her to - night . She is simply a born artist . I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled . I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century . I was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen . After the performance was over , I went behind and spoke to her . As we were sitting together , suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had never seen there before . My lips moved towards hers . We kissed each other . I can t describe to you what I felt at that moment . It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose - coloured joy . She trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus . Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands . I feel that I should not tell you all this , but I can t help it . Of course , our engagement is a dead secret . She has not even told her own mother . I don t know what my guardians will say . Lord Radley is sure to be furious . I don t care . I shall be of age in less than a year , and then I can do what I like . I have been right , Basil , haven t I , to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare s plays ? Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear . I have had the arms of Rosalind around me , and kissed Juliet on the mouth . "
32987	32998	33000	33000	Hallward	121	" Yes , Dorian , I suppose you were right , "
33003	33012	33014	33015	Lord Henry	120	" Have you seen her to - day ? "
33023	33043	33020	33020	his	117	" I left her in the forest of Arden ; I shall find her in an orchard in Verona . "
33054	33083	33044	33045	Lord Henry	120	" At what particular point did you mention the word marriage , Dorian ? And what did she say in answer ? Perhaps you forgot all about it . "
33084	33144	33020	33020	his	117	" My dear Harry , I did not treat it as a business transaction , and I did not make any formal proposal . I told her that I loved her , and she said she was not worthy to be my wife . Not worthy ! Why , the whole world is nothing to me compared with her . "
33145	33151	33153	33154	Lord Henry	120	" Women are wonderfully practical , "
33156	33184	33153	33154	Lord Henry	120	" much more practical than we are . In situations of that kind we often forget to say anything about marriage , and they always remind us . "
33193	33228	33185	33185	Hallward	121	" Don t , Harry . You have annoyed Dorian . He is not like other men . He would never bring misery upon any one . His nature is too fine for that . "
33236	33244	33245	33245	he	120	" Dorian is never annoyed with me , "
33248	33320	33245	33245	he	120	" I asked the question for the best reason possible , for the only reason , indeed , that excuses one for asking any question simple curiosity . I have a theory that it is always the women who propose to us , and not we who propose to the women . Except , of course , in middle - class life . But then the middle classes are not modern . "
33330	33523	33321	33322	Dorian Gray	117	" You are quite incorrigible , Harry ; but I don t mind . It is impossible to be angry with you . When you see Sibyl Vane , you will feel that the man who could wrong her would be a beast , a beast without a heart . I can not understand how any one can wish to shame the thing he loves . I love Sibyl Vane . I want to place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman who is mine . What is marriage ? An irrevocable vow . You mock at it for that . Ah ! don t mock . It is an irrevocable vow that I want to take . Her trust makes me faithful , her belief makes me good . When I am with her , I regret all that you have taught me . I become different from what you have known me to be . I am changed , and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane s hand makes me forget you and all your wrong , fascinating , poisonous , delightful theories . "
33524	33530	33532	33533	Lord Henry	120	" And those are ... ? "
33541	33568	33321	33322	Dorian Gray	117	" Oh , your theories about life , your theories about love , your theories about pleasure . All your theories , in fact , Harry . "
33569	33581	33582	33582	he	120	" Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about , "
33590	33647	33582	33582	he	120	" But I am afraid I can not claim my theory as my own . It belongs to Nature , not to me . Pleasure is Nature s test , her sign of approval . When we are happy , we are always good , but when we are good , we are not always happy . "
33648	33659	33661	33662	Basil Hallward	121	" Ah ! but what do you mean by good ? "
33664	33667	33669	33669	Dorian	117	" Yes , "
33699	33709	33582	33582	he	120	" what do you mean by good , Harry ? "
33710	33724	33725	33725	he	120	" To be good is to be in harmony with one s self , "
33744	33849	33725	33725	he	120	" Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others . One s own life that is the important thing . As for the lives of one s neighbours , if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan , one can flaunt one s moral views about them , but they are not one s concern . Besides , individualism has really the higher aim . Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one s age . I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality . "
33850	33875	33877	33878	the painter	389	" But , surely , if one lives merely for one s self , Harry , one pays a terrible price for doing so ? "
33880	33925	33725	33725	he	120	" Yes , we are overcharged for everything nowadays . I should fancy that the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but self - denial . Beautiful sins , like beautiful things , are the privilege of the rich . "
33926	33937	33725	33725	he	120	" One has to pay in other ways but money . "
33938	33946	33725	33725	he	120	" What sort of ways , Basil ? "
33947	33969	33725	33725	he	120	" Oh ! I should fancy in remorse , in suffering , in ... well , in the consciousness of degradation . "
33976	34051	33973	33973	his	120	" My dear fellow , medi val art is charming , but medi val emotions are out of date . One can use them in fiction , of course . But then the only things that one can use in fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact . Believe me , no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure , and no uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is . "
34052	34059	34061	34062	Dorian Gray	117	" I know what pleasure is , "
34064	34072	34061	34062	Dorian Gray	117	" It is to adore some one . "
34073	34082	34083	34083	he	117	" That is certainly better than being adored , "
34091	34123	34083	34083	he	117	" Being adored is a nuisance . Women treat us just as humanity treats its gods . They worship us , and are always bothering us to do something for them . "
34124	34141	34143	34144	the lad	427	" I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to us , "
34147	34164	34143	34144	the lad	427	" They create love in our natures . They have a right to demand it back . "
34165	34173	34175	34175	Hallward	121	" That is quite true , Dorian , "
34177	34184	34186	34187	Lord Henry	120	" Nothing is ever quite true , "
34189	34193	34195	34195	Dorian	117	" This is , "
34197	34216	34195	34195	Dorian	117	" You must admit , Harry , that women give to men the very gold of their lives . "
34217	34220	34221	34221	he	120	" Possibly , "
34224	34269	34221	34221	he	120	" but they invariably want it back in such very small change . That is the worry . Women , as some witty Frenchman once put it , inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out . "
34270	34288	34195	34195	Dorian	117	" Harry , you are dreadful ! I don t know why I like you so much . "
34289	34298	34299	34299	he	120	" You will always like me , Dorian , "
34302	34411	34299	34299	he	120	" Will you have some coffee , you fellows ? Waiter , bring coffee , and _ fine - champagne _ , and some cigarettes . No , don t mind the cigarettes I have some . Basil , I can t allow you to smoke cigars . You must have a cigarette . A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure . It is exquisite , and it leaves one unsatisfied . What more can one want ? Yes , Dorian , you will always be fond of me . I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit . "
34412	34420	34422	34423	the lad	427	" What nonsense you talk , Harry ! "
34444	34480	34422	34423	the lad	427	" Let us go down to the theatre . When Sibyl comes on the stage you will have a new ideal of life . She will represent something to you that you have never known . "
34481	34487	34489	34490	Lord Henry	120	" I have known everything , "
34500	34591	34489	34490	Lord Henry	120	" but I am always ready for a new emotion . I am afraid , however , that , for me at any rate , there is no such thing . Still , your wonderful girl may thrill me . I love acting . It is so much more real than life . Let us go . Dorian , you will come with me . I am so sorry , Basil , but there is only room for two in the brougham . You must follow us in a hansom . "
34993	35004	35006	35007	Lord Henry	120	" What a place to find one s divinity in ! "
35009	35012	35014	35015	Dorian Gray	117	" Yes ! "
35017	35114	35014	35015	Dorian Gray	117	" It was here I found her , and she is divine beyond all living things . When she acts , you will forget everything . These common rough people , with their coarse faces and brutal gestures , become quite different when she is on the stage . They sit silently and watch her . They weep and laugh as she wills them to do . She makes them as responsive as a violin . She spiritualizes them , and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one s self . "
35115	35132	35134	35135	Lord Henry	120	" The same flesh and blood as one s self ! Oh , I hope not ! "
35151	35162	35164	35165	the painter	389	" Don t pay any attention to him , Dorian , "
35167	35320	35164	35165	the painter	389	" I understand what you mean , and I believe in this girl . Any one you love must be marvellous , and any girl who has the effect you describe must be fine and noble . To spiritualize one s age that is something worth doing . If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one , if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly , if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own , she is worthy of all your adoration , worthy of the adoration of the world . This marriage is quite right . I did not think so at first , but I admit it now . The gods made Sibyl Vane for you . Without her you would have been incomplete . "
35321	35326	35328	35329	Dorian Gray	117	" Thanks , Basil , "
35335	35407	35328	35329	Dorian Gray	117	" I knew that you would understand me . Harry is so cynical , he terrifies me . But here is the orchestra . It is quite dreadful , but it only lasts for about five minutes . Then the curtain rises , and you will see the girl to whom I am going to give all my life , to whom I have given everything that is good in me . "
35548	35553	35539	35540	Lord Henry	120	" Charming ! charming ! "
36014	36018	36010	36010	one	381	" It lightens . "
36177	36185	36186	36186	he	120	" She is quite beautiful , Dorian , "
36189	36200	36186	36186	he	120	" but she can t act . Let us go . "
36201	36211	36213	36214	the lad	427	" I am going to see the play through , "
36222	36244	36213	36214	the lad	427	" I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an evening , Harry . I apologize to you both . "
36245	36258	36260	36260	Hallward	121	" My dear Dorian , I should think Miss Vane was ill , "
36262	36270	36260	36260	Hallward	121	" We will come some other night . "
36271	36278	36279	36279	he	121	" I wish she were ill , "
36282	36318	36279	36279	he	121	" But she seems to me to be simply callous and cold . She has entirely altered . Last night she was a great artist . This evening she is merely a commonplace mediocre actress . "
36319	36342	36260	36260	Hallward	121	" Don t talk like that about any one you love , Dorian . Love is a more wonderful thing than art . "
36343	36352	36354	36355	Lord Henry	120	" They are both simply forms of imitation , "
36357	36525	36354	36355	Lord Henry	120	" But do let us go . Dorian , you must not stay here any longer . It is not good for one s morals to see bad acting . Besides , I don t suppose you will want your wife to act , so what does it matter if she plays Juliet like a wooden doll ? She is very lovely , and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting , she will be a delightful experience . There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating people who know absolutely everything , and people who know absolutely nothing . Good heavens , my dear boy , don t look so tragic ! The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming . Come to the club with Basil and myself . We will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane . She is beautiful . What more can you want ? "
36526	36532	36534	36535	the lad	427	" Go away , Harry , "
36537	36562	36534	36535	the lad	427	" I want to be alone . Basil , you must go . Ah ! can t you see that my heart is breaking ? "
36598	36605	36607	36608	Lord Henry	120	" Let us go , Basil , "
36794	36805	36806	36806	she	2212	" How badly I acted to - night , Dorian ! "
36809	36812	36813	36813	he	117	" Horribly ! "
36822	36849	36813	36813	he	117	" Horribly ! It was dreadful . Are you ill ? You have no idea what it was . You have no idea what I suffered . "
36854	36857	36858	36858	she	2212	" Dorian , "
36889	36906	36871	36871	her	2212	" Dorian , you should have understood . But you understand now , don t you ? "
36907	36911	36912	36912	he	117	" Understand what ? "
36917	36942	36871	36871	her	2212	" Why I was so bad to - night . Why I shall always be bad . Why I shall never act well again . "
36948	36979	36945	36945	his	117	" You are ill , I suppose . When you are ill you shouldn t act . You make yourself ridiculous . My friends were bored . I was bored . "
37001	37006	37007	37007	she	2212	" Dorian , Dorian , "
37010	37463	37007	37007	she	2212	" before I knew you , acting was the one reality of my life . It was only in the theatre that I lived . I thought that it was all true . I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other . The joy of Beatrice was my joy , and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine also . I believed in everything . The common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike . The painted scenes were my world . I knew nothing but shadows , and I thought them real . You came oh , my beautiful love ! and you freed my soul from prison . You taught me what reality really is . To - night , for the first time in my life , I saw through the hollowness , the sham , the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had always played . To - night , for the first time , I became conscious that the Romeo was hideous , and old , and painted , that the moonlight in the orchard was false , that the scenery was vulgar , and that the words I had to speak were unreal , were not my words , were not what I wanted to say . You had brought me something higher , something of which all art is but a reflection . You had made me understand what love really is . My love ! My love ! Prince Charming ! Prince of life ! I have grown sick of shadows . You are more to me than all art can ever be . What have I to do with the puppets of a play ? When I came on to - night , I could not understand how it was that everything had gone from me . I thought that I was going to be wonderful . I found that I could do nothing . Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant . The knowledge was exquisite to me . I heard them hissing , and I smiled . What could they know of love such as ours ? Take me away , Dorian take me away with you , where we can be quite alone . I hate the stage . I might mimic a passion that I do not feel , but I can not mimic one that burns me like fire . Oh , Dorian , Dorian , you understand now what it signifies ? Even if I could do it , it would be profanation for me to play at being in love . You have made me see that . "
37477	37484	37485	37485	he	851	" You have killed my love , "
37550	37553	37554	37554	he	851	" Yes , "
37557	37790	37554	37554	he	851	" you have killed my love . You used to stir my imagination . Now you don t even stir my curiosity . You simply produce no effect . I loved you because you were marvellous , because you had genius and intellect , because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art . You have thrown it all away . You are shallow and stupid . My God ! how mad I was to love you ! What a fool I have been ! You are nothing to me now . I will never see you again . I will never think of you . I will never mention your name . You don t know what you were to me , once . Why , once ... Oh , I can t bear to think of it ! I wish I had never laid eyes upon you ! You have spoiled the romance of my life . How little you can know of love , if you say it mars your art ! Without your art , you are nothing . I would have made you famous , splendid , magnificent . The world would have worshipped you , and you would have borne my name . What are you now ? A third - rate actress with a pretty face . "
37815	37823	37824	37824	she	2212	" You are not serious , Dorian ? "
37827	37832	37824	37824	she	2212	" You are acting . "
37833	37848	37849	37849	he	854	" Acting ! I leave that to you . You do it so well , "
37895	37901	37902	37902	he	854	" Don t touch me ! "
37927	37937	37938	37938	she	2212	" Dorian , Dorian , don t leave me ! "
37941	38154	37938	37938	she	2212	" I am so sorry I didn t act well . I was thinking of you all the time . But I will try indeed , I will try . It came so suddenly across me , my love for you . I think I should never have known it if you had not kissed me if we had not kissed each other . Kiss me again , my love . Don t go away from me . I couldn t bear it . Oh ! don t go away from me . My brother ... No ; never mind . He didn t mean it . He was in jest .... But you , oh ! can t you forgive me for to - night ? I will work so hard and try to improve . Don t be cruel to me , because I love you better than anything in the world . After all , it is only once that I have not pleased you . But you are quite right , Dorian . I should have shown myself more of an artist . It was foolish of me , and yet I couldn t help it . Oh , don t leave me , don t leave me . "
38230	38235	38236	38236	he	117	" I am going , "
38246	38268	38236	38236	he	117	" I don t wish to be unkind , but I can t see you again . You have disappointed me . "
39971	39975	39976	39976	he	117	" How horrible ! "
40164	40172	40173	40173	he	195	" Monsieur has well slept this morning , "
40178	40187	40189	40190	Dorian Gray	117	" What o clock is it , Victor ? "
40193	40202	40173	40173	he	195	" One hour and a quarter , Monsieur . "
40572	40578	40580	40581	his valet	509	" Too cold for Monsieur ? "
40590	40596	40580	40581	his valet	509	" I shut the window ? "
40602	40608	40609	40609	he	117	" I am not cold , "
40804	40816	40817	40817	he	117	" I am not at home to any one , Victor , "
41545	41572	41539	41540	Lord Henry	120	" My dear boy , I must see you . Let me in at once . I can t bear your shutting yourself up like this . "
41653	41664	41666	41667	Lord Henry	120	" I am so sorry for it all , Dorian , "
41672	41683	41666	41667	Lord Henry	120	" But you must not think too much about it . "
41684	41692	41694	41695	the lad	427	" Do you mean about Sibyl Vane ? "
41697	41703	41705	41706	Lord Henry	120	" Yes , of course , "
41720	41755	41705	41706	Lord Henry	120	" It is dreadful , from one point of view , but it was not your fault . Tell me , did you go behind and see her , after the play was over ? "
41756	41759	41666	41667	Lord Henry	120	" Yes . "
41760	41775	41705	41706	Lord Henry	120	" I felt sure you had . Did you make a scene with her ? "
41776	41811	41666	41667	Lord Henry	120	" I was brutal , Harry perfectly brutal . But it is all right now . I am not sorry for anything that has happened . It has taught me to know myself better . "
41812	41847	41705	41706	Lord Henry	120	" Ah , Dorian , I am so glad you take it in that way ! I was afraid I would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours . "
41848	41856	41858	41858	Dorian	117	" I have got through all that , "
41866	41935	41858	41858	Dorian	117	" I am perfectly happy now . I know what conscience is , to begin with . It is not what you told me it was . It is the divinest thing in us . Don t sneer at it , Harry , any more at least not before me . I want to be good . I can t bear the idea of my soul being hideous . "
41936	41961	41705	41706	Lord Henry	120	" A very charming artistic basis for ethics , Dorian ! I congratulate you on it . But how are you going to begin ? "
41962	41968	41858	41858	Dorian	117	" By marrying Sibyl Vane . "
41969	41974	41976	41977	Lord Henry	120	" Marrying Sibyl Vane ! "
41989	41995	41976	41977	Lord Henry	120	" But , my dear Dorian "
41996	42060	41858	41858	Dorian	117	" Yes , Harry , I know what you are going to say . Something dreadful about marriage . Don t say it . Don t ever say things of that kind to me again . Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me . I am not going to break my word to her . She is to be my wife . "
42061	42092	41976	41977	Lord Henry	120	" Your wife ! Dorian ! ... Didn t you get my letter ? I wrote to you this morning , and sent the note down by my own man . "
42093	42137	41858	41858	Dorian	117	" Your letter ? Oh , yes , I remember . I have not read it yet , Harry . I was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn t like . You cut life to pieces with your epigrams . "
42138	42144	41976	41977	Lord Henry	120	" You know nothing then ? "
42145	42151	41858	41858	Dorian	117	" What do you mean ? "
42178	42181	42182	42182	he	120	" Dorian , "
42185	42202	42182	42182	he	120	" my letter don t be frightened was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is dead . "
42231	42254	42215	42215	he	427	" Dead ! Sibyl dead ! It is not true ! It is a horrible lie ! How dare you say it ? "
42255	42263	42265	42266	Lord Henry	120	" It is quite true , Dorian , "
42270	42404	42265	42266	Lord Henry	120	" It is in all the morning papers . I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till I came . There will have to be an inquest , of course , and you must not be mixed up in it . Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris . But in London people are so prejudiced . Here , one should never make one s _ d but _ with a scandal . One should reserve that to give an interest to one s old age . I suppose they don t know your name at the theatre ? If they don t , it is all right . Did any one see you going round to her room ? That is an important point . "
42429	42468	42421	42421	he	117	" Harry , did you say an inquest ? What did you mean by that ? Did Sibyl ? Oh , Harry , I can t bear it ! But be quick . Tell me everything at once . "
42469	42604	42265	42266	Lord Henry	120	" I have no doubt it was not an accident , Dorian , though it must be put in that way to the public . It seems that as she was leaving the theatre with her mother , about half - past twelve or so , she said she had forgotten something upstairs . They waited some time for her , but she did not come down again . They ultimately found her lying dead on the floor of her dressing - room . She had swallowed something by mistake , some dreadful thing they use at theatres . I don t know what it was , but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it . I should fancy it was prussic acid , as she seems to have died instantaneously . "
42605	42614	42616	42617	the lad	427	" Harry , Harry , it is terrible ! "
42619	42740	42265	42266	Lord Henry	120	" Yes ; it is very tragic , of course , but you must not get yourself mixed up in it . I see by _ The Standard _ that she was seventeen . I should have thought she was almost younger than that . She looked such a child , and seemed to know so little about acting . Dorian , you mustn t let this thing get on your nerves . You must come and dine with me , and afterwards we will look in at the opera . It is a Patti night , and everybody will be there . You can come to my sister s box . She has got some smart women with her . "
42741	42749	42751	42752	Dorian Gray	117	" So I have murdered Sibyl Vane , "
42758	43105	42751	42752	Dorian Gray	117	" murdered her as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife . Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that . The birds sing just as happily in my garden . And to - night I am to dine with you , and then go on to the opera , and sup somewhere , I suppose , afterwards . How extraordinarily dramatic life is ! If I had read all this in a book , Harry , I think I would have wept over it . Somehow , now that it has happened actually , and to me , it seems far too wonderful for tears . Here is the first passionate love - letter I have ever written in my life . Strange , that my first passionate love - letter should have been addressed to a dead girl . Can they feel , I wonder , those white silent people we call the dead ? Sibyl ! Can she feel , or know , or listen ? Oh , Harry , how I loved her once ! It seems years ago to me now . She was everything to me . Then came that dreadful night was it really only last night ? when she played so badly , and my heart almost broke . She explained it all to me . It was terribly pathetic . But I was not moved a bit . I thought her shallow . Suddenly something happened that made me afraid . I can t tell you what it was , but it was terrible . I said I would go back to her . I felt I had done wrong . And now she is dead . My God ! My God ! Harry , what shall I do ? You don t know the danger I am in , and there is nothing to keep me straight . She would have done that for me . She had no right to kill herself . It was selfish of her . "
43106	43111	43113	43114	Lord Henry	120	" My dear Dorian , "
43130	43281	43113	43114	Lord Henry	120	" the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life . If you had married this girl , you would have been wretched . Of course , you would have treated her kindly . One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing . But she would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her . And when a woman finds that out about her husband , she either becomes dreadfully dowdy , or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman s husband has to pay for . I say nothing about the social mistake , which would have been abject which , of course , I would not have allowed but I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure . "
43282	43288	43290	43291	the lad	427	" I suppose it would , "
43304	43355	43290	43291	the lad	427	" But I thought it was my duty . It is not my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right . I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good resolutions that they are always made too late . Mine certainly were . "
43356	43431	43113	43114	Lord Henry	120	" Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws . Their origin is pure vanity . Their result is absolutely _ nil _ . They give us , now and then , some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak . That is all that can be said for them . They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account . "
43432	43435	43437	43438	Dorian Gray	117	" Harry , "
43448	43477	43437	43438	Dorian Gray	117	" why is it that I can not feel this tragedy as much as I want to ? I don t think I am heartless . Do you ? "
43478	43501	43503	43504	Lord Henry	120	" You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be entitled to give yourself that name , Dorian , "
43515	43525	43526	43526	he	120	" I don t like that explanation , Harry , "
43529	43620	43526	43526	he	120	" but I am glad you don t think I am heartless . I am nothing of the kind . I know I am not . And yet I must admit that this thing that has happened does not affect me as it should . It seems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play . It has all the terrible beauty of a Greek tragedy , a tragedy in which I took a great part , but by which I have not been wounded . "
43621	43628	43630	43631	Lord Henry	120	" It is an interesting question , "
43647	43957	43630	43631	Lord Henry	120	" an extremely interesting question . I fancy that the true explanation is this : It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence , their absolute incoherence , their absurd want of meaning , their entire lack of style . They affect us just as vulgarity affects us . They give us an impression of sheer brute force , and we revolt against that . Sometimes , however , a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives . If these elements of beauty are real , the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect . Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors , but the spectators of the play . Or rather we are both . We watch ourselves , and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us . In the present case , what is it that has really happened ? Some one has killed herself for love of you . I wish that I had ever had such an experience . It would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life . The people who have adored me there have not been very many , but there have been some have always insisted on living on , long after I had ceased to care for them , or they to care for me . They have become stout and tedious , and when I meet them , they go in at once for reminiscences . That awful memory of woman ! What a fearful thing it is ! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals ! One should absorb the colour of life , but one should never remember its details . Details are always vulgar . "
43958	43967	43969	43969	Dorian	117	" I must sow poppies in my garden , "
43971	43977	43979	43980	his companion	397	" There is no necessity , "
43982	44464	43979	43980	his companion	397	" Life has always poppies in her hands . Of course , now and then things linger . I once wore nothing but violets all through one season , as a form of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die . Ultimately , however , it did die . I forget what killed it . I think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me . That is always a dreadful moment . It fills one with the terror of eternity . Well would you believe it ? a week ago , at Lady Hampshire s , I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in question , and she insisted on going over the whole thing again , and digging up the past , and raking up the future . I had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel . She dragged it out again and assured me that I had spoiled her life . I am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner , so I did not feel any anxiety . But what a lack of taste she showed ! The one charm of the past is that it is the past . But women never know when the curtain has fallen . They always want a sixth act , and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over , they propose to continue it . If they were allowed their own way , every comedy would have a tragic ending , and every tragedy would culminate in a farce . They are charmingly artificial , but they have no sense of art . You are more fortunate than I am . I assure you , Dorian , that not one of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you . Ordinary women always console themselves . Some of them do it by going in for sentimental colours . Never trust a woman who wears mauve , whatever her age may be , or a woman over thirty - five who is fond of pink ribbons . It always means that they have a history . Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands . They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one s face , as if it were the most fascinating of sins . Religion consoles some . Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation , a woman once told me , and I can quite understand it . Besides , nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner . Conscience makes egotists of us all . Yes ; there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life . Indeed , I have not mentioned the most important one . "
44465	44472	44474	44475	the lad	427	" What is that , Harry ? "
44478	44575	43979	43980	his companion	397	" Oh , the obvious consolation . Taking some one else s admirer when one loses one s own . In good society that always whitewashes a woman . But really , Dorian , how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the women one meets ! There is something to me quite beautiful about her death . I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen . They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with , such as romance , passion , and love . "
44576	44588	43979	43980	his companion	397	" I was terribly cruel to her . You forget that . "
44589	44704	43979	43980	his companion	397	" I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty , downright cruelty , more than anything else . They have wonderfully primitive instincts . We have emancipated them , but they remain slaves looking for their masters , all the same . They love being dominated . I am sure you were splendid . I have never seen you really and absolutely angry , but I can fancy how delightful you looked . And , after all , you said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful , but that I see now was absolutely true , and it holds the key to everything . "
44705	44712	43979	43980	his companion	397	" What was that , Harry ? "
44713	44755	43979	43980	his companion	397	" You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of romance that she was Desdemona one night , and Ophelia the other ; that if she died as Juliet , she came to life as Imogen . "
44756	44766	44768	44769	the lad	427	" She will never come to life again now , "
44778	44958	43979	43980	his companion	397	" No , she will never come to life . She has played her last part . But you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing - room simply as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy , as a wonderful scene from Webster , or Ford , or Cyril Tourneur . The girl never really lived , and so she has never really died . To you at least she was always a dream , a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare s plays and left them lovelier for its presence , a reed through which Shakespeare s music sounded richer and more full of joy . The moment she touched actual life , she marred it , and it marred her , and so she passed away . Mourn for Ophelia , if you like . Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was strangled . Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio died . But don t waste your tears over Sibyl Vane . She was less real than they are . "
45002	45012	45013	45013	he	117	" You have explained me to myself , Harry , "
45023	45091	45013	45013	he	117	" I felt all that you have said , but somehow I was afraid of it , and I could not express it to myself . How well you know me ! But we will not talk again of what has happened . It has been a marvellous experience . That is all . I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous . "
45092	45122	45013	45013	he	117	" Life has everything in store for you , Dorian . There is nothing that you , with your extraordinary good looks , will not be able to do . "
45123	45142	45013	45013	he	117	" But suppose , Harry , I became haggard , and old , and wrinkled ? What then ? "
45143	45148	45150	45151	Lord Henry	120	" Ah , then , "
45157	45242	45150	45151	Lord Henry	120	" then , my dear Dorian , you would have to fight for your victories . As it is , they are brought to you . No , you must keep your good looks . We live in an age that reads too much to be wise , and that thinks too much to be beautiful . We can not spare you . And now you had better dress and drive down to the club . We are rather late , as it is . "
45243	45274	45013	45013	he	117	" I think I shall join you at the opera , Harry . I feel too tired to eat anything . What is the number of your sister s box ? "
45275	45310	45150	45151	Lord Henry	120	" Twenty - seven , I believe . It is on the grand tier . You will see her name on the door . But I am sorry you won t come and dine . "
45311	45320	45322	45322	Dorian	117	" I don t feel up to it , "
45325	45359	45322	45322	Dorian	117	" But I am awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me . You are certainly my best friend . No one has ever understood me as you have . "
45360	45373	45375	45376	Lord Henry	120	" We are only at the beginning of our friendship , Dorian , "
45384	45407	45375	45376	Lord Henry	120	" Good - bye . I shall see you before nine - thirty , I hope . Remember , Patti is singing . "
46443	46455	46456	46456	he	121	" I am so glad I have found you , Dorian , "
46460	46676	46456	46456	he	121	" I called last night , and they told me you were at the opera . Of course , I knew that was impossible . But I wish you had left word where you had really gone to . I passed a dreadful evening , half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another . I think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first . I read of it quite by chance in a late edition of _ The Globe _ that I picked up at the club . I came here at once and was miserable at not finding you . I can t tell you how heart - broken I am about the whole thing . I know what you must suffer . But where were you ? Did you go down and see the girl s mother ? For a moment I thought of following you there . They gave the address in the paper . Somewhere in the Euston Road , isn t it ? But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten . Poor woman ! What a state she must be in ! And her only child , too ! What did she say about it all ? "
46677	46687	46689	46690	Dorian Gray	117	" My dear Basil , how do I know ? "
46714	46848	46456	46456	he	121	" I was at the opera . You should have come on there . I met Lady Gwendolen , Harry s sister , for the first time . We were in her box . She is perfectly charming ; and Patti sang divinely . Don t talk about horrid subjects . If one doesn t talk about a thing , it has never happened . It is simply expression , as Harry says , that gives reality to things . I may mention that she was not the woman s only child . There is a son , a charming fellow , I believe . But he is not on the stage . He is a sailor , or something . And now , tell me about yourself and what you are painting . "
46849	46856	46858	46858	Hallward	121	" You went to the opera ? "
46874	46941	46858	46858	Hallward	121	" You went to the opera while Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging ? You can talk to me of other women being charming , and of Patti singing divinely , before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in ? Why , man , there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers ! "
46942	46953	46955	46955	Dorian	961	" Stop , Basil ! I won t hear it ! "
46962	46983	46955	46955	Dorian	961	" You must not tell me about things . What is done is done . What is past is past . "
46984	46991	46858	46858	Hallward	121	" You call yesterday the past ? "
46992	47069	46955	46955	Dorian	961	" What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it ? It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion . A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure . I don t want to be at the mercy of my emotions . I want to use them , to enjoy them , and to dominate them . "
47070	47168	46858	46858	Hallward	121	" Dorian , this is horrible ! Something has changed you completely . You look exactly the same wonderful boy who , day after day , used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture . But you were simple , natural , and affectionate then . You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world . Now , I don t know what has come over you . You talk as if you had no heart , no pity in you . It is all Harry s influence . I see that . "
47197	47208	47209	47209	he	427	" I owe a great deal to Harry , Basil , "
47214	47230	47209	47209	he	427	" more than I owe to you . You only taught me to be vain . "
47231	47247	47169	47170	The lad	427	" Well , I am punished for that , Dorian or shall be some day . "
47248	47259	47260	47260	he	427	" I don t know what you mean , Basil , "
47266	47280	47260	47260	he	427	" I don t know what you want . What do you want ? "
47281	47292	47294	47295	the artist	357	" I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint , "
47298	47301	47303	47304	the lad	427	" Basil , "
47318	47336	47303	47304	the lad	427	" you have come too late . Yesterday , when I heard that Sibyl Vane had killed herself "
47337	47351	47353	47353	Hallward	121	" Killed herself ! Good heavens ! is there no doubt about that ? "
47365	47387	47303	47304	the lad	427	" My dear Basil ! Surely you don t think it was a vulgar accident ? Of course she killed herself . "
47398	47402	47403	47403	he	966	" How fearful , "
47413	47416	47418	47419	Dorian Gray	117	" No , "
47421	48118	47418	47419	Dorian Gray	117	" there is nothing fearful about it . It is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age . As a rule , people who act lead the most commonplace lives . They are good husbands , or faithful wives , or something tedious . You know what I mean middle - class virtue and all that kind of thing . How different Sibyl was ! She lived her finest tragedy . She was always a heroine . The last night she played the night you saw her she acted badly because she had known the reality of love . When she knew its unreality , she died , as Juliet might have died . She passed again into the sphere of art . There is something of the martyr about her . Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom , all its wasted beauty . But , as I was saying , you must not think I have not suffered . If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment about half - past five , perhaps , or a quarter to six you would have found me in tears . Even Harry , who was here , who brought me the news , in fact , had no idea what I was going through . I suffered immensely . Then it passed away . I can not repeat an emotion . No one can , except sentimentalists . And you are awfully unjust , Basil . You come down here to console me . That is charming of you . You find me consoled , and you are furious . How like a sympathetic person ! You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed , or some unjust law altered I forget exactly what it was . Finally he succeeded , and nothing could exceed his disappointment . He had absolutely nothing to do , almost died of _ ennui _ , and became a confirmed misanthrope . And besides , my dear old Basil , if you really want to console me , teach me rather to forget what has happened , or to see it from a proper artistic point of view . Was it not Gautier who used to write about _ la consolation des arts _ ? I remember picking up a little vellum - covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase . Well , I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together , the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life . I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle . Old brocades , green bronzes , lacquer - work , carved ivories , exquisite surroundings , luxury , pomp there is much to be got from all these . But the artistic temperament that they create , or at any rate reveal , is still more to me . To become the spectator of one s own life , as Harry says , is to escape the suffering of life . I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this . You have not realized how I have developed . I was a schoolboy when you knew me . I am a man now . I have new passions , new thoughts , new ideas . I am different , but you must not like me less . I am changed , but you must always be my friend . Of course , I am very fond of Harry . But I know that you are better than he is . You are not stronger you are too much afraid of life but you are better . And how happy we used to be together ! Don t leave me , Basil , and don t quarrel with me . I am what I am . There is nothing more to be said . "
48191	48196	48197	48197	he	427	" Well , Dorian , "
48207	48253	48197	48197	he	427	" I won t speak to you again about this horrible thing , after to - day . I only trust your name won t be mentioned in connection with it . The inquest is to take place this afternoon . Have they summoned you ? "
48274	48277	48254	48254	Dorian	117	" inquest . "
48291	48299	48300	48300	he	117	" They don t know my name , "
48303	48309	48256	48256	his	117	" But surely she did ? "
48310	48396	48256	48256	his	117	" Only my Christian name , and that I am quite sure she never mentioned to any one . She told me once that they were all rather curious to learn who I was , and that she invariably told them my name was Prince Charming . It was pretty of her . You must do me a drawing of Sibyl , Basil . I should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words . "
48397	48432	48256	48256	his	117	" I will try and do something , Dorian , if it would please you . But you must come and sit to me yourself again . I can t get on without you . "
48433	48448	48449	48449	he	969	" I can never sit to you again , Basil . It is impossible ! "
48461	48469	48470	48470	he	969	" My dear boy , what nonsense ! "
48473	48552	48470	48470	he	969	" Do you mean to say you don t like what I did of you ? Where is it ? Why have you pulled the screen in front of it ? Let me look at it . It is the best thing I have ever done . Do take the screen away , Dorian . It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that . I felt the room looked different as I came in . "
48553	48605	48459	48459	him	969	" My servant has nothing to do with it , Basil . You don t imagine I let him arrange my room for me ? He settles my flowers for me sometimes that is all . No ; I did it myself . The light was too strong on the portrait . "
48606	48630	48631	48632	And Hallward	121	" Too strong ! Surely not , my dear fellow ? It is an admirable place for it . Let me see it . "
48662	48665	48666	48666	he	117	" Basil , "
48673	48688	48666	48666	he	117	" you must not look at it . I don t wish you to . "
48689	48710	48712	48712	Hallward	121	" Not look at my own work ! You are not serious . Why shouldn t I look at it ? "
48716	48782	48666	48666	he	117	" If you try to look at it , Basil , on my word of honour I will never speak to you again as long as I live . I am quite serious . I don t offer any explanation , and you are not to ask for any . But , remember , if you touch this screen , everything is over between us . "
48837	48840	48805	48806	The lad	427	" Dorian ! "
48841	48846	48805	48806	The lad	427	" Don t speak ! "
48847	48870	48871	48871	he	427	" But what is the matter ? Of course I won t look at it if you don t want me to , "
48888	48949	48871	48871	he	427	" But , really , it seems rather absurd that I shouldn t see my own work , especially as I am going to exhibit it in Paris in the autumn . I shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that , so I must see it some day , and why not to - day ? "
48950	48961	48963	48964	Dorian Gray	117	" To exhibit it ! You want to exhibit it ? "
49013	49107	49108	49109	Dorian Gray	117	" Yes ; I don t suppose you will object to that . Georges Petit is going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de S ze , which will open the first week in October . The portrait will only be away a month . I should think you could easily spare it for that time . In fact , you are sure to be out of town . And if you keep it always behind a screen , you can t care much about it . "
49137	49151	49152	49152	he	117	" You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it , "
49155	49225	49152	49152	he	117	" Why have you changed your mind ? You people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have . The only difference is that your moods are rather meaningless . You can t have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition . You told Harry exactly the same thing . "
49258	49300	49243	49244	Lord Henry	120	" If you want to have a strange quarter of an hour , get Basil to tell you why he won t exhibit your picture . He told me why he wouldn t , and it was a revelation to me . "
49319	49322	49323	49323	he	117	" Basil , "
49338	49370	49323	49323	he	117	" we have each of us a secret . Let me know yours , and I shall tell you mine . What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture ? "
49379	49473	49371	49372	The painter	389	" Dorian , if I told you , you might like me less than you do , and you would certainly laugh at me . I could not bear your doing either of those two things . If you wish me never to look at your picture again , I am content . I have always you to look at . If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from the world , I am satisfied . Your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation . "
49474	49484	49486	49487	Dorian Gray	117	" No , Basil , you must tell me , "
49489	49499	49500	49500	His	117	" I think I have a right to know . "
49526	49534	49536	49537	the painter	389	" Let us sit down , Dorian , "
49542	49582	49536	49537	the painter	389	" Let us sit down . And just answer me one question . Have you noticed in the picture something curious ? something that probably at first did not strike you , but that revealed itself to you suddenly ? "
49583	49586	49588	49589	the lad	427	" Basil ! "
49609	50347	49536	49537	the painter	389	" I see you did . Don t speak . Wait till you hear what I have to say . Dorian , from the moment I met you , your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me . I was dominated , soul , brain , and power , by you . You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream . I worshipped you . I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke . I wanted to have you all to myself . I was only happy when I was with you . When you were away from me , you were still present in my art .... Of course , I never let you know anything about this . It would have been impossible . You would not have understood it . I hardly understood it myself . I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face , and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes too wonderful , perhaps , for in such mad worships there is peril , the peril of losing them , no less than the peril of keeping them .... Weeks and weeks went on , and I grew more and more absorbed in you . Then came a new development . I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour , and as Adonis with huntsman s cloak and polished boar - spear . Crowned with heavy lotus - blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian s barge , gazing across the green turbid Nile . You had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the water s silent silver the marvel of your own face . And it had all been what art should be unconscious , ideal , and remote . One day , a fatal day I sometimes think , I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are , not in the costume of dead ages , but in your own dress and in your own time . Whether it was the realism of the method , or the mere wonder of your own personality , thus directly presented to me without mist or veil , I can not tell . But I know that as I worked at it , every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret . I grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry . I felt , Dorian , that I had told too much , that I had put too much of myself into it . Then it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited . You were a little annoyed ; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me . Harry , to whom I talked about it , laughed at me . But I did not mind that . When the picture was finished , and I sat alone with it , I felt that I was right .... Well , after a few days the thing left my studio , and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence , it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had seen anything in it , more than that you were extremely good - looking and that I could paint . Even now I can not help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates . Art is always more abstract than we fancy . Form and colour tell us of form and colour that is all . It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him . And so when I got this offer from Paris , I determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition . It never occurred to me that you would refuse . I see now that you were right . The picture can not be shown . You must not be angry with me , Dorian , for what I have told you . As I said to Harry , once , you are made to be worshipped . "
50476	50485	50487	50487	Hallward	121	" It is extraordinary to me , Dorian , "
50489	50506	50487	50487	Hallward	121	" that you should have seen this in the portrait . Did you really see it ? "
50507	50514	50515	50515	he	117	" I saw something in it , "
50518	50527	50515	50515	he	117	" something that seemed to me very curious . "
50528	50542	50453	50462	some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry	981	" Well , you don t mind my looking at the thing now ? "
50548	50571	50545	50545	his	117	" You must not ask me that , Basil . I could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture . "
50572	50580	50453	50462	some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry	981	" You will some day , surely ? "
50581	50584	50545	50545	his	117	" Never . "
50585	50650	50453	50462	some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry	981	" Well , perhaps you are right . And now good - bye , Dorian . You have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art . Whatever I have done that is good , I owe to you . Ah ! you don t know what it cost me to tell you all that I have told you . "
50651	50656	50658	50658	Dorian	117	" My dear Basil , "
50660	50685	50658	50658	Dorian	117	" what have you told me ? Simply that you felt that you admired me too much . That is not even a compliment . "
50686	50727	50453	50462	some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry	981	" It was not intended as a compliment . It was a confession . Now that I have made it , something seems to have gone out of me . Perhaps one should never put one s worship into words . "
50728	50736	50658	50658	Dorian	117	" It was a very disappointing confession . "
50737	50767	50453	50462	some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry	981	" Why , what did you expect , Dorian ? You didn t see anything else in the picture , did you ? There was nothing else to see ? "
50768	50810	50658	50658	Dorian	117	" No ; there was nothing else to see . Why do you ask ? But you mustn t talk about worship . It is foolish . You and I are friends , Basil , and we must always remain so . "
50811	50817	50819	50820	the painter	389	" You have got Harry , "
50823	50828	50830	50831	the lad	427	" Oh , Harry ! "
50839	50895	50830	50831	the lad	427	" Harry spends his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is improbable . Just the sort of life I would like to lead . But still I don t think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble . I would sooner go to you , Basil . "
50896	50904	50658	50658	Dorian	117	" You will sit to me again ? "
50905	50908	50830	50831	the lad	427	" Impossible ! "
50909	50935	50658	50658	Dorian	117	" You spoil my life as an artist by refusing , Dorian . No man comes across two ideal things . Few come across one . "
50936	50988	50830	50831	the lad	427	" I can t explain it to you , Basil , but I must never sit to you again . There is something fatal about a portrait . It has a life of its own . I will come and have tea with you . That will be just as pleasant . "
50989	50998	51000	51000	Hallward	121	" Pleasanter for you , I am afraid , "
51003	51041	51000	51000	Hallward	121	" And now good - bye . I am sorry you won t let me look at the picture once again . But that can t be helped . I quite understand what you feel about it . "
51415	51423	51424	51424	she	422	" The old schoolroom , Mr. Dorian ? "
51427	51467	51424	51424	she	422	" Why , it is full of dust . I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it . It is not fit for you to see , sir . It is not , indeed . "
51468	51485	51407	51407	her	422	" I don t want it put straight , Leaf . I only want the key . "
51486	51520	51424	51424	she	422	" Well , sir , you ll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it . Why , it hasn t been opened for nearly five years not since his lordship died . "
51537	51543	51544	51544	he	991	" That does not matter , "
51547	51564	51544	51544	he	991	" I simply want to see the place that is all . Give me the key . "
51565	51574	51576	51578	the old lady	1001	" And here is the key , sir , "
51592	51627	51576	51578	the old lady	1001	" Here is the key . I ll have it off the bunch in a moment . But you don t think of living up there , sir , and you so comfortable here ? "
51628	51633	51634	51634	he	991	" No , no , "
51638	51648	51634	51634	he	991	" Thank you , Leaf . That will do . "
52209	52217	52251	52251	him	117	" The persons are here , Monsieur . "
52300	52306	52307	52307	he	117	" Wait for an answer , "
52315	52323	52307	52307	he	117	" and show the men in here . "
52442	52453	52454	52454	he	217	" What can I do for you , Mr. Gray ? "
52463	52517	52454	52454	he	217	" I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in person . I have just got a beauty of a frame , sir . Picked it up at a sale . Old Florentine . Came from Fonthill , I believe . Admirably suited for a religious subject , Mr. Gray . "
52518	52598	52431	52431	everybody	2085	" I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round , Mr. Hubbard . I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame though I don t go in much at present for religious art but to - day I only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me . It is rather heavy , so I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men . "
52599	52628	52454	52454	he	217	" No trouble at all , Mr. Gray . I am delighted to be of any service to you . Which is the work of art , sir ? "
52629	52632	52634	52634	Dorian	117	" This , "
52641	52667	52634	52634	Dorian	117	" Can you move it , covering and all , just as it is ? I don t want it to get scratched going upstairs . "
52668	52677	52679	52683	the genial frame - maker	1022	" There will be no difficulty , sir , "
52709	52724	52679	52683	the genial frame - maker	1022	" And , now , where shall we carry it to , Mr. Gray ? "
52725	52779	52679	52683	the genial frame - maker	1022	" I will show you the way , Mr. Hubbard , if you will kindly follow me . Or perhaps you had better go in front . I am afraid it is right at the top of the house . We will go up by the front staircase , as it is wider . "
52856	52866	52868	52870	the little man	1029	" Something of a load to carry , sir , "
52885	52894	52896	52896	Dorian	117	" I am afraid it is rather heavy , "
53528	53538	53539	53539	he	117	" Bring it in , Mr. Hubbard , please , "
53547	53564	53539	53539	he	117	" I am sorry I kept you so long . I was thinking of something else . "
53565	53576	53578	53588	the frame - maker , who was still gasping for breath	1052	" Always glad to have a rest , Mr. Gray , "
53590	53599	53578	53588	the frame - maker , who was still gasping for breath	1052	" Where shall we put it , sir ? "
53600	53630	53665	53666	the man	2023	" Oh , anywhere . Here : this will do . I don t want to have it hung up . Just lean it against the wall . Thanks . "
53631	53643	53578	53588	the frame - maker , who was still gasping for breath	1052	" Might one look at the work of art , sir ? "
53647	53657	53658	53658	he	117	" It would not interest you , Mr. Hubbard , "
53697	53718	53668	53668	He	117	" I shan t trouble you any more now . I am much obliged for your kindness in coming round . "
53719	53741	53743	53744	Mr. Hubbard	217	" Not at all , not at all , Mr. Gray . Ever ready to do anything for you , sir . "
54974	54982	54983	54983	he	117	" I am so sorry , Harry , "
54986	55012	54983	54983	he	117	" but really it is entirely your fault . That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the time was going . "
55013	55023	55025	55026	his host	1100	" Yes , I thought you would like it , "
55033	55056	54983	54983	he	117	" I didn t say I liked it , Harry . I said it fascinated me . There is a great difference . "
55057	55065	55067	55068	Lord Henry	120	" Ah , you have discovered that ? "
56109	56119	56123	56123	he	117	" make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty . "
56128	56134	56123	56123	he	117	" the visible world existed . "

63728	63826	63700	63700	him	117	" Dorian ! What an extraordinary piece of luck ! I have been waiting for you in your library ever since nine o clock . Finally I took pity on your tired servant and told him to go to bed , as he let me out . I am off to Paris by the midnight train , and I particularly wanted to see you before I left . I thought it was you , or rather your fur coat , as you passed me . But I wasn t quite sure . Didn t you recognize me ? "
63827	63892	63999	63999	his	117	" In this fog , my dear Basil ? Why , I can t even recognize Grosvenor Square . I believe my house is somewhere about here , but I don t feel at all certain about it . I am sorry you are going away , as I have not seen you for ages . But I suppose you will be back soon ? "
63893	63968	63700	63700	him	117	" No : I am going to be out of England for six months . I intend to take a studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture I have in my head . However , it wasn t about myself I wanted to talk . Here we are at your door . Let me come in for a moment . I have something to say to you . "
63969	63983	63985	63986	Dorian Gray	117	" I shall be charmed . But won t you miss your train ? "
64019	64026	64027	64027	he	121	" I have heaps of time , "
64030	64111	64027	64027	he	121	" The train doesn t go till twelve - fifteen , and it is only just eleven . In fact , I was on my way to the club to look for you , when I met you . You see , I shan t have any delay about luggage , as I have sent on my heavy things . All I have with me is in this bag , and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes . "
64119	64170	64112	64112	Dorian	117	" What a way for a fashionable painter to travel ! A Gladstone bag and an ulster ! Come in , or the fog will get into the house . And mind you don t talk about anything serious . Nothing is serious nowadays . At least nothing should be . "
64235	64294	64564	64564	his	121	" You see your servant made me quite at home , Dorian . He gave me everything I wanted , including your best gold - tipped cigarettes . He is a most hospitable creature . I like him much better than the Frenchman you used to have . What has become of the Frenchman , by the bye ? "
64300	64436	64295	64295	Dorian	117	" I believe he married Lady Radley s maid , and has established her in Paris as an English dressmaker . _ Anglomanie _ is very fashionable over there now , I hear . It seems silly of the French , doesn t it ? But do you know ? he was not at all a bad servant . I never liked him , but I had nothing to complain about . One often imagines things that are quite absurd . He was really very devoted to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away . Have another brandy - and - soda ? Or would you like hock - and - seltzer ? I always take hock - and - seltzer myself . There is sure to be some in the next room . "
64437	64447	64449	64450	the painter	389	" Thanks , I won t have anything more , "
64472	64504	64465	64465	he	389	" And now , my dear fellow , I want to speak to you seriously . Don t frown like that . You make it so much more difficult for me . "
64505	64512	64514	64514	Dorian	1390	" What is it all about ? "
64527	64553	64514	64514	Dorian	1390	" I hope it is not about myself . I am tired of myself to - night . I should like to be somebody else . "
64554	64560	64562	64562	Hallward	121	" It is about yourself , "
64569	64587	64562	64562	Hallward	121	" and I must say it to you . I shall only keep you half an hour . "
64595	64600	64601	64601	he	117	" Half an hour ! "
64604	64650	64514	64514	Dorian	1390	" It is not much to ask of you , Dorian , and it is entirely for your own sake that I am speaking . I think it right that you should know that the most dreadful things are being said against you in London . "
64651	64687	64514	64514	Dorian	1390	" I don t wish to know anything about them . I love scandals about other people , but scandals about myself don t interest me . They have not got the charm of novelty . "
64688	65284	64514	64514	Dorian	1390	" They must interest you , Dorian . Every gentleman is interested in his good name . You don t want people to talk of you as something vile and degraded . Of course , you have your position , and your wealth , and all that kind of thing . But position and wealth are not everything . Mind you , I don t believe these rumours at all . At least , I can t believe them when I see you . Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man s face . It can not be concealed . People talk sometimes of secret vices . There are no such things . If a wretched man has a vice , it shows itself in the lines of his mouth , the droop of his eyelids , the moulding of his hands even . Somebody I won t mention his name , but you know him came to me last year to have his portrait done . I had never seen him before , and had never heard anything about him at the time , though I have heard a good deal since . He offered an extravagant price . I refused him . There was something in the shape of his fingers that I hated . I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him . His life is dreadful . But you , Dorian , with your pure , bright , innocent face , and your marvellous untroubled youth I can t believe anything against you . And yet I see you very seldom , and you never come down to the studio now , and when I am away from you , and I hear all these hideous things that people are whispering about you , I don t know what to say . Why is it , Dorian , that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it ? Why is it that so many gentlemen in London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs ? You used to be a friend of Lord Staveley . I met him at dinner last week . Your name happened to come up in conversation , in connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley . Staveley curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes , but that you were a man whom no pure - minded girl should be allowed to know , and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with . I reminded him that I was a friend of yours , and asked him what he meant . He told me . He told me right out before everybody . It was horrible ! Why is your friendship so fatal to young men ? There was that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide . You were his great friend . There was Sir Henry Ashton , who had to leave England with a tarnished name . You and he were inseparable . What about Adrian Singleton and his dreadful end ? What about Lord Kent s only son and his career ? I met his father yesterday in St. James s Street . He seemed broken with shame and sorrow . What about the young Duke of Perth ? What sort of life has he got now ? What gentleman would associate with him ? "
65285	65301	65303	65304	Dorian Gray	117	" Stop , Basil . You are talking about things of which you know nothing , "
65321	65543	65318	65318	his	117	" You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it . It is because I know everything about his life , not because he knows anything about mine . With such blood as he has in his veins , how could his record be clean ? You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth . Did I teach the one his vices , and the other his debauchery ? If Kent s silly son takes his wife from the streets , what is that to me ? If Adrian Singleton writes his friend s name across a bill , am I his keeper ? I know how people chatter in England . The middle classes air their moral prejudices over their gross dinner - tables , and whisper about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with the people they slander . In this country , it is enough for a man to have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him . And what sort of lives do these people , who pose as being moral , lead themselves ? My dear fellow , you forget that we are in the native land of the hypocrite . "
65544	65547	65549	65549	Hallward	121	" Dorian , "
65551	65703	65549	65549	Hallward	121	" that is not the question . England is bad enough I know , and English society is all wrong . That is the reason why I want you to be fine . You have not been fine . One has a right to judge of a man by the effect he has over his friends . Yours seem to lose all sense of honour , of goodness , of purity . You have filled them with a madness for pleasure . They have gone down into the depths . You led them there . Yes : you led them there , and yet you can smile , as you are smiling now . And there is worse behind . I know you and Harry are inseparable . Surely for that reason , if for none other , you should not have made his sister s name a by - word . "
65704	65715	65318	65318	his	117	" Take care , Basil . You go too far . "
65716	66151	65549	65549	Hallward	121	" I must speak , and you must listen . You shall listen . When you met Lady Gwendolen , not a breath of scandal had ever touched her . Is there a single decent woman in London now who would drive with her in the park ? Why , even her children are not allowed to live with her . Then there are other stories stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in London . Are they true ? Can they be true ? When I first heard them , I laughed . I hear them now , and they make me shudder . What about your country - house and the life that is led there ? Dorian , you don t know what is said about you . I won t tell you that I don t want to preach to you . I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that , and then proceeded to break his word . I do want to preach to you . I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you . I want you to have a clean name and a fair record . I want you to get rid of the dreadful people you associate with . Don t shrug your shoulders like that . Don t be so indifferent . You have a wonderful influence . Let it be for good , not for evil . They say that you corrupt every one with whom you become intimate , and that it is quite sufficient for you to enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after . I don t know whether it is so or not . How should I know ? But it is said of you . I am told things that it seems impossible to doubt . Lord Gloucester was one of my greatest friends at Oxford . He showed me a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at Mentone . Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read . I told him that it was absurd that I knew you thoroughly and that you were incapable of anything of the kind . Know you ? I wonder do I know you ? Before I could answer that , I should have to see your soul . "
66152	66158	66160	66161	Dorian Gray	117	" To see my soul ! "
66175	66178	66180	66180	Hallward	121	" Yes , "
66193	66206	66190	66190	his	121	" to see your soul . But only God can do that . "
66221	66232	66233	66233	he	121	" You shall see it yourself , to - night ! "
66243	66336	66233	66233	he	121	" Come : it is your own handiwork . Why shouldn t you look at it ? You can tell the world all about it afterwards , if you choose . Nobody would believe you . If they did believe you , they would like me all the better for it . I know the age better than you do , though you will prate about it so tediously . Come , I tell you . You have chattered enough about corruption . Now you shall look on it face to face . "
66417	66420	66421	66421	he	121	" Yes , "
66436	66457	66421	66421	he	121	" I shall show you my soul . You shall see the thing that you fancy only God can see . "
66462	66469	66470	66470	he	121	" This is blasphemy , Dorian ! "
66473	66493	66470	66470	he	121	" You must not say things like that . They are horrible , and they don t mean anything . "
66494	66499	66500	66500	He	121	" You think so ? "
66504	66539	66421	66421	he	121	" I know so . As for what I said to you to - night , I said it for your good . You know I have been always a stanch friend to you . "
66540	66553	66470	66470	he	121	" Don t touch me . Finish what you have to say . "
66653	66660	66662	66664	the young man	1396	" I am waiting , Basil , "
66675	66684	66685	66685	he	1396	" What I have to say is this , "
66688	66760	66685	66685	he	1396	" You must give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you . If you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end , I shall believe you . Deny them , Dorian , deny them ! Can t you see what I am going through ? My God ! don t tell me that you are bad , and corrupt , and shameful . "
66775	66781	66782	66782	he	117	" Come upstairs , Basil , "
66786	66823	66782	66782	he	117	" I keep a diary of my life from day to day , and it never leaves the room in which it is written . I shall show it to you if you come with me . "
66824	66881	66685	66685	he	1396	" I shall come with you , Dorian , if you wish it . I see I have missed my train . That makes no matter . I can go to - morrow . But don t ask me to read anything to - night . All I want is a plain answer to my question . "
66882	66906	66782	66782	he	117	" That shall be given to you upstairs . I could not give it here . You will not have to read long . "
66987	66995	66996	66996	he	117	" You insist on knowing , Basil ? "
67003	67006	66996	66996	he	117	" Yes . "
67007	67012	67013	67013	he	117	" I am delighted , "
67025	67055	67019	67019	he	117	" You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know everything about me . You have had more to do with my life than you think "
67098	67105	67106	67106	he	117	" Shut the door behind you , "
67231	67258	67300	67302	the young man	1396	" So you think that it is only God who sees the soul , Basil ? Draw that curtain back , and you will see mine . "
67268	67280	67282	67282	Hallward	121	" You are mad , Dorian , or playing a part , "
67286	67298	67300	67302	the young man	1396	" You won t ? Then I must do it myself , "
67701	67707	67709	67709	Hallward	121	" What does this mean ? "
67725	67735	67737	67738	Dorian Gray	117	" Years ago , when I was a boy , "
67747	67834	67737	67738	Dorian Gray	117	" you met me , flattered me , and taught me to be vain of my good looks . One day you introduced me to a friend of yours , who explained to me the wonder of youth , and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty . In a mad moment that , even now , I don t know whether I regret or not , I made a wish , perhaps you would call it a prayer .... "
67835	67887	67714	67714	His	121	" I remember it ! Oh , how well I remember it ! No ! the thing is impossible . The room is damp . Mildew has got into the canvas . The paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them . I tell you the thing is impossible . "
67888	67895	67897	67899	the young man	1396	" Ah , what is impossible ? "
67919	67928	67737	67738	Dorian Gray	117	" You told me you had destroyed it . "
67929	67939	67737	67738	Dorian Gray	117	" I was wrong . It has destroyed me . "
67940	67950	67737	67738	Dorian Gray	117	" I don t believe it is my picture . "
67951	67961	67963	67963	Dorian	1415	" Can t you see your ideal in it ? "
67966	67975	67737	67738	Dorian Gray	117	" My ideal , as you call it ... "
67976	67982	67737	67738	Dorian Gray	117	" As you called it . "
67983	68016	67737	67738	Dorian Gray	117	" There was nothing evil in it , nothing shameful . You were to me such an ideal as I shall never meet again . This is the face of a satyr . "
68017	68026	67737	67738	Dorian Gray	117	" It is the face of my soul . "
68027	68046	67737	67738	Dorian Gray	117	" Christ ! what a thing I must have worshipped ! It has the eyes of a devil . "
68047	68060	68062	68062	Dorian	117	" Each of us has heaven and hell in him , Basil , "
68081	68090	68091	68091	he	121	" My God ! If it is true , "
68094	68124	68091	68091	he	121	" and this is what you have done with your life , why , you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you to be ! "
68251	68266	68276	68278	the young man	1396	" Good God , Dorian , what a lesson ! What an awful lesson ! "
68284	68291	68292	68292	he	121	" Pray , Dorian , pray , "
68295	68374	68292	68292	he	121	" What is it that one was taught to say in one s boyhood ? Lead us not into temptation . Forgive us our sins . Wash away our iniquities . Let us say that together . The prayer of your pride has been answered . The prayer of your repentance will be answered also . I worshipped you too much . I am punished for it . You worshipped yourself too much . We are both punished . "
68390	68398	68399	68399	he	121	" It is too late , Basil , "
68402	68449	68292	68292	he	121	" It is never too late , Dorian . Let us kneel down and try if we can not remember a prayer . Isn t there a verse somewhere , Though your sins be as scarlet , yet I will make them as white as snow ? "
68450	68459	68375	68376	Dorian Gray	117	" Those words mean nothing to me now . "
68460	68491	68292	68292	he	121	" Hush ! Don t say that . You have done enough evil in your life . My God ! Don t you see that accursed thing leering at us ? "
69645	69659	69660	69660	he	117	" I am sorry to have had to wake you up , Francis , "
69666	69681	69660	69660	he	117	" but I had forgotten my latch - key . What time is it ? "
69682	69690	69692	69700	the man , looking at the clock and blinking	1452	" Ten minutes past two , sir , "
69702	69729	69840	69841	The man	2023	" Ten minutes past two ? How horribly late ! You must wake me at nine to - morrow . I have some work to do . "
69730	69736	69840	69841	The man	2023	" All right , sir . "
69737	69745	69840	69841	The man	2023	" Did any one call this evening ? "
69746	69768	69840	69841	The man	2023	" Mr. Hallward , sir . He stayed here till eleven , and then he went away to catch his train . "
69769	69787	69840	69841	The man	2023	" Oh ! I am sorry I didn t see him . Did he leave any message ? "
69788	69813	69840	69841	The man	2023	" No , sir , except that he would write to you from Paris , if he did not find you at the club . "
69814	69833	69840	69841	The man	2023	" That will do , Francis . Don t forget to call me at nine to - morrow . "
69834	69839	69840	69841	The man	2023	" No , sir . "
69906	69917	69887	69887	he	117	" Alan Campbell , 152 , Hertford Street , Mayfair . "

70537	70562	70523	70523	he	1459	" Take this round to 152 , Hertford Street , Francis , and if Mr. Campbell is out of town , get his address . "

72204	72219	72167	72168	The man	2023	" Alan ! This is kind of you . I thank you for coming . "
72220	72245	72246	72246	His	309	" I had intended never to enter your house again , Gray . But you said it was a matter of life and death . "
72303	72327	72351	72351	Dorian	117	" Yes : it is a matter of life and death , Alan , and to more than one person . Sit down . "
72403	72485	72377	72377	he	117	" Alan , in a locked room at the top of this house , a room to which nobody but myself has access , a dead man is seated at a table . He has been dead ten hours now . Don t stir , and don t look at me like that . Who the man is , why he died , how he died , are matters that do not concern you . What you have to do is this "
72486	72542	72377	72377	he	117	" Stop , Gray . I don t want to know anything further . Whether what you have told me is true or not true doesn t concern me . I entirely decline to be mixed up in your life . Keep your horrible secrets to yourself . They don t interest me any more . "
72543	72728	72377	72377	he	117	" Alan , they will have to interest you . This one will have to interest you . I am awfully sorry for you , Alan . But I can t help myself . You are the one man who is able to save me . I am forced to bring you into the matter . I have no option . Alan , you are scientific . You know about chemistry and things of that kind . You have made experiments . What you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs to destroy it so that not a vestige of it will be left . Nobody saw this person come into the house . Indeed , at the present moment he is supposed to be in Paris . He will not be missed for months . When he is missed , there must be no trace of him found here . You , Alan , you must change him , and everything that belongs to him , into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in the air . "
72729	72736	72377	72377	he	117	" You are mad , Dorian . "
72737	72750	72377	72377	he	117	" Ah ! I was waiting for you to call me Dorian . "
72751	72820	72377	72377	he	117	" You are mad , I tell you mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to help you , mad to make this monstrous confession . I will have nothing to do with this matter , whatever it is . Do you think I am going to peril my reputation for you ? What is it to me what devil s work you are up to ? "
72821	72828	72377	72377	he	117	" It was suicide , Alan . "
72829	72849	72377	72377	he	117	" I am glad of that . But who drove him to it ? You , I should fancy . "
72850	72861	72377	72377	he	117	" Do you still refuse to do this for me ? "
72862	72993	72377	72377	he	117	" Of course I refuse . I will have absolutely nothing to do with it . I don t care what shame comes on you . You deserve it all . I should not be sorry to see you disgraced , publicly disgraced . How dare you ask me , of all men in the world , to mix myself up in this horror ? I should have thought you knew more about people s characters . Your friend Lord Henry Wotton can t have taught you much about psychology , whatever else he has taught you . Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you . You have come to the wrong man . Go to some of your friends . Don t come to me . "
72994	73053	72377	72377	he	117	" Alan , it was murder . I killed him . You don t know what he had made me suffer . Whatever my life is , he had more to do with the making or the marring of it than poor Harry has had . He may not have intended it , the result was the same . "
73054	73119	72377	72377	he	117	" Murder ! Good God , Dorian , is that what you have come to ? I shall not inform upon you . It is not my business . Besides , without my stirring in the matter , you are certain to be arrested . Nobody ever commits a crime without doing something stupid . But I will have nothing to do with it . "
73120	73348	72377	72377	he	117	" You must have something to do with it . Wait , wait a moment ; listen to me . Only listen , Alan . All I ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment . You go to hospitals and dead - houses , and the horrors that you do there don t affect you . If in some hideous dissecting - room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow through , you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject . You would not turn a hair . You would not believe that you were doing anything wrong . On the contrary , you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race , or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world , or gratifying intellectual curiosity , or something of that kind . What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before . Indeed , to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at . And , remember , it is the only piece of evidence against me . If it is discovered , I am lost ; and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me . "
73349	73379	72377	72377	he	117	" I have no desire to help you . You forget that . I am simply indifferent to the whole thing . It has nothing to do with me . "
73380	73479	72377	72377	he	117	" Alan , I entreat you . Think of the position I am in . Just before you came I almost fainted with terror . You may know terror yourself some day . No ! don t think of that . Look at the matter purely from the scientific point of view . You don t inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come from . Don t inquire now . I have told you too much as it is . But I beg of you to do this . We were friends once , Alan . "
73480	73493	72377	72377	he	117	" Don t speak about those days , Dorian they are dead . "
73494	73562	72377	72377	he	117	" The dead linger sometimes . The man upstairs will not go away . He is sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms . Alan ! Alan ! If you don t come to my assistance , I am ruined . Why , they will hang me , Alan ! Don t you understand ? They will hang me for what I have done . "
73563	73592	72377	72377	he	117	" There is no good in prolonging this scene . I absolutely refuse to do anything in the matter . It is insane of you to ask me . "
73593	73597	72377	72377	he	117	" You refuse ? "
73598	73601	72377	72377	he	117	" Yes . "
73602	73609	72377	72377	he	117	" I entreat you , Alan . "
73610	73615	72377	72377	he	117	" It is useless . "
73765	73775	73776	73776	he	117	" I am so sorry for you , Alan , "
73779	73910	73776	73776	he	117	" but you leave me no alternative . I have a letter written already . Here it is . You see the address . If you don t help me , I must send it . If you don t help me , I will send it . You know what the result will be . But you are going to help me . It is impossible for you to refuse now . I tried to spare you . You will do me the justice to admit that . You were stern , harsh , offensive . You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me no living man , at any rate . I bore it all . Now it is for me to dictate terms . "
73926	73975	73924	73924	him	309	" Yes , it is my turn to dictate terms , Alan . You know what they are . The thing is quite simple . Come , don t work yourself into this fever . The thing has to be done . Face it , and do it . "
74072	74083	74048	74048	him	309	" Come , Alan , you must decide at once . "
74084	74091	74092	74092	he	309	" I can not do it , "
74104	74117	74048	74048	him	309	" You must . You have no choice . Don t delay . "
74123	74133	74118	74118	He	309	" Is there a fire in the room upstairs ? "
74134	74146	74048	74048	him	309	" Yes , there is a gas - fire with asbestos . "
74147	74162	74118	74118	He	309	" I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory . "
74163	74200	74048	74048	him	309	" No , Alan , you must not leave the house . Write out on a sheet of notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the things back to you . "
74367	74375	74376	74376	he	309	" You are infamous , absolutely infamous ! "
74379	74390	74392	74392	Dorian	117	" Hush , Alan . You have saved my life , "
74394	74448	74376	74376	he	309	" Your life ? Good heavens ! what a life that is ! You have gone from corruption to corruption , and now you have culminated in crime . In doing what I am going to do what you force me to do it is not of your life that I am thinking . "
74449	74454	74456	74456	Dorian	117	" Ah , Alan , "
74461	74480	74456	74456	Dorian	117	" I wish you had a thousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you . "
74541	74551	74552	74552	he	309	" Shall I leave the things here , sir ? "
74556	74559	74561	74561	Dorian	117	" Yes , "
74563	74594	74561	74561	Dorian	117	" And I am afraid , Francis , that I have another errand for you . What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies Selby with orchids ? "
74595	74600	74552	74552	he	309	" Harden , sir . "
74601	74676	74561	74561	Dorian	117	" Yes Harden . You must go down to Richmond at once , see Harden personally , and tell him to send twice as many orchids as I ordered , and to have as few white ones as possible . In fact , I don t want any white ones . It is a lovely day , Francis , and Richmond is a very pretty place otherwise I wouldn t bother you about it . "
74677	74691	74552	74552	he	309	" No trouble , sir . At what time shall I be back ? "
74697	74707	74708	74708	he	309	" How long will your experiment take , Alan ? "
74739	74747	74748	74748	he	309	" It will take about five hours , "
74751	74805	74719	74721	a third person	1520	" It will be time enough , then , if you are back at half - past seven , Francis . Or stay : just leave my things out for dressing . You can have the evening to yourself . I am not dining at home , so I shall not want you . "
74806	74812	74814	74815	the man	2023	" Thank you , sir , "
74821	74854	74855	74855	He	2023	" Now , Alan , there is not a moment to be lost . How heavy this chest is ! I ll take it for you . You bring the other things . "
74911	74923	74924	74924	he	117	" I don t think I can go in , Alan , "
74927	74940	74942	74942	Campbell	309	" It is nothing to me . I don t require you , "
75244	75249	75255	75255	him	1527	" Leave me now , "
75324	75335	75336	75336	he	1527	" I have done what you asked me to do , "
75339	75355	75336	75336	he	1527	" And now , good - bye . Let us never see each other again . "
75356	75372	75374	75374	Dorian	117	" You have saved me from ruin , Alan . I can not forget that , "
75717	75734	75735	75735	she	318	" I know , my dear , I should have fallen madly in love with you , "
75740	75831	75735	75735	she	318	" and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake . It is most fortunate that you were not thought of at the time . As it was , our bonnets were so unbecoming , and the mills were so occupied in trying to raise the wind , that I never had even a flirtation with anybody . However , that was all Narborough s fault . He was dreadfully short - sighted , and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who never sees anything . "
75886	75899	75900	75900	she	318	" I think it is most unkind of her , my dear , "
75903	76032	75900	75900	she	318	" Of course I go and stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg , but then an old woman like me must have fresh air sometimes , and besides , I really wake them up . You don t know what an existence they lead down there . It is pure unadulterated country life . They get up early , because they have so much to do , and go to bed early , because they have so little to think about . There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since the time of Queen Elizabeth , and consequently they all fall asleep after dinner . You shan t sit next either of them . You shall sit by me and amuse me . "
76258	76287	76234	76235	Lady Narborough	318	" How horrid of Henry Wotton to be so late ! I sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised faithfully not to disappoint me . "
76349	76366	76347	76347	she	318	" an insult to poor Adolphe , who invented the _ menu _ specially for you , "
76409	76412	76414	76415	Lord Henry	120	" Dorian , "
76431	76449	76414	76415	Lord Henry	120	" what is the matter with you to - night ? You are quite out of sorts . "
76450	76458	76460	76461	Lady Narborough	318	" I believe he is in love , "
76463	76488	76460	76461	Lady Narborough	318	" and that he is afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous . He is quite right . I certainly should . "
76489	76494	76496	76496	Dorian	117	" Dear Lady Narborough , "
76500	76523	76496	76496	Dorian	117	" I have not been in love for a whole week not , in fact , since Madame de Ferrol left town . "
76524	76536	76538	76540	the old lady	1001	" How you men can fall in love with that woman ! "
76542	76550	76538	76540	the old lady	1001	" I really can not understand it . "
76551	76569	76571	76572	Lord Henry	120	" It is simply because she remembers you when you were a little girl , Lady Narborough , "
76574	76587	76571	76572	Lord Henry	120	" She is the one link between us and your short frocks . "
76588	76625	76538	76540	the old lady	1001	" She does not remember my short frocks at all , Lord Henry . But I remember her very well at Vienna thirty years ago , and how _ d collet e _ she was then . "
76626	76636	76637	76637	he	120	" She is still _ d collet e _ , "
76648	76705	76637	76637	he	120	" and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an _ dition de luxe _ of a bad French novel . She is really wonderful , and full of surprises . Her capacity for family affection is extraordinary . When her third husband died , her hair turned quite gold from grief . "
76706	76713	76715	76715	Dorian	1573	" How can you , Harry ! "
76717	76725	76727	76728	the hostess	1574	" It is a most romantic explanation , "
76730	76750	76727	76728	the hostess	1574	" But her third husband , Lord Henry ! You don t mean to say Ferrol is the fourth ? "
76751	76757	76637	76637	he	120	" Certainly , Lady Narborough . "
76758	76768	76727	76728	the hostess	1574	" I don t believe a word of it . "
76769	76785	76637	76637	he	120	" Well , ask Mr. Gray . He is one of her most intimate friends . "
76786	76794	76727	76728	the hostess	1574	" Is it true , Mr. Gray ? "
76795	76804	76806	76806	Dorian	117	" She assures me so , Lady Narborough , "
76808	76848	76806	76806	Dorian	117	" I asked her whether , like Marguerite de Navarre , she had their hearts embalmed and hung at her girdle . She told me she didn t , because none of them had had any hearts at all . "
76849	76865	76727	76728	the hostess	1574	" Four husbands ! Upon my word that is _ trop de z le _ . "
76866	76877	76879	76879	Dorian	117	" _ Trop d audace _ , I tell her , "
76881	76906	76727	76728	the hostess	1574	" Oh ! she is audacious enough for anything , my dear . And what is Ferrol like ? I don t know him . "
76907	76920	76922	76923	Lord Henry	120	" The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes , "
76937	76957	76929	76930	Lady Narborough	318	" Lord Henry , I am not at all surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked . "
76958	76965	76967	76968	Lord Henry	120	" But what world says that ? "
76974	76992	76967	76968	Lord Henry	120	" It can only be the next world . This world and I are on excellent terms . "
76993	77003	77005	77007	the old lady	1001	" Everybody I know says you are very wicked , "
77021	77027	77028	77028	he	120	" It is perfectly monstrous , "
77034	77056	77028	77028	he	120	" the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one s back that are absolutely and entirely true . "
77057	77063	77065	77065	Dorian	1576	" Isn t he incorrigible ? "
77073	77078	77080	77081	his hostess	1577	" I hope so , "
77085	77115	77080	77081	his hostess	1577	" But really , if you all worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way , I shall have to marry again so as to be in the fashion . "
77116	77126	77129	77130	Lord Henry	120	" You will never marry again , Lady Narborough , "
77132	77178	77129	77130	Lord Henry	120	" You were far too happy . When a woman marries again , it is because she detested her first husband . When a man marries again , it is because he adored his first wife . Women try their luck ; men risk theirs . "
77179	77185	77187	77189	the old lady	1001	" Narborough wasn t perfect , "
77191	77208	77210	77211	the rejoinder	1579	" If he had been , you would not have loved him , my dear lady , "
77213	77263	77210	77211	the rejoinder	1579	" Women love us for our defects . If we have enough of them , they will forgive us everything , even our intellects . You will never ask me to dinner again after saying this , I am afraid , Lady Narborough , but it is quite true . "
77264	77337	77187	77189	the old lady	1001	" Of course it is true , Lord Henry . If we women did not love you for your defects , where would you all be ? Not one of you would ever be married . You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors . Not , however , that that would alter you much . Nowadays all the married men live like bachelors , and all the bachelors like married men . "
77338	77346	77348	77349	Lord Henry	120	" _ Fin de si cle _ , "
77351	77358	77360	77361	his hostess	1577	" _ Fin du globe _ , "
77363	77374	77376	77376	Dorian	117	" I wish it were _ fin du globe _ , "
77381	77388	77376	77376	Dorian	117	" Life is a great disappointment . "
77389	77395	77397	77398	Lady Narborough	318	" Ah , my dear , "
77405	77478	77397	77398	Lady Narborough	318	" don t tell me that you have exhausted life . When a man says that one knows that life has exhausted him . Lord Henry is very wicked , and I sometimes wish that I had been ; but you are made to be good you look so good . I must find you a nice wife . Lord Henry , don t you think that Mr. Gray should get married ? "
77479	77490	77492	77493	Lord Henry	120	" I am always telling him so , Lady Narborough , "
77498	77533	77397	77398	Lady Narborough	318	" Well , we must look out for a suitable match for him . I shall go through Debrett carefully to - night and draw out a list of all the eligible young ladies . "
77534	77542	77544	77544	Dorian	117	" With their ages , Lady Narborough ? "
77546	77591	77397	77398	Lady Narborough	318	" Of course , with their ages , slightly edited . But nothing must be done in a hurry . I want it to be what _ The Morning Post _ calls a suitable alliance , and I want you both to be happy . "
77592	77601	77603	77604	Lord Henry	120	" What nonsense people talk about happy marriages ! "
77606	77625	77603	77604	Lord Henry	120	" A man can be happy with any woman , as long as he does not love her . "
77626	77635	77637	77639	the old lady	1001	" Ah ! what a cynic you are ! "
77651	77702	77637	77639	the old lady	1001	" You must come and dine with me soon again . You are really an admirable tonic , much better than what Sir Andrew prescribes for me . You must tell me what people you would like to meet , though . I want it to be a delightful gathering . "
77703	77718	77719	77719	he	1582	" I like men who have a future and women who have a past , "
77722	77735	77719	77719	he	1582	" Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party ? "
77736	77741	77742	77742	she	1001	" I fear so , "
77752	77762	77763	77763	she	1001	" A thousand pardons , my dear Lady Ruxton , "
77766	77778	77763	77763	she	1001	" I didn t see you hadn t finished your cigarette . "
77779	77805	77849	77849	him	1582	" Never mind , Lady Narborough . I smoke a great deal too much . I am going to limit myself , for the future . "
77806	77814	77816	77817	Lord Henry	120	" Pray don t , Lady Ruxton , "
77819	77844	77816	77817	Lord Henry	120	" Moderation is a fatal thing . Enough is as bad as a meal . More than enough is as good as a feast . "
77852	77873	77874	77874	she	1001	" You must come and explain that to me some afternoon , Lord Henry . It sounds a fascinating theory , "
77885	77901	77903	77904	Lady Narborough	318	" Now , mind you don t stay too long over your politics and scandal , "
77909	77921	77903	77904	Lady Narborough	318	" If you do , we are sure to squabble upstairs . "
78066	78075	78076	78076	he	328	" Are you better , my dear fellow ? "
78079	78089	78076	78076	he	328	" You seemed rather out of sorts at dinner . "
78090	78106	78047	78047	society	1127	" I am quite well , Harry . I am tired . That is all . "
78107	78133	78076	78076	he	328	" You were charming last night . The little duchess is quite devoted to you . She tells me she is going down to Selby . "
78134	78144	78047	78047	society	1127	" She has promised to come on the twentieth . "
78145	78154	78076	78076	he	328	" Is Monmouth to be there , too ? "
78155	78162	78047	78047	society	1127	" Oh , yes , Harry . "
78163	78255	78076	78076	he	328	" He bores me dreadfully , almost as much as he bores her . She is very clever , too clever for a woman . She lacks the indefinable charm of weakness . It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image precious . Her feet are very pretty , but they are not feet of clay . White porcelain feet , if you like . They have been through the fire , and what fire does not destroy , it hardens . She has had experiences . "
78256	78264	78266	78266	Dorian	117	" How long has she been married ? "
78268	78310	78076	78076	he	328	" An eternity , she tells me . I believe , according to the peerage , it is ten years , but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity , with time thrown in . Who else is coming ? "
78311	78339	78076	78076	he	328	" Oh , the Willoughbys , Lord Rugby and his wife , our hostess , Geoffrey Clouston , the usual set . I have asked Lord Grotrian . "
78340	78345	78347	78348	Lord Henry	120	" I like him , "
78350	78386	78347	78348	Lord Henry	120	" A great many people don t , but I find him charming . He atones for being occasionally somewhat overdressed by being always absolutely over - educated . He is a very modern type . "
78387	78414	78467	78467	him	117	" I don t know if he will be able to come , Harry . He may have to go to Monte Carlo with his father . "
78415	78463	78347	78348	Lord Henry	120	" Ah ! what a nuisance people s people are ! Try and make him come . By the way , Dorian , you ran off very early last night . You left before eleven . What did you do afterwards ? Did you go straight home ? "
78472	78477	78478	78478	he	117	" No , Harry , "
78483	78493	78478	78478	he	117	" I did not get home till nearly three . "
78494	78502	78467	78467	him	117	" Did you go to the club ? "
78503	78506	78507	78507	he	117	" Yes , "
78516	78624	78511	78511	he	117	" No , I don t mean that . I didn t go to the club . I walked about . I forget what I did .... How inquisitive you are , Harry ! You always want to know what one has been doing . I always want to forget what I have been doing . I came in at half - past two , if you wish to know the exact time . I had left my latch - key at home , and my servant had to let me in . If you want any corroborative evidence on the subject , you can ask him . "
78631	78682	78625	78626	Lord Henry	120	" My dear fellow , as if I cared ! Let us go up to the drawing - room . No sherry , thank you , Mr. Chapman . Something has happened to you , Dorian . Tell me what it is . You are not yourself to - night . "
78683	78738	78628	78628	his	120	" Don t mind me , Harry . I am irritable , and out of temper . I shall come round and see you to - morrow , or next day . Make my excuses to Lady Narborough . I shan t go upstairs . I shall go home . I must go home . "
78739	78765	78812	78813	Lord Henry	120	" All right , Dorian . I dare say I shall see you to - morrow at tea - time . The duchess is coming . "
78766	78776	78777	78777	he	1589	" I will try to be there , Harry , "
79322	79330	79331	79331	he	2023	" It is too far for me , "
79334	79342	79344	79344	Dorian	117	" Here is a sovereign for you , "
79346	79356	79344	79344	Dorian	117	" You shall have another if you drive fast . "
79357	79363	79365	79366	the man	2023	" All right , sir , "
79368	79377	79365	79366	the man	2023	" you will be there in an hour , "
79515	79535	79501	79502	Lord Henry	120	" To cure the soul by means of the senses , and the senses by means of the soul . "
79673	79693	79635	79635	his	2023	" To cure the soul by means of the senses , and the senses by means of the soul ! "
80360	80371	80372	80372	he	2023	" Somewhere about here , sir , ain t it ? "
80385	80390	80391	80391	he	117	" This will do , "
80767	80778	80782	80782	them	1655	" He thinks he s got red ants on him , "
80884	80890	80892	80892	Dorian	117	" You here , Adrian ? "
80894	80901	80902	80902	he	117	" Where else should I be ? "
80907	80918	80902	80902	he	117	" None of the chaps will speak to me now . "
80919	80927	80853	80871	a young man with smooth yellow hair , who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe	1662	" I thought you had left England . "
80928	80958	80959	80959	he	117	" Darlington is not going to do anything . My brother paid the bill at last . George doesn t speak to me either .... I don t care , "
80965	80989	80959	80959	he	117	" As long as one has this stuff , one doesn t want friends . I think I have had too many friends . "
81130	81140	81141	81141	he	117	" I am going on to the other place , "
81147	81152	81141	81141	he	117	" On the wharf ? "
81153	81156	81141	81141	he	117	" Yes . "
81157	81178	81141	81141	he	117	" That mad - cat is sure to be there . They won t have her in this place now . "
81184	81210	81181	81181	his	117	" I am sick of women who love one . Women who hate one are much more interesting . Besides , the stuff is better . "
81211	81216	81141	81141	he	117	" Much the same . "
81217	81235	81181	81181	his	117	" I like it better . Come and have something to drink . I must have something . "
81236	81243	81245	81247	the young man	1396	" I don t want anything , "
81249	81253	81181	81181	his	117	" Never mind . "
81344	81353	81354	81354	she	1669	" We are very proud to - night , "
81357	81368	81370	81370	Dorian	117	" For God s sake don t talk to me , "
81379	81399	81370	81370	Dorian	117	" What do you want ? Money ? Here it is . Don t ever talk to me again . "
81445	81451	81453	81454	Adrian Singleton	211	" It s no use , "
81456	81476	81453	81454	Adrian Singleton	211	" I don t care to go back . What does it matter ? I am quite happy here . "
81477	81492	81494	81494	Dorian	117	" You will write to me if you want anything , won t you ? "
81500	81503	81453	81454	Adrian Singleton	211	" Perhaps . "
81504	81510	81453	81454	Adrian Singleton	211	" Good night , then . "
81511	81515	81517	81519	the young man	1396	" Good night , "
81572	81580	81581	81581	she	1674	" There goes the devil s bargain ! "
81589	81593	81594	81594	he	117	" Curse you ! "
81597	81604	81594	81594	he	117	" don t call me that . "
81610	81625	81626	81626	she	1674	" Prince Charming is what you like to be called , ain t it ? "
82114	82120	82121	82121	he	117	" What do you want ? "
82124	82128	82130	82131	the man	2023	" Keep quiet , "
82133	82142	82130	82131	the man	2023	" If you stir , I shoot you . "
82143	82155	82104	82110	a short , thick - set man	1694	" You are mad . What have I done to you ? "
82156	82165	82130	82131	the man	2023	" You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane , "
82170	82268	82130	82131	the man	2023	" and Sibyl Vane was my sister . She killed herself . I know it . Her death is at your door . I swore I would kill you in return . For years I have sought you . I had no clue , no trace . The two people who could have described you were dead . I knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you . I heard it to - night by chance . Make your peace with God , for to - night you are going to die . "
82276	82282	82283	82283	he	117	" I never knew her , "
82286	82297	82283	82283	he	117	" I never heard of her . You are mad . "
82298	82321	82346	82347	the man	2023	" You had better confess your sin , for as sure as I am James Vane , you are going to die . "
82338	82344	82346	82347	the man	2023	" Down on your knees ! "
82349	82387	82346	82347	the man	2023	" I give you one minute to make your peace no more . I go on board to - night for India , and I must do my job first . One minute . That s all . "
82417	82420	82421	82421	he	117	" Stop , "
82424	82440	82421	82421	he	117	" How long ago is it since your sister died ? Quick , tell me ! "
82441	82445	82447	82448	the man	2023	" Eighteen years , "
82450	82462	82447	82448	the man	2023	" Why do you ask me ? What do years matter ? "
82463	82467	82469	82470	Dorian Gray	117	" Eighteen years , "
82481	82496	82469	82470	Dorian Gray	117	" Eighteen years ! Set me under the lamp and look at my face ! "
82635	82642	82643	82643	he	117	" My God ! my God ! "
82646	82654	82643	82643	he	117	" and I would have murdered you ! "
82662	82678	82679	82679	he	117	" You have been on the brink of committing a terrible crime , my man , "
82687	82704	82679	82679	he	117	" Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own hands . "
82705	82711	82713	82714	James Vane	183	" Forgive me , sir , "
82716	82737	82713	82714	James Vane	183	" I was deceived . A chance word I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track . "
82738	82757	82759	82759	Dorian	117	" You had better go home and put that pistol away , or you may get into trouble , "
82848	82856	82857	82857	she	1707	" Why didn t you kill him ? "
82869	82906	82857	82857	she	1707	" I knew you were following him when you rushed out from Daly s. You fool ! You should have killed him . He has lots of money , and he s as bad as bad . "
82907	82918	82919	82919	he	183	" He is not the man I am looking for , "
82922	82972	82919	82919	he	183	" and I want no man s money . I want a man s life . The man whose life I want must be nearly forty now . This one is little more than a boy . Thank God , I have not got his blood upon my hands . "
82980	82987	82988	82988	she	770	" Little more than a boy ! "
82991	83011	82988	82988	she	770	" Why , man , it s nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me what I am . "
83012	83016	83018	83019	James Vane	183	" You lie ! "
83029	83038	83039	83039	she	770	" Before God I am telling the truth , "
83042	83046	82988	82988	she	770	" Before God ? "
83047	83104	83105	83105	she	770	" Strike me dumb if it ain t so . He is the worst one that comes here . They say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face . It s nigh on eighteen years since I met him . He hasn t changed much since then . I have , though , "
83113	83118	82988	82988	she	770	" You swear this ? "
83119	83124	83130	83130	her	770	" I swear it , "
83134	83144	83145	83145	she	770	" But don t give me away to him , "
83148	83166	83145	83145	she	770	" I am afraid of him . Let me have some money for my night s lodging . "
83398	83406	83408	83409	Lord Henry	120	" What are you two talking about ? "
83422	83444	83408	83409	Lord Henry	120	" I hope Dorian has told you about my plan for rechristening everything , Gladys . It is a delightful idea . "
83445	83457	83459	83460	the duchess	573	" But I don t want to be rechristened , Harry , "
83471	83493	83467	83467	her	573	" I am quite satisfied with my own name , and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his . "
83494	83656	83408	83409	Lord Henry	120	" My dear Gladys , I would not alter either name for the world . They are both perfect . I was thinking chiefly of flowers . Yesterday I cut an orchid , for my button - hole . It was a marvellous spotted thing , as effective as the seven deadly sins . In a thoughtless moment I asked one of the gardeners what it was called . He told me it was a fine specimen of _ Robinsoniana _ , or something dreadful of that kind . It is a sad truth , but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things . Names are everything . I never quarrel with actions . My one quarrel is with words . That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature . The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one . It is the only thing he is fit for . "
83657	83667	83668	83668	she	1727	" Then what should we call you , Harry ? "
83671	83678	83680	83680	Dorian	117	" His name is Prince Paradox , "
83682	83690	83692	83693	the duchess	573	" I recognize him in a flash , "
83695	83703	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" I won t hear of it , "
83713	83727	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" From a label there is no escape ! I refuse the title . "
83728	83734	83692	83693	the duchess	573	" Royalties may not abdicate , "
83743	83754	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" You wish me to defend my throne , then ? "
83755	83758	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Yes . "
83759	83769	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" I give the truths of to - morrow . "
83770	83780	83781	83781	she	1727	" I prefer the mistakes of to - day , "
83784	83791	83792	83792	he	120	" You disarm me , Gladys , "
83802	83814	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Of your shield , Harry , not of your spear . "
83815	83822	83823	83823	he	120	" I never tilt against beauty , "
83833	83851	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" That is your error , Harry , believe me . You value beauty far too much . "
83852	83904	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" How can you say that ? I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good . But on the other hand , no one is more ready than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly . "
83905	83917	83919	83920	the duchess	573	" Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins , then ? "
83922	83932	83919	83920	the duchess	573	" What becomes of your simile about the orchid ? "
83933	83975	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues , Gladys . You , as a good Tory , must not underrate them . Beer , the Bible , and the seven deadly virtues have made our England what she is . "
83976	83986	83987	83987	she	573	" You don t like your country , then ? "
83990	83996	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" I live in it . "
83997	84006	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" That you may censure it the better . "
84007	84020	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Would you have me take the verdict of Europe on it ? "
84024	84032	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" What do they say of us ? "
84033	84045	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" That Tartuffe has emigrated to England and opened a shop . "
84046	84053	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Is that yours , Harry ? "
84054	84061	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" I give it to you . "
84062	84074	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" I could not use it . It is too true . "
84075	84089	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" You need not be afraid . Our countrymen never recognize a description . "
84090	84095	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" They are practical . "
84096	84122	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" They are more cunning than practical . When they make up their ledger , they balance stupidity by wealth , and vice by hypocrisy . "
84123	84132	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Still , we have done great things . "
84133	84144	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Great things have been thrust on us , Gladys . "
84145	84152	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" We have carried their burden . "
84153	84162	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Only as far as the Stock Exchange . "
84168	84175	84176	84176	she	1731	" I believe in the race , "
84179	84188	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" It represents the survival of the pushing . "
84189	84194	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" It has development . "
84195	84201	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Decay fascinates me more . "
84202	84207	84208	84208	she	1731	" What of art ? "
84211	84217	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" It is a malady . "
84218	84221	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Love ? "
84222	84226	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" An illusion . "
84227	84230	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Religion ? "
84231	84238	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" The fashionable substitute for belief . "
84239	84245	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" You are a sceptic . "
84246	84256	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Never ! Scepticism is the beginning of faith . "
84257	84262	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" What are you ? "
84263	84270	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" To define is to limit . "
84271	84277	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Give me a clue . "
84278	84291	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Threads snap . You would lose your way in the labyrinth . "
84292	84305	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" You bewilder me . Let us talk of some one else . "
84306	84322	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Our host is a delightful topic . Years ago he was christened Prince Charming . "
84323	84333	84335	84336	Dorian Gray	117	" Ah ! don t remind me of that , "
84338	84347	84349	84350	the duchess	573	" Our host is rather horrid this evening , "
84354	84379	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" I believe he thinks that Monmouth married me on purely scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern butterfly . "
84380	84395	84397	84397	Dorian	117	" Well , I hope he won t stick pins into you , Duchess , "
84399	84418	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" Oh ! my maid does that already , Mr. Gray , when she is annoyed with me . "
84419	84432	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" And what does she get annoyed with you about , Duchess ? "
84433	84471	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" For the most trivial things , Mr. Gray , I assure you . Usually because I come in at ten minutes to nine and tell her that I must be dressed by half - past eight . "
84472	84484	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" How unreasonable of her ! You should give her warning . "
84485	84549	83705	83706	Lord Henry	120	" I daren t , Mr. Gray . Why , she invents hats for me . You remember the one I wore at Lady Hilstone s garden - party ? You don t , but it is nice of you to pretend that you do . Well , she made it out of nothing . All good hats are made out of nothing . "
84550	84558	84560	84561	Lord Henry	120	" Like all good reputations , Gladys , "
84563	84583	84560	84561	Lord Henry	120	" Every effect that one produces gives one an enemy . To be popular one must be a mediocrity . "
84584	84589	84591	84592	the duchess	573	" Not with women , "
84598	84643	84591	84592	the duchess	573	" and women rule the world . I assure you we can t bear mediocrities . We women , as some one says , love with our ears , just as you men love with your eyes , if you ever love at all . "
84644	84656	84658	84658	Dorian	117	" It seems to me that we never do anything else , "
84660	84673	84675	84676	the duchess	573	" Ah ! then , you never really love , Mr. Gray , "
84681	84686	84688	84689	Lord Henry	120	" My dear Gladys ! "
84691	84770	84688	84689	Lord Henry	120	" How can you say that ? Romance lives by repetition , and repetition converts an appetite into an art . Besides , each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved . Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion . It merely intensifies it . We can have in life but one great experience at best , and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible . "
84771	84783	84785	84786	the duchess	573	" Even when one has been wounded by it , Harry ? "
84791	84801	84803	84804	Lord Henry	120	" Especially when one has been wounded by it , "
84822	84833	84834	84834	she	573	" What do you say to that , Mr. Gray ? "
84852	84861	84844	84844	he	117	" I always agree with Harry , Duchess . "
84862	84869	84819	84819	her	573	" Even when he is wrong ? "
84870	84878	84844	84844	he	117	" Harry is never wrong , Duchess . "
84879	84888	84819	84819	her	573	" And does his philosophy make you happy ? "
84889	84907	84844	84844	he	117	" I have never searched for happiness . Who wants happiness ? I have searched for pleasure . "
84908	84916	84819	84819	her	573	" And found it , Mr. Gray ? "
84917	84923	84844	84844	he	117	" Often . Too often . "
84928	84935	84936	84936	she	573	" I am searching for peace , "
84939	84956	84936	84936	she	573	" and if I don t go and dress , I shall have none this evening . "
84957	84967	84969	84969	Dorian	117	" Let me get you some orchids , Duchess , "
84981	84989	84991	84992	Lord Henry	120	" You are flirting disgracefully with him , "
84997	85009	84991	84992	Lord Henry	120	" You had better take care . He is very fascinating . "
85010	85022	84936	84936	she	573	" If he were not , there would be no battle . "
85023	85030	84991	84992	Lord Henry	120	" Greek meets Greek , then ? "
85031	85047	84936	84936	she	573	" I am on the side of the Trojans . They fought for a woman . "
85048	85053	84991	84992	Lord Henry	120	" They were defeated . "
85054	85062	85063	85063	she	1740	" There are worse things than capture , "
85066	85074	85082	85085	the _ riposte _	1741	" You gallop with a loose rein . "
85075	85080	85082	85085	the _ riposte _	1741	" Pace gives life , "
85087	85099	85082	85085	the _ riposte _	1741	" I shall write it in my diary to - night . "
85100	85103	85082	85085	the _ riposte _	1741	" What ? "
85104	85113	85082	85085	the _ riposte _	1741	" That a burnt child loves the fire . "
85114	85126	85082	85085	the _ riposte _	1741	" I am not even singed . My wings are untouched . "
85127	85137	85082	85085	the _ riposte _	1741	" You use them for everything , except flight . "
85138	85155	85082	85085	the _ riposte _	1741	" Courage has passed from men to women . It is a new experience for us . "
85156	85162	85082	85085	the _ riposte _	1741	" You have a rival . "
85163	85166	85082	85085	the _ riposte _	1741	" Who ? "
85170	85174	85175	85175	he	1742	" Lady Narborough , "
85178	85184	85175	85175	he	1742	" She perfectly adores him . "
85185	85204	85249	85249	She	1743	" You fill me with apprehension . The appeal to antiquity is fatal to us who are romanticists . "
85205	85216	85175	85175	he	1742	" Romanticists ! You have all the methods of science . "
85217	85223	85249	85249	She	1743	" Men have educated us . "
85224	85230	85175	85175	he	1742	" But not explained you . "
85231	85238	85249	85249	She	1743	" Describe us as a sex , "
85243	85248	85252	85252	him	1742	" Sphinxes without secrets . "
85256	85263	85264	85264	she	1743	" How long Mr. Gray is ! "
85267	85287	85264	85264	she	1743	" Let us go and help him . I have not yet told him the colour of my frock . "
85288	85302	85175	85175	he	1742	" Ah ! you must suit your frock to his flowers , Gladys . "
85303	85311	85264	85264	she	1743	" That would be a premature surrender . "
85312	85320	85175	85175	he	1742	" Romantic art begins with its climax . "
85321	85330	85264	85264	she	1743	" I must keep an opportunity for retreat . "
85331	85337	85175	85175	he	1742	" In the Parthian manner ? "
85338	85352	85264	85264	she	1743	" They found safety in the desert . I could not do that . "
85353	85362	85175	85175	he	1742	" Women are not always allowed a choice , "
85473	85478	85479	85479	he	117	" What has happened ? "
85482	85495	85496	85496	He	117	" Oh ! I remember . Am I safe here , Harry ? "
85501	85506	85508	85509	Lord Henry	120	" My dear Dorian , "
85511	85541	85508	85509	Lord Henry	120	" you merely fainted . That was all . You must have overtired yourself . You had better not come down to dinner . I will take your place . "
85542	85550	85551	85551	he	117	" No , I will come down , "
85559	85572	85551	85551	he	117	" I would rather come down . I must not be alone . "
86476	86485	86486	86486	he	2023	" Have you had good sport , Geoffrey ? "
86489	86525	86463	86463	his	2023	" Not very good , Dorian . I think most of the birds have gone to the open . I dare say it will be better after lunch , when we get to new ground . "
86675	86687	86669	86669	he	332	" Don t shoot it , Geoffrey . Let it live . "
86688	86694	86696	86697	his companion	397	" What nonsense , Dorian ! "
86741	86751	86753	86754	Sir Geoffrey	332	" Good heavens ! I have hit a beater ! "
86756	86775	86776	86776	he	332	" What an ass the man was to get in front of the guns ! Stop shooting there ! "
86786	86792	86776	86776	he	332	" A man is hurt . "
86807	86816	86817	86817	he	1784	" Where , sir ? Where is he ? "
86832	86835	86837	86838	Sir Geoffrey	332	" Here , "
86846	86865	86837	86838	Sir Geoffrey	332	" Why on earth don t you keep your men back ? Spoiled my shooting for the day . "
87012	87015	87017	87018	Lord Henry	120	" Dorian , "
87020	87045	87017	87018	Lord Henry	120	" I had better tell them that the shooting is stopped for to - day . It would not look well to go on . "
87046	87057	87058	87058	he	117	" I wish it were stopped for ever , Harry , "
87062	87076	87058	87058	he	117	" The whole thing is hideous and cruel . Is the man ... ? "
87084	87090	87092	87093	Lord Henry	120	" I am afraid so , "
87095	87121	87092	87093	Lord Henry	120	" He got the whole charge of shot in his chest . He must have died almost instantaneously . Come ; let us go home . "
87154	87168	87141	87141	Dorian	117	" It is a bad omen , Harry , a very bad omen . "
87169	87173	87175	87176	Lord Henry	120	" What is ? "
87178	87272	87175	87176	Lord Henry	120	" Oh ! this accident , I suppose . My dear fellow , it can t be helped . It was the man s own fault . Why did he get in front of the guns ? Besides , it is nothing to us . It is rather awkward for Geoffrey , of course . It does not do to pepper beaters . It makes people think that one is a wild shot . And Geoffrey is not ; he shoots very straight . But there is no use talking about the matter . "
87278	87307	87308	87308	he	117	" It is a bad omen , Harry . I feel as if something horrible were going to happen to some of us . To myself , perhaps , "
87329	87457	87324	87326	The elder man	966	" The only horrible thing in the world is _ ennui _ , Dorian . That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness . But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner . I must tell them that the subject is to be tabooed . As for omens , there is no such thing as an omen . Destiny does not send us heralds . She is too wise or too cruel for that . Besides , what on earth could happen to you , Dorian ? You have everything in the world that a man can want . There is no one who would not be delighted to change places with you . "
87458	87552	87324	87326	The elder man	966	" There is no one with whom I would not change places , Harry . Don t laugh like that . I am telling you the truth . The wretched peasant who has just died is better off than I am . I have no terror of death . It is the coming of death that terrifies me . Its monstrous wings seem to wheel in the leaden air around me . Good heavens ! don t you see a man moving behind the trees there , watching me , waiting for me ? "
87568	87571	87572	87572	he	120	" Yes , "
87577	87631	87572	87572	he	120	" I see the gardener waiting for you . I suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the table to - night . How absurdly nervous you are , my dear fellow ! You must come and see my doctor , when we get back to town . "
87676	87687	87688	87688	he	2023	" Her Grace told me to wait for an answer , "
87699	87709	87710	87710	he	117	" Tell her Grace that I am coming in , "
87729	87739	87741	87742	Lord Henry	120	" How fond women are of doing dangerous things ! "
87744	87776	87741	87742	Lord Henry	120	" It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most . A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on . "
87777	87813	87715	87716	The man	2023	" How fond you are of saying dangerous things , Harry ! In the present instance , you are quite astray . I like the duchess very much , but I don t love her . "
87814	87835	87741	87742	Lord Henry	120	" And the duchess loves you very much , but she likes you less , so you are excellently matched . "
87836	87853	87715	87716	The man	2023	" You are talking scandal , Harry , and there is never any basis for scandal . "
87854	87865	87867	87868	Lord Henry	120	" The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty , "
87874	87889	87925	87925	his	117	" You would sacrifice anybody , Harry , for the sake of an epigram . "
87890	87902	87925	87925	his	117	" The world goes to the altar of its own accord , "
87907	87914	87916	87917	Dorian Gray	117	" I wish I could love , "
87928	88007	87916	87917	Dorian Gray	117	" But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the desire . I am too much concentrated on myself . My own personality has become a burden to me . I want to escape , to go away , to forget . It was silly of me to come down here at all . I think I shall send a wire to Harvey to have the yacht got ready . On a yacht one is safe . "
88008	88036	87925	87925	his	117	" Safe from what , Dorian ? You are in some trouble . Why not tell me what it is ? You know I would help you . "
88037	88046	88047	88047	he	1797	" I can t tell you , Harry , "
88051	88086	88047	88047	he	1797	" And I dare say it is only a fancy of mine . This unfortunate accident has upset me . I have a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me . "
88087	88091	87925	87925	his	117	" What nonsense ! "
88092	88132	88047	88047	he	1797	" I hope it is , but I can t help feeling it . Ah ! here is the duchess , looking like Artemis in a tailor - made gown . You see we have come back , Duchess . "
88133	88144	88145	88145	she	1798	" I have heard all about it , Mr. Gray , "
88148	88171	88145	88145	she	1798	" Poor Geoffrey is terribly upset . And it seems that you asked him not to shoot the hare . How curious ! "
88172	88222	88047	88047	he	1797	" Yes , it was very curious . I don t know what made me say it . Some whim , I suppose . It looked the loveliest of little live things . But I am sorry they told you about the man . It is a hideous subject . "
88223	88230	88233	88234	Lord Henry	120	" It is an annoying subject , "
88236	88275	88233	88234	Lord Henry	120	" It has no psychological value at all . Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on purpose , how interesting he would be ! I should like to know some one who had committed a real murder . "
88276	88284	88286	88287	the duchess	573	" How horrid of you , Harry ! "
88289	88311	88286	88287	the duchess	573	" Isn t it , Mr. Gray ? Harry , Mr. Gray is ill again . He is going to faint . "
88322	88329	88330	88330	he	1800	" It is nothing , Duchess , "
88333	88395	88330	88330	he	1800	" my nerves are dreadfully out of order . That is all . I am afraid I walked too far this morning . I didn t hear what Harry said . Was it very bad ? You must tell me some other time . I think I must go and lie down . You will excuse me , won t you ? "
88435	88445	88446	88446	he	120	" Are you very much in love with him ? "
88464	88470	88471	88471	she	573	" I wish I knew , "
88481	88501	88478	88478	his	120	" Knowledge would be fatal . It is the uncertainty that charms one . A mist makes things wonderful . "
88502	88510	88471	88471	she	573	" One may lose one s way . "
88511	88524	88478	88478	his	120	" All ways end at the same point , my dear Gladys . "
88525	88530	88471	88471	she	573	" What is that ? "
88531	88534	88478	88478	his	120	" Disillusion . "
88535	88546	88547	88547	she	573	" It was my _ d but _ in life , "
88550	88557	88478	88478	his	120	" It came to you crowned . "
88558	88566	88471	88471	she	573	" I am tired of strawberry leaves . "
88567	88572	88478	88478	his	120	" They become you . "
88573	88578	88471	88471	she	573	" Only in public . "
88579	88585	88587	88588	Lord Henry	120	" You would miss them , "
88590	88599	88471	88471	she	573	" I will not part with a petal . "
88600	88605	88471	88471	she	573	" Monmouth has ears . "
88606	88614	88471	88471	she	573	" Old age is dull of hearing . "
88615	88622	88471	88471	she	573	" Has he never been jealous ? "
88623	88630	88471	88471	she	573	" I wish he had been . "
88641	88648	88649	88649	she	573	" What are you looking for ? "
88652	88659	88660	88660	he	120	" The button from your foil , "
88663	88669	88660	88660	he	120	" You have dropped it . "
88673	88680	88670	88670	She	573	" I have still the mask . "
88681	88688	88690	88690	his	120	" It makes your eyes lovelier , "
88943	88948	88949	88949	he	1807	" Send him in , "
88979	88995	88996	88996	he	1807	" I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this morning , Thornton ? "
89004	89009	89011	89012	the gamekeeper	1821	" Yes , sir , "
89014	89029	89031	89031	Dorian	117	" Was the poor fellow married ? Had he any people dependent on him ? "
89036	89064	89031	89031	Dorian	117	" If so , I should not like them to be left in want , and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary . "
89065	89089	89011	89012	the gamekeeper	1821	" We don t know who he is , sir . That is what I took the liberty of coming to you about . "
89090	89098	89100	89100	Dorian	117	" Don t know who he is ? "
89104	89118	89100	89100	Dorian	117	" What do you mean ? Wasn t he one of your men ? "
89119	89136	89011	89012	the gamekeeper	1821	" No , sir . Never saw him before . Seems like a sailor , sir . "
89158	89162	89163	89163	he	117	" A sailor ? "
89167	89174	89163	89163	he	117	" Did you say a sailor ? "
89175	89203	89100	89100	Dorian	117	" Yes , sir . He looks as if he had been a sort of sailor ; tattooed on both arms , and that kind of thing . "
89204	89212	89214	89214	Dorian	117	" Was there anything found on him ? "
89227	89235	89214	89214	Dorian	117	" Anything that would tell his name ? "
89236	89278	89100	89100	Dorian	117	" Some money , sir not much , and a six - shooter . There was no name of any kind . A decent - looking man , sir , but rough - like . A sort of sailor we think . "
89298	89304	89305	89305	he	117	" Where is the body ? "
89308	89318	89305	89305	he	117	" Quick ! I must see it at once . "
89319	89356	89100	89100	Dorian	117	" It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm , sir . The folk don t like to have that sort of thing in their houses . They say a corpse brings bad luck . "
89357	89399	89305	89305	he	117	" The Home Farm ! Go there at once and meet me . Tell one of the grooms to bring my horse round . No . Never mind . I ll go to the stables myself . It will save time . "
89671	89685	89686	89686	he	117	" Take that thing off the face . I wish to see it , "
89767	89783	89785	89786	Lord Henry	120	" There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good , "
89803	89815	89789	89789	his	120	" You are quite perfect . Pray , don t change . "
89822	89854	89816	89817	Dorian Gray	117	" No , Harry , I have done too many dreadful things in my life . I am not going to do any more . I began my good actions yesterday . "
89855	89861	89789	89789	his	120	" Where were you yesterday ? "
89862	89879	89816	89817	Dorian Gray	117	" In the country , Harry . I was staying at a little inn by myself . "
89880	89885	89887	89888	Lord Henry	120	" My dear boy , "
89892	89973	89887	89888	Lord Henry	120	" anybody can be good in the country . There are no temptations there . That is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized . Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to . There are only two ways by which man can reach it . One is by being cultured , the other by being corrupt . Country people have no opportunity of being either , so they stagnate . "
89974	89979	89981	89981	Dorian	117	" Culture and corruption , "
89983	90026	89981	89981	Dorian	117	" I have known something of both . It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found together . For I have a new ideal , Harry . I am going to alter . I think I have altered . "
90027	90051	90053	90054	his companion	397	" You have not yet told me what your good action was . Or did you say you had done more than one ? "
90085	90272	89887	89888	Lord Henry	120	" I can tell you , Harry . It is not a story I could tell to any one else . I spared somebody . It sounds vain , but you understand what I mean . She was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane . I think it was that which first attracted me to her . You remember Sibyl , don t you ? How long ago that seems ! Well , Hetty was not one of our own class , of course . She was simply a girl in a village . But I really loved her . I am quite sure that I loved her . All during this wonderful May that we have been having , I used to run down and see her two or three times a week . Yesterday she met me in a little orchard . The apple - blossoms kept tumbling down on her hair , and she was laughing . We were to have gone away together this morning at dawn . Suddenly I determined to leave her as flowerlike as I had found her . "
90273	90294	90296	90297	Lord Henry	120	" I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill of real pleasure , Dorian , "
90299	90327	90296	90297	Lord Henry	120	" But I can finish your idyll for you . You gave her good advice and broke her heart . That was the beginning of your reformation . "
90328	90382	89887	89888	Lord Henry	120	" Harry , you are horrible ! You mustn t say these dreadful things . Hetty s heart is not broken . Of course , she cried and all that . But there is no disgrace upon her . She can live , like Perdita , in her garden of mint and marigold . "
90383	90391	90393	90394	Lord Henry	120	" And weep over a faithless Florizel , "
90406	90544	90399	90399	he	120	" My dear Dorian , you have the most curiously boyish moods . Do you think this girl will ever be really content now with any one of her own rank ? I suppose she will be married some day to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman . Well , the fact of having met you , and loved you , will teach her to despise her husband , and she will be wretched . From a moral point of view , I can not say that I think much of your great renunciation . Even as a beginning , it is poor . Besides , how do you know that Hetty isn t floating at the present moment in some starlit mill - pond , with lovely water - lilies round her , like Ophelia ? "
90545	90707	89887	89888	Lord Henry	120	" I can t bear this , Harry ! You mock at everything , and then suggest the most serious tragedies . I am sorry I told you now . I don t care what you say to me . I know I was right in acting as I did . Poor Hetty ! As I rode past the farm this morning , I saw her white face at the window , like a spray of jasmine . Don t let us talk about it any more , and don t try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years , the first little bit of self - sacrifice I have ever known , is really a sort of sin . I want to be better . I am going to be better . Tell me something about yourself . What is going on in town ? I have not been to the club for days . "
90708	90719	90399	90399	he	120	" The people are still discussing poor Basil s disappearance . "
90720	90735	90737	90737	Dorian	117	" I should have thought they had got tired of that by this time , "
90748	90918	90399	90399	he	120	" My dear boy , they have only been talking about it for six weeks , and the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having more than one topic every three months . They have been very fortunate lately , however . They have had my own divorce - case and Alan Campbell s suicide . Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist . Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor Basil , and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris at all . I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has been seen in San Francisco . It is an odd thing , but every one who disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco . It must be a delightful city , and possess all the attractions of the next world . "
90919	90929	90931	90931	Dorian	117	" What do you think has happened to Basil ? "
90954	91004	90399	90399	he	120	" I have not the slightest idea . If Basil chooses to hide himself , it is no business of mine . If he is dead , I don t want to think about him . Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me . I hate it . "
91005	91008	91010	91012	the younger man	1391	" Why ? "
91015	91018	91020	91021	Lord Henry	120	" Because , "
91036	91159	91020	91021	Lord Henry	120	" one can survive everything nowadays except that . Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one can not explain away . Let us have our coffee in the music - room , Dorian . You must play Chopin to me . The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely . Poor Victoria ! I was very fond of her . The house is rather lonely without her . Of course , married life is merely a habit , a bad habit . But then one regrets the loss even of one s worst habits . Perhaps one regrets them the most . They are such an essential part of one s personality . "
91217	91231	91205	91205	he	117	" Harry , did it ever occur to you that Basil was murdered ? "
91236	91333	91232	91233	Lord Henry	120	" Basil was very popular , and always wore a Waterbury watch . Why should he have been murdered ? He was not clever enough to have enemies . Of course , he had a wonderful genius for painting . But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible . Basil was really rather dull . He only interested me once , and that was when he told me , years ago , that he had a wild adoration for you and that you were the dominant motive of his art . "
91334	91342	91344	91344	Dorian	117	" I was very fond of Basil , "
91354	91365	91344	91344	Dorian	117	" But don t people say that he was murdered ? "
91366	91421	91232	91233	Lord Henry	120	" Oh , some of the papers do . It does not seem to me to be at all probable . I know there are dreadful places in Paris , but Basil was not the sort of man to have gone to them . He had no curiosity . It was his chief defect . "
91422	91440	91442	91444	the younger man	1391	" What would you say , Harry , if I told you that I had murdered Basil ? "
91455	91562	91232	91233	Lord Henry	120	" I would say , my dear fellow , that you were posing for a character that doesn t suit you . All crime is vulgar , just as all vulgarity is crime . It is not in you , Dorian , to commit a murder . I am sorry if I hurt your vanity by saying so , but I assure you it is true . Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders . I don t blame them in the smallest degree . I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us , simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations . "
91563	91599	91232	91233	Lord Henry	120	" A method of procuring sensations ? Do you think , then , that a man who has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again ? Don t tell me that . "
91600	91614	91616	91617	Lord Henry	120	" Oh ! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often , "
91621	91781	91616	91617	Lord Henry	120	" That is one of the most important secrets of life . I should fancy , however , that murder is always a mistake . One should never do anything that one can not talk about after dinner . But let us pass from poor Basil . I wish I could believe that he had come to such a really romantic end as you suggest , but I can t. I dare say he fell into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the scandal . Yes : I should fancy that was his end . I see him lying now on his back under those dull - green waters , with the heavy barges floating over him and long weeds catching in his hair . Do you know , I don t think he would have done much more good work . During the last ten years his painting had gone off very much . "
91856	91859	91860	91860	he	120	" Yes , "
91874	92077	91860	91860	he	120	" his painting had quite gone off . It seemed to me to have lost something . It had lost an ideal . When you and he ceased to be great friends , he ceased to be a great artist . What was it separated you ? I suppose he bored you . If so , he never forgave you . It s a habit bores have . By the way , what has become of that wonderful portrait he did of you ? I don t think I have ever seen it since he finished it . Oh ! I remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to Selby , and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way . You never got it back ? What a pity ! it was really a masterpiece . I remember I wanted to buy it . I wish I had now . It belonged to Basil s best period . Since then , his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative British artist . Did you advertise for it ? You should . "
92078	92082	92084	92084	Dorian	117	" I forget , "
92086	92144	92084	92084	Dorian	117	" I suppose I did . But I never really liked it . I am sorry I sat for it . The memory of the thing is hateful to me . Why do you talk of it ? It used to remind me of those curious lines in some play Hamlet , I think how do they run ?
92145	92159	91860	91860	he	120	" Like the painting of a sorrow , A face without a heart . "
92169	92169	91860	91860	he	120	"
92174	92188	92189	92189	he	120	" If a man treats life artistically , his brain is his heart , "
92213	92221	92222	92222	he	117	" Like the painting of a sorrow , "
92225	92232	92222	92222	he	117	" a face without a heart . "
92248	92255	92256	92256	he	117	" By the way , Dorian , "
92262	92287	92256	92256	he	117	" what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose how does the quotation run ? his own soul ? "
92302	92312	92293	92294	Dorian Gray	117	" Why do you ask me that , Harry ? "
92313	92318	92320	92321	Lord Henry	120	" My dear fellow , "
92329	92500	92320	92321	Lord Henry	120	" I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer . That is all . I was going through the park last Sunday , and close by the Marble Arch there stood a little crowd of shabby - looking people listening to some vulgar street - preacher . As I passed by , I heard the man yelling out that question to his audience . It struck me as being rather dramatic . London is very rich in curious effects of that kind . A wet Sunday , an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh , a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas , and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips it was really very good in its way , quite a suggestion . I thought of telling the prophet that art had a soul , but that man had not . I am afraid , however , he would not have understood me . "
92501	92549	92293	92294	Dorian Gray	117	" Don t , Harry . The soul is a terrible reality . It can be bought , and sold , and bartered away . It can be poisoned , or made perfect . There is a soul in each one of us . I know it . "
92550	92561	92320	92321	Lord Henry	120	" Do you feel quite sure of that , Dorian ? "
92562	92566	92293	92294	Dorian Gray	117	" Quite sure . "
92567	93093	92320	92321	Lord Henry	120	" Ah ! then it must be an illusion . The things one feels absolutely certain about are never true . That is the fatality of faith , and the lesson of romance . How grave you are ! Don t be so serious . What have you or I to do with the superstitions of our age ? No : we have given up our belief in the soul . Play me something . Play me a nocturne , Dorian , and , as you play , tell me , in a low voice , how you have kept your youth . You must have some secret . I am only ten years older than you are , and I am wrinkled , and worn , and yellow . You are really wonderful , Dorian . You have never looked more charming than you do to - night . You remind me of the day I saw you first . You were rather cheeky , very shy , and absolutely extraordinary . You have changed , of course , but not in appearance . I wish you would tell me your secret . To get back my youth I would do anything in the world , except take exercise , get up early , or be respectable . Youth ! There is nothing like it . It s absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth . The only people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much younger than myself . They seem in front of me . Life has revealed to them her latest wonder . As for the aged , I always contradict the aged . I do it on principle . If you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday , they solemnly give you the opinions current in 1820 , when people wore high stocks , believed in everything , and knew absolutely nothing . How lovely that thing you are playing is ! I wonder , did Chopin write it at Majorca , with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against the panes ? It is marvellously romantic . What a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that is not imitative ! Don t stop . I want music to - night . It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I am Marsyas listening to you . I have sorrows , Dorian , of my own , that even you know nothing of . The tragedy of old age is not that one is old , but that one is young . I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity . Ah , Dorian , how happy you are ! What an exquisite life you have had ! You have drunk deeply of everything . You have crushed the grapes against your palate . Nothing has been hidden from you . And it has all been to you no more than the sound of music . It has not marred you . You are still the same . "
93094	93103	92293	92294	Dorian Gray	117	" I am not the same , Harry . "
93104	93438	92320	92321	Lord Henry	120	" Yes , you are the same . I wonder what the rest of your life will be . Don t spoil it by renunciations . At present you are a perfect type . Don t make yourself incomplete . You are quite flawless now . You need not shake your head : you know you are . Besides , Dorian , don t deceive yourself . Life is not governed by will or intention . Life is a question of nerves , and fibres , and slowly built - up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams . You may fancy yourself safe and think yourself strong . But a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky , a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it , a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again , a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to play I tell you , Dorian , that it is on things like these that our lives depend . Browning writes about that somewhere ; but our own senses will imagine them for us . There are moments when the odour of _ lilas blanc _ passes suddenly across me , and I have to live the strangest month of my life over again . I wish I could change places with you , Dorian . The world has cried out against us both , but it has always worshipped you . It always will worship you . You are the type of what the age is searching for , and what it is afraid it has found . I am so glad that you have never done anything , never carved a statue , or painted a picture , or produced anything outside of yourself ! Life has been your art . You have set yourself to music . Your days are your sonnets . "
93453	93461	93462	93462	he	117	" Yes , life has been exquisite , "
93465	93519	93462	93462	he	117	" but I am not going to have the same life , Harry . And you must not say these extravagant things to me . You don t know everything about me . I think that if you did , even you would turn from me . You laugh . Don t laugh . "
93520	93653	93667	93667	his	117	" Why have you stopped playing , Dorian ? Go back and give me the nocturne over again . Look at that great , honey - coloured moon that hangs in the dusky air . She is waiting for you to charm her , and if you play she will come closer to the earth . You won t ? Let us go to the club , then . It has been a charming evening , and we must end it charmingly . There is some one at White s who wants immensely to know you young Lord Poole , Bournemouth s eldest son . He has already copied your neckties , and has begged me to introduce him to you . He is quite delightful and rather reminds me of you . "
93654	93659	93661	93661	Dorian	117	" I hope not , "
93670	93703	93661	93661	Dorian	117	" But I am tired to - night , Harry . I shan t go to the club . It is nearly eleven , and I want to go to bed early . "
93704	93742	93667	93667	his	117	" Do stay . You have never played so well as to - night . There was something in your touch that was wonderful . It had more expression than I had ever heard from it before . "
93743	93754	93755	93755	he	117	" It is because I am going to be good , "
93760	93768	93755	93755	he	117	" I am a little changed already . "
93769	93779	93781	93782	Lord Henry	120	" You can not change to me , Dorian , "
93784	93793	93781	93782	Lord Henry	120	" You and I will always be friends . "
93794	93829	93755	93755	he	117	" Yet you poisoned me with a book once . I should not forgive that . Harry , promise me that you will never lend that book to any one . It does harm . "
93830	94069	93781	93782	Lord Henry	120	" My dear boy , you are really beginning to moralize . You will soon be going about like the converted , and the revivalist , warning people against all the sins of which you have grown tired . You are much too delightful to do that . Besides , it is no use . You and I are what we are , and will be what we will be . As for being poisoned by a book , there is no such thing as that . Art has no influence upon action . It annihilates the desire to act . It is superbly sterile . The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame . That is all . But we won t discuss literature . Come round to - morrow . I am going to ride at eleven . We might go together , and I will take you to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome . She is a charming woman , and wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying . Mind you come . Or shall we lunch with our little duchess ? She says she never sees you now . Perhaps you are tired of Gladys ? I thought you would be . Her clever tongue gets on one s nerves . Well , in any case , be here at eleven . "
94070	94078	93755	93755	he	117	" Must I really come , Harry ? "
94079	94105	93781	93782	Lord Henry	120	" Certainly . The park is quite lovely now . I don t think there have been such lilacs since the year I met you . "
94106	94117	94119	94119	Dorian	117	" Very well . I shall be here at eleven , "
94121	94127	94119	94119	Dorian	117	" Good night , Harry . "
94215	94221	94207	94209	one of them	1845	" That is Dorian Gray . "
94606	94611	94625	94625	man	364	" Forgive us our sins "
94613	94619	94625	94625	man	364	" Smite us for our iniquities "
94732	94754	94711	94717	some one who had terribly loved him	1859	" The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold . The curves of your lips rewrite history . "
96140	96148	96150	96155	the elder of the two gentlemen	1884	" Whose house is that , Constable ? "
96157	96165	96167	96168	the policeman	1429	" Mr. Dorian Gray s , sir , "
