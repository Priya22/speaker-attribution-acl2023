7	17	19	20	Miss Bartlett	115	" The Signora had no business to do it , "
22	62	19	20	Miss Bartlett	115	" no business at all . She promised us south rooms with a view close together , instead of which here are north rooms , looking into a courtyard , and a long way apart . Oh , Lucy ! "
63	70	72	72	Lucy	116	" And a Cockney , besides ! "
86	92	93	93	She	116	" It might be London . "
179	220	315	315	she	116	" Charlotte , do n't you feel , too , that we might be in London ? I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside . I suppose it is one 's being so tired . "
221	231	233	234	Miss Bartlett	115	" This meat has surely been used for soup , "
241	284	315	315	she	116	" I want so to see the Arno . The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno . The Signora had no business to do it at all . Oh , it is a shame ! "
285	292	293	294	Miss Bartlett	115	" Any nook does for me , "
297	311	293	294	Miss Bartlett	115	" but it does seem hard that you should n't have a view . "
320	352	312	312	Lucy	116	" Charlotte , you must n't spoil me : of course , you must look over the Arno , too . I meant that . The first vacant room in the front-- "
353	359	361	362	Miss Bartlett	115	" You must have it , "
389	399	312	312	Lucy	116	" No , no . You must have it . "
400	415	361	362	Miss Bartlett	115	" I insist on it . Your mother would never forgive me , Lucy . "
416	423	312	312	Lucy	116	" She would never forgive me . "
497	508	494	494	He	305	" I have a view , I have a view . "
539	541	537	537	they	308	" do "
660	675	645	645	she	115	" A view ? Oh , a view ! How delightful a view is ! "
676	682	684	686	the old man	313	" This is my son , "
688	700	684	686	the old man	313	" his name 's George . He has a view too . "
701	704	706	707	Miss Bartlett	115	" Ah , "
718	723	724	724	he	309	" What I mean , "
727	746	724	724	he	309	" is that you can have our rooms , and we 'll have yours . We 'll change . "
781	795	772	772	her	115	" Thank you very much indeed ; that is out of the question . "
796	799	801	803	the old man	313	" Why ? "
812	825	772	772	her	115	" Because it is quite out of the question , thank you . "
826	836	838	838	Lucy	116	" You see , we do n't like to take-- "
846	850	851	851	he	309	" But why ? "
854	866	868	868	he	309	" Women like looking at a view ; men do n't . "
886	892	868	868	he	309	" George , persuade them ! "
893	904	906	907	the son	320	" It 's so obvious they should have the rooms , "
909	917	906	907	the son	320	" There 's nothing else to say . "
956	961	948	948	they	302	" quite a scene , "
1084	1091	1075	1075	She	115	" Are you all like this ? "
1121	1130	1075	1075	She	115	" We are not ; we are genteel . "
1131	1138	1139	1139	she	115	" Eat your dinner , dear , "
1168	1190	1193	1193	she	116	" Eat your dinner , dear . This pension is a failure . To - morrow we will make a change . "
1257	1292	1239	1239	Lucy	116	" Oh , oh ! Why , it 's Mr. Beebe ! Oh , how perfectly lovely ! Oh , Charlotte , we must stop now , however bad the rooms are . Oh ! "
1301	1343	1293	1294	Miss Bartlett	115	" How do you do , Mr. Beebe ? I expect that you have forgotten us : Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch , who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter 's that very cold Easter . "
1388	1397	1399	1400	the girl	332	" I AM so glad to see you , "
1427	1447	1399	1400	the girl	332	" Just fancy how small the world is . Summer Street , too , makes it so specially funny . "
1448	1459	1461	1462	Miss Bartlett	115	" Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street , "
1469	1488	1461	1462	Miss Bartlett	115	" and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living-- "
1489	1528	1399	1400	the girl	332	" Yes , I heard from mother so last week . She did n't know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells ; but I wrote back at once , and I said : ' Mr. Beebe is-- ' "
1529	1533	1535	1536	the clergyman	335	" Quite right , "
1538	1562	1535	1536	the clergyman	335	" I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June . I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood . "
1563	1580	1399	1400	the girl	332	" Oh , how glad I am ! The name of our house is Windy Corner . "
1585	1617	1399	1400	the girl	332	" There is mother and me generally , and my brother , though it 's not often we get him to ch---- The church is rather far off , I mean . "
1618	1630	1399	1400	the girl	332	" Lucy , dearest , let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner . "
1631	1644	1660	1661	Miss Bartlett	115	" I am eating it , thank you , and enjoying it . "
1709	1717	1702	1702	he	119	" Do n't neglect the country round , "
1722	1743	1718	1718	his	119	" The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole , and round by Settignano , or something of that sort . "
1744	1747	1702	1702	he	119	" No ! "
1758	1777	1702	1702	he	119	" Mr. Beebe , you are wrong . The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato . "
1778	1785	1787	1788	Miss Bartlett	115	" That lady looks so clever , "
1793	1799	1787	1788	Miss Bartlett	115	" We are in luck . "
1898	1934	1892	1894	the clever lady	347	" Prato ! They must go to Prato . That place is too sweetly squalid for words . I love it ; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability , as you know . "
2218	2226	2227	2227	she	115	" We are most grateful to you , "
2231	2252	2227	2227	she	115	" The first evening means so much . When you arrived we were in for a peculiarly mauvais quart d'heure . "
2258	2280	2227	2227	she	115	" Do you , by any chance , know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner ? "
2281	2284	2227	2227	she	115	" Emerson . "
2285	2293	2227	2227	she	115	" Is he a friend of yours ? "
2294	2305	2227	2227	she	115	" We are friendly -- as one is in pensions . "
2306	2314	2227	2227	she	115	" Then I will say no more . "
2326	2334	2335	2335	she	115	" I am , as it were , "
2338	2384	2335	2335	she	115	" the chaperon of my young cousin , Lucy , and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing . His manner was somewhat unfortunate . I hope I acted for the best . "
2385	2391	2393	2393	he	119	" You acted very naturally , "
2406	2423	2395	2395	He	119	" All the same , I do n't think much harm would have come of accepting . "
2424	2440	2322	2322	she	115	" No harm , of course . But we could not be under an obligation . "
2441	2449	2451	2451	he	119	" He is rather a peculiar man . "
2459	2549	2451	2451	he	119	" I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance , nor expect you to show gratitude . He has the merit -- if it is one -- of saying exactly what he means . He has rooms he does not value , and he thinks you would value them . He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite . It is so difficult -- at least , I find it difficult -- to understand people who speak the truth . "
2557	2577	2550	2550	Lucy	116	" I was hoping that he was nice ; I do so always hope that people will be nice . "
2578	2694	2322	2322	she	115	" I think he is ; nice and tiresome . I differ from him on almost every point of any importance , and so , I expect -- I may say I hope -- you will differ . But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores . When he first came here he not unnaturally put people 's backs up . He has no tact and no manners -- I do n't mean by that that he has bad manners -- and he will not keep his opinions to himself . We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora , but I am glad to say we thought better of it . "
2695	2701	2703	2704	Miss Bartlett	115	" Am I to conclude , "
2706	2713	2703	2704	Miss Bartlett	115	" that he is a Socialist ? "
2730	2746	2322	2322	she	115	" And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist , too ? "
2747	2801	2322	2322	she	115	" I hardly know George , for he has n't learnt to talk yet . He seems a nice creature , and I think he has brains . Of course , he has all his father 's mannerisms , and it is quite possible that he , too , may be a Socialist . "
2802	2809	2811	2812	Miss Bartlett	115	" Oh , you relieve me , "
2814	2837	2811	2812	Miss Bartlett	115	" So you think I ought to have accepted their offer ? You feel I have been narrow - minded and suspicious ? "
2838	2843	2844	2844	he	363	" Not at all , "
2847	2853	2844	2844	he	363	" I never suggested that . "
2854	2871	2811	2812	Miss Bartlett	115	" But ought I not to apologize , at all events , for my apparent rudeness ? "
2900	2906	2908	2909	Miss Bartlett	115	" Was I a bore ? "
2918	2963	2908	2909	Miss Bartlett	115	" Why did n't you talk , Lucy ? He prefers young people , I 'm sure . I do hope I have n't monopolized him . I hoped you would have him all the evening , as well as all dinner - time . "
2964	2969	2971	2971	Lucy	116	" He is nice , "
2973	2996	2971	2971	Lucy	116	" Just what I remember . He seems to see good in everyone . No one would take him for a clergyman . "
2997	3001	2908	2909	Miss Bartlett	115	" My dear Lucia-- "
3002	3028	2971	2971	Lucy	116	" Well , you know what I mean . And you know how clergymen generally laugh ; Mr. Beebe laughs just like an ordinary man . "
3029	3052	2908	2909	Miss Bartlett	115	" Funny girl ! How you do remind me of your mother . I wonder if she will approve of Mr. Beebe . "
3053	3065	2971	2971	Lucy	116	" I 'm sure she will ; and so will Freddy . "
3066	3098	2908	2909	Miss Bartlett	115	" I think everyone at Windy Corner will approve ; it is the fashionable world . I am used to Tunbridge Wells , where we are all hopelessly behind the times . "
3099	3102	3104	3104	Lucy	116	" Yes , "
3176	3189	3165	3166	Miss Bartlett	115	" I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion . "
3196	3221	3191	3192	the girl	332	" I must have been selfish or unkind ; I must be more careful . It is so dreadful for Charlotte , being poor . "
3393	3410	3375	3375	her	116	" But here you are as safe as in England . Signora Bertolini is so English . "
3411	3417	3420	3420	Lucy	116	" Yet our rooms smell , "
3422	3429	3420	3420	Lucy	116	" We dread going to bed . "
3430	3440	3441	3441	She	116	" Ah , then you look into the court . "
3444	3462	3441	3441	She	116	" If only Mr. Emerson was more tactful ! We were so sorry for you at dinner . "
3463	3473	3375	3375	her	116	" I think he was meaning to be kind . "
3474	3479	3481	3482	Miss Bartlett	115	" Undoubtedly he was , "
3484	3510	3375	3375	her	116	" Mr. Beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature . Of course , I was holding back on my cousin 's account . "
3511	3515	3517	3520	the little old lady	375	" Of course , "
3573	3617	3548	3550	a great fool	379	" About old Mr. Emerson -- I hardly know . No , he is not tactful ; yet , have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate , and yet at the same time -- beautiful ? "
3618	3621	3623	3624	Miss Bartlett	115	" Beautiful ? "
3631	3640	3623	3624	Miss Bartlett	115	" Are not beauty and delicacy the same ? "
3641	3648	3650	3652	the other helplessly	382	" So one would have thought , "
3654	3665	3650	3652	the other helplessly	382	" But things are so difficult , I sometimes think . "
3682	3686	3687	3687	he	119	" Miss Bartlett , "
3690	3746	3687	3687	he	119	" it 's all right about the rooms . I 'm so glad . Mr. Emerson was talking about it in the smoking - room , and knowing what I did , I encouraged him to make the offer again . He has let me come and ask you . He would be so pleased . "
3747	3752	3754	3754	Lucy	116	" Oh , Charlotte , "
3759	3781	3754	3754	Lucy	116	" we must have the rooms now . The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be . "
3787	3791	3793	3794	Mr. Beebe	119	" I fear , "
3800	3814	3793	3794	Mr. Beebe	119	" that I have been officious . I must apologize for my interference . "
3831	3923	3827	3828	Miss Bartlett	115	" My own wishes , dearest Lucy , are unimportant in comparison with yours . It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence , when I am only here through your kindness . If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms , I will do it . Would you then , Mr. Beebe , kindly tell Mr. Emerson that I accept his kind offer , and then conduct him to me , in order that I may thank him personally ? "
3967	3998	3950	3951	The clergyman	335	" Remember , Lucy , I alone am implicated in this . I do not wish the acceptance to come from you . Grant me that , at all events . "
4008	4021	3999	4000	Mr. Beebe	119	" Mr. Emerson is engaged , but here is his son instead . "
4045	4049	4050	4050	he	119	" My father , "
4053	4089	4050	4050	he	119	" is in his bath , so you can not thank him personally . But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out . "
4129	4134	4136	4137	Miss Bartlett	115	" Poor young man ! "
4146	4168	4192	4194	the two cousins	393	" How angry he is with his father about the rooms ! It is all he can do to keep polite . "
4169	4182	4184	4185	Mr. Beebe	119	" In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready , "
4210	4215	4217	4220	the little old lady	375	" Oh , dear ! "
4236	4242	4243	4243	Her	375	" Gentlemen sometimes do not realize-- "
4337	4359	4327	4328	Miss Bartlett	115	" I think one might venture now . No , Lucy , do not stir . I will superintend the move . "
4360	4367	4369	4369	Lucy	116	" How you do do everything , "
4371	4381	4327	4328	Miss Bartlett	115	" Naturally , dear . It is my affair . "
4382	4391	4327	4328	Miss Bartlett	115	" But I would like to help you . "
4392	4397	4327	4328	Miss Bartlett	115	" No , dear . "
4476	4482	4484	4485	Miss Bartlett	115	" I want to explain , "
4487	4536	4484	4485	Miss Bartlett	115	" why it is that I have taken the largest room . Naturally , of course , I should have given it to you ; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man , and I was sure your mother would not like it . "
4541	4605	4661	4661	she	116	" If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him . I am a woman of the world , in my small way , and I know where things lead to . However , Mr. Beebe is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this . "
4606	4615	4617	4617	Lucy	116	" Mother would n't mind I 'm sure , "
4789	4795	4796	4796	she	115	" What does it mean ? "
5485	5576	5479	5481	the clever lady	347	" If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you , I do assure you that you can neglect the good person . Being English , Miss Honeychurch will be perfectly safe . Italians understand . A dear friend of mine , Contessa Baroncelli , has two daughters , and when she can not send a maid to school with them , she lets them go in sailor - hats instead . Every one takes them for English , you see , especially if their hair is strained tightly behind . "
5636	5664	5606	5608	The clever lady	347	" I will take you by a dear dirty back way , Miss Honeychurch , and if you bring me luck , we shall have an adventure . "
5687	5740	5665	5665	Lucy	116	" Tut , tut ! Miss Lucy ! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker . He does but touch the surface of things . As to the true Italy -- he does not even dream of it . The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation . "
5899	5921	5896	5896	she	131	" A smell ! a true Florentine smell ! Every city , let me teach you , has its own smell . "
5922	5930	5932	5932	Lucy	116	" Is it a very nice smell ? "
5945	5955	5896	5896	she	131	" One does n't come to Italy for niceness , "
5960	5972	5896	5896	she	131	" one comes for life . Buon giorno ! Buon giorno ! "
5978	5999	5896	5896	she	131	" Look at that adorable wine - cart ! How the driver stares at us , dear , simple soul ! "
6068	6117	6396	6397	Miss Lavish	131	" Buon giorno ! Take the word of an old woman , Miss Lucy : you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors . That is the true democracy . Though I am a real Radical as well . There , now you 're shocked . "
6118	6125	6127	6127	Lucy	116	" Indeed , I 'm not ! "
6129	6156	6127	6127	Lucy	116	" We are Radicals , too , out and out . My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone , until he was so dreadful about Ireland . "
6157	6174	6396	6397	Miss Lavish	131	" I see , I see . And now you have gone over to the enemy . "
6175	6234	6127	6127	Lucy	116	" Oh , please-- ! If my father was alive , I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right . And as it is , the glass over our front door was broken last election , and Freddy is sure it was the Tories ; but mother says nonsense , a tramp . "
6235	6245	6396	6397	Miss Lavish	131	" Shameful ! A manufacturing district , I suppose ? "
6246	6265	6127	6127	Lucy	116	" No -- in the Surrey hills . About five miles from Dorking , looking over the Weald . "
6276	6311	6127	6127	Lucy	116	" What a delightful part ; I know it so well . It is full of the very nicest people . Do you know Sir Harry Otway -- a Radical if ever there was ? "
6312	6317	6127	6127	Lucy	116	" Very well indeed . "
6318	6326	6127	6127	Lucy	116	" And old Mrs. Butterworth the philanthropist ? "
6327	6340	6127	6127	Lucy	116	" Why , she rents a field of us ! How funny ! "
6354	6363	6341	6342	Miss Lavish	131	" Oh , you have property in Surrey ? "
6364	6368	6370	6370	Lucy	116	" Hardly any , "
6379	6395	6370	6370	Lucy	116	" Only thirty acres -- just the garden , all downhill , and some fields . "
6472	6488	6466	6466	she	131	" Bless us ! Bless us and save us ! We 've lost the way . "
6537	6591	6466	6466	she	131	" Lost ! lost ! My dear Miss Lucy , during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning . How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us ! What are we to do ? Two lone females in an unknown town . Now , this is what I call an adventure . "
6616	6662	6466	6466	she	131	" Oh , but that is the word of a craven ! And no , you are not , not , NOT to look at your Baedeker . Give it to me ; I sha n't let you carry it . We will simply drift . "
6917	6961	6904	6904	it	473	" Stop a minute ; let those two people go on , or I shall have to speak to them . I do detest conventional intercourse . Nasty ! they are going into the church , too . Oh , the Britisher abroad ! "
6962	6985	6904	6904	it	473	" We sat opposite them at dinner last night . They have given us their rooms . They were so very kind . "
6986	6992	6994	6995	Miss Lavish	131	" Look at their figures ! "
6997	7039	6994	6995	Miss Lavish	131	" They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows . It 's very naughty of me , but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover , and turn back every tourist who could n't pass it . "
7040	7047	6904	6904	it	473	" What would you ask us ? "
7109	7126	7095	7096	Miss Lavish	131	" There goes my local - colour box ! I must have a word with him ! "
7738	7742	7747	7749	old Mr. Emerson	118	" Hateful bishop ! "
7757	7795	7747	7749	old Mr. Emerson	118	" Hard in life , hard in death . Go out into the sunshine , little boy , and kiss your hand to the sun , for that is where you ought to be . Intolerable bishop ! "
7829	7834	7836	7837	Mr. Emerson	118	" Look at him ! "
7841	7866	7836	7837	Mr. Emerson	118	" Here 's a mess : a baby hurt , cold , and frightened ! But what else can you expect from a church ? "
7951	7958	7960	7961	Mr. Emerson	118	" You are a clever woman , "
7963	8004	7960	7961	Mr. Emerson	118	" You have done more than all the relics in the world . I am not of your creed , but I do believe in those who make their fellow - creatures happy . There is no scheme of the universe-- "
8011	8014	8016	8018	the Italian lady	512	" Niente , "
8026	8035	8037	8037	Lucy	116	" I 'm not sure she understands English , "
8084	8090	8092	8093	Mr. Emerson	118	" That woman understands everything , "
8097	8118	8092	8093	Mr. Emerson	118	" But what are you doing here ? Are you doing the church ? Are you through with the church ? "
8119	8122	8124	8124	Lucy	116	" No , "
8130	8173	8124	8124	Lucy	116	" I came here with Miss Lavish , who was to explain everything ; and just by the door -- it is too bad!--she simply ran away , and after waiting quite a time , I had to come in by myself . "
8174	8180	8182	8183	Mr. Emerson	118	" Why should n't you ? "
8185	8196	8198	8199	the son	320	" Yes , why should n't you come by yourself ? "
8210	8220	8124	8124	Lucy	116	" But Miss Lavish has even taken away Baedeker . "
8221	8224	8226	8227	Mr. Emerson	118	" Baedeker ? "
8229	8255	8226	8227	Mr. Emerson	118	" I 'm glad it 's THAT you minded . It 's worth minding , the loss of a Baedeker . THAT 'S worth minding . "
8279	8286	8288	8289	the son	320	" If you 've no Baedeker , "
8291	8298	8288	8289	the son	320	" you 'd better join us . "
8314	8379	8288	8289	the son	320	" Thank you very much , but I could not think of that . I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you . I really came to help with the child , and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night . I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience . "
8380	8384	8386	8388	the old man	313	" My dear , "
8391	8449	8386	8388	the old man	313	" I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say . You are pretending to be touchy ; but you are not really . Stop being so tiresome , and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see . To take you to it will be a real pleasure . "
8552	8581	8582	8583	The son	320	" I am not touchy , I hope . It is the Giottos that I want to see , if you will kindly tell me which they are . "
8667	8670	8671	8671	he	118	" Remember , "
8675	8763	8671	8671	he	118	" the facts about this church of Santa Croce ; how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism , before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared . Observe how Giotto in these frescoes -- now , unhappily , ruined by restoration -- is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective . Could anything be more majestic , more pathetic , beautiful , true ? How little , we feel , avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels ! "
8764	8767	8769	8770	Mr. Emerson	118	" No ! "
8781	8845	8769	8770	Mr. Emerson	118	" Remember nothing of the sort ! Built by faith indeed ! That simply means the workmen were n't paid properly . And as for the frescoes , I see no truth in them . Look at that fat man in blue ! He must weigh as much as I do , and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon . "
8854	8860	8846	8846	He	118	" Ascension of St. John . "
8922	8938	8898	8898	they	535	" Now , did this happen , or did n't it ? Yes or no ? "
8942	8991	8939	8939	George	118	" It happened like this , if it happened at all . I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs ; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it , just as they do here . "
8992	8999	9001	9002	his father	350	" You will never go up , "
9004	9035	9001	9002	his father	350	" You and I , dear boy , will lie at peace in the earth that bore us , and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives . "
9036	9071	9103	9104	a clergyman	2144	" Some of the people can only see the empty grave , not the saint , whoever he is , going up . It did happen like that , if it happened at all . "
9072	9076	9001	9002	his father	350	" Pardon me , "
9082	9099	9001	9002	his father	350	" The chapel is somewhat small for two parties . We will incommode you no longer . "
9160	9163	9165	9166	Mr. Emerson	118	" Stop ! "
9168	9180	9165	9166	Mr. Emerson	118	" There 's plenty of room for us all . Stop ! "
9206	9219	9189	9190	the lecturer	533	" George , I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate . "
9230	9240	9220	9220	George	118	" Perhaps he is . I do n't remember . "
9241	9297	9189	9190	the lecturer	533	" Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am . It 's that Mr. Eager . Why did he go ? Did we talk too loud ? How vexatious . I shall go and say we are sorry . Had n't I better ? Then perhaps he will come back . "
9298	9305	9307	9307	George	118	" He will not come back , "
9380	9390	9391	9391	he	118	" My father has that effect on nearly everyone , "
9395	9403	9391	9391	he	118	" He will try to be kind . "
9404	9411	9413	9413	she	116	" I hope we all try , "
9418	9451	9391	9391	he	118	" Because we think it improves our characters . But he is kind to people because he loves them ; and they find him out , and are offended , or frightened . "
9452	9458	9460	9460	Lucy	116	" How silly of them ! "
9469	9478	9466	9466	she	116	" I think that a kind action done tactfully-- "
9479	9482	9391	9391	he	118	" Tact ! "
9634	9639	9641	9642	his son	319	" Were you snubbed ? "
9645	9667	9641	9642	his son	319	" But we have spoilt the pleasure of I do n't know how many people . They wo n't come back . "
9668	9689	9641	9642	his son	319	" ... full of innate sympathy ... quickness to perceive good in others ... vision of the brotherhood of man ... "
9704	9712	9713	9713	he	118	" Do n't let us spoil yours , "
9718	9726	9713	9713	he	118	" Have you looked at those saints ? "
9727	9730	9732	9732	Lucy	116	" Yes , "
9734	9752	9732	9732	Lucy	116	" They are lovely . Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin ? "
9878	9887	9888	9888	he	118	" Why will he look at that fresco ? "
9892	9899	9888	9888	he	118	" I saw nothing in it . "
9900	9905	9906	9906	she	564	" I like Giotto , "
9909	9933	9906	9906	she	564	" It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values . Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better . "
9934	9969	9888	9888	he	118	" So you ought . A baby is worth a dozen saints . And my baby 's worth the whole of Paradise , and as far as I can see he lives in Hell . "
9979	9983	9984	9984	he	564	" In Hell , "
9987	9992	9984	9984	he	564	" He 's unhappy . "
9993	9998	10000	10000	Lucy	116	" Oh , dear ! "
10002	10069	10081	10085	a very foolish old man	566	" How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive ? What more is one to give him ? And think how he has been brought up -- free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God . With such an education as that , I thought he was bound to grow up happy . "
10120	10129	10130	10130	he	566	" What are we to do with him ? "
10133	10175	10130	10130	he	566	" He comes out for his holiday to Italy , and behaves -- like that ; like the little child who ought to have been playing , and who hurt himself upon the tombstone . Eh ? What did you say ? "
10186	10335	10183	10183	he	566	" Now do n't be stupid over this . I do n't require you to fall in love with my boy , but I do think you might try and understand him . You are nearer his age , and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible . You might help me . He has known so few women , and you have the time . You stop here several weeks , I suppose ? But let yourself go . You are inclined to get muddled , if I may judge from last night . Let yourself go . Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand , and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them . By understanding George you may learn to understand yourself . It will be good for both of you . "
10345	10363	10440	10440	he	570	" I only know what it is that 's wrong with him ; not why it is . "
10364	10370	10372	10372	Lucy	116	" And what is it ? "
10380	10390	10440	10440	he	570	" The old trouble ; things wo n't fit . "
10391	10395	10440	10440	he	570	" What things ? "
10396	10412	10440	10440	he	570	" The things of the universe . It is quite true . They do n't . "
10413	10424	10440	10440	he	570	" Oh , Mr. Emerson , whatever do you mean ? "
10443	10473	10440	10440	he	570	" ' From far , from eve and morning , And yon twelve - winded sky , The stuff of life to knit me Blew hither : here am I '
10552	10552	10543	10543	I	0	"
10557	10593	10543	10543	I	0	" Then make my boy think like us . Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes -- a transitory Yes if you like , but a Yes . "
10631	10637	10638	10638	she	116	" I 'm very sorry , "
10641	10651	10653	10653	she	116	" You 'll think me unfeeling , but -- but-- "
10657	10716	10653	10653	she	116	" Oh , but your son wants employment . Has he no particular hobby ? Why , I myself have worries , but I can generally forget them at the piano ; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother . Perhaps Italy bores him ; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes . "
10828	10832	10825	10825	He	118	" Miss Bartlett . "
10833	10840	10842	10842	Lucy	116	" Oh , good gracious me ! "
10858	10863	10842	10842	Lucy	116	" Where ? Where ? "
10864	10869	10825	10825	He	118	" In the nave . "
10870	10881	10882	10882	She	116	" I see . Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have-- "
10886	10890	10892	10893	Mr. Emerson	150	" Poor girl ! "
10895	10899	10892	10893	Mr. Emerson	150	" Poor girl ! "
10917	11016	10892	10893	Mr. Emerson	150	" Poor girl ? I fail to understand the point of that remark . I think myself a very fortunate girl , I assure you . I 'm thoroughly happy , and having a splendid time . Pray do n't waste time mourning over me . There 's enough sorrow in the world , is n't there , without trying to invent it . Good - bye . Thank you both so much for all your kindness . Ah , yes ! there does come my cousin . A delightful morning ! Santa Croce is a wonderful church . "
11032	11034	10892	10893	Mr. Emerson	150	" S "
11564	11572	11574	11575	Mr. Beebe	119	" Miss Honeychurch . Piano . Beethoven , "
11714	11719	11720	11720	he	119	" Who is she ? "
11726	11774	11720	11720	he	119	" Cousin of one of my parishioners . I do not consider her choice of a piece happy . Beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that , which , if anything , disturbs . "
11775	11779	11839	11856	a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty , pale , undeveloped face	611	" Introduce me . "
11780	11799	11720	11720	he	119	" She will be delighted . She and Miss Bartlett are full of the praises of your sermon . "
11800	11804	11806	11807	Mr. Beebe	119	" My sermon ? "
11809	11818	11806	11807	Mr. Beebe	119	" Why ever did she listen to it ? "
11922	11946	11911	11911	she	116	" If Miss Honeychurch ever takes to live as she plays , it will be very exciting both for us and for her . "
11956	11985	11911	11911	she	116	" Oh , what a funny thing ! Some one said just the same to mother , and she said she trusted I should never live a duet . "
11986	11994	11911	11911	she	116	" Does n't Mrs. Honeychurch like music ? "
11995	12072	11911	11911	she	116	" She does n't mind it . But she does n't like one to get excited over anything ; she thinks I am silly about it . She thinks -- I ca n't make out . Once , you know , I said that I liked my own playing better than any one 's . She has never got over it . Of course , I did n't mean that I played well ; I only meant-- "
12073	12077	12079	12079	he	614	" Of course , "
12088	12090	12092	12092	Lucy	116	" Music-- "
12186	12191	12193	12194	Mr. Beebe	119	" What about music ? "
12196	12203	12205	12205	Lucy	116	" Poor Charlotte will be sopped , "
12295	12317	12267	12267	she	115	" Miss Lavish has led your cousin astray . She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe . "
12318	12325	12327	12327	Lucy	116	" Miss Lavish is so original , "
12384	12389	12391	12391	Lucy	116	" Is it true , "
12398	12407	12391	12391	Lucy	116	" that Miss Lavish is writing a book ? "
12408	12414	12391	12391	Lucy	116	" They do say so . "
12415	12421	12391	12391	Lucy	116	" What is it about ? "
12422	12429	12431	12432	Mr. Beebe	119	" It will be a novel , "
12434	12464	12431	12432	Mr. Beebe	119	" dealing with modern Italy . Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine Alan , who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know . "
12465	12523	12391	12391	Lucy	116	" I wish Miss Lavish would tell me herself . We started such friends . But I do n't think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce . Charlotte was most annoyed at finding me practically alone , and so I could n't help being a little annoyed with Miss Lavish . "
12524	12538	12547	12547	women	2099	" The two ladies , at all events , have made it up . "
12780	12824	12766	12768	Miss Catharine Alan	146	" Oh , dear Miss Honeychurch , you will catch a chill ! And Mr. Beebe here besides . Who would suppose this is Italy ? There is my sister actually nursing the hot - water can ; no comforts or proper provisions . "
12856	12906	12837	12837	she	116	" I could hear your beautiful playing , Miss Honeychurch , though I was in my room with the door shut . Doors shut ; indeed , most necessary . No one has the least idea of privacy in this country . And one person catches it from another . "
12940	12947	12948	12948	He	119	" Fa niente , sono vecchia . "
12954	13103	12948	12948	He	119	" I quite agree with you , Miss Alan . The Italians are a most unpleasant people . They pry everywhere , they see everything , and they know what we want before we know it ourselves . We are at their mercy . They read our thoughts , they foretell our desires . From the cab - driver down to -- to Giotto , they turn us inside out , and I resent it . Yet in their heart of hearts they are -- how superficial ! They have no conception of the intellectual life . How right is Signora Bertolini , who exclaimed to me the other day : ' Ho , Mr. Beebe , if you knew what I suffer over the children 's edjucaishion . HI wo n't ' ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what ca n't explain nothink ! ' "
13216	13219	13198	13198	she	146	" E. L. "
13220	13226	13228	13229	the clergyman	335	" That belongs to Lavish . "
13231	13247	13228	13229	the clergyman	335	" A good fellow , Lavish , but I wish she 'd start a pipe . "
13248	13254	13256	13257	Miss Alan	146	" Oh , Mr. Beebe , "
13265	13315	13256	13257	Miss Alan	146	" Indeed , though it is dreadful for her to smoke , it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose . She took to it , practically in despair , after her life 's work was carried away in a landslip . Surely that makes it more excusable . "
13316	13321	13323	13323	Lucy	116	" What was that ? "
13338	13589	13332	13333	Miss Alan	146	" It was a novel -- and I am afraid , from what I can gather , not a very nice novel . It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them , and I must say they nearly always do . Anyhow , she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink . She said : ' Can I have a little ink , please ? ' But you know what Italians are , and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach , and the saddest thing of all is that she can not remember what she has written . The poor thing was very ill after it , and so got tempted into cigarettes . It is a great secret , but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel . She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour -- this novel is to be about modern Italy ; the other was historical -- but that she could not start till she had an idea . First she tried Perugia for an inspiration , then she came here -- this must on no account get round . And so cheerful through it all ! I can not help thinking that there is something to admire in everyone , even if you do not approve of them . "
13647	13675	13632	13632	she	146	" All the same , she is a little too -- I hardly like to say unwomanly , but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived . "
13702	13741	13689	13689	she	146	" I do n't know , Miss Honeychurch , if you have noticed that Miss Pole , the lady who has so much yellow hair , takes lemonade . That old Mr. Emerson , who puts things very strangely-- "
13776	14212	13767	13767	she	146	" Stomach . He warned Miss Pole of her stomach - acidity , he called it -- and he may have meant to be kind . I must say I forgot myself and laughed ; it was so sudden . As Teresa truly said , it was no laughing matter . But the point is that Miss Lavish was positively ATTRACTED by his mentioning S. , and said she liked plain speaking , and meeting different grades of thought . She thought they were commercial travellers--'drummers ' was the word she used -- and all through dinner she tried to prove that England , our great and beloved country , rests on nothing but commerce . Teresa was very much annoyed , and left the table before the cheese , saying as she did so : ' There , Miss Lavish , is one who can confute you better than I , ' and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson . Then Miss Lavish said : ' Tut ! The early Victorians . ' Just imagine ! ' Tut ! The early Victorians . ' My sister had gone , and I felt bound to speak . I said : ' Miss Lavish , I am an early Victorian ; at least , that is to say , I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen . ' It was horrible speaking . I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go , and I must say she was dumbfounded , and made no reply . But , unluckily , Mr. Emerson overheard this part , and called in his deep voice : ' Quite so , quite so ! I honour the woman for her Irish visit . ' The woman ! I tell things so badly ; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time , all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place . But that was not all . After dinner Miss Lavish actually came up and said : ' Miss Alan , I am going into the smoking - room to talk to those two nice men . Come , too . ' Needless to say , I refused such an unsuitable invitation , and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas , and said that she had four brothers , all University men , except one who was in the army , who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers . "
14213	14220	14222	14223	Mr. Beebe	119	" Let me finish the story , "
14229	14274	13767	13767	she	146	" Miss Lavish tried Miss Pole , myself , everyone , and finally said : ' I shall go alone . ' She went . At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board , and began playing patience . "
14275	14279	14281	14281	Lucy	116	" Whatever happened ? "
14283	14312	13767	13767	she	146	" No one knows . No one will ever know . Miss Lavish will never dare to tell , and Mr. Emerson does not think it worth telling . "
14313	14335	13767	13767	she	146	" Mr. Beebe -- old Mr. Emerson , is he nice or not nice ? I do so want to know . "
14350	14385	13767	13767	she	146	" No ; but it is so difficult . Sometimes he is so silly , and then I do not mind him . Miss Alan , what do you think ? Is he nice ? "
14412	14435	14398	14399	Mr. Beebe	119	" I consider that you are bound to class him as nice , Miss Alan , after that business of the violets . "
14436	14514	14398	14399	Mr. Beebe	119	" Violets ? Oh , dear ! Who told you about the violets ? How do things get round ? A pension is a bad place for gossips . No , I can not forget how they behaved at Mr. Eager 's lecture at Santa Croce . Oh , poor Miss Honeychurch ! It really was too bad . No , I have quite changed . I do NOT like the Emersons . They are not nice . "
14742	14758	14760	14762	the little lady	656	" But are n't they always waylaying you to go out with them , dear ? "
14765	14785	14730	14730	them	143	" Only once . Charlotte did n't like it , and said something -- quite politely , of course . "
14786	14805	14760	14762	the little lady	656	" Most right of her . They do n't understand our ways . They must find their level . "
14963	14970	14972	14973	Miss Alan	146	" Too late to go out , "
14980	14987	14972	14973	Miss Alan	146	" All the galleries are shut . "
14988	14996	14998	14998	Lucy	116	" I think I shall go out , "
15000	15020	14998	14998	Lucy	116	" I want to go round the town in the circular tram -- on the platform by the driver . "
15046	15075	15027	15028	Mr. Beebe	119	" I wish we could . Unluckily I have letters . If you do want to go out alone , wo n't you be better on your feet ? "
15076	15084	15086	15087	Miss Alan	146	" Italians , dear , you know , "
15089	15102	15027	15028	Mr. Beebe	119	" Perhaps I shall meet someone who reads me through and through ! "
15139	15149	15151	15152	Mr. Beebe	119	" She ought n't really to go at all , "
15162	15177	15151	15152	Mr. Beebe	119	" and she knows it . I put it down to too much Beethoven . "
15673	15678	15679	15679	Venus	161	" Birth of Venus . "
15718	15721	15716	15716	Giorgione	162	" Tempesta , "
15723	15726	15716	15716	Giorgione	162	" Idolino , "

15829	15833	15834	15834	she	116	" The world , "
15837	15853	15834	15834	she	116	" is certainly full of beautiful things , if only I could come across them . "
15879	15886	15887	15887	she	116	" Nothing ever happens to me , "
16124	16128	16129	16129	they	706	" Cinque lire , "
16133	16137	16129	16129	they	706	" cinque lire ! "
16301	16309	16298	16298	She	116	" Oh , what have I done ? "
16310	16318	16319	16319	she	116	" Oh , what have I done ? "
16394	16402	16391	16391	She	116	" Oh , what have I done ? "
16403	16407	16433	16433	she	116	" You fainted . "
16408	16416	16391	16391	She	116	" I -- I am very sorry . "
16417	16423	16433	16433	she	116	" How are you now ? "
16424	16431	16433	16433	she	116	" Perfectly well -- absolutely well . "
16440	16455	16433	16433	she	116	" Then let us come home . There 's no point in our stopping . "
16499	16528	16529	16529	His	701	" How very kind you have been ! I might have hurt myself falling . But now I am well . I can go alone , thank you . "
16535	16541	16542	16542	she	116	" Oh , my photographs ! "
16546	16550	16529	16529	His	701	" What photographs ? "
16551	16571	16572	16572	She	116	" I bought some photographs at Alinari 's . I must have dropped them out there in the square . "
16578	16589	16572	16572	She	116	" Would you add to your kindness by fetching them ? "
16622	16626	16611	16612	a maniac	718	" Miss Honeychurch ! "
16636	16650	16611	16612	a maniac	718	" You sit still ; you are n't fit to go home alone . "
16651	16663	16627	16627	She	116	" Yes , I am , thank you so very much . "
16664	16679	16611	16612	a maniac	718	" No , you are n't . You 'd go openly if you were . "
16680	16685	16627	16627	She	116	" But I had rather-- "
16686	16695	16611	16612	a maniac	718	" Then I do n't fetch your photographs . "
16696	16703	16627	16627	She	116	" I had rather be alone . "
16708	16727	16704	16704	He	720	" The man is dead -- the man is probably dead ; sit down till you are rested . "
16736	16746	16728	16728	She	116	" And do n't move till I come back . "
16803	16809	16817	16819	the dying man	723	" Oh , what have I done?"--the
16915	16971	16905	16906	a cabman	725	" And the murderer tried to kiss him , you say -- how very odd Italians are!--and gave himself up to the police ! Mr. Beebe was saying that Italians know everything , but I think they are rather childish . When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday -- What was that ? "
16980	16987	16905	16906	a cabman	725	" What did you throw in ? "
16988	16995	16996	16996	he	725	" Things I did n't want , "
17000	17004	16905	16906	a cabman	725	" Mr. Emerson ! "
17005	17008	16905	16906	a cabman	725	" Well ? "
17009	17015	16905	16906	a cabman	725	" Where are the photographs ? "
17020	17032	16905	16906	a cabman	725	" I believe it was my photographs that you threw away . "
17033	17044	17045	17045	he	725	" I did n't know what to do with them , "
17068	17102	17103	17103	He	725	" They were covered with blood . There ! I 'm glad I 've told you ; and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them . "
17109	17114	17103	17103	He	725	" They 've gone . "
17122	17161	17163	17164	the boy	733	" I did mind them so , and one is so foolish , it seemed better that they should go out to the sea -- I do n't know ; I may just mean that they frightened me . "
17170	17195	17163	17164	the boy	733	" For something tremendous has happened ; I must face it without getting muddled . It is n't exactly that a man has died . "
17205	17210	17211	17211	he	725	" It has happened , "
17214	17225	17211	17211	he	725	" and I mean to find out what it is . "
17226	17229	17200	17200	she	116	" Mr. Emerson-- "
17247	17259	17238	17238	she	116	" I want to ask you something before we go in . "
17316	17322	17309	17309	She	116	" I have behaved ridiculously . "
17330	17352	17309	17309	She	116	" I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life ; I can not think what came over me . "
17353	17359	17360	17360	he	725	" I nearly fainted myself , "
17372	17382	17309	17309	She	116	" Well , I owe you a thousand apologies . "
17383	17389	17309	17309	She	116	" Oh , all right . "
17390	17420	17309	17309	She	116	" And -- this is the real point -- you know how silly people are gossiping -- ladies especially , I am afraid -- you understand what I mean ? "
17421	17429	17309	17309	She	116	" I 'm afraid I do n't . "
17430	17447	17309	17309	She	116	" I mean , would you not mention it to any one , my foolish behaviour ? "
17448	17462	17309	17309	She	116	" Your behaviour ? Oh , yes , all right -- all right . "
17463	17472	17309	17309	She	116	" Thank you so much . And would you-- "
17586	17590	17594	17594	he	740	" And would you-- "
17684	17692	17693	17693	she	116	" Well , thank you so much , "
17696	17713	17693	17693	she	116	" How quickly these accidents do happen , and then one returns to the old life ! "
17714	17719	17725	17725	him	740	" I do n't . "
17732	17740	17727	17727	His	740	" I shall probably want to live . "
17741	17753	17799	17800	a family	747	" But why , Mr. Emerson ? What do you mean ? "
17754	17764	17727	17727	His	740	" I shall want to live , I say . "
17803	17814	17815	17815	She	116	" you never knew which way Charlotte Bartlett would turn . "
17963	17968	17970	17970	he	119	" Too much Beethoven . "
18130	18135	18137	18138	the girl	332	" No , Charlotte ! "
18144	18166	18137	18138	the girl	332	" It 's very kind of Mr. Beebe , but I am certainly coming with you . I had much rather . "
18167	18173	18175	18176	Miss Bartlett	115	" Very well , dear , "
18281	18296	18272	18272	She	115	" How I do wish Freddy and your mother could see this , too ! "
18313	18340	18377	18377	she	116	" Look , Lucia ! Oh , you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party . I feared you would repent you of your choice . "
18549	18557	18559	18560	Miss Bartlett	115	" Oh , let me congratulate you ! "
18562	18574	18559	18560	Miss Bartlett	115	" After your despair of yesterday ! What a fortunate thing ! "
18575	18605	18606	18606	Lucy	116	" Aha ! Miss Honeychurch , come you here I am in luck . Now , you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning . "
18615	18623	18559	18560	Miss Bartlett	115	" But perhaps you would rather not ? "
18624	18643	18606	18606	Lucy	116	" I 'm sorry -- if you could manage without it , I think I would rather not . "
18664	18672	18674	18675	Miss Lavish	131	" It is I who am sorry , "
18676	18700	18674	18675	Miss Lavish	131	" literary hacks are shameless creatures . I believe there 's no secret of the human heart into which we would n't pry . "
18795	18803	18805	18806	Miss Bartlett	115	" What is the heroine 's name ? "
18808	18811	18813	18814	Miss Lavish	131	" Leonora , "
18822	18830	18967	18968	Miss Bartlett	115	" I do hope she 's nice . "
18838	18845	18967	18968	Miss Bartlett	115	" And what is the plot ? "
18874	18887	18888	18889	Miss Lavish	131	" I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this , "
18892	18957	18888	18889	Miss Lavish	131	" It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people . Of course , this is the barest outline . There will be a deal of local colouring , descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood , and I shall also introduce some humorous characters . And let me give you all fair warning : I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist . "
18958	18965	18967	18968	Miss Bartlett	115	" Oh , you wicked woman , "
18970	18981	18967	18968	Miss Bartlett	115	" I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons . "
18989	19061	18982	18983	Miss Lavish	131	" I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen . It is the neglected Italians who attract me , and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can . For I repeat and I insist , and I have always held most strongly , that a tragedy such as yesterday 's is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life . "
19090	19101	19103	19104	Miss Bartlett	115	" She is my idea of a really clever woman , "
19106	19125	19103	19104	Miss Bartlett	115	" That last remark struck me as so particularly true . It should be a most pathetic novel . "
19164	19180	19182	19183	Miss Bartlett	115	" She is emancipated , but only in the very best sense of the word , "
19186	19243	19182	19183	Miss Bartlett	115	" None but the superficial would be shocked at her . We had a long talk yesterday . She believes in justice and truth and human interest . She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman -- Mr. Eager ! Why , how nice ! What a pleasant surprise ! "
19244	19251	19253	19254	the chaplain	779	" Ah , not for me , "
19257	19273	19253	19254	the chaplain	779	" for I have been watching you and Miss Honeychurch for quite a little time . "
19274	19282	19182	19183	Miss Bartlett	115	" We were chatting to Miss Lavish . "
19287	19302	19182	19183	Miss Bartlett	115	" So I saw . Were you indeed ? Andate via ! sono occupato ! "
19322	19451	19182	19183	Miss Bartlett	115	" I am about to venture a suggestion . Would you and Miss Honeychurch be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week -- a drive in the hills ? We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano . There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour 's ramble on the hillside . The view thence of Florence is most beautiful -- far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole . It is the view that Alessio Baldovinetti is fond of introducing into his pictures . That man had a decided feeling for landscape . Decidedly . But who looks at it to - day ? Ah , the world is too much for us . "
19752	19761	19763	19764	the chaplain	779	" So we shall be a partie carree , "
19766	19810	19763	19764	the chaplain	779	" In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity . Andate via ! andate presto , presto ! Ah , the town ! Beautiful as it is , it is the town . "
19814	19854	19763	19764	the chaplain	779	" This very square -- so I am told -- witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies . To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration -- portentous and humiliating . "
19855	19859	19861	19862	Miss Bartlett	115	" Humiliating indeed , "
19864	19885	19886	19886	She	115	" Miss Honeychurch happened to be passing through as it happened . She can hardly bear to speak of it . "
19892	19902	19904	19905	the chaplain	779	" And how came we to have you here ? "
19919	19940	19908	19909	Miss Bartlett	115	" Do not blame her , please , Mr. Eager . The fault is mine : I left her unchaperoned . "
19941	19951	19952	19952	His	779	" So you were here alone , Miss Honeychurch ? "
19987	19990	19952	19952	His	779	" Practically . "
19991	20002	20004	20005	Miss Bartlett	115	" One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home , "
20015	20046	19952	19952	His	779	" For her also it must have been a terrible experience . I trust that neither of you was at all -- that it was not in your immediate proximity ? "
20086	20096	20098	20098	her	116	" He died by the fountain , I believe , "
20101	20107	20172	20175	the vendor of photographs	800	" And you and your friend-- "
20108	20115	20172	20175	the vendor of photographs	800	" Were over at the Loggia . "
20116	20170	20172	20175	the vendor of photographs	800	" That must have saved you much . You have not , of course , seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press -- This man is a public nuisance ; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well , and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views . "
20221	20227	20229	20230	the chaplain	779	" This is too much ! "
20267	20272	20274	20275	Miss Bartlett	115	" Willingly would I purchase-- "
20277	20281	20283	20284	Mr. Eager	148	" Ignore him , "
20628	20672	20605	20605	she	115	" The son of a labourer ; I happen to know it for a fact . A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young ; then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press . I came across him at Brixton . "
20680	20689	20691	20692	Miss Bartlett	115	" How wonderfully people rise in these days ! "
20704	20707	20709	20710	Mr. Eager	148	" Generally , "
20712	20766	20709	20710	Mr. Eager	148	" one has only sympathy for their success . The desire for education and for social advance -- in these things there is something not wholly vile . There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence -- little as they would make of it . "
20767	20774	20775	20776	Miss Bartlett	115	" Is he a journalist now ? "
20779	20790	20709	20710	Mr. Eager	148	" He is not ; he made an advantageous marriage . "
20808	20817	20791	20791	He	148	" Oh , so he has a wife . "
20818	20892	20791	20791	He	148	" Dead , Miss Bartlett , dead . I wonder -- yes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face , to dare to claim acquaintance with me . He was in my London parish long ago . The other day in Santa Croce , when he was with Miss Honeychurch , I snubbed him . Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub . "
20893	20896	20898	20898	Lucy	116	" What ? "
20902	20905	20907	20908	Mr. Eager	148	" Exposure ! "
20966	20971	20972	20972	she	116	" Do you mean , "
20975	20988	20972	20972	she	116	" that he is an irreligious man ? We know that already . "
20989	20993	20995	20996	Miss Bartlett	115	" Lucy , dear-- "
21005	21043	20960	20960	them	143	" I should be astonished if you knew all . The boy -- an innocent child at the time -- I will exclude . God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him . "
21044	21047	21049	21050	Miss Bartlett	115	" Perhaps , "
21052	21063	21049	21050	Miss Bartlett	115	" it is something that we had better not hear . "
21064	21069	21071	21072	Mr. Eager	148	" To speak plainly , "
21074	21084	21071	21072	Mr. Eager	148	" it is . I will say no more . "
21106	21113	21071	21072	Mr. Eager	148	" You have said very little . "
21114	21124	21126	21126	his	148	" It was my intention to say very little , "
21180	21189	21190	21190	he	148	" Murder , if you want to know , "
21194	21201	21190	21190	he	148	" That man murdered his wife ! "
21202	21205	21206	21206	she	332	" How ? "
21209	21232	21190	21190	he	148	" To all intents and purposes he murdered her . That day in Santa Croce -- did they say anything against me ? "
21233	21246	21190	21190	he	148	" Not a word , Mr. Eager -- not a single word . "
21247	21275	21190	21190	he	148	" Oh , I thought they had been libelling me to you . But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them . "
21276	21283	21285	21285	Lucy	116	" I 'm not defending them , "
21299	21306	21285	21285	Lucy	116	" They 're nothing to me . "
21307	21317	21319	21320	Miss Bartlett	115	" How could you think she was defending them ? "
21335	21355	21285	21285	Lucy	116	" She will find it difficult . For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God . "
21406	21412	21414	21414	he	779	" I must be going , "
21442	21454	21425	21426	Miss Bartlett	115	" Drive ? Oh , is our drive to come off ? "
21475	21480	21482	21483	the girl	332	" Bother the drive ! "
21492	21534	21482	21483	the girl	332	" It is just the drive we had arranged with Mr. Beebe without any fuss at all . Why should he invite us in that absurd manner ? We might as well invite him . We are each paying for ourselves . "
21556	21599	21482	21483	the girl	332	" If that is so , dear -- if the drive we and Mr. Beebe are going with Mr. Eager is really the same as the one we are going with Mr. Beebe , then I foresee a sad kettle of fish . "
21600	21603	21482	21483	the girl	332	" How ? "
21604	21617	21482	21483	the girl	332	" Because Mr. Beebe has asked Eleanor Lavish to come , too . "
21618	21625	21482	21483	the girl	332	" That will mean another carriage . "
21626	21655	21482	21483	the girl	332	" Far worse . Mr. Eager does not like Eleanor . She knows it herself . The truth must be told ; she is too unconventional for him . "
21816	21823	21832	21832	she	116	" where things might lead to , "
21902	21997	21899	21899	she	116	" Whether it is Mr. Beebe who forgot to tell Mr. Eager , or Mr. Eager who forgot when he told us , or whether they have decided to leave Eleanor out altogether -- which they could scarcely do -- but in any case we must be prepared . It is you they really want ; I am only asked for appearances . You shall go with the two gentlemen , and I and Eleanor will follow behind . A one - horse carriage would do for us . Yet how difficult it is ! "
21998	22003	22005	22006	the girl	332	" It is indeed , "
22015	22023	22025	22026	Miss Bartlett	115	" What do you think about it ? "
22039	22053	21899	21899	she	116	" I do n't know what I think , nor what I want . "
22054	22094	22133	22134	her mother	450	" Oh , dear , Lucy ! I do hope Florence is n't boring you . Speak the word , and , as you know , I would take you to the ends of the earth to - morrow . "
22095	22101	22103	22103	Lucy	116	" Thank you , Charlotte , "
22280	22285	22287	22288	Miss Bartlett	115	" And the news ? "
22290	22301	22303	22303	Lucy	116	" Mrs. Vyse and her son have gone to Rome , "
22313	22320	22303	22303	Lucy	116	" Do you know the Vyses ? "
22321	22341	22256	22256	her	116	" Oh , not that way back . We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria . "
22342	22371	22303	22303	Lucy	116	" They 're nice people , the Vyses . So clever -- my idea of what 's really clever . Do n't you long to be in Rome ? "
22372	22378	22256	22256	her	116	" I die for it ! "
22510	22513	22515	22516	the girl	332	" Charlotte ! "
22519	22575	22515	22516	the girl	332	" Here 's an idea . What if we popped off to Rome to - morrow -- straight to the Vyses ' hotel ? For I do know what I want . I 'm sick of Florence . No , you said you 'd go to the ends of the earth ! Do ! Do ! "
22585	22604	22576	22577	Miss Bartlett	115	" Oh , you droll person ! Pray , what would become of your drive in the hills ? "
23375	23391	23338	23339	two clergymen	887	" So , Miss Honeychurch , you are travelling ? As a student of art ? "
23392	23404	23338	23339	two clergymen	887	" Oh , dear me , no -- oh , no ! "
23405	23414	23416	23417	Miss Lavish	131	" Perhaps as a student of human nature , "
23419	23423	23416	23417	Miss Lavish	131	" like myself ? "
23424	23436	23338	23339	two clergymen	887	" Oh , no . I am here as a tourist . "
23437	23442	23444	23445	Mr. Eager	148	" Oh , indeed , "
23447	23596	23444	23445	Mr. Eager	148	" Are you indeed ? If you will not think me rude , we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little -- handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence , from Florence to Rome , living herded together in pensions or hotels , quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker , their one anxiety to get ' done ' or ' through ' and go on somewhere else . The result is , they mix up towns , rivers , palaces in one inextricable whirl . You know the American girl in Punch who says : ' Say , poppa , what did we see at Rome ? ' And the father replies : ' Why , guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog . ' There 's travelling for you . Ha ! ha ! ha ! "
23597	23602	23604	23605	Miss Lavish	131	" I quite agree , "
23618	23636	23604	23605	Miss Lavish	131	" The narrowness and superficiality of the Anglo - Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace . "
23637	23778	23807	23808	Mr. Eager	148	" Quite so . Now , the English colony at Florence , Miss Honeychurch -- and it is of considerable size , though , of course , not all equally -- a few are here for trade , for example . But the greater part are students . Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico . I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left . No , you can only see it if you stand -- no , do not stand ; you will fall . She is very proud of that thick hedge . Inside , perfect seclusion . One might have gone back six hundred years . Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron , which lends it an additional interest , does it not ? "
23779	23784	23786	23787	Miss Lavish	131	" It does indeed ! "
23789	23805	23786	23787	Miss Lavish	131	" Tell me , where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day ? "
23842	23938	23833	23835	the Somebody Elses	893	" Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of ' Mediaeval Byways ' ? He is working at Gemistus Pletho . Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear , over the wall , the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot , dusty , unintelligent tourists who are going to ' do ' Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there , and I think -- think -- I think how little they think what lies so near them . "
24009	24014	24016	24017	Mr. Eager	148	" Piano ! piano ! "
24027	24039	24041	24042	the driver	2196	" Va bene , signore , va bene , va bene , "
24120	24125	24127	24127	he	166	" Piano ! piano ! "
24210	24216	24218	24218	he	166	" She is my sister , "
24316	24325	24326	24326	she	131	" Most certainly I would let them be , "
24329	24362	24326	24326	she	131	" But I dare say I shall receive scant support . I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life . This is what I call an adventure . "
24363	24369	24371	24372	Mr. Eager	148	" We must not submit , "
24374	24398	24371	24372	Mr. Eager	148	" I knew he was trying it on . He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook 's tourists . "
24399	24403	24405	24406	Miss Lavish	131	" Surely no ! "
24441	24446	24447	24448	Mr. Emerson	118	" Leave them alone , "
24461	24510	24455	24455	he	118	" Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there ? To be driven by lovers -- A king might envy us , and if we part them it 's more like sacrilege than anything I know . "
24625	24628	24630	24631	the man	2384	" Signorina ! "
24648	24651	24653	24653	Persephone	181	" Signorina ! "
24687	24692	24694	24695	Mr. Eager	148	" Victory at last ! "
24707	24713	24715	24716	Mr. Emerson	118	" It is not victory , "
24718	24732	24715	24716	Mr. Emerson	118	" It is defeat . You have parted two people who were happy . "
24788	24823	24780	24780	he	313	" We have tried to buy what can not be bought with money . He has bargained to drive us , and he is doing it . We have no rights over his soul . "
24846	24854	24855	24855	she	131	" He was not driving us well , "
24858	24863	24855	24855	she	131	" He jolted us . "
24864	24936	24843	24843	his	924	" That I deny . It was as restful as sleeping . Aha ! he is jolting us now . Can you wonder ? He would like to throw us out , and most certainly he is justified . And if I were superstitious I 'd be frightened of the girl , too . It does n't do to injure young people . Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici ? "
24941	24975	24843	24843	his	924	" Most certainly I have . Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico , or to Lorenzo , Duke of Urbino , or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature ? "
24976	25019	24843	24843	his	924	" The Lord knows . Possibly he does know , for I refer to Lorenzo the poet . He wrote a line -- so I heard yesterday -- which runs like this : ' Do n't go fighting against the Spring . ' "
25030	25037	25038	25038	he	148	" Non fate guerra al Maggio , "
25041	25055	25038	25038	he	148	" ' War not with the May ' would render a correct meaning . "
25056	25069	25070	25070	He	148	" The point is , we have warred with it . Look . "
25089	25145	25070	25070	He	148	" Fifty miles of Spring , and we 've come up to admire them . Do you suppose there 's any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man ? But there we go , praising the one and condemning the other as improper , ashamed that the same laws work eternally through both . "
25508	25512	25505	25505	he	118	" the railway . "
25570	25574	25576	25577	Miss Lavish	131	" The railway ! "
25579	25594	25576	25577	Miss Lavish	131	" Oh , but I shall die ! Of course it was the railway ! "
25602	25619	25595	25595	She	115	" He is the image of a porter -- on , on the South - Eastern . "
25620	25626	25629	25631	her vivacious companion	953	" Eleanor , be quiet , "
25633	25642	25629	25631	her vivacious companion	953	" Hush ! They 'll hear -- the Emersons-- "
25643	25658	25595	25595	She	115	" I ca n't stop . Let me go my wicked way . A porter-- "
25659	25662	25629	25631	her vivacious companion	953	" Eleanor ! "
25663	25672	25675	25675	Lucy	116	" I 'm sure it 's all right , "
25677	25693	25675	25675	Lucy	116	" The Emersons wo n't hear , and they would n't mind if they did . "
25703	25708	25709	25709	she	131	" Miss Honeychurch listening ! "
25714	25726	25709	25709	she	131	" Pouf ! Wouf ! You naughty girl ! Go away ! "
25727	25744	25629	25631	her vivacious companion	953	" Oh , Lucy , you ought to be with Mr. Eager , I 'm sure . "
25745	25761	25709	25709	she	131	" I ca n't find them now , and I do n't want to either . "
25762	25774	25629	25631	her vivacious companion	953	" Mr. Eager will be offended . It is your party . "
25775	25786	25709	25709	she	131	" Please , I 'd rather stop here with you . "
25787	25793	25795	25796	Miss Lavish	131	" No , I agree , "
25798	25835	25795	25796	Miss Lavish	131	" It 's like a school feast ; the boys have got separated from the girls . Miss Lucy , you are to go . We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear . "
25904	25910	25912	25913	Miss Bartlett	115	" How tired one gets , "
25915	25929	25912	25913	Miss Bartlett	115	" Oh , I do wish Freddy and your mother could be here . "
25963	25969	25971	25972	Miss Lavish	131	" Then sit you down , "
25974	25979	25971	25972	Miss Lavish	131	" Observe my foresight . "
26019	26075	26076	26076	She	131	" Lucy ; without a moment 's doubt , Lucy . The ground will do for me . Really I have not had rheumatism for years . If I do feel it coming on I shall stand . Imagine your mother 's feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen . "
26087	26129	26130	26130	She	131	" Here we are , all settled delightfully . Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much , being brown . Sit down , dear ; you are too unselfish ; you do n't assert yourself enough . "
26135	26173	26130	26130	She	131	" Now do n't be alarmed ; this is n't a cold . It 's the tiniest cough , and I have had it three days . It 's nothing to do with sitting here at all . "
26257	26260	26262	26262	Lucy	116	" Dove ? "
26338	26340	26359	26361	those noble beings	965	" clergyman "
26342	26347	26349	26349	she	116	" Dove buoni uomini ? "
26369	26376	26378	26378	her	116	" Uno -- piu -- piccolo , "
26383	26403	26378	26378	her	116	" Has the cigar been given to you by Mr. Beebe , the smaller of the two good men ? "
26582	26590	26563	26563	His	961	" would she like to see them ? "
26591	26596	26606	26607	violets afterwards	974	" Ma buoni uomini . "
26689	26694	26717	26717	his	961	" What is that ? "
26766	26769	26770	26770	he	961	" Eccolo ! "
26819	26822	26824	26825	her companion	985	" Courage ! "
26834	26839	26824	26825	her companion	985	" Courage and love . "
27030	27037	27016	27016	she	116	" Lucy ! Lucy ! Lucy ! "
27279	27285	27286	27286	he	119	" Let us go immediately , "
27290	27296	27286	27286	he	119	" The signorino will walk . "
27297	27307	27309	27310	Mr. Beebe	119	" All the way ? He will be hours , "
27312	27322	27323	27323	He	119	" Apparently . I told him it was unwise . "
27636	27691	27630	27631	Mr. Eager	148	" Courage , Miss Honeychurch , courage and faith . If I might say so , there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements . Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds , all this immense electrical display , is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me ? "
27692	27697	27630	27631	Mr. Eager	148	" No -- of course-- "
27698	27754	27630	27631	Mr. Eager	148	" Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous . The steel knives , the only articles which might attract the current , are in the other carriage . And , in any case , we are infinitely safer than if we were walking . Courage -- courage and faith . "
27840	27844	27846	27847	Mr. Beebe	119	" Mr. Eager ! "
27849	27861	27846	27847	Mr. Beebe	119	" We want your assistance . Will you interpret for us ? "
27862	27865	27867	27868	Mr. Emerson	118	" George ! "
27870	27891	27867	27868	Mr. Emerson	118	" Ask your driver which way George went . The boy may lose his way . He may be killed . "
27892	27898	27900	27901	Miss Bartlett	115	" Go , Mr. Eager , "
27903	27928	27900	27901	Miss Bartlett	115	" do n't ask our driver ; our driver is no help . Go and support poor Mr. Beebe-- , he is nearly demented . "
27929	27935	27937	27939	the old man	313	" He may be killed ! "
27941	27947	27937	27939	the old man	313	" He may be killed ! "
27948	27952	27954	27955	the chaplain	779	" Typical behaviour , "
27963	27977	27954	27955	the chaplain	779	" In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down . "
27978	27984	27986	27986	Lucy	116	" What does he know ? "
27994	28004	27986	27986	Lucy	116	" Charlotte , how much does Mr. Eager know ? "
28005	28015	28016	28016	she	116	" Nothing , dearest ; he knows nothing . But-- "
28020	28033	28019	28020	the driver-"HE	2546	driver-"HE knows everything . Dearest , had we better ? Shall I ? "
28040	28058	28059	28060	Tapping Phaethon	180	" It is dreadful to be entangled with low - class people . He saw it all . "
28072	28075	28069	28069	she	116	" Silenzio ! "
28082	28086	28087	28087	he	1024	" Va bene , "
28302	28337	28297	28297	hers	116	" Charlotte , dear Charlotte , kiss me . Kiss me again . Only you can understand me . You warned me to be careful . And I -- I thought I was developing . "
28338	28349	28297	28297	hers	116	" Do not cry , dearest . Take your time . "
28350	28388	28297	28297	hers	116	" I have been obstinate and silly -- worse than you know , far worse . Once by the river -- Oh , but he is n't killed -- he would n't be killed , would he ? "
28427	28439	28297	28297	hers	116	" I trust not . One would always pray against that . "
28440	28530	28297	28297	hers	116	" He is really -- I think he was taken by surprise , just as I was before . But this time I 'm not to blame ; I want you to believe that . I simply slipped into those violets . No , I want to be really truthful . I am a little to blame . I had silly thoughts . The sky , you know , was gold , and the ground all blue , and for a moment he looked like someone in a book . "
28531	28536	28297	28297	hers	116	" In a book ? "
28537	28547	28297	28297	hers	116	" Heroes -- gods -- the nonsense of schoolgirls . "
28548	28552	28297	28297	hers	116	" And then ? "
28553	28564	28297	28297	hers	116	" But , Charlotte , you know what happened then . "
28612	28619	28620	28620	she	116	" I want to be truthful , "
28623	28633	28620	28620	she	116	" It is so hard to be absolutely truthful . "
28634	28661	28678	28679	the girl	332	" Do n't be troubled , dearest . Wait till you are calmer . We will talk it over before bed - time in my room . "
28810	28814	28816	28816	she	116	" At last , "
28818	28846	28816	28816	she	116	" I shall understand myself . I sha n't again be troubled by things that come out of nothing , and mean I do n't know what . "
28955	28985	28938	28939	Miss Bartlett	115	" Well , dear , I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire . Come into my room , and I will give a good brush to your hair . "
29007	29015	29004	29005	Miss Bartlett	115	" So what is to be done ? "
29051	29069	29046	29046	she	116	" What is to be done ? A point , dearest , which you alone can settle . "
29161	29171	29172	29172	she	116	" It has been raining for nearly four hours , "
29183	29192	29172	29172	she	116	" How do you propose to silence him ? "
29193	29197	29172	29172	she	116	" The driver ? "
29198	29209	29172	29172	she	116	" My dear girl , no ; Mr. George Emerson . "
29220	29226	29227	29227	she	116	" I do n't understand , "
29247	29259	29172	29172	she	116	" How are you going to stop him talking about it ? "
29260	29275	29172	29172	she	116	" I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do . "
29276	29304	29172	29172	she	116	" I , too , intend to judge him charitably . But unfortunately I have met the type before . They seldom keep their exploits to themselves . "
29305	29308	29310	29310	Lucy	116	" Exploits ? "
29318	29374	29172	29172	she	116	" My poor dear , did you suppose that this was his first ? Come here and listen to me . I am only gathering it from his own remarks . Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with Miss Alan that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another ? "
29375	29378	29380	29380	Lucy	116	" Yes , "
29391	29451	29172	29172	she	116	" Well , I am no prude . There is no need to call him a wicked young man , but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined . Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education , if you wish . But we are no farther on with our question . What do you propose to do ? "
29480	29488	29490	29490	she	116	" I propose to speak to him , "
29501	29531	29679	29679	her	116	" You see , Charlotte , your kindness -- I shall never forget it . But -- as you said -- it is my affair . Mine and his . "
29532	29548	29679	29679	her	116	" And you are going to IMPLORE him , to BEG him to keep silence ? "
29549	29591	29679	29679	her	116	" Certainly not . There would be no difficulty . Whatever you ask him he answers , yes or no ; then it is over . I have been frightened of him . But now I am not one little bit . "
29592	29665	29679	29679	her	116	" But we fear him for you , dear . You are so young and inexperienced , you have lived among such nice people , that you can not realize what men can be -- how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round . This afternoon , for example , if I had not arrived , what would have happened ? "
29666	29672	29674	29674	Lucy	116	" I ca n't think , "
29693	29704	29679	29679	her	116	" What would have happened if I had n't arrived ? "
29705	29711	29713	29713	Lucy	116	" I ca n't think , "
29716	29728	29679	29679	her	116	" When he insulted you , how would you have replied ? "
29729	29740	29679	29679	her	116	" I had n't time to think . You came . "
29741	29757	29679	29679	her	116	" Yes , but wo n't you tell me now what you would have done ? "
29758	29762	29763	29763	She	116	" I should have-- "
29798	29807	29809	29810	Miss Bartlett	115	" Come away from the window , dear , "
29812	29821	29809	29810	Miss Bartlett	115	" You will be seen from the road . "
29881	29961	29963	29963	she	115	" Oh , for a real man ! We are only two women , you and I. Mr. Beebe is hopeless . There is Mr. Eager , but you do not trust him . Oh , for your brother ! He is young , but I know that his sister 's insult would rouse in him a very lion . Thank God , chivalry is not yet dead . There are still left some men who can reverence woman . "
29995	30012	29987	29987	she	115	" It will be a push to catch the morning train , but we must try . "
30013	30017	29987	29987	she	115	" What train ? "
30018	30024	30025	30025	She	115	" The train to Rome . "
30045	30054	29987	29987	she	115	" When does the train to Rome go ? "
30055	30059	30032	30033	The girl	332	" At eight . "
30060	30067	29987	29987	she	115	" Signora Bertolini would be upset . "
30068	30074	30076	30077	Miss Bartlett	115	" We must face that , "
30090	30103	29987	29987	she	115	" She will make us pay for a whole week 's pension . "
30104	30133	29987	29987	she	115	" I expect she will . However , we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses ' hotel . Is n't afternoon tea given there for nothing ? "
30134	30144	29987	29987	she	115	" Yes , but they pay extra for wine . "
30425	30436	30417	30417	she	115	" Dearest Lucy , how will you ever forgive me ? "
30470	30487	30467	30467	she	116	" Charlotte dear , what do you mean ? As if I have anything to forgive ! "
30488	30520	30467	30467	she	116	" You have a great deal , and I have a very great deal to forgive myself , too . I know well how much I vex you at every turn . "
30521	30524	30467	30467	she	116	" But no-- "
30539	30599	30467	30467	she	116	" Ah , but yes ! I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped . I might have known it would not do . You want someone younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you . I am too uninteresting and old - fashioned -- only fit to pack and unpack your things . "
30600	30602	30528	30528	her	115	" Please-- "
30603	30669	30467	30467	she	116	" My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste , and were often able to leave me at home . I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do , but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary . You had your own way about these rooms , at all events . "
30670	30678	30680	30680	Lucy	116	" You must n't say these things , "
30708	30715	30717	30718	Miss Bartlett	115	" I have been a failure , "
30736	30769	30721	30721	she	115	" Failed to make you happy ; failed in my duty to your mother . She has been so generous to me ; I shall never face her again after this disaster . "
30770	30793	30694	30695	each other	628	" But mother will understand . It is not your fault , this trouble , and it is n't a disaster either . "
30794	30828	30721	30721	she	115	" It is my fault , it is a disaster . She will never forgive me , and rightly . For instance , what right had I to make friends with Miss Lavish ? "
30829	30833	30694	30695	each other	628	" Every right . "
30834	30874	30721	30721	she	115	" When I was here for your sake ? If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you . Your mother will see this as clearly as I do , when you tell her . "
30888	30896	30694	30695	each other	628	" Why need mother hear of it ? "
30897	30904	30694	30695	each other	628	" But you tell her everything ? "
30905	30912	30694	30695	each other	628	" I suppose I do generally . "
30913	30942	30694	30695	each other	628	" I dare not break your confidence . There is something sacred in it . Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her . "
30952	30998	30694	30695	each other	628	" Naturally I should have told her . But in case she should blame you in any way , I promise I will not , I am very willing not to . I will never speak of it either to her or to any one . "
31427	31445	31423	31423	her	115	" I wish one word with you in the drawing - room , Mr. Emerson , please . "
31456	31464	31452	31453	Miss Bartlett	115	" Good - night , Mr. Emerson . "
31486	31513	31482	31482	Lucy	116	" It is n't true . It ca n't all be true . I want not to be muddled . I want to grow older quickly . "
31521	31539	31482	31482	Lucy	116	" Go to bed at once , dear . You need all the rest you can get . "
31615	31625	31607	31607	none	1087	" Life like a dome of many coloured glass , "
31789	31795	31797	31798	the boy	733	" Where are n't they ? "
31808	31818	31797	31798	the boy	733	" I tell you I 'm getting fairly sick . "
31819	31834	31836	31837	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" For goodness ' sake go out of my drawing - room , then ? "
31859	31869	31870	31870	she	154	" I think things are coming to a head , "
31891	31896	31875	31875	her	154	" Time they did . "
31897	31910	31883	31883	she	154	" I am glad that Cecil is asking her this once more . "
31911	31922	31875	31875	her	154	" It 's his third go , is n't it ? "
31923	31934	31883	31883	she	154	" Freddy I do call the way you talk unkind . "
31935	31944	31946	31946	he	124	" I did n't mean to be unkind . "
31949	32013	31946	31946	he	124	" But I do think Lucy might have got this off her chest in Italy . I do n't know how girls manage things , but she ca n't have said ' No ' properly before , or she would n't have to say it again now . Over the whole thing -- I ca n't explain -- I do feel so uncomfortable . "
32014	32024	31883	31883	she	154	" Do you indeed , dear ? How interesting ! "
32025	32032	31946	31946	he	124	" I feel -- never mind . "
32039	32060	31883	31883	she	154	" Just listen to what I have written to Mrs. Vyse . I said : ' Dear Mrs. Vyse . ' "
32061	32075	31883	31883	she	154	" Yes , mother , you told me . A jolly good letter . "
32076	32107	32108	32108	She	1098	" I said : ' Dear Mrs. Vyse , Cecil has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted , if Lucy wishes it . But-- ' "
32112	32156	32108	32108	She	1098	" I was rather amused at Cecil asking my permission at all . He has always gone in for unconventionality , and parents nowhere , and so forth . When it comes to the point , he ca n't get on without me . "
32157	32161	32267	32267	her	1098	" Nor me . "
32162	32165	32108	32108	She	1098	" You ? "
32169	32175	32108	32108	She	1098	" What do you mean ? "
32176	32185	32108	32108	She	1098	" He asked me for my permission also . "
32189	32196	32186	32186	She	1098	" How very odd of him ! "
32197	32201	32203	32206	the son and heir	1099	" Why so ? "
32208	32217	32203	32206	the son and heir	1099	" Why should n't my permission be asked ? "
32218	32236	32186	32186	She	1098	" What do you know about Lucy or girls or anything ? What ever did you say ? "
32237	32258	32203	32206	the son and heir	1099	" I said to Cecil , ' Take her or leave her ; it 's no business of mine ! ' "
32259	32265	32186	32186	She	1098	" What a helpful answer ! "
32285	32291	32293	32293	Freddy	124	" The bother is this , "
32320	32332	32312	32313	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Freddy , you must come . There they still are ! "
32333	32346	32312	32313	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" I do n't see you ought to go peeping like that . "
32347	32362	32312	32313	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Peeping like that ! Ca n't I look out of my own window ? "
32380	32385	32364	32364	she	1098	" Still page 322 ? "
32421	32439	32440	32440	He	124	" The bother is this : I have put my foot in it with Cecil most awfully . "
32446	32532	32440	32440	He	124	" Not content with ' permission ' , which I did give -- that is to say , I said , ' I do n't mind'--well , not content with that , he wanted to know whether I was n't off my head with joy . He practically put it like this : Was n't it a splendid thing for Lucy and for Windy Corner generally if he married her ? And he would have an answer -- he said it would strengthen his hand . "
32533	32544	32364	32364	she	1098	" I hope you gave a careful answer , dear . "
32545	32551	32553	32554	the boy	733	" I answered ' No ' "
32560	32593	32553	32554	the boy	733	" There ! Fly into a stew ! I ca n't help it -- had to say it . I had to say no . He ought never to have asked me . "
32594	32598	32600	32601	his mother	1093	" Ridiculous child ! "
32603	32652	32600	32601	his mother	1093	" You think you 're so holy and truthful , but really it 's only abominable conceit . Do you suppose that a man like Cecil would take the slightest notice of anything you say ? I hope he boxed your ears . How dare you say no ? "
32653	32730	32553	32554	the boy	733	" Oh , do keep quiet , mother ! I had to say no when I could n't say yes . I tried to laugh as if I did n't mean what I said , and , as Cecil laughed too , and went away , it may be all right . But I feel my foot 's in it . Oh , do keep quiet , though , and let a man do some work . "
32731	32734	32736	32737	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" No , "
32750	32793	32736	32737	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" I shall not keep quiet . You know all that has passed between them in Rome ; you know why he is down here , and yet you deliberately insult him , and try to turn him out of my house . "
32794	32799	32800	32800	he	1105	" Not a bit ! "
32803	32837	32800	32800	he	1105	" I only let out I did n't like him . I do n't hate him , but I do n't like him . What I mind is that he 'll tell Lucy . "
32845	32852	32854	32855	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Well , I like him , "
32857	32907	32908	32908	She	154	" I know his mother ; he 's good , he 's clever , he 's rich , he 's well connected -- Oh , you need n't kick the piano ! He 's well connected -- I'll say it again if you like : he 's well connected . "
32926	32933	32923	32923	She	154	" And he has beautiful manners . "
32934	32969	32914	32914	her	154	" I liked him till just now . I suppose it 's having him spoiling Lucy 's first week at home ; and it 's also something that Mr. Beebe said , not knowing . "
32970	32974	32976	32977	his mother	1093	" Mr. Beebe ? "
32985	32996	32976	32977	his mother	1093	" I do n't see how Mr. Beebe comes in . "
32997	33089	32914	32914	her	154	" You know Mr. Beebe 's funny way , when you never quite know what he means . He said : ' Mr. Vyse is an ideal bachelor . ' I was very cute , I asked him what he meant . He said ' Oh , he 's like me -- better detached . ' I could n't make him say any more , but it set me thinking . Since Cecil has come after Lucy he has n't been so pleasant , at least -- I ca n't explain . "
33090	33116	32976	32977	his mother	1093	" You never can , dear . But I can . You are jealous of Cecil because he may stop Lucy knitting you silk ties . "
33216	33221	33223	33224	his mother	1093	" Will this do ? "
33226	33359	33223	33224	his mother	1093	" ' Dear Mrs. Vyse,--Cecil has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it . ' Then I put in at the top , ' and I have told Lucy so . ' I must write the letter out again--'and I have told Lucy so . But Lucy seems very uncertain , and in these days young people must decide for themselves . ' I said that because I did n't want Mrs. Vyse to think us old - fashioned . She goes in for lectures and improving her mind , and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds , and the maid 's dirty thumb - marks where you turn on the electric light . She keeps that flat abominably-- "
33360	33378	33197	33197	himself	124	" Suppose Lucy marries Cecil , would she live in a flat , or in the country ? "
33379	33461	33223	33224	his mother	1093	" Do n't interrupt so foolishly . Where was I ? Oh yes--'Young people must decide for themselves . I know that Lucy likes your son , because she tells me everything , and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first . ' No , I 'll cross that last bit out -- it looks patronizing . I 'll stop at ' because she tells me everything . ' Or shall I cross that out , too ? "
33462	33469	33471	33471	Freddy	124	" Cross it out , too , "
33479	33552	33223	33224	his mother	1093	" Then the whole thing runs : ' Dear Mrs. Vyse.--Cecil has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted if Lucy wishes it , and I have told Lucy so . But Lucy seems very uncertain , and in these days young people must decide for themselves . I know that Lucy likes your son , because she tells me everything . But I do not know-- ' "
33553	33557	33559	33559	Freddy	124	" Look out ! "
33875	33880	33881	33881	she	154	" Oh , Cecil ! "
33882	33890	33903	33903	him	198	exclaimed--"oh , Cecil , do tell me ! "
33891	33896	33898	33898	he	198	" I promessi sposi , "
33906	33912	33913	33913	he	198	" She has accepted me , "
33937	33943	33945	33946	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" I am so glad , "
34007	34015	34017	34018	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Welcome as one of the family ! "
34027	34047	34017	34018	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" This is indeed a joyous day ! I feel sure that you will make our dear Lucy happy . "
34048	34053	34055	34057	the young man	348	" I hope so , "
34066	34069	34071	34072	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" We mothers-- "
34117	34123	34125	34125	Cecil	198	" I say , Lucy ! "
34186	34190	34183	34183	He	834	" Steady on ! "
34191	34198	34200	34201	her mother	450	" Not a kiss for me ? "
34208	34224	34225	34225	Cecil	198	" Would you take them into the garden and tell Mrs. Honeychurch all about it ? "
34228	34239	34225	34225	Cecil	198	" And I 'd stop here and tell my mother . "
34240	34246	34248	34248	Freddy	124	" We go with Lucy ? "
34255	34263	34225	34225	Cecil	198	" Yes , you go with Lucy . "
34518	34521	34522	34522	She	116	" story . "
34802	34807	34800	34800	he	198	" Dear Mrs. Vyse , "
35026	35032	35033	35033	he	198	Freddy--"He is only a boy , "
35036	35057	35012	35013	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" I represent all that he despises . Why should he want me for a brother - in - law ? "
35102	35106	35108	35109	the maid	2625	" Mr. Beebe ! "
35150	35169	35108	35109	the maid	2625	" I 've come for tea , Mr. Vyse . Do you suppose that I shall get it ? "
35170	35200	35139	35139	her	116	" I should say so . Food is the thing one does get here -- Don't sit in that chair ; young Honeychurch has left a bone in it . "
35201	35204	35108	35109	the maid	2625	" Pfui ! "
35205	35209	35211	35211	Cecil	198	" I know , "
35213	35227	35211	35211	Cecil	198	" I know . I ca n't think why Mrs. Honeychurch allows it . "
35260	35275	35249	35249	they	1159	" I 've come for tea and for gossip . Is n't this news ? "
35276	35285	35287	35287	Cecil	198	" News ? I do n't understand you , "
35289	35292	35287	35287	Cecil	198	" News ? "
35308	35343	35249	35249	they	1159	" I met Sir Harry Otway as I came up ; I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field . He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack ! "
35344	35349	35351	35351	Cecil	198	" Has he indeed ? "
35413	35456	35410	35411	a bounder	1164	" Unpardonable question ! To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert , the semi - detached villas that have been run up opposite the church ! I 'll set Mrs. Honeychurch after you . "
35457	35466	35468	35470	the young man	348	" I 'm shockingly stupid over local affairs , "
35473	35546	35468	35470	the young man	348	" I ca n't even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board . Perhaps there is no difference , or perhaps those are n't the right names . I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery . It is very remiss of me . Italy and London are the only places where I do n't feel to exist on sufferance . "
35566	35582	35410	35411	a bounder	1164	" Let me see , Mr. Vyse -- I forget -- what is your profession ? "
35583	35589	35591	35591	Cecil	198	" I have no profession , "
35593	35668	35591	35591	Cecil	198	" It is another example of my decadence . My attitude -- quite an indefensible one -- is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like . I know I ought to be getting money out of people , or devoting myself to things I do n't care a straw about , but somehow , I 've not been able to begin . "
35669	35675	35677	35678	Mr. Beebe	119	" You are very fortunate , "
35680	35692	35677	35678	Mr. Beebe	119	" It is a wonderful opportunity , the possession of leisure . "
35730	35752	35677	35678	Mr. Beebe	119	" I am glad that you approve . I dare n't face the healthy person -- for example , Freddy Honeychurch . "
35753	35766	35715	35719	all who have regular occupation	1166	" Oh , Freddy 's a good sort , is n't he ? "
35767	35780	35677	35678	Mr. Beebe	119	" Admirable . The sort who has made England what she is . "
35846	35852	35854	35855	Mr. Beebe	119	" Where are the others ? "
35859	35869	35854	35855	Mr. Beebe	119	" I insist on extracting tea before evening service . "
35870	35947	35827	35827	he	198	" I suppose Anne never told them you were here . In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives . The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly , and kicks the chair - legs with her feet . The faults of Mary -- I forget the faults of Mary , but they are very grave . Shall we look in the garden ? "
35948	35967	35854	35855	Mr. Beebe	119	" I know the faults of Mary . She leaves the dust - pans standing on the stairs . "
35968	35989	35827	35827	he	198	" The fault of Euphemia is that she will not , simply will not , chop the suet sufficiently small . "
36001	36006	36007	36007	Cecil	198	" The faults of Freddy-- "
36010	36042	35854	35855	Mr. Beebe	119	" Ah , he has too many . No one but his mother can remember the faults of Freddy . Try the faults of Miss Honeychurch ; they are not innumerable . "
36043	36048	36050	36052	the young man	348	" She has none , "
36058	36069	35827	35827	he	198	" I quite agree . At present she has none . "
36070	36074	35827	35827	he	198	" At present ? "
36075	36161	35827	35827	he	198	" I 'm not cynical . I 'm only thinking of my pet theory about Miss Honeychurch . Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully , and live so quietly ? I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both . The water - tight compartments in her will break down , and music and life will mingle . Then we shall have her heroically good , heroically bad -- too heroic , perhaps , to be good or bad . "
36168	36183	36280	36280	them	1174	" And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes ? "
36184	36268	36280	36280	them	1174	" Well , I must say I 've only seen her at Tunbridge Wells , where she was not wonderful , and at Florence . Since I came to Summer Street she has been away . You saw her , did n't you , at Rome and in the Alps . Oh , I forgot ; of course , you knew her before . No , she was n't wonderful in Florence either , but I kept on expecting that she would be . "
36269	36274	36280	36280	them	1174	" In what way ? "
36292	36355	36428	36430	the young man	348	" I could as easily tell you what tune she 'll play next . There was simply the sense that she had found wings , and meant to use them . I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary : Miss Honeychurch as a kite , Miss Bartlett holding the string . Picture number two : the string breaks . "
36389	36396	36428	36430	the young man	348	" But the string never broke ? "
36397	36419	36387	36387	himself	1176	" No . I might n't have seen Miss Honeychurch rise , but I should certainly have heard Miss Bartlett fall . "
36420	36426	36428	36430	the young man	348	" It has broken now , "
36484	36492	36467	36467	he	1176	" Broken ? What do you mean ? "
36493	36497	36499	36499	Cecil	198	" I meant , "
36502	36511	36499	36499	Cecil	198	" that she is going to marry me . "
36530	36572	36577	36577	he	335	" I am sorry ; I must apologize . I had no idea you were intimate with her , or I should never have talked in this flippant , superficial way . Mr. Vyse , you ought to have stopped me . "
36662	36673	36674	36674	he	198	" I am sorry I have given you a shock , "
36678	36692	36674	36674	he	198	" I fear that Lucy 's choice does not meet with your approval . "
36693	36735	36656	36656	he	198	" Not that . But you ought to have stopped me . I know Miss Honeychurch only a little as time goes . Perhaps I ought n't to have discussed her so freely with any one ; certainly not with you . "
36736	36746	36674	36674	he	198	" You are conscious of having said something indiscreet ? "
36780	36866	36878	36880	the approaching trio	1184	" No , I have said nothing indiscreet . I foresaw at Florence that her quiet , uneventful childhood must end , and it has ended . I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step . She has taken it . She has learnt -- you will let me talk freely , as I have begun freely -- she has learnt what it is to love : the greatest lesson , some people will tell you , that our earthly life provides . "
36890	36897	36882	36882	He	119	" She has learnt through you , "
36912	36926	36900	36900	his	119	" let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her . "
36927	36931	36933	36933	Cecil	198	" Grazie tante ! "
36941	36946	36948	36949	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Have you heard ? "
36958	36970	36948	36949	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Oh , Mr. Beebe , have you heard the news ? "
36990	36995	36996	36996	he	1186	" Indeed I have ! "
37023	37096	37007	37007	he	1186	" Mrs. Honeychurch , I 'm going to do what I am always supposed to do , but generally I 'm too shy . I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them , grave and gay , great and small . I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife , as father and mother . And now I want my tea . "
37097	37107	37108	37109	the lady	1189	" You only asked for it just in time , "
37112	37122	37108	37109	the lady	1189	" How dare you be serious at Windy Corner ? "
37417	37418	37406	37406	Freddy	124	" Fiasco"--family
37674	37686	37687	37687	he	198	" Do you go to much of this sort of thing ? "
37695	37702	37704	37704	Lucy	116	" Oh , now and then , "
37712	37720	37710	37710	herself	116	" Is it typical of country society ? "
37721	37732	37704	37704	Lucy	116	" I suppose so . Mother , would it be ? "
37733	37738	37740	37741	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Plenty of society , "
37770	37782	37763	37763	Cecil	198	" To me it seemed perfectly appalling , disastrous , portentous . "
37783	37793	37740	37741	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" I am so sorry that you were stranded . "
37794	37837	37763	37763	Cecil	198	" Not that , but the congratulations . It is so disgusting , the way an engagement is regarded as public property -- a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment . All those old women smirking ! "
37838	37859	37740	37741	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" One has to go through it , I suppose . They wo n't notice us so much next time . "
37860	37894	37763	37763	Cecil	198	" But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong . An engagement -- horrid word in the first place -- is a private matter , and should be treated as such . "
37964	37968	37969	37969	she	116	" How tiresome ! "
37972	37981	37969	37969	she	116	" Could n't you have escaped to tennis ? "
37982	38020	38048	38061	a young man who had spent a quiet winter in Rome with his mother	1220	" I do n't play tennis -- at least , not in public . The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic . Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato . "
38021	38025	37969	37969	she	116	" Inglese Italianato ? "
38026	38037	38048	38061	a young man who had spent a quiet winter in Rome with his mother	1220	" E un diavolo incarnato ! You know the proverb ? "
38084	38087	38089	38089	he	198	" Well , "
38091	38120	38089	38089	he	198	" I can not help it if they do disapprove of me . There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them , and I must accept them . "
38121	38131	38133	38134	wise Lucy	116	" We all have our limitations , I suppose , "
38136	38146	38148	38148	Cecil	198	" Sometimes they are forced on us , though , "
38164	38167	38089	38089	he	198	" How ? "
38168	38196	38161	38161	his	198	" It makes a difference does n't it , whether we fully fence ourselves in , or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others ? "
38211	38214	38216	38217	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Difference ? "
38222	38243	38216	38217	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" I do n't see any difference . Fences are fences , especially when they are in the same place . "
38244	38251	38253	38253	Cecil	198	" We were speaking of motives , "
38261	38269	38270	38270	She	116	" My dear Cecil , look here . "
38285	38317	38270	38270	She	116	" This is me . That 's Windy Corner . The rest of the pattern is the other people . Motives are all very well , but the fence comes here . "
38318	38327	38329	38329	Lucy	116	" We were n't talking of real fences , "
38333	38343	38270	38270	She	116	" Oh , I see , dear -- poetry . "
38357	38373	38374	38374	she	116	" I tell you who has no ' fences , ' as you call them , "
38377	38384	38374	38374	she	116	" and that 's Mr. Beebe . "
38385	38395	38411	38411	they	308	" A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless . "
38428	38436	38437	38437	she	116	" Do n't you like Mr. Beebe ? "
38441	38447	38448	38448	he	198	" I never said so ! "
38451	38463	38465	38465	he	198	" I consider him far above the average . I only denied-- "
38479	38489	38491	38491	she	116	" Now , a clergyman that I do hate , "
38498	38550	38491	38491	she	116	" a clergyman that does have fences , and the most dreadful ones , is Mr. Eager , the English chaplain at Florence . He was truly insincere -- not merely the manner unfortunate . He was a snob , and so conceited , and he did say such unkind things . "
38551	38557	38610	38610	her	116	" What sort of things ? "
38558	38575	38491	38491	she	116	" There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife . "
38576	38581	38610	38610	her	116	" Perhaps he had . "
38582	38585	38491	38491	she	116	" No ! "
38586	38592	38610	38610	her	116	" Why ' no ' ? "
38593	38606	38491	38491	she	116	" He was such a nice old man , I 'm sure . "
38614	38660	38491	38491	she	116	" Well , I did try to sift the thing . Mr. Eager would never come to the point . He prefers it vague -- said the old man had ' practically ' murdered his wife -- had murdered her in the sight of God . "
38661	38666	38668	38669	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Hush , dear ! "
38672	38723	38610	38610	her	116	" But is n't it intolerable that a person whom we 're told to imitate should go round spreading slander ? It was , I believe , chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped . People pretended he was vulgar , but he certainly was n't that . "
38724	38734	38825	38826	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Poor old man ! What was his name ? "
38735	38738	38740	38740	Lucy	116	" Harris , "
38743	38756	38758	38759	her mother	450	" Let 's hope that Mrs. Harris there warn't no sich person , "
38765	38777	38778	38778	he	198	" Is n't Mr. Eager a parson of the cultured type ? "
38781	38814	38761	38761	Cecil	198	" I do n't know . I hate him . I 've heard him lecture on Giotto . I hate him . Nothing can hide a petty nature . I HATE him . "
38815	38823	38825	38826	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" My goodness gracious me , child ! "
38828	38854	38825	38826	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" You 'll blow my head off ! Whatever is there to shout over ? I forbid you and Cecil to hate any more clergymen . "
39047	39055	39056	39056	he	1224	" I count myself a lucky person , "
39059	39188	39056	39056	he	1224	" When I 'm in London I feel I could never live out of it . When I 'm in the country I feel the same about the country . After all , I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life , and that the people who live amongst them must be the best . It 's true that in nine cases out of ten they do n't seem to notice anything . The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions . Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of Nature which is denied to us of the town . Do you feel that , Mrs. Honeychurch ? "
39273	39287	39288	39288	he	198	" ' Come down , O maid , from yonder mountain height , ' "
39305	39309	39299	39299	She	116	" What height ? "
39310	39363	39288	39288	he	198	" ' Come down , O maid , from yonder mountain height , What pleasure lives in height ( the shepherd sang ) . In height and in the splendour of the hills ? ' Let us take Mrs. Honeychurch 's advice and hate clergymen no more . What 's this place ? "
39364	39371	39373	39373	Lucy	116	" Summer Street , of course , "
39509	39511	39495	39497	Sir Harry Otway	135	" Cissie "
39521	39523	39495	39497	Sir Harry Otway	135	" Albert "

39641	39647	39649	39650	the ladies	302	" The place is ruined ! "
39653	39663	39649	39650	the ladies	302	" Summer Street will never be the same again . "
39669	39672	39677	39678	a gentleman	646	" Cissie 's "
39684	39687	39689	39690	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Stop ! "
39699	39720	39689	39690	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Here 's Sir Harry . Now we shall know . Sir Harry , pull those things down at once ! "
39737	39758	39689	39690	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Mrs. Honeychurch , I meant to . I ca n't , I really ca n't turn out Miss Flack . "
39759	39793	39689	39690	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Am I not always right ? She ought to have gone before the contract was signed . Does she still live rent free , as she did in her nephew 's time ? "
39794	39801	39802	39802	He	135	" But what can I do ? "
39807	39820	39804	39804	his	135	" An old lady , so very vulgar , and almost bedridden . "
39821	39826	39828	39828	Cecil	198	" Turn her out , "
40023	40054	40010	40011	Mr. Flack	211	" and all the capitals different -- one with dragons in the foliage , another approaching to the Ionian style , another introducing Mrs. Flack 's initials -- everyone different . "
40160	40161	40156	40158	a desirable tenant	1269	" Cissie"--some
40166	40173	40174	40174	he	1265	" The rent is absurdly low , "
40178	40214	40174	40174	he	1265	" and perhaps I am an easy landlord . But it is such an awkward size . It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves . "
40241	40251	40252	40252	he	1265	" You ought to find a tenant at once , "
40256	40268	40252	40252	he	1265	" It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk . "
40269	40272	40274	40275	Sir Harry	135	" Exactly ! "
40278	40326	40274	40275	Sir Harry	135	" That is exactly what I fear , Mr. Vyse . It will attract the wrong type of people . The train service has improved -- a fatal improvement , to my mind . And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles ? "
40327	40336	40338	40338	Lucy	116	" Rather a strenuous clerk it would be , "
40386	40390	40391	40391	she	116	" Sir Harry ! "
40394	40406	40391	40391	she	116	" I have an idea . How would you like spinsters ? "
40407	40423	40381	40381	herself	116	" My dear Lucy , it would be splendid . Do you know any such ? "
40424	40432	40391	40391	she	116	" Yes ; I met them abroad . "
40433	40436	40437	40437	he	1265	" Gentlewomen ? "
40441	40496	40391	40391	she	116	" Yes , indeed , and at the present moment homeless . I heard from them last week -- Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine Alan . I 'm really not joking . They are quite the right people . Mr. Beebe knows them , too . May I tell them to write to you ? "
40497	40502	40503	40503	he	1265	" Indeed you may ! "
40506	40648	40503	40503	he	1265	" Here we are with the difficulty solved already . How delightful it is ! Extra facilities -- please tell them they shall have extra facilities , for I shall have no agents ' fees . Oh , the agents ! The appalling people they have sent me ! One woman , when I wrote -- a tactful letter , you know -- asking her to explain her social position to me , replied that she would pay the rent in advance . As if one cares about that ! And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory -- people swindlers , or not respectable . And oh , the deceit ! I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week . The deceit of the most promising people . My dear Lucy , the deceit ! "
40652	40656	40659	40660	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" My advice , "
40662	40734	40659	40660	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" is to have nothing to do with Lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all . I know the type . Preserve me from people who have seen better days , and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy . It 's a sad thing , but I 'd far rather let to someone who is going up in the world than to someone who has come down . "
40735	40742	40744	40745	Sir Harry	135	" I think I follow you , "
40747	40761	40744	40745	Sir Harry	135	" but it is , as you say , a very sad thing . "
40762	40770	40772	40772	Lucy	116	" The Misses Alan are n't that ! "
40774	40780	40782	40782	Cecil	198	" Yes , they are , "
40784	40804	40782	40782	Cecil	198	" I have n't met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood . "
40805	40819	40659	40660	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Do n't listen to him , Sir Harry -- he 's tiresome . "
40820	40828	40829	40829	he	135	" It 's I who am tiresome , "
40832	40876	40829	40829	he	135	" I ought n't to come with my troubles to young people . But really I am so worried , and Lady Otway will only say that I can not be too careful , which is quite true , but no real help . "
40877	40887	40659	40660	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Then may I write to my Misses Alan ? "
40888	40891	40829	40829	he	135	" Please ! "
40901	40946	40897	40898	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Beware ! They are certain to have canaries . Sir Harry , beware of canaries : they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come . Beware of women altogether . Only let to a man . "
40947	40949	40950	40950	he	135	" Really-- "
40963	41025	40960	40960	her	154	" Men do n't gossip over tea - cups . If they get drunk , there 's an end of them -- they lie down comfortably and sleep it off . If they 're vulgar , they somehow keep it to themselves . It does n't spread so . Give me a man -- of course , provided he 's clean . "
41073	41075	41077	41077	herself	154	" Cissie "
41123	41127	41128	41128	he	135	" Mrs. Honeychurch , "
41131	41142	41128	41128	he	135	" what if we two walk home and leave you ? "
41143	41146	41148	41148	her	154	" Certainly ! "
41173	41182	41165	41165	He	135	" Aha ! young people , young people ! "
41191	41195	41197	41197	Cecil	198	" Hopeless vulgarian ! "
41207	41212	41165	41165	He	135	" Oh , Cecil ! "
41213	41230	41165	41165	He	135	" I ca n't help it . It would be wrong not to loathe that man . "
41231	41243	41165	41165	He	135	" He is n't clever , but really he is nice . "
41244	41317	41165	41165	He	135	" No , Lucy , he stands for all that is bad in country life . In London he would keep his place . He would belong to a brainless club , and his wife would give brainless dinner parties . But down here he acts the little god with his gentility , and his patronage , and his sham aesthetics , and everyone -- even your mother -- is taken in . "
41318	41327	41329	41329	Lucy	116	" All that you say is quite true , "
41336	41348	41329	41329	Lucy	116	" I wonder whether -- whether it matters so very much . "
41349	41417	41441	41447	the people who really mattered to her	1284	" It matters supremely . Sir Harry is the essence of that garden - party . Oh , goodness , how cross I feel ! How I do hope he 'll get some vulgar tenant in that villa -- some woman so really vulgar that he 'll notice it . GENTLEFOLKS ! Ugh ! with his bald head and retreating chin ! But let 's forget him . "
41477	41486	41470	41470	Cecil	198	" It would be wrong not to loathe Freddy "
41548	41555	41556	41556	she	116	" Which way shall we go ? "
41593	41599	41566	41566	she	116	" Are there two ways ? "
41600	41615	41566	41566	she	116	" Perhaps the road is more sensible , as we 're got up smart . "
41616	41625	41627	41627	Cecil	198	" I 'd rather go through the wood , "
41643	41679	41627	41627	Cecil	198	" Why is it , Lucy , that you always say the road ? Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged ? "
41680	41690	41692	41692	Lucy	116	" Have n't I ? The wood , then , "
41746	41770	41735	41735	he	198	" I had got an idea -- I dare say wrongly -- that you feel more at home with me in a room . "
41771	41775	41776	41776	she	116	" A room ? "
41782	41808	41735	41735	he	198	" Yes . Or , at the most , in a garden , or on a road . Never in the real country like this . "
41809	41842	41735	41735	he	198	" Oh , Cecil , whatever do you mean ? I have never felt anything of the sort . You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person . "
41843	41876	41735	41735	he	198	" I do n't know that you are n't . I connect you with a view -- a certain type of view . Why should n't you connect me with a room ? "
41888	41924	41735	41735	he	198	" Do you know that you 're right ? I do . I must be a poetess after all . When I think of you it 's always as in a room . How funny ! "
41933	41945	41735	41735	he	198	" A drawing - room , pray ? With no view ? "
41946	41959	41929	41929	he	1290	" Yes , with no view , I fancy . Why not ? "
41960	41965	41966	41966	he	1290	" I 'd rather , "
41970	41980	41966	41966	he	1290	" that you connected me with the open air . "
41985	41995	41981	41981	She	116	" Oh , Cecil , whatever do you mean ? "
42122	42127	42119	42119	She	116	" The Sacred Lake ! "
42128	42136	42265	42265	he	124	" Why do you call it that ? "
42137	42213	42119	42119	She	116	" I ca n't remember why . I suppose it comes out of some book . It 's only a puddle now , but you see that stream going through it ? Well , a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains , and ca n't get away at once , and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful . Then Freddy used to bathe there . He is very fond of it . "
42214	42218	42265	42265	he	124	" And you ? "
42222	42229	42231	42231	she	116	" Are you fond of it ? "
42235	42254	42231	42231	she	116	" I bathed here , too , till I was found out . Then there was a row . "
42343	42349	42318	42318	she	116	" Who found you out ? "
42350	42353	42354	42354	she	116	" Charlotte , "
42357	42368	42354	42354	she	116	" She was stopping with us . Charlotte -- Charlotte . "
42369	42373	42318	42318	she	116	" Poor girl ! "
42393	42396	42436	42436	his	124	" Lucy ! "
42397	42408	42410	42410	her	116	" Yes , I suppose we ought to be going , "
42413	42430	42436	42436	his	124	" Lucy , I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before . "
42446	42451	42436	42436	his	124	" What , Cecil ? "
42452	42469	42436	42436	his	124	" Hitherto never -- not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me-- "
42491	42494	42438	42438	she	116	" Yes ? "
42495	42505	42482	42482	they	1297	" Up to now I have never kissed you . "
42520	42527	42528	42528	she	116	" No -- more you have , "
42531	42541	42438	42438	she	116	" Then I ask you -- may I now ? "
42542	42565	42512	42512	he	124	" Of course , you may , Cecil . You might before . I ca n't run at you , you know . "
42795	42804	42787	42787	she	116	" Emerson was the name , not Harris . "
42805	42809	42787	42787	she	116	" What name ? "
42810	42816	42787	42787	she	116	" The old man 's . "
42817	42822	42787	42787	she	116	" What old man ? "
42823	42841	42787	42787	she	116	" That old man I told you about . The one Mr. Eager was so unkind to . "
43040	43050	43051	43051	she	2452	" I can not think what people are doing , "
43055	43065	43051	43051	she	2452	" but it is extremely fortunate for the children . "
43401	43408	43409	43409	he	198	" Does that very much matter ? "
43637	43665	43624	43624	she	116	" Oh , it has been such a nuisance -- first he , then they -- no one knowing what they wanted , and everyone so tiresome . "
43666	43674	43676	43677	Mr. Beebe	119	" But they really are coming now , "
43679	43723	43676	43677	Mr. Beebe	119	" I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago -- she was wondering how often the butcher called , and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably . They are coming . I heard from them this morning . "
43724	43732	43733	43734	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" I shall hate those Miss Alans ! "
43737	43780	43733	43734	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Just because they 're old and silly one 's expected to say ' How sweet ! ' I hate their ' if'-ing and ' but'-ing and ' and'-ing . And poor Lucy -- serve her right -- worn to a shadow . "
43811	43826	43827	43827	Saturn	226	" Well , if they are coming -- No , Minnie , not Saturn . "
43850	43906	43842	43842	his	198	" If they are coming , Sir Harry will let them move in before the twenty - ninth , and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings , because it made them nervous , and put in the fair wear and tear one.--That does n't count . I told you not Saturn . "
43907	43917	43919	43919	Freddy	124	" Saturn 's all right for bumble - puppy , "
43924	43934	43919	43919	Freddy	124	" Minnie , do n't you listen to her . "
43935	43941	43842	43842	his	198	" Saturn does n't bounce . "
43942	43947	43919	43919	Freddy	124	" Saturn bounces enough . "
43948	43955	43842	43842	his	198	" No , he does n't . "
43956	43968	43919	43919	Freddy	124	" Well ; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil . "
43969	43974	43976	43977	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Hush , dear , "
43979	44034	43919	43919	Freddy	124	" But look at Lucy -- complaining of Saturn , and all the time 's got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand , ready to plug it in . That 's right , Minnie , go for her -- get her over the shins with the racquet -- get her over the shins ! "
44056	44068	44047	44048	Mr. Beebe	119	" The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona , please . "
44181	44191	44193	44194	Mr. Beebe	119	" I wish the Miss Alans could see this , "
44218	44225	44226	44226	Freddy	124	" Who are the Miss Alans ? "
44229	44236	44215	44216	her brother	834	" They have taken Cissie Villa . "
44237	44243	44215	44216	her brother	834	" That was n't the name-- "
44264	44270	44272	44272	Lucy	116	" Was n't what name ? "
44283	44298	44215	44216	her brother	834	" Alan was n't the name of the people Sir Harry 's let to . "
44299	44310	44215	44216	her brother	834	" Nonsense , Freddy ! You know nothing about it . "
44311	44330	44332	44334	an indifferent mimic--"'ahem	2827	" Nonsense yourself ! I 've this minute seen him . He said to me : ' Ahem ! Honeychurch,'"--Freddy
44334	44369	44332	44334	an indifferent mimic--"'ahem	2827	mimic--"'ahem ! ahem ! I have at last procured really dee - sire - rebel tenants . ' I said , ' ooray , old boy ! ' and slapped him on the back . "
44370	44377	44332	44334	an indifferent mimic--"'ahem	2827	" Exactly . The Miss Alans ? "
44378	44386	44332	44334	an indifferent mimic--"'ahem	2827	" Rather not . More like Anderson . "
44387	44402	44403	44404	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Oh , good gracious , there is n't going to be another muddle ! "
44407	44444	44403	44404	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Do you notice , Lucy , I 'm always right ? I said do n't interfere with Cissie Villa . I 'm always right . I 'm quite uneasy at being always right so often . "
44445	44472	44332	44334	an indifferent mimic--"'ahem	2827	" It 's only another muddle of Freddy 's . Freddy does n't even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead . "
44473	44486	44403	44404	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Yes , I do . I 've got it . Emerson . "
44487	44491	44332	44334	an indifferent mimic--"'ahem	2827	" What name ? "
44492	44503	44403	44404	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Emerson . I 'll bet you anything you like . "
44504	44512	44514	44514	Lucy	116	" What a weathercock Sir Harry is , "
44517	44529	44514	44514	Lucy	116	" I wish I had never bothered over it at all . "
44591	44604	44629	44631	most young people	1367	" Emerson , Freddy ? Do you know what Emersons they are ? "
44605	44616	44618	44618	Freddy	124	" I do n't know whether they 're any Emersons , "
44659	44673	44629	44631	most young people	1367	" I trust they are the right sort of person . All right , Lucy"--she
44677	44713	44629	44631	most young people	1367	again--"I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother 's a snob . But there is a right sort and a wrong sort , and it 's affectation to pretend there is n't . "
44714	44722	44723	44723	Lucy	116	" Emerson 's a common enough name , "
44768	44802	44629	44631	most young people	1367	" I was merely going to remark , Freddy , that I trusted they were no relations of Emerson the philosopher , a most trying man . Pray , does that satisfy you ? "
44803	44808	44809	44809	he	1371	" Oh , yes , "
44812	44828	44809	44809	he	1371	" And you will be satisfied , too , for they 're friends of Cecil ; so"--elaborate
44829	44844	44629	44631	most young people	1367	irony--"you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety . "
44845	44848	44850	44850	Lucy	116	" CECIL ? "
44852	44860	44862	44863	his mother	1093	" Do n't be rude , dear , "
44866	44884	44862	44863	his mother	1093	" Lucy , do n't screech . It 's a new bad habit you 're getting into . "
44885	44889	44629	44631	most young people	1367	" But has Cecil-- "
44890	44896	44897	44897	he	1371	" Friends of Cecil 's , "
44900	44923	44897	44897	he	1371	" ' and so really dee - sire - rebel . Ahem ! Honeychurch , I have just telegraphed to them . ' "
44973	44975	44970	44970	She	116	" screech "
45029	45047	45026	45026	she	116	" But Cecil 's Emersons -- they ca n't possibly be the same ones -- there is that-- "
45080	45144	45145	45145	He	335	" The Emersons who were at Florence , do you mean ? No , I do n't suppose it will prove to be them . It is probably a long cry from them to friends of Mr. Vyse 's . Oh , Mrs. Honeychurch , the oddest people ! The queerest people ! For our part we liked them , did n't we ? "
45150	45263	45145	45145	He	335	" There was a great scene over some violets . They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa . Poor little ladies ! So shocked and so pleased . It used to be one of Miss Catharine 's great stories . ' My dear sister loves flowers , ' it began . They found the whole room a mass of blue -- vases and jugs -- and the story ends with ' So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful . ' It is all very difficult . Yes , I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets . "
45264	45272	45274	45274	Freddy	124	" Fiasco 's done you this time , "
45305	45366	45381	45381	he	119	" These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son -- the son a goodly , if not a good young man ; not a fool , I fancy , but very immature -- pessimism , et cetera . Our special joy was the father -- such a sentimental darling , and people declared he had murdered his wife . "
45402	45407	45409	45410	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Murdered his wife ? "
45412	45474	45409	45410	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Lucy , do n't desert us -- go on playing bumble - puppy . Really , the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place . That 's the second murderer I 've heard of as being there . Whatever was Charlotte doing to stop ? By - the - by , we really must ask Charlotte here some time . "
45563	45570	45571	45571	he	834	" Oh , do n't go ! "
45583	45588	45589	45589	she	116	" I must go , "
45593	45607	45589	45589	she	116	" Do n't be silly . You always overdo it when you play . "
45617	45620	45612	45613	her mother	450	" Harris ! "
45734	45737	45705	45705	she	116	" Cecil ! "
45738	45741	45742	45742	he	198	" Hullo ! "
45761	45854	45755	45755	He	198	" I was hoping you 'd come . I heard you all bear - gardening , but there 's better fun up here . I , even I , have won a great victory for the Comic Muse . George Meredith 's right -- the cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same ; and I , even I , have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa . Do n't be angry ! Do n't be angry ! You 'll forgive me when you hear it all . "
45874	45879	45880	45880	she	1390	" I have heard , "
45883	45938	45880	45880	she	1390	" Freddy has told us . Naughty Cecil ! I suppose I must forgive you . Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing ! Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome , and I 'd rather have nice friends of yours . But you ought n't to tease one so . "
45939	45944	45945	45945	he	198	" Friends of mine ? "
45948	45963	45965	45965	she	1390	" But , Lucy , the whole joke is to come ! Come here . "
45972	45999	45965	45965	she	1390	" Do you know where I met these desirable tenants ? In the National Gallery , when I was up to see my mother last week . "
46000	46009	46010	46010	she	1390	" What an odd place to meet people ! "
46014	46021	46010	46010	she	1390	" I do n't quite understand . "
46022	46063	45965	45965	she	1390	" In the Umbrian Room . Absolute strangers . They were admiring Luca Signorelli -- of course , quite stupidly . However , we got talking , and they refreshed me not a little . They had been to Italy . "
46064	46068	46010	46010	she	1390	" But , Cecil-- "
46072	46146	45965	45965	she	1390	" In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage -- the father to live there , the son to run down for week - ends . I thought , ' What a chance of scoring off Sir Harry ! ' and I took their address and a London reference , found they were n't actual blackguards -- it was great sport -- and wrote to him , making out-- "
46147	46163	45965	45965	she	1390	" Cecil ! No , it 's not fair . I 've probably met them before-- "
46169	46249	46296	46296	Her	1392	" Perfectly fair . Anything is fair that punishes a snob . That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good . Sir Harry is too disgusting with his ' decayed gentlewomen . ' I meant to read him a lesson some time . No , Lucy , the classes ought to mix , and before long you 'll agree with me . There ought to be intermarriage -- all sorts of things . I believe in democracy-- "
46250	46257	46258	46258	she	1392	" No , you do n't , "

46307	46373	46296	46296	Her	1392	" It is n't fair , Cecil . I blame you -- I blame you very much indeed . You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans , and make me look ridiculous . You call it scoring off Sir Harry , but do you realize that it is all at my expense ? I consider it most disloyal of you . "

47071	47270	47040	47040	she	116	" I have news of you at last ! Miss Lavish has been bicycling in your parts , but was not sure whether a call would be welcome . Puncturing her tire near Summer Street , and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard , she saw to her astonishment , a door open opposite and the younger Emerson man come out . He said his father had just taken the house . He SAID he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood ( ? ) . He never suggested giving Eleanor a cup of tea . Dear Lucy , I am much worried , and I advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother , Freddy , and Mr. Vyse , who will forbid him to enter the house , etc . That was a great misfortune , and I dare say you have told them already . Mr. Vyse is so sensitive . I remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome . I am very sorry about it all , and should not feel easy unless I warned you . "
47271	47275	47040	47040	she	116	" Believe me , "

47309	47521	47040	47040	she	116	" Many thanks for your warning . When Mr. Emerson forgot himself on the mountain , you made me promise not to tell mother , because you said she would blame you for not being always with me . I have kept that promise , and can not possibly tell her now . I have said both to her and Cecil that I met the Emersons at Florence , and that they are respectable people -- which I do think -- and the reason that he offered Miss Lavish no tea was probably that he had none himself . She should have tried at the Rectory . I can not begin making a fuss at this stage . You must see that it would be too absurd . If the Emersons heard I had complained of them , they would think themselves of importance , which is exactly what they are not . I like the old father , and look forward to seeing him again . As for the son , I am sorry for him when we meet , rather than for myself . They are known to Cecil , who is very well and spoke of you the other day . We expect to be married in January . "
47522	47565	47040	47040	she	116	" Miss Lavish can not have told you much about me , for I am not at Windy Corner at all , but here . Please do not put ' Private ' outside your envelope again . No one opens my letters . "

48297	48384	48385	48385	He	1450	" The style of her ! How she kept to Schumann when , like an idiot , I wanted Beethoven . Schumann was right for this evening . Schumann was the thing . Do you know , mother , I shall have our children educated just like Lucy . Bring them up among honest country folks for freshness , send them to Italy for subtlety , and then -- not till then -- let them come to London . I do n't believe in these London educations-- "

48871	48877	48868	48868	Freddy	1467	" Are they that sort ? "
48878	48956	48776	48776	he	119	" I fancy they know how to read -- a rare accomplishment . What have they got ? Byron . Exactly . A Shropshire Lad . Never heard of it . The Way of All Flesh . Never heard of it . Gibbon . Hullo ! dear George reads German . Um -- um -- Schopenhauer , Nietzsche , and so we go on . Well , I suppose your generation knows its own business , Honeychurch . "

49024	49031	48982	48983	an amateur	1469	" How very odd of him ! "
49032	49037	48982	48983	an amateur	1469	" Surely you agree ? "
49058	49061	49062	49063	the clergyman	335	" Pictures ! "
49071	49085	49062	49063	the clergyman	335	" Giotto -- they got that at Florence , I 'll be bound . "

49111	49117	48982	48983	an amateur	1469	" She came back yesterday . "
49118	49127	49062	49063	the clergyman	335	" I suppose she had a good time ? "
49128	49133	49135	49135	Freddy	124	" Yes , very , "
49142	49151	49135	49135	Freddy	124	" She and Cecil are thicker than ever . "
49152	49158	48982	48983	an amateur	1469	" That 's good hearing . "
49159	49172	49135	49135	Freddy	124	" I wish I was n't such a fool , Mr. Beebe . "
49179	49210	49062	49063	the clergyman	335	" Lucy used to be nearly as stupid as I am , but it 'll be very different now , mother thinks . She will read all kinds of books . "
49211	49216	49062	49063	the clergyman	335	" So will you . "
49217	49261	49062	49063	the clergyman	335	" Only medical books . Not books that you can talk about afterwards . Cecil is teaching Lucy Italian , and he says her playing is wonderful . There are all kinds of things in it that we have never noticed . Cecil says-- "
49262	49282	49062	49063	the clergyman	335	" What on earth are those people doing upstairs ? Emerson -- we think we 'll come another time . "
49297	49307	49062	49063	the clergyman	335	" Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch , a neighbour . "
49347	49358	49342	49342	he	118	" How d'ye do ? Come and have a bathe . "
49359	49365	49367	49367	George	118	" Oh , all right , "
49377	49394	49395	49395	he	119	" ' How d'ye do ? how d'ye do ? Come and have a bathe , ' "
49398	49465	49395	49395	he	119	" That 's the best conversational opening I 've ever heard . But I 'm afraid it will only act between men . Can you picture a lady who has been introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with ' How do you do ? Come and have a bathe ' ? And yet you will tell me that the sexes are equal . "
49466	49475	49477	49478	Mr. Emerson	150	" I tell you that they shall be , "
49488	49509	49477	49478	Mr. Emerson	150	" Good afternoon , Mr. Beebe . I tell you they shall be comrades , and George thinks the same . "
49510	49520	49521	49522	the clergyman	335	" We are to raise ladies to our level ? "
49525	49531	49533	49534	Mr. Emerson	150	" The Garden of Eden , "
49539	49565	49533	49534	Mr. Emerson	150	" which you place in the past , is really yet to come . We shall enter it when we no longer despise our bodies . "
49576	49611	49533	49534	Mr. Emerson	150	" In this -- not in other things -- we men are ahead . We despise the body less than women do . But not until we are comrades shall we enter the garden . "
49612	49621	49623	49623	Freddy	124	" I say , what about this bathe ? "
49636	49686	49533	49534	Mr. Emerson	150	" I believed in a return to Nature once . But how can we return to Nature when we have never been with her ? To - day , I believe that we must discover Nature . After many conquests we shall attain simplicity . It is our heritage . "
49687	49702	49533	49534	Mr. Emerson	150	" Let me introduce Mr. Honeychurch , whose sister you will remember at Florence . "
49703	49838	49533	49534	Mr. Emerson	150	" How do you do ? Very glad to see you , and that you are taking George for a bathe . Very glad to hear that your sister is going to marry . Marriage is a duty . I am sure that she will be happy , for we know Mr. Vyse , too . He has been most kind . He met us by chance in the National Gallery , and arranged everything about this delightful house . Though I hope I have not vexed Sir Harry Otway . I have met so few Liberal landowners , and I was anxious to compare his attitude towards the game laws with the Conservative attitude . Ah , this wind ! You do well to bathe . Yours is a glorious country , Honeychurch ! "
49839	49844	49846	49846	Freddy	124	" Not a bit ! "
49848	49878	49846	49846	Freddy	124	" I must -- that is to say , I have to -- have the pleasure of calling on you later on , my mother says , I hope . "
49879	49913	49533	49534	Mr. Emerson	150	" CALL , my lad ? Who taught us that drawing - room twaddle ? Call on your grandmother ! Listen to the wind among the pines ! Yours is a glorious country . "
49921	49988	49533	49534	Mr. Emerson	150	" Mr. Emerson , he will call , I shall call ; you or your son will return our calls before ten days have elapsed . I trust that you have realized about the ten days ' interval . It does not count that I helped you with the stair - eyes yesterday . It does not count that they are going to bathe this afternoon . "
49989	50044	49533	49534	Mr. Emerson	150	" Yes , go and bathe , George . Why do you dawdle talking ? Bring them back to tea . Bring back some milk , cakes , honey . The change will do you good . George has been working very hard at his office . I ca n't believe he 's well . "
50065	50073	50074	50074	Freddy	124	" Do you really want this bathe ? "
50078	50100	50074	50074	Freddy	124	" It is only a pond , do n't you know . I dare say you are used to something better . "
50101	50112	50047	50047	his	118	" Yes -- I have said ' Yes ' already . "
50249	50275	50412	50413	the clergyman	335	" And what a coincidence that you should meet Mr. Vyse ! Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here ? "
50276	50286	50412	50413	the clergyman	335	" I did not . Miss Lavish told me . "
50287	50307	50412	50413	the clergyman	335	" When I was a young man , I always meant to write a ' History of Coincidence . ' "
50311	50348	50412	50413	the clergyman	335	" Though , as a matter of fact , coincidences are much rarer than we suppose . For example , it is n't purely coincidentally that you are here now , when one comes to reflect . "
50358	50401	50412	50413	the clergyman	335	" It is . I have reflected . It is Fate . Everything is Fate . We are flung together by Fate , drawn apart by Fate -- flung together , drawn apart . The twelve winds blow us -- we settle nothing-- "
50402	50410	50412	50413	the clergyman	335	" You have not reflected at all , "
50415	50470	50412	50413	the clergyman	335	" Let me give you a useful tip , Emerson : attribute nothing to Fate . Do n't say , ' I did n't do this , ' for you did it , ten to one . Now I 'll cross - question you . Where did you first meet Miss Honeychurch and myself ? "
50471	50474	50412	50413	the clergyman	335	" Italy . "
50475	50492	50412	50413	the clergyman	335	" And where did you meet Mr. Vyse , who is going to marry Miss Honeychurch ? "
50493	50497	50412	50413	the clergyman	335	" National Gallery . "
50498	50543	50412	50413	the clergyman	335	" Looking at Italian art . There you are , and yet you talk of coincidence and Fate . You naturally seek out things Italian , and so do we and our friends . This narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it . "
50544	50553	50555	50555	George	118	" It is Fate that I am here , "
50557	50571	50555	50555	George	118	" But you can call it Italy if it makes you less unhappy . "
50601	50621	50622	50622	Silence	246	" And so for this and for other reasons my ' History of Coincidence ' is still to write . "
50634	50645	50631	50631	he	119	" We are all so glad that you have come . "
50648	50653	50655	50655	Freddy	124	" Here we are ! "
50657	50662	50664	50665	Mr. Beebe	119	" Oh , good ! "
50671	50684	50685	50685	he	119	" In there 's the pond . I wish it was bigger , "
50764	50774	50776	50777	Mr. Beebe	119	" It 's distinctly successful , as ponds go , "
50779	50788	50776	50777	Mr. Beebe	119	" No apologies are necessary for the pond . "
50804	50832	50776	50777	Mr. Beebe	119	" Are n't those masses of willow - herb splendid ? I love willow - herb in seed . What 's the name of this aromatic plant ? "
50842	50885	50776	50777	Mr. Beebe	119	" These abrupt changes of vegetation -- this little spongeous tract of water plants , and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle -- heather , bracken , hurts , pines . Very charming , very charming . "
50886	50895	50897	50897	Freddy	124	" Mr. Beebe , are n't you bathing ? "
50911	50916	50918	50918	Freddy	124	" Water 's wonderful ! "
50923	50928	50930	50930	George	118	" Water 's water , "
51001	51008	51010	51010	Freddy	1497	" Apooshoo , apooshoo , apooshoo , "
51029	51035	51037	51038	the other	2517	" Is it worth it ? "
51065	51087	51143	51143	him	119	" Hee - poof -- I've swallowed a pollywog , Mr. Beebe , water 's wonderful , water 's simply ripping . "
51088	51095	51097	51097	George	118	" Water 's not so bad , "
51110	51120	51143	51143	him	119	" Water 's wonderful . Mr. Beebe , do . "
51121	51126	51143	51143	him	119	" Apooshoo , kouf . "
51217	51224	51240	51240	he	2517	" I may as well wash too "
51422	51430	51432	51432	Freddy	124	" Race you round it , then , "
51519	51544	51483	51483	they	1506	" No . We are what matters . Without us shall no enterprise begin . To us shall all flesh turn in the end . "
51545	51552	51554	51554	Freddy	1514	" A try ! A try ! "
51571	51575	51576	51576	George	118	" Socker rules , "
51587	51590	51483	51483	they	1506	" Goal ! "
51591	51594	51483	51483	they	1506	" Goal ! "
51595	51598	51483	51483	they	1506	" Pass ! "
51599	51605	51607	51608	Mr. Beebe	119	" Take care my watch ! "
51616	51638	51483	51483	they	1506	" Take care my hat ! No , that 's enough , Freddy . Dress now . No , I say ! "
51675	51680	51682	51683	Mr. Beebe	119	" That 'll do ! "
51711	51724	51697	51697	his	119	" Hi ! Steady on ! I see people coming you fellows ! "
51735	51742	51697	51697	his	119	" Hi ! hi ! LADIES ! "
51825	51829	51831	51832	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Gracious alive ! "
51834	51859	51831	51832	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Whoever were those unfortunate people ? Oh , dears , look away ! And poor Mr. Beebe , too ! Whatever has happened ? "
51860	51866	51868	51868	Cecil	198	" Come this way immediately , "
51908	51931	51898	51898	them	1515	" Oh , poor Mr. Beebe ! Was that his waistcoat we left in the path ? Cecil , Mr. Beebe 's waistcoat-- "
51932	51938	51940	51940	Cecil	198	" No business of ours , "
51956	51967	51898	51898	them	1515	" I fancy Mr. Beebe jumped back into the pond . "
51968	51980	51898	51898	them	1515	" This way , please , Mrs. Honeychurch , this way . "
52002	52011	51898	51898	them	1515	" Well , I ca n't help it , "
52035	52046	52019	52019	Freddy	124	" I ca n't be trodden on , can I ? "
52047	52079	51898	51898	them	1515	" Good gracious me , dear ; so it 's you ! What miserable management ! Why not have a comfortable bath at home , with hot and cold laid on ? "
52080	52103	52019	52019	Freddy	124	" Look here , mother , a fellow must wash , and a fellow 's got to dry , and if another fellow-- "
52104	52128	52129	52129	They	1526	" Dear , no doubt you 're right as usual , but you are in no position to argue . Come , Lucy . "
52132	52149	52129	52129	They	1526	" Oh , look -- don't look ! Oh , poor Mr. Beebe ! How unfortunate again-- "
52191	52200	52202	52202	he	118	" And me , I 've swallowed one , "
52207	52235	52202	52202	he	118	" I 've swallowed a pollywog . It wriggleth in my tummy . I shall die -- Emerson you beast , you 've got on my bags . "
52236	52241	52243	52244	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Hush , dears , "
52254	52274	52243	52244	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first . All these colds come of not drying thoroughly . "
52275	52282	52284	52284	Lucy	116	" Mother , do come away , "
52286	52296	52284	52284	Lucy	116	" Oh for goodness ' sake , do come . "
52297	52300	52302	52302	George	118	" Hullo ! "
52334	52342	52331	52331	he	118	" Hullo , Miss Honeychurch ! Hullo ! "
52343	52359	52331	52331	he	118	" Bow , Lucy ; better bow . Whoever is it ? I shall bow . "
52623	52628	52629	52629	she	116	" I will bow , "
52633	52650	52651	52651	She	116	" I will not shake hands with him . That will be just the proper thing . "
52765	52767	52753	52753	he	198	" Yes "
52769	52771	52753	52753	he	198	" No "
52855	52858	52860	52861	her mother	450	" Lucy , "
52868	52876	52860	52861	her mother	450	" is anything the matter with Cecil ? "
52894	52910	52860	52861	her mother	450	" No , I do n't think so , mother ; Cecil 's all right . "
52911	52917	52860	52861	her mother	450	" Perhaps he 's tired . "
52928	52930	52933	52933	her	154	" Because otherwise"--she
52939	52948	52860	52861	her mother	450	displeasure--"because otherwise I can not account for him . "
52949	52964	52860	52861	her mother	450	" I do think Mrs. Butterworth is rather tiresome , if you mean that . "
52965	53007	52860	52861	her mother	450	" Cecil has told you to think so . You were devoted to her as a little girl , and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever . No -- it is just the same thing everywhere . "
53008	53020	52860	52861	her mother	450	" Let me just put your bonnet away , may I ? "
53021	53034	52860	52861	her mother	450	" Surely he could answer her civilly for one half - hour ? "
53035	53045	53047	53047	Lucy	116	" Cecil has a very high standard for people , "
53053	53070	53047	53047	Lucy	116	" It 's part of his ideals -- it is really that that makes him sometimes seem-- "
53071	53095	53097	53098	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Oh , rubbish ! If high ideals make a young man rude , the sooner he gets rid of them the better , "
53105	53120	52860	52861	her mother	450	" Now , mother ! I 've seen you cross with Mrs. Butterworth yourself ! "
53121	53152	52860	52861	her mother	450	" Not in that way . At times I could wring her neck . But not in that way . No . It is the same with Cecil all over . "
53153	53178	52860	52861	her mother	450	" By - the - by -- I never told you . I had a letter from Charlotte while I was away in London . "
53195	53267	52860	52861	her mother	450	" Since Cecil came back from London , nothing appears to please him . Whenever I speak he winces;--I see him , Lucy ; it is useless to contradict me . No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical , but I can not help the drawing - room furniture ; your father bought it and we must put up with it , will Cecil kindly remember . "
53268	53320	52860	52861	her mother	450	" I -- I see what you mean , and certainly Cecil ought n't to . But he does not mean to be uncivil -- he once explained -- it is the things that upset him -- he is easily upset by ugly things -- he is not uncivil to PEOPLE . "
53321	53333	52860	52861	her mother	450	" Is it a thing or a person when Freddy sings ? "
53334	53351	52860	52861	her mother	450	" You ca n't expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do . "
53352	53373	52860	52861	her mother	450	" Then why did n't he leave the room ? Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone 's pleasure ? "
53374	53383	53385	53385	Lucy	116	" We must n't be unjust to people , "
53556	53568	53539	53539	she	116	" Go and dress , dear ; you 'll be late . "
53569	53574	53539	53539	she	116	" All right , mother-- "
53575	53588	53539	53539	she	116	" Do n't say ' All right ' and stop . Go . "
53654	53669	53649	53649	she	116	" Oh , dear , what shall I do , what shall I do ? "
53739	53748	53721	53721	she	116	" I say , those are topping people . "
53749	53806	53721	53721	she	116	" My dear baby , how tiresome you 've been ! You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred Lake ; it 's much too public . It was all right for you but most awkward for everyone else . Do be more careful . You forget the place is growing half suburban . "
53807	53819	53721	53721	she	116	" I say , is anything on to - morrow week ? "
53820	53827	53721	53721	she	116	" Not that I know of . "
53828	53841	53721	53721	she	116	" Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis . "
53842	53863	53721	53721	she	116	" Oh , I would n't do that , Freddy , I would n't do that with all this muddle . "
53864	53888	53721	53721	she	116	" What 's wrong with the court ? They wo n't mind a bump or two , and I 've ordered new balls . "
53889	53902	53721	53721	she	116	" I meant it 's better not . I really mean it . "
53965	53994	53957	53958	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Lucy , what a noise you 're making ! I have something to say to you . Did you say you had had a letter from Charlotte ? "
54000	54014	53957	53958	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Yes . I really ca n't stop . I must dress too . "
54015	54020	53957	53958	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" How 's Charlotte ? "
54021	54025	53957	53958	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" All right . "
54026	54029	53957	53958	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Lucy ! "
54035	54058	53957	53958	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" You 've a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one 's sentences . Did Charlotte mention her boiler ? "
54059	54063	53957	53958	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Her WHAT ? "
54064	54096	53957	53958	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Do n't you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October , and her bath cistern cleaned out , and all kinds of terrible to - doings ? "
54097	54107	54109	54109	Lucy	116	" I ca n't remember all Charlotte 's worries , "
54112	54130	54109	54109	Lucy	116	" I shall have enough of my own , now that you are not pleased with Cecil . "
54145	54163	54142	54142	She	154	" Come here , old lady -- thank you for putting away my bonnet -- kiss me . "
54294	54302	54291	54291	Freddy	124	" Lucy , what 's Emerson like ? "
54303	54310	54312	54312	Lucy	116	" I saw him in Florence , "
54323	54337	54291	54291	Freddy	124	" Is he the clever sort , or is he a decent chap ? "
54338	54350	54291	54291	Freddy	124	" Ask Cecil ; it is Cecil who brought him here . "
54351	54361	54363	54363	Cecil	198	" He is the clever sort , like myself , "
54371	54382	54384	54385	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" How well did you know them at the Bertolini ? "
54387	54405	54291	54291	Freddy	124	" Oh , very slightly . I mean , Charlotte knew them even less than I did . "
54406	54424	54291	54291	Freddy	124	" Oh , that reminds me -- you never told me what Charlotte said in her letter . "
54425	54431	54433	54433	Lucy	116	" One thing and another , "
54447	54480	54437	54437	she	116	" Among other things , that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street , wondered if she 'd come up and see us , and mercifully did n't . "
54481	54493	54545	54545	their	1567	" Lucy , I do call the way you talk unkind . "
54494	54500	54502	54502	Lucy	116	" She was a novelist , "
54557	54570	54553	54553	Her	154	" If books must be written , let them be written by men "
54587	54598	54573	54573	she	154	" This year , next year , now , never , "
54730	54749	54681	54683	a spectral family	1573	" I have been thinking , Lucy , of that letter of Charlotte 's . How is she ? "
54750	54757	54681	54683	a spectral family	1573	" I tore the thing up . "
54758	54774	54681	54683	a spectral family	1573	" Did n't she say how she was ? How does she sound ? Cheerful ? "
54775	54792	54681	54683	a spectral family	1573	" Oh , yes I suppose so -- no -- not very cheerful , I suppose . "
54793	54829	54681	54683	a spectral family	1573	" Then , depend upon it , it IS the boiler . I know myself how water preys upon one 's mind . I would rather anything else -- even a misfortune with the meat . "
54838	54843	54845	54845	Freddy	124	" So would I , "
54864	54871	54872	54872	she	1093	" And I have been thinking , "
54877	54911	54872	54872	she	1093	" surely we could squeeze Charlotte in here next week , and give her a nice holiday while plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish . I have not seen poor Charlotte for so long . "
54936	54941	54942	54942	she	1093	" Mother , no ! "
54945	55006	54942	54942	she	1093	" It 's impossible . We ca n't have Charlotte on the top of the other things ; we 're squeezed to death as it is . Freddy 's got a friend coming Tuesday , there 's Cecil , and you 've promised to take in Minnie Beebe because of the diphtheria scare . It simply ca n't be done . "
55007	55013	54928	54929	her mother	450	" Nonsense ! It can . "
55014	55025	54942	54942	she	1093	" If Minnie sleeps in the bath . Not otherwise . "
55026	55033	54928	54929	her mother	450	" Minnie can sleep with you . "
55034	55041	54942	54942	she	1093	" I wo n't have her . "
55042	55060	54928	54929	her mother	450	" Then , if you 're so selfish , Mr. Floyd must share a room with Freddy . "
55061	55071	55073	55073	Cecil	198	" Miss Bartlett , Miss Bartlett , Miss Bartlett , "
55083	55088	55090	55090	Lucy	116	" It 's impossible , "
55092	55117	55090	55090	Lucy	116	" I do n't want to make difficulties , but it really is n't fair on the maids to fill up the house so . "
55120	55133	54928	54929	her mother	450	" The truth is , dear , you do n't like Charlotte . "
55134	55197	55224	55224	herself	154	" No , I do n't . And no more does Cecil . She gets on our nerves . You have n't seen her lately , and do n't realize how tiresome she can be , though so good . So please , mother , do n't worry us this last summer ; but spoil us by not asking her to come . "
55198	55203	55205	55205	Cecil	198	" Hear , hear ! "
55228	55300	55207	55208	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" This is n't very kind of you two . You have each other and all these woods to walk in , so full of beautiful things ; and poor Charlotte has only the water turned off and plumbers . You are young , dears , and however clever young people are , and however many books they read , they will never guess what it feels like to grow old . "
55306	55325	55328	55328	Freddy	124	" I must say Cousin Charlotte was very kind to me that year I called on my bike , "
55330	55360	55328	55328	Freddy	124	" She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool , and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right . "
55361	55389	55393	55393	her	116	" I know , dear . She is kind to everyone , and yet Lucy makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return . "
55446	55469	55440	55440	She	115	" I ca n't help it , mother . I do n't like Charlotte . I admit it 's horrid of me . "
55470	55482	55440	55440	She	115	" From your own account , you told her as much . "
55483	55495	55440	55440	She	115	" Well , she would leave Florence so stupidly . She flurried-- "
55566	55581	55583	55583	Cecil	198	" I suppose Miss Bartlett must come , since she boils eggs so well , "
55601	55612	55614	55614	Freddy	1583	" I did n't mean the egg was WELL boiled , "
55616	55651	55614	55614	Freddy	1583	" because in point of fact she forgot to take it off , and as a matter of fact I do n't care for eggs . I only meant how jolly kind she seemed . "
55676	55687	55688	55688	he	198	" May me and Lucy get down from our chairs ? "
55696	55704	55688	55688	he	198	" We do n't want no dessert . "
55920	55935	55916	55916	she	116	" things that came out of nothing and meant she did n't know what . "
55971	55977	55978	55983	A reader in Lucy 's place	1593	" She loves young Emerson . "
56004	56006	56028	56029	the reader	1592	" nerves "
56107	56112	56114	56115	Mr. Beebe	119	" A nice fellow , "
56117	56138	56114	56115	Mr. Beebe	119	" He will work off his crudities in time . I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully . "
56142	56153	56139	56139	Lucy	116	" He seems in better spirits . He laughs more . "
56154	56157	56159	56160	the clergyman	335	" Yes , "
56162	56168	56159	56160	the clergyman	335	" He is waking up . "
56304	56311	56313	56314	Miss Bartlett	115	" I shall never forgive myself , "
56336	56365	56313	56314	Miss Bartlett	115	" I have upset everything . Bursting in on young people ! But I insist on paying for my cab up . Grant that , at any rate . "
56366	56375	56377	56377	Lucy	116	" Our visitors never do such dreadful things , "
56399	56420	56313	56314	Miss Bartlett	115	" Just what I 've been trying to convince Cousin Charlotte of , Lucy , for the last half hour . "
56421	56431	56433	56434	Miss Bartlett	115	" I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor , "
56443	56465	56313	56314	Miss Bartlett	115	" All right , if you 'd really rather . Five shillings , and I gave a bob to the driver . "
56508	56519	56499	56500	Miss Bartlett	115	" But who am I to give the sovereign to ? "
56520	56531	56533	56533	Lucy	116	" Let 's leave it all till mother comes back , "
56535	56573	56499	56500	Miss Bartlett	115	" No , dear ; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me . We all have our little foibles , and mine is the prompt settling of accounts . "
56644	56676	56772	56774	the other youths	1612	" Please -- please -- I know I am a sad spoil - sport , but it would make me wretched . I should practically be robbing the one who lost . "
56677	56684	56686	56686	Cecil	198	" Freddy owes me fifteen shillings , "
56688	56703	56686	56686	Cecil	198	" So it will work out right if you give the pound to me . "
56704	56708	56710	56711	Miss Bartlett	115	" Fifteen shillings , "
56714	56722	56710	56711	Miss Bartlett	115	" How is that , Mr. Vyse ? "
56723	56749	56686	56686	Cecil	198	" Because , do n't you see , Freddy paid your cab . Give me the pound , and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling . "
56820	56828	56830	56831	Minnie Beebe	225	" But I do n't see that ! "
56840	56854	56830	56831	Minnie Beebe	225	" I do n't see why Mr. Vyse is to have the quid . "
56855	56865	56866	56866	they	1616	" Because of the fifteen shillings and the five , "
56870	56883	56866	56866	they	1616	" Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound , you see . "
56884	56890	56830	56831	Minnie Beebe	225	" But I do n't see-- "
56899	56970	56830	56831	Minnie Beebe	225	" No , thank you . I 'm done . I do n't see why -- Freddy , do n't poke me . Miss Honeychurch , your brother 's hurting me . Ow ! What about Mr. Floyd 's ten shillings ? Ow ! No , I do n't see and I never shall see why Miss What's - her - name should n't pay that bob for the driver . "
56971	56978	56980	56981	Miss Bartlett	115	" I had forgotten the driver , "
56985	57011	56980	56981	Miss Bartlett	115	" Thank you , dear , for reminding me . A shilling was it ? Can any one give me change for half a crown ? "
57012	57018	57020	57022	the young hostess	1617	" I 'll get it , "
57028	57064	56980	56981	Miss Bartlett	115	" Cecil , give me that sovereign . No , give me up that sovereign . I 'll get Euphemia to change it , and we 'll start the whole thing again from the beginning . "
57065	57076	57078	57079	Miss Bartlett	115	" Lucy -- Lucy -- what a nuisance I am ! "
57111	57120	57101	57102	Miss Bartlett	115	" Have you told him about him yet ? "
57121	57128	57130	57130	Lucy	116	" No , I have n't , "
57148	57160	57137	57137	her	116	" Let me see -- a sovereign 's worth of silver . "
57211	57223	57224	57224	she	115	" No , I have n't told Cecil or any one , "
57231	57266	57224	57224	she	115	" I promised you I should n't . Here is your money -- all shillings , except two half - crowns . Would you count it ? You can settle your debt nicely now . "
57290	57294	57295	57295	she	115	" How dreadful ! "
57298	57318	57295	57295	she	115	" how more than dreadful , if Mr. Vyse should come to hear of it from some other source . "
57319	57326	57328	57329	the girl	332	" Oh , no , Charlotte , "
57335	57349	57328	57329	the girl	332	" George Emerson is all right , and what other source is there ? "
57354	57380	57350	57351	Miss Bartlett	115	" For instance , the driver . I saw him looking through the bushes at you , remember he had a violet between his teeth . "
57386	57415	57381	57381	Lucy	116	" We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we are n't careful . How could a Florentine cab - driver ever get hold of Cecil ? "
57416	57424	57328	57329	the girl	332	" We must think of every possibility . "
57425	57433	57381	57381	Lucy	116	" Oh , it 's all right . "
57434	57451	57328	57329	the girl	332	" Or perhaps old Mr. Emerson knows . In fact , he is certain to know . "
57452	57490	57381	57381	Lucy	116	" I do n't care if he does . I was grateful to you for your letter , but even if the news does get round , I think I can trust Cecil to laugh at it . "
57491	57496	57328	57329	the girl	332	" To contradict it ? "
57497	57505	57507	57507	she	116	" No , to laugh at it . "
57525	57553	57520	57520	he	1625	" Very well , dear , you know best . Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young . Ladies are certainly different . "
57554	57559	57560	57560	She	116	" Now , Charlotte ! "
57566	57606	57560	57560	She	116	" You kind , anxious thing . What WOULD you have me do ? First you say ' Do n't tell ' ; and then you say , ' Tell ' . Which is it to be ? Quick ! "
57610	57660	57607	57608	Miss Bartlett	115	" I am no match for you in conversation , dearest . I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence , and you so well able to look after yourself , and so much cleverer in all ways than I am . You will never forgive me . "
57661	57680	57520	57520	he	1625	" Shall we go out , then . They will smash all the china if we do n't . "
57699	57724	57607	57608	Miss Bartlett	115	" Dear , one moment -- we may not have this chance for a chat again . Have you seen the young one yet ? "
57725	57731	57607	57608	Miss Bartlett	115	" Yes , I have . "
57732	57736	57607	57608	Miss Bartlett	115	" What happened ? "
57737	57744	57607	57608	Miss Bartlett	115	" We met at the Rectory . "
57745	57753	57607	57608	Miss Bartlett	115	" What line is he taking up ? "
57754	57811	57607	57608	Miss Bartlett	115	" No line . He talked about Italy , like any other person . It is really all right . What advantage would he get from being a cad , to put it bluntly ? I do wish I could make you see it my way . He really wo n't be any nuisance , Charlotte . "
57812	57827	57607	57608	Miss Bartlett	115	" Once a cad , always a cad . That is my poor opinion . "
57831	57858	57828	57828	Lucy	116	" Cecil said one day -- and I thought it so profound -- that there are two kinds of cads -- the conscious and the subconscious . "
57909	57918	57920	57921	Miss Bartlett	115	" Once a cad , always a cad , "
57923	58103	58104	58104	She	1629	" What I mean by subconscious is that Emerson lost his head . I fell into all those violets , and he was silly and surprised . I do n't think we ought to blame him very much . It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly . It really does ; it makes an enormous difference , and he lost his head : he does n't admire me , or any of that nonsense , one straw . Freddy rather likes him , and has asked him up here on Sunday , so you can judge for yourself . He has improved ; he does n't always look as if he 's going to burst into tears . He is a clerk in the General Manager 's office at one of the big railways -- not a porter ! and runs down to his father for week - ends . Papa was to do with journalism , but is rheumatic and has retired . There ! Now for the garden . "
58114	58145	58104	58104	She	1629	" Suppose we do n't talk about this silly Italian business any more . We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner , with no worriting . "
58367	58374	58376	58376	I	0	" The men say they wo n't go"--"Well
58380	58383	58385	58385	she	115	them"--Minnie says , "
58386	58390	58385	58385	she	115	go?"--"Tell her , no nonsense"--"Anne
58396	58408	58385	58385	she	115	behind!"--"Dearest Lucia , may I trespass upon you for a pin ? "
58663	58690	58645	58645	she	115	" Lucy ! Lucy ! What 's that book ? Who 's been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil ? "
58691	58704	58645	58645	she	115	" It 's only the library book that Cecil 's been reading . "
58705	58721	58645	58645	she	115	" But pick it up , and do n't stand idling there like a flamingo . "
58809	58820	58805	58805	Cecil	198	" What ! you are n't forgetting your Italy already ? "
58856	58871	58805	58805	Cecil	198	" Lucy -- have you a sixpence for Minnie and a shilling for yourself ? "
58889	58955	58805	58805	Cecil	198	" It 's a special collection -- I forget what for . I do beg , no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies ; see that Minnie has a nice bright sixpence . Where is the child ? Minnie ! That book 's all warped . ( Gracious , how plain you look ! ) Put it under the Atlas to press . Minnie ! "
58956	58961	58805	58805	Cecil	198	" Oh , Mrs. Honeychurch-- "
58967	58978	58805	58805	Cecil	198	" Minnie , do n't be late . Here comes the horse"--it
58988	59029	58805	58805	Cecil	198	" Where 's Charlotte ? Run up and hurry her . Why is she so long ? She had nothing to do . She never brings anything but blouses . Poor Charlotte -- How I do detest blouses ! Minnie ! "
59119	59147	59101	59102	Miss Bartlett	115	" Dear Marian , I am very sorry , but I have no small change -- nothing but sovereigns and half crowns . Could any one give me-- "
59148	59176	59101	59102	Miss Bartlett	115	" Yes , easily . Jump in . Gracious me , how smart you look ! What a lovely frock ! You put us all to shame . "
59177	59196	59198	59199	Miss Bartlett	115	" If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now , when should I wear them ? "
59228	59236	59239	59239	Cecil	198	" Good - bye ! Be good ! "
59256	59261	59262	59262	they	1662	" church and so on "
59407	59411	59413	59414	her mother	450	" Introduce me , "
59416	59428	59413	59414	her mother	450	" Unless the young man considers that he knows me already . "
59511	59515	59516	59516	he	261	" Very much , "
59541	59576	59538	59538	He	261	" We find , though , that the Miss Alans were coming , and that we have turned them out . Women mind such a thing . I am very much upset about it . "
59577	59586	59588	59589	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" I believe that there was some misunderstanding , "
59592	59607	59609	59609	George	118	" Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person , "
59620	59632	59609	59609	George	118	" He thought we should be artistic . He is disappointed . "
59633	59658	59659	59659	He	118	" And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up . What do you think ? "
59664	59673	59675	59675	Lucy	116	" Oh , stop now you have come , "
59702	59726	59696	59696	his	198	" So George says . He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall . Yet it does seem so unkind . "
59727	59740	59742	59742	George	118	" There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world , "
59756	59759	59761	59762	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Yes ! "
59764	59783	59761	59762	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" That 's exactly what I say . Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans ? "
59784	59803	59804	59804	he	118	" There is a certain amount of kindness , just as there is a certain amount of light , "
59810	59879	59804	59804	he	118	" We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand , and it is no good moving from place to place to save things ; because the shadow always follows . Choose a place where you wo n't do harm -- yes , choose a place where you wo n't do very much harm , and stand in it for all you are worth , facing the sunshine . "
59880	59892	59932	59933	her mother	450	" Oh , Mr. Emerson , I see you 're clever ! "
59893	59896	59804	59804	he	118	" Eh-- ? "
59897	59920	59932	59933	her mother	450	" I see you 're going to be clever . I hope you did n't go behaving like that to poor Freddy . "
59940	59947	59948	59948	he	118	" No , I did n't , "
59951	59981	59948	59948	he	118	" He behaved that way to me . It is his philosophy . Only he starts life with it ; and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first . "
59982	60021	60078	60078	her	1677	" What DO you mean ? No , never mind what you mean . Do n't explain . He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon . Do you play tennis ? Do you mind tennis on Sunday-- ? "
60022	60038	59948	59948	he	118	" George mind tennis on Sunday ! George , after his education , distinguish between Sunday-- "
60039	60075	60078	60078	her	1677	" Very well , George does n't mind tennis on Sunday . No more do I. That 's settled . Mr. Emerson , if you could come with your son we should be so pleased . "
60101	60116	60096	60096	She	1677	" And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans . "
60117	60121	60123	60123	George	118	" I know , "
60185	60194	60196	60197	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" You know our cousin , Miss Bartlett , "
60200	60210	60196	60197	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" You met her with my daughter in Florence . "
60211	60216	60218	60220	the old man	313	" Yes , indeed ! "
60316	60330	60313	60313	He	118	" I -- I'll come up to tennis if I can manage it , "
60422	60429	60431	60432	his father	350	" George , do n't go , "
60450	60473	60431	60432	his father	350	" George has been in such good spirits today , and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon . "
60490	60493	60494	60494	she	116	" Yes , "
60501	60508	60494	60494	she	116	" I do hope he will . "
60518	60534	60510	60510	she	116	" The old man has n't been told ; I knew it was all right . "
60602	60613	60614	60614	Her	116	" He has not told , he has not told . "
60620	60652	60614	60614	Her	116	" He has not told his father -- to whom he tells all things . It was not an exploit . He did not laugh at me when I had gone . "
60661	60687	60653	60653	She	116	" He does not love me . No . How terrible if he did ! But he has not told . He will not tell . "
60695	60716	60688	60688	She	116	" It is all right . It 's a secret between us two for ever . Cecil will never hear . "
60798	60812	60787	60787	he	198	" The Emersons have been so nice . George Emerson has improved enormously . "
60813	60819	60821	60821	Cecil	198	" How are my proteges ? "
60848	60851	60852	60852	she	116	" Proteges ! "
60889	60920	60921	60921	She	116	" You shall see for yourself how your proteges are . George Emerson is coming up this afternoon . He is a most interesting man to talk to . Only don't-- "
60925	60931	60921	60921	She	116	" Do n't protect him . "
61010	61034	61002	61008	a Being who whispered to her soul	1711	" It will not last , this cheerfulness . In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men . "
61169	61182	61160	61160	Cecil	198	" Now play us the other garden -- the one in Parsifal . "
61188	61193	61195	61196	her mother	450	" Not very dutiful , "
61224	61232	61233	61233	she	116	" Oh , I had no idea ! "
61267	61275	61277	61278	Miss Bartlett	115	" Our performer has changed her mind , "
61325	61330	61332	61332	Freddy	124	" I vote tennis , "
61340	61346	61349	61349	she	116	" Yes , so do I. "
61355	61365	61349	61349	she	116	" I vote you have a men 's four . "
61366	61370	61404	61406	a bad player	1720	" All right . "
61371	61379	61381	61381	Cecil	198	" Not for me , thank you , "
61383	61391	61381	61381	Cecil	198	" I will not spoil the set . "
61413	61436	61381	61381	Cecil	198	" Oh , come along Cecil . I 'm bad , Floyd 's rotten , and so I dare say 's Emerson . "
61441	61447	61437	61437	George	118	" I am not bad . "
61457	61465	61467	61467	Cecil	198	" Then certainly I wo n't play , "
61484	61504	61470	61471	Miss Bartlett	115	" I agree with you , Mr. Vyse . You had much better not play . Much better not . "
61521	61535	61537	61537	Sunday	266	" I shall miss every ball anyway , so what does it matter ? "
61547	61556	61558	61559	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Then it will have to be Lucy , "
61561	61586	61558	61559	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" you must fall back on Lucy . There is no other way out of it . Lucy , go and change your frock . "
61747	61758	61733	61733	he	118	" I shall want to live , I tell you . "
61960	61974	61947	61947	He	198	" I say , listen to this , Lucy . Three split infinitives . "
61975	61978	61980	61980	Lucy	116	" Dreadful ! "
62036	62044	62031	62033	the other two	1740	" The scene is laid in Florence . "
62045	62066	62067	62067	She	116	" What fun , Cecil ! Read away . Come , Mr. Emerson , sit down after all your energy . "
62069	62071	62072	62072	George	118	" forgiven "
62103	62111	62090	62090	He	198	" You -- and are you tired ? "
62112	62119	62148	62148	she	116	" Of course I 'm not ! "
62120	62127	62090	62090	He	198	" Do you mind being beaten ? "
62134	62137	62128	62128	She	116	" No , "
62151	62154	62155	62155	She	116	" Yes . "
62159	62186	62155	62155	She	116	" I do n't see you 're such a splendid player , though . The light was behind you , and it was in my eyes . "
62187	62194	62128	62128	She	116	" I never said I was . "
62195	62201	62155	62155	She	116	" Why , you did ! "
62202	62208	62128	62128	She	116	" You did n't attend . "
62209	62240	62155	62155	She	116	" You said -- oh , do n't go in for accuracy at this house . We all exaggerate , and we get very angry with people who do n't . "
62241	62251	62253	62253	Cecil	198	" ' The scene is laid in Florence , ' "
62264	62272	62155	62155	She	116	" ' Sunset . Leonora was speeding-- ' "
62276	62290	62273	62273	Lucy	116	" Leonora ? Is Leonora the heroine ? Who 's the book by ? "
62291	62340	62155	62155	She	116	" Joseph Emery Prank . ' Sunset . Leonora speeding across the square . Pray the saints she might not arrive too late . Sunset -- the sunset of Italy . Under Orcagna 's Loggia -- the Loggia de ' Lanzi , as we sometimes call it now-- ' "
62346	62378	62341	62341	Lucy	116	" ' Joseph Emery Prank ' indeed ! Why it 's Miss Lavish ! It 's Miss Lavish 's novel , and she 's publishing it under somebody else 's name . "
62379	62386	62155	62155	She	116	" Who may Miss Lavish be ? "
62387	62402	62341	62341	Lucy	116	" Oh , a dreadful person -- Mr. Emerson , you remember Miss Lavish ? "
62418	62446	62414	62414	George	118	" Of course I do . I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street . It was she who told me that you lived here . "
62447	62453	62454	62454	She	116	" Were n't you pleased ? "
62456	62462	62414	62414	George	118	" to see Miss Lavish , "
62506	62514	62515	62515	she	116	" No wonder the novel 's bad , "
62518	62539	62515	62515	she	116	" I never liked Miss Lavish . But I suppose one ought to read it as one 's met her . "
62540	62547	62549	62549	Cecil	198	" All modern books are bad , "
62565	62575	62560	62560	his	198	" Every one writes for money in these days . "
62576	62581	62614	62614	his	118	" Oh , Cecil-- ! "
62582	62598	62560	62560	his	198	" It is so . I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer . "
62682	62695	62647	62647	him	118	" How do you like this view of ours , Mr. Emerson ? "
62696	62705	62647	62647	him	118	" I never notice much difference in views . "
62706	62712	62647	62647	him	118	" What do you mean ? "
62713	62731	62647	62647	him	118	" Because they 're all alike . Because all that matters in them is distance and air . "
62732	62735	62737	62737	Cecil	198	" H'm ! "
62748	62750	62757	62757	he	118	" My father"--he
62761	62794	62757	62757	he	118	flushed)--"says that there is only one perfect view -- the view of the sky straight over our heads , and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it . "
62795	62805	62807	62807	Cecil	198	" I expect your father has been reading Dante , "
62822	62871	62913	62913	He	198	" He told us another day that views are really crowds -- crowds of trees and houses and hills -- and are bound to resemble each other , like human crowds -- and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural , for the same reason . "
62877	62912	62913	62913	He	198	" For a crowd is more than the people who make it up . Something gets added to it -- no one knows how -- just as something has got added to those hills . "
62923	62929	62930	62930	she	116	" What a splendid idea ! "
62933	62953	62930	62930	she	116	" I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again . I 'm so sorry he 's not so well . "
62954	62962	62913	62913	He	198	" No , he is n't well . "
62963	62976	62978	62978	Cecil	198	" There 's an absurd account of a view in this book , "
62980	63004	62978	62978	Cecil	198	" Also that men fall into two classes -- those who forget views and those who remember them , even in small rooms . "
63005	63016	62913	62913	He	198	" Mr. Emerson , have you any brothers or sisters ? "
63017	63022	62978	62978	Cecil	198	" None . Why ? "
63023	63031	62913	62913	He	198	" You spoke of ' us . ' "
63032	63040	62978	62978	Cecil	198	" My mother , I was meaning . "
63049	63060	63110	63111	the man	2384	" Oh , Cecil -- how you made me jump ! "
63061	63073	63110	63111	the man	2384	" I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer . "
63074	63105	63110	63111	the man	2384	" I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead . It is the first thing that I remember . "
63144	63155	63127	63127	he	2384	" Cecil , do read the thing about the view . "
63156	63167	63127	63127	he	2384	" Not while Mr. Emerson is here to entertain us . "
63168	63199	63127	63127	he	2384	" No -- read away . I think nothing 's funnier than to hear silly things read out loud . If Mr. Emerson thinks us frivolous , he can go . "
63229	63239	63240	63240	She	116	" Mr. Emerson , go and find tennis balls . "
63295	63302	63304	63304	George	118	" Am I really to go ? "
63306	63314	63315	63315	she	116	" No , of course not really , "
63318	63322	63324	63324	Cecil	198	" Chapter two , "
63328	63341	63324	63324	Cecil	198	" Find me chapter two , if it is n't bothering you . "
63362	63370	63324	63324	Cecil	198	" Here -- hand me the book . "
63377	63407	63373	63373	her	116	" It is n't worth reading -- it 's too silly to read -- I never saw such rubbish -- it ought n't to be allowed to be printed . "
63415	63420	63421	63421	he	198	" ' Leonora , ' "
63424	63454	63421	63421	he	198	" ' sat pensive and alone . Before her lay the rich champaign of Tuscany , dotted over with many a smiling village . The season was spring . ' "
63480	63487	63488	63488	he	198	" ' A golden haze , ' "
63494	63523	63491	63491	He	198	" ' Afar off the towers of Florence , while the bank on which she sat was carpeted with violets . All unobserved Antonio stole up behind her-- ' "
63542	63583	63539	63539	He	118	" ' There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use . No eloquence was his , nor did he suffer from the lack of it . He simply enfolded her in his manly arms . ' "
63584	63593	63594	63594	he	118	" This is n't the passage I wanted , "
63598	63608	63609	63609	He	118	" there is another much funnier , further on . "
63615	63623	63625	63625	Lucy	116	" Should we go in to tea ? "
63703	63705	63706	63706	she	116	" No-- "
63799	63817	63794	63794	She	116	" I am not coming in to tea -- tell mother -- I must write some letters , "
63949	63954	63948	63948	She	116	" conquered her breakdown . "
64045	64052	64053	64053	she	116	" Something too awful has happened , "
64063	64074	64053	64053	she	116	" Do you know anything about Miss Lavish 's novel ? "
64105	64126	64075	64076	Miss Bartlett	115	" There is a scene in it . The hero and heroine make love . Do you know about that ? "
64127	64130	64083	64083	she	115	" Dear-- ? "
64131	64140	64141	64141	she	116	" Do you know about it , please ? "
64144	64158	64141	64141	she	116	" They are on a hillside , and Florence is in the distance . "
64159	64177	64083	64083	she	115	" My good Lucia , I am all at sea . I know nothing about it whatever . "
64178	64214	64141	64141	she	116	" There are violets . I can not believe it is a coincidence . Charlotte , Charlotte , how could you have told her ? I have thought before speaking ; it must be you . "
64215	64220	64221	64221	she	116	" Told her what ? "
64228	64236	64083	64083	she	115	" About that dreadful afternoon in February . "
64243	64260	64237	64238	Miss Bartlett	115	" Oh , Lucy , dearest girl -- she has n't put that in her book ? "
64264	64275	64141	64141	she	116	" Not so that one could recognize it . Yes . "
64276	64293	64141	64141	she	116	" Then never -- never -- never more shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine . "
64294	64300	64141	64141	she	116	" So you did tell ? "
64301	64321	64141	64141	she	116	" I did just happen -- when I had tea with her at Rome -- in the course of conversation-- "
64322	64355	64141	64141	she	116	" But Charlotte -- what about the promise you gave me when we were packing ? Why did you tell Miss Lavish , when you would n't even let me tell mother ? "
64356	64369	64141	64141	she	116	" I will never forgive Eleanor . She has betrayed my confidence . "
64370	64386	64141	64141	she	116	" Why did you tell her , though ? This is a most serious thing . "
64447	64501	64442	64442	Lucy	116	" Cecil happened to read out the passage aloud to me and to Mr. Emerson ; it upset Mr. Emerson and he insulted me again . Behind Cecil 's back . Ugh ! Is it possible that men are such brutes ? Behind Cecil 's back as we were walking up the garden . "
64512	64525	64442	64442	Lucy	116	" What is to be done now ? Can you tell me ? "
64526	64547	64442	64442	Lucy	116	" Oh , Lucy -- I shall never forgive myself , never to my dying day . Fancy if your prospects-- "
64548	64552	64554	64554	Lucy	116	" I know , "
64561	64600	64554	64554	Lucy	116	" I see now why you wanted me to tell Cecil , and what you meant by ' some other source . ' You knew that you had told Miss Lavish , and that she was not reliable . "
64610	64613	64615	64616	the girl	332	" However , "
64624	64650	64615	64616	the girl	332	" What 's done 's done . You have put me in a most awkward position . How am I to get out of it ? "
64696	64783	64687	64688	the girl	332	" He must -- that man must have such a setting down that he wo n't forget . And who 's to give it him ? I ca n't tell mother now -- owing to you . Nor Cecil , Charlotte , owing to you . I am caught up every way . I think I shall go mad . I have no one to help me . That 's why I 've sent for you . What 's wanted is a man with a whip . "
64796	64830	64790	64794	a man with a whip	3203	" Yes -- but it 's no good agreeing . What 's to be DONE . We women go maundering on . What DOES a girl do when she comes across a cad ? "
64831	64868	64784	64785	Miss Bartlett	115	" I always said he was a cad , dear . Give me credit for that , at all events . From the very first moment -- when he said his father was having a bath . "
64869	64919	64790	64794	a man with a whip	3203	" Oh , bother the credit and who 's been right or wrong ! We 've both made a muddle of it . George Emerson is still down the garden there , and is he to be left unpunished , or is n't he ? I want to know . "
64962	64987	64790	64794	a man with a whip	3203	" You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome . Ca n't you speak again to him now ? "
64988	64996	64953	64954	the cad	1771	" Willingly would I move heaven and earth-- "
64997	65004	65006	65006	Lucy	116	" I want something more definite , "
65009	65036	65006	65006	Lucy	116	" Will you speak to him ? It is the least you can do , surely , considering it all happened because you broke your word . "
65037	65049	64953	64954	the cad	1771	" Never again shall Eleanor Lavish be a friend of mine . "
65057	65068	64953	64954	the cad	1771	" Yes or no , please ; yes or no . "
65069	65083	65084	65085	George Emerson	118	" It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle . "
65099	65103	65105	65105	Lucy	116	" Very well , "
65112	65126	65105	65105	Lucy	116	" No one will help me . I will speak to him myself . "
65142	65147	65149	65149	Freddy	124	" Hullo , Emerson ! "
65153	65166	65149	65149	Freddy	124	" Found the lost ball ? Good man ! Want any tea ? "
65180	65195	65234	65234	him	118	" Oh , Lucy , but that is brave of you ! I admire you-- "
65259	65299	65247	65247	She	116	" Freddy has taken him into the dining - room . The others are going down the garden . Come . Let us get this over quickly . Come . I want you in the room , of course . "
65300	65309	65244	65244	their	143	" Lucy , do you mind doing it ? "
65310	65320	65247	65247	She	116	" How can you ask such a ridiculous question ? "
65321	65324	65325	65325	She	116	" Poor Lucy-- "
65331	65343	65344	65344	Lucy	116	" I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go . "
65396	65401	65402	65402	Freddy	124	" Try the jam , "
65406	65413	65402	65402	Freddy	124	" The jam 's jolly good . "
65440	65447	65434	65434	he	118	" No -- nothing to eat . "
65448	65456	65458	65458	Lucy	116	" You go down to the others , "
65460	65476	65458	65458	Lucy	116	" Charlotte and I will give Mr. Emerson all he wants . Where 's mother ? "
65477	65494	65434	65434	he	118	" She 's started on her Sunday writing . She 's in the drawing - room . "
65495	65505	65458	65458	Lucy	116	" That 's all right . You go away . "
65549	65585	65545	65545	She	115	" I ca n't have it , Mr. Emerson . I can not even talk to you . Go out of this house , and never come into it again as long as I live here-- "
65596	65605	65588	65588	she	115	" I hate a row . Go please . "
65606	65608	65588	65588	she	115	" What-- "
65609	65613	65588	65588	she	115	" No discussion . "
65614	65618	65588	65588	she	115	" But I can't-- "
65624	65639	65621	65621	her	115	" Go , please . I do not want to call in Mr. Vyse . "
65640	65646	65647	65647	he	118	" You do n't mean , "
65653	65666	65621	65621	her	115	Bartlett--"you do n't mean that you are going to marry that man ? "
65684	65690	65691	65691	she	115	" You are merely ridiculous , "
65703	65739	65696	65696	his	118	" You can not live with Vyse . He 's only for an acquaintance . He is for society and cultivated talk . He should know no one intimately , least of all a woman . "
65750	65761	65696	65696	his	118	" Have you ever talked to Vyse without feeling tired ? "
65762	65767	65696	65696	his	118	" I can scarcely discuss-- "
65768	66146	65696	65696	his	118	" No , but have you ever ? He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things -- books , pictures -- but kill when they come to people . That 's why I 'll speak out through all this muddle even now . It 's shocking enough to lose you in any case , but generally a man must deny himself joy , and I would have held back if your Cecil had been a different person . I would never have let myself go . But I saw him first in the National Gallery , when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters . Then he brings us here , and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour . That is the man all over -- playing tricks on people , on the most sacred form of life that he can find . Next , I meet you together , and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked , when it was for YOU to settle whether you were shocked or no . Cecil all over again . He dare n't let a woman decide . He 's the type who 's kept Europe back for a thousand years . Every moment of his life he 's forming you , telling you what 's charming or amusing or ladylike , telling you what a man thinks womanly ; and you , you of all women , listen to his voice instead of to your own . So it was at the Rectory , when I met you both again ; so it has been the whole of this afternoon . Therefore -- not ' therefore I kissed you , ' because the book made me do that , and I wish to goodness I had more self - control . I 'm not ashamed . I do n't apologize . But it has frightened you , and you may not have noticed that I love you . Or would you have told me to go , and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly ? But therefore -- therefore I settled to fight him . "
66155	66181	66456	66456	his	1784	" You say Mr. Vyse wants me to listen to him , Mr. Emerson . Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit . "
66197	66203	66194	66194	He	1782	" Yes , I have , "
66212	66264	66265	66265	He	1782	" I 'm the same kind of brute at bottom . This desire to govern a woman -- it lies very deep , and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden . But I do love you surely in a better way than he does . "
66268	66294	66295	66295	He	1782	" Yes -- really in a better way . I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms . "
66301	66411	66295	66295	He	1782	" Lucy , be quick -- there 's no time for us to talk now -- come to me as you came in the spring , and afterwards I will be gentle and explain . I have cared for you since that man died . I can not live without you , ' No good , ' I thought ; ' she is marrying someone else ' ; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun . As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered . I called . I wanted to live and have my chance of joy . "
66412	66417	66419	66419	Lucy	116	" And Mr. Vyse ? "
66426	66452	66419	66419	Lucy	116	" Does he not matter ? That I love Cecil and shall be his wife shortly ? A detail of no importance , I suppose ? "
66464	66477	66419	66419	Lucy	116	" May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition ? "
66481	66496	66478	66478	He	1784	" It is our last chance . I shall do all that I can . "
66524	66537	66538	66538	he	1784	" You would n't stop us this second time if you understood , "
66541	66564	66538	66538	he	1784	" I have been into the dark , and I am going back into it , unless you will try to understand . "
66587	66593	66594	66594	he	1784	" It is being young , "
66610	66631	66594	66594	he	1784	" It is being certain that Lucy cares for me really . It is that love and youth matter intellectually . "
66733	66749	66727	66727	they	1786	" Oh , Lucia -- come back here -- oh , what an awful man ! "
66761	66768	66769	66769	she	116	" Well , he amuses me , "
66772	66825	66769	66769	she	116	" Either I 'm mad , or else he is , and I 'm inclined to think it 's the latter . One more fuss through with you , Charlotte . Many thanks . I think , though , that this is the last . My admirer will hardly trouble me again . "
66836	66888	66769	66769	she	116	" Well , it is n't everyone who could boast such a conquest , dearest , is it ? Oh , one ought n't to laugh , really . It might have been very serious . But you were so sensible and brave -- so unlike the girls of my day . "
66889	66897	66769	66769	she	116	" Let 's go down to them . "
67001	67020	67140	67140	she	116	" Hullo , Lucy ! There 's still light enough for another set , if you two'll hurry . "
67021	67029	67140	67140	she	116	" Mr. Emerson has had to go . "
67030	67073	67140	67140	she	116	" What a nuisance ! That spoils the four . I say , Cecil , do play , do , there 's a good chap . It 's Floyd 's last day . Do play tennis with us , just this once . "
67079	67129	67074	67074	Cecil	198	" My dear Freddy , I am no athlete . As you well remarked this very morning , ' There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books ' ; I plead guilty to being such a chap , and will not inflict myself on you . "
67260	67268	67269	67269	she	116	" I am very sorry about it , "
67272	67306	67269	67269	she	116	" I have carefully thought things over . We are too different . I must ask you to release me , and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl . "
67327	67333	67322	67322	her	116	" Different -- how -- how-- "
67334	67348	67349	67349	she	116	" I have n't had a really good education , for one thing , "
67360	67398	67349	67349	she	116	" My Italian trip came too late , and I am forgetting all that I learnt there . I shall never be able to talk to your friends , or behave as a wife of yours should . "
67399	67418	67322	67322	her	116	" I do n't understand you . You are n't like yourself . You 're tired , Lucy . "
67419	67422	67423	67423	she	116	" Tired ! "
67430	67448	67423	67423	she	116	" That is exactly like you . You always think women do n't mean what they say . "
67449	67463	67322	67322	her	116	" Well , you sound tired , as if something has worried you . "
67464	67497	67423	67423	she	116	" What if I do ? It does n't prevent me from realizing the truth . I ca n't marry you , and you will thank me for saying so some day . "
67498	67507	67508	67508	she	116	" You had that bad headache yesterday -- All right"--for
67513	67531	67508	67508	she	116	" I see it 's much more than headaches . But give me a moment 's time . "
67537	67592	67532	67532	He	1794	" You must excuse me if I say stupid things , but my brain has gone to pieces . Part of it lives three minutes back , when I was sure that you loved me , and the other part -- I find it difficult -- I am likely to say the wrong thing . "
67628	67690	67625	67625	she	116	" There are days when one sees clearly , and this is one of them . Things must come to a breaking - point some time , and it happens to be to - day . If you want to know , quite a little thing decided me to speak to you -- when you would n't play tennis with Freddy . "
67691	67698	67700	67700	Cecil	198	" I never do play tennis , "
67705	67720	67700	67700	Cecil	198	" I never could play . I do n't understand a word you say . "
67721	67741	67625	67625	she	116	" You can play well enough to make up a four . I thought it abominably selfish of you . "
67742	67787	67700	67700	Cecil	198	" No , I can't -- well , never mind the tennis . Why could n't you -- couldn't you have warned me if you felt anything wrong ? You talked of our wedding at lunch -- at least , you let me talk . "
67788	67796	67798	67798	Lucy	116	" I knew you would n't understand , "
67802	67851	67852	67852	She	116	" I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations . Of course , it is n't the tennis -- that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks . Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain . "
67857	67963	67852	67852	She	116	" Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife -- for instance , in London ; and are you fitted to be my husband ? I do n't think so . You do n't like Freddy , nor my mother . There was always a lot against our engagement , Cecil , but all our relations seemed pleased , and we met so often , and it was no good mentioning it until -- well , until all things came to a point . They have to - day . I see clearly . I must speak . That 's all . "
67964	67973	67975	67975	Cecil	198	" I can not think you were right , "
67978	68010	67975	67975	Cecil	198	" I can not tell why , but though all that you say sounds true , I feel that you are not treating me fairly . It 's all too horrible . "
68011	68020	67852	67852	She	116	" What 's the good of a scene ? "
68021	68037	67975	67975	Cecil	198	" No good . But surely I have a right to hear a little more . "
68078	68082	68083	68083	his	198	" little more , "
68089	68114	68115	68115	He	198	" Do n't open the window ; and you 'd better draw the curtain , too ; Freddy or any one might be outside . "
68118	68163	68115	68115	He	198	" I really think we had better go to bed , if you do n't mind . I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards . As you say it is all too horrible , and it is no good talking . "
68247	68261	68244	68244	he	198	" But I love you , and I did think you loved me ! "
68262	68267	68268	68268	she	1795	" I did not , "
68271	68295	68268	68268	she	1795	" I thought I did at first . I am sorry , and ought to have refused you this last time , too . "
68351	68381	68409	68409	his	198	" You do n't love me , evidently . I dare say you are right not to . But it would hurt a little less if I knew why . "
68382	68383	68387	68387	her	1795	" Because"--a
68392	68403	68387	68387	her	1795	it--"you're the sort who ca n't know any one intimately . "
68412	68467	68468	68468	Her	1795	" I do n't mean exactly that . But you will question me , though I beg you not to , and I must say something . It is that , more or less . When we were only acquaintances , you let me be myself , but now you 're always protecting me . "
68472	68544	68547	68547	her	1795	" I wo n't be protected . I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right . To shield me is an insult . Ca n't I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second - hand through you ? A woman 's place ! You despise my mother -- I know you do -- because she 's conventional and bothers over puddings ; but , oh goodness!"--she
68548	68646	68647	68647	She	1795	feet--"conventional , Cecil , you 're that , for you may understand beautiful things , but you do n't know how to use them ; and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music , and would try to wrap up me . I wo n't be stifled , not by the most glorious music , for people are more glorious , and you hide them from me . That 's why I break off my engagement . You were all right as long as you kept to things , but when you came to people-- "
68662	68667	68656	68656	Cecil	198	" It is true . "
68668	68674	68675	68675	she	1795	" True on the whole , "
68684	68699	68656	68656	Cecil	198	" True , every word . It is a revelation . It is -- I. "
68700	68713	68656	68656	Cecil	198	" Anyhow , those are my reasons for not being your wife . "
68717	68765	68714	68714	He	198	" ' The sort that can know no one intimately . ' It is true . I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged . I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother . You are even greater than I thought . "
68771	68879	68766	68766	She	1795	" I 'm not going to worry you . You are far too good to me . I shall never forget your insight ; and , dear , I only blame you for this : you might have warned me in the early stages , before you felt you would n't marry me , and so have given me a chance to improve . I have never known you till this evening . I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be . But this evening you are a different person : new thoughts -- even a new voice-- "
68880	68890	68891	68891	she	1799	" What do you mean by a new voice ? "
68899	68911	68913	68913	he	1800	" I mean that a new person seems speaking through you , "
68924	68942	68921	68921	She	1799	" If you think I am in love with someone else , you are very much mistaken . "
68943	68960	68766	68766	She	1795	" Of course I do n't think that . You are not that kind , Lucy . "
68961	69049	68921	68921	She	1799	" Oh , yes , you do think it . It 's your old idea , the idea that has kept Europe back -- I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men . If a girl breaks off her engagement , everyone says : ' Oh , she had some one else in her mind ; she hopes to get someone else . ' It 's disgusting , brutal ! As if a girl ca n't break it off for the sake of freedom . "
69054	69077	69050	69050	He	1801	" I may have said that in the past . I shall never say it again . You have taught me better . "
69091	69151	69078	69078	She	1801	" Of course , there is no question of ' someone else ' in this , no ' jilting ' or any such nauseous stupidity . I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was . I only meant that there was a force in you that I had n't known of up till now . "
69152	69173	68921	68921	She	1799	" All right , Cecil , that will do . Do n't apologize to me . It was my mistake . "
69174	69216	69217	69217	His	1802	" It is a question between ideals , yours and mine -- pure abstract ideals , and yours are the nobler . I was bound up in the old vicious notions , and all the time you were splendid and new . "
69221	69258	69217	69217	His	1802	" I must actually thank you for what you have done -- for showing me what I really am . Solemnly , I thank you for showing me a true woman . Will you shake hands ? "
69259	69265	69267	69267	Lucy	116	" Of course I will , "
69278	69308	69267	69267	Lucy	116	" Good - night , Cecil . Good - bye . That 's all right . I 'm sorry about it . Thank you very much for your gentleness . "
69309	69319	69217	69217	His	1802	" Let me light your candle , shall I ? "
69326	69341	69352	69352	him	1805	" Thank you . Good - night again . God bless you , Lucy ! "
69342	69349	69320	69320	They	1803	" Good - bye , Cecil . "
69910	69913	69936	69937	expensive architects	1842	" did , "
70031	70042	70044	70045	Miss Catharine	146	" Since Florence did my poor sister so much good , "
70047	70113	70044	70045	Miss Catharine	146	" we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter . Of course , Athens is a plunge , and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread ; but , after all , we can take that with us , and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train . But is there an English Church ? "
70122	70153	70044	70045	Miss Catharine	146	" I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens , but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople , we should be so grateful . "
70500	70512	70513	70513	he	335	" So you 're off for a minute , Mr. Vyse ? "
70519	70522	70516	70516	Cecil	198	" Yes , "
70528	70545	70546	70546	He	335	" I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of Miss Honeychurch . "
70551	70590	70546	70546	He	335	" Is n't it wonderful ? Is n't it romance ? Most certainly they will go to Constantinople . They are taken in a snare that can not fail . They will end by going round the world . "
70608	70709	70751	70751	he	198	" Is n't Romance capricious ! I never notice it in you young people ; you do nothing but play lawn tennis , and say that romance is dead , while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing . ' A really comfortable pension at Constantinople ! ' So they call it out of decency , but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn ! No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans . They want the Pension Keats . "
70710	70721	70723	70723	Freddy	124	" I 'm awfully sorry to interrupt , Mr. Beebe , "
70725	70732	70723	70723	Freddy	124	" but have you any matches ? "
70733	70737	70739	70739	Cecil	198	" I have , "
70759	70774	70751	70751	he	198	" You have never met these Miss Alans , have you , Mr. Vyse ? "
70775	70778	70751	70751	he	198	" Never . "
70779	70911	70751	70751	he	198	" Then you do n't see the wonder of this Greek visit . I have n't been to Greece myself , and do n't mean to go , and I ca n't imagine any of my friends going . It is altogether too big for our little lot . Do n't you think so ? Italy is just about as much as we can manage . Italy is heroic , but Greece is godlike or devilish -- I am not sure which , and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus . All right , Freddy -- I am not being clever , upon my word I am not -- I took the idea from another fellow ; and give me those matches when you 've done with them . "
70927	70995	70912	70912	He	1868	" I was saying , if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background , let it be Italian . Big enough in all conscience . The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me . There the contrast is just as much as I can realize . But not the Parthenon , not the frieze of Phidias at any price ; and here comes the victoria . "
70996	71002	71004	71004	Cecil	198	" You 're quite right , "
71006	71014	71017	71017	he	1868	" Greece is not for our little lot "
71079	71121	71076	71076	he	124	" I 'm so glad you only talked about books . Cecil 's hard hit . Lucy wo n't marry him . If you 'd gone on about her , as you did about them , he might have broken down . "
71122	71125	71076	71076	he	124	" But when-- "
71126	71135	71076	71076	he	124	" Late last night . I must go . "
71136	71146	71076	71076	he	124	" Perhaps they wo n't want me down there . "
71147	71157	71076	71076	he	124	" No -- go on . Good - bye . "
71158	71162	71164	71165	Mr. Beebe	119	" Thank goodness ! "
71178	71196	71204	71204	he	124	" It was the one foolish thing she ever did . Oh , what a glorious riddance ! "
71328	71333	71327	71331	the " garden - child	3338	" garden - child , "
71349	71425	71327	71331	the " garden - child	3338	" Oh , how do you do , Mr. Beebe ? Gracious what a mess everything is ! Look at my scarlet pompoms , and the wind blowing your skirts about , and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in , and then the carriage having to go out , when I had counted on having Powell , who -- give every one their due -- does tie up dahlias properly . "
71432	71438	71440	71441	Miss Bartlett	115	" How do you do ? "
71464	71472	71474	71475	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" Here , Lennie , the bass , "
71532	71540	71541	71541	he	1877	" Come for a walk with me , "
71545	71582	71541	71541	he	1877	" You have worried them as much as they can stand . Mrs. Honeychurch , I only called in aimlessly . I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern , if I may . "
71583	71623	71519	71519	her	225	" Oh , must you ? Yes do.--Not the scissors , thank you , Charlotte , when both my hands are full already -- I'm perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it . "
71646	71677	71519	71519	her	225	" Yes , Charlotte , I do n't want you -- do go ; there 's nothing to stop about for , either in the house or out of it . "
71754	71765	71766	71766	he	119	" It is terrible , this havoc among the flowers , "
71769	71785	71787	71788	Miss Bartlett	115	" It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment , "
71790	71810	71744	71744	his	119	" Perhaps we ought to send Miss Honeychurch down to her mother . Or will she come with us ? "
71811	71828	71744	71744	his	119	" I think we had better leave Lucy to herself , and to her own pursuits . "
71829	71843	71845	71845	Minnie	225	" They 're angry with Miss Honeychurch because she was late for breakfast , "
71847	71884	71845	71845	Minnie	225	" and Floyd has gone , and Mr. Vyse has gone , and Freddy wo n't play with me . In fact , Uncle Arthur , the house is not AT ALL what it was yesterday . "
71885	71892	71894	71894	her	225	" Do n't be a prig , "
71898	71906	71896	71896	Arthur	282	" Go and put on your boots . "
71932	71957	71926	71926	She	225	" How do you do ? Miss Bartlett and Minnie are coming with me to tea at the Beehive . Would you come too ? "
71958	71969	71926	71926	She	225	" I do n't think I will , thank you . "
71970	71983	71926	71926	She	225	" No , I did n't suppose you would care to much . "
71995	72002	72004	72005	Mr. Beebe	119	" How delicate those Sonatas are ! "
72027	72031	72070	72070	she	116	" Miss Honeychurch ! "
72032	72035	72022	72022	Lucy	116	" Yes . "
72036	72049	72070	72070	she	116	" I met them on the hill . Your brother told me . "
72050	72055	72056	72056	She	116	" Oh he did ? "
72078	72090	72070	72070	she	116	" I need n't say that it will go no further . "
72091	72102	72104	72104	Lucy	116	" Mother , Charlotte , Cecil , Freddy , you , "
72122	72148	72070	72070	she	116	" If you 'll let me say so , I am very glad , and I am certain that you have done the right thing . "
72149	72165	72070	72070	she	116	" So I hoped other people would think , but they do n't seem to . "
72166	72177	72070	72070	she	116	" I could see that Miss Bartlett thought it unwise . "
72178	72187	72070	72070	she	116	" So does mother . Mother minds dreadfully . "
72188	72196	72198	72199	Mr. Beebe	119	" I am very sorry for that , "
72263	72268	72254	72254	she	116	" And Freddy minds . "
72269	72301	72254	72254	she	116	" Still , Freddy never hit it off with Vyse much , did he ? I gathered that he disliked the engagement , and felt it might separate him from you . "
72302	72308	72254	72254	she	116	" Boys are so odd . "
72361	72388	72358	72358	he	119	" I have had an absurd letter from Miss Alan . That was really what brought me over . I thought it might amuse you all . "
72389	72393	72395	72395	Lucy	116	" How delightful ! "
72433	72442	72429	72429	she	116	" Going abroad ? When do they start ? "
72443	72450	72429	72429	she	116	" Next week , I gather . "
72451	72462	72429	72429	she	116	" Did Freddy say whether he was driving straight back ? "
72463	72470	72429	72429	she	116	" No , he did n't . "
72471	72482	72429	72429	she	116	" Because I do hope he wo n't go gossiping . "
72514	72535	72504	72504	she	116	" Oh , do tell me more about the Miss Alans ! How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad ! "
72536	72556	72429	72429	she	116	" I want them to start from Venice , and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast ! "
72561	72573	72557	72557	She	116	" Oh , delightful ! I wish they 'd take me . "
72574	72604	72504	72504	she	116	" Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel ? Perhaps George Emerson is right . He says that ' Italy is only an euphuism for Fate . ' "
72605	72632	72557	72557	She	116	" Oh , not Italy , but Constantinople . I have always longed to go to Constantinople . Constantinople is practically Asia , is n't it ? "
72653	72665	72645	72647	the Miss Alans	150	" with Delphi , perhaps , if the roads are safe . "
72702	72722	72697	72697	she	116	" I did n't realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends , after Cissie Villa . "
72723	72749	72697	72697	she	116	" Oh , that 's nothing ; I assure you Cissie Villa 's nothing to me ; I would give anything to go with them . "
72750	72768	72697	72697	she	116	" Would your mother spare you again so soon ? You have scarcely been home three months . "
72769	72775	72777	72777	Lucy	116	" She MUST spare me ! "
72783	72794	72777	72777	Lucy	116	" I simply MUST go away . I have to . "
72804	72835	72795	72795	She	116	" Do n't you see that I HAVE to go away ? I did n't realize at the time -- and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly . "
72836	72849	72777	72777	Lucy	116	" You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel-- "
72850	72861	72795	72795	She	116	" Yes , yes . I knew you 'd understand . "
72924	72947	72918	72918	she	116	" Yes , of course ; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down . "
72948	72959	72960	72960	he	198	" I am afraid it has been a bothersome business , "
72964	73060	72918	72918	she	116	" No , not at all . Cecil was very kind indeed ; only -- I had better tell you the whole truth , since you have heard a little -- it was that he is so masterful . I found that he would n't let me go my own way . He would improve me in places where I ca n't be improved . Cecil wo n't let a woman decide for herself -- in fact , he dare n't . What nonsense I do talk ! But that is the kind of thing . "
73061	73120	72918	72918	she	116	" It is what I gathered from my own observation of Mr. Vyse ; it is what I gather from all that I have known of you . I do sympathize and agree most profoundly . I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism : Is it worth while rushing off to Greece ? "
73121	73128	73129	73129	she	1889	" But I must go somewhere ! "
73132	73148	72918	72918	she	116	" I have been worrying all the morning , and here comes the very thing . "
73160	73201	73149	73149	She	1889	" I must ! And the time I shall have with mother , and all the money she spent on me last spring . You all think much too highly of me . I wish you were n't so kind . "
73214	73237	73205	73206	Miss Bartlett	115	" I must get away , ever so far . I must know my own mind and where I want to go . "
73238	73248	73250	73251	Mr. Beebe	119	" Come along ; tea , tea , tea , "
73296	73302	73303	73303	he	119	" She is playing again , "
73309	73315	73303	73303	he	119	" Lucy can always play , "
73321	73377	73303	73303	he	119	" One is very thankful that she has such a resource . She is evidently much worried , as , of course , she ought to be . I know all about it . The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak . "
73410	73424	73401	73401	he	119	" she might yet reveal depths of strangeness , if not of meaning . "
73464	73474	73458	73458	She	225	" We had much better let the matter drop . "
73475	73479	73458	73458	She	225	" I wonder . "
73480	73513	73458	73458	She	225	" It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street . It would be DEATH to gossip about Mr. Vyse 's dismissal at the present moment . "
73540	73573	73537	73537	He	119	" Of course , Miss Honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way , and when she chooses . Freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind . "
73574	73578	73580	73581	Miss Bartlett	115	" I know , "
73584	73602	73580	73581	Miss Bartlett	115	" Yet Freddy ought not to have told even you . One can not be too careful . "
73603	73607	73537	73537	He	119	" Quite so . "
73608	73624	73580	73581	Miss Bartlett	115	" I do implore absolute secrecy . A chance word to a chattering friend , and-- "
73625	73628	73629	73629	He	119	" Exactly . "
73689	73770	73683	73684	Mr. Beebe	119	" Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately ? I believe you keep up with Miss Lavish . It is odd how we of that pension , who seemed such a fortuitous collection , have been working into one another 's lives . Two , three , four , six of us -- no , eight ; I had forgotten the Emersons -- have kept more or less in touch . We must really give the Signora a testimonial . "
73952	73978	73949	73949	he	119	" We sha n't have rain , but we shall have darkness , so let us hurry on . The darkness last night was appalling . "
74085	74094	74095	74095	he	119	" I have been thinking , Miss Bartlett , "
74098	74115	74095	74095	he	119	" and , unless you very much object , I would like to reopen that discussion . "
74119	74186	74187	74187	He	119	" Nothing about the past . I know little and care less about that ; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin 's credit . She has acted loftily and rightly , and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her . But the future . Seriously , what do you think of this Greek plan ? "
74194	74229	74187	74187	He	119	" I do n't know whether you overheard , but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career . It 's all -- I ca n't explain -- it 's wrong . "
74252	74263	74361	74363	the male intellect	1908	" I ca n't see the point of it myself . "
74271	74288	74268	74268	she	115	" There I can not agree with you . In it I spy Lucy 's salvation . "
74289	74296	74187	74187	He	119	" Really . Now , why ? "
74297	74305	74268	74268	she	115	" She wanted to leave Windy Corner . "
74306	74330	74187	74187	He	119	" I know -- but it seems so odd , so unlike her , so -- I was going to say -- selfish . "
74331	74350	74268	74268	she	115	" It is natural , surely -- after such painful scenes -- that she should desire a change . "
74370	74424	74366	74367	Mr. Beebe	119	" So she says herself , and since another lady agrees with her , I must own that I am partially convinced . Perhaps she must have a change . I have no sisters or -- and I do n't understand these things . But why need she go as far as Greece ? "
74425	74432	74434	74435	Miss Bartlett	115	" You may well ask that , "
74450	74532	74434	74435	Miss Bartlett	115	" Why Greece ? ( What is it , Minnie dear -- jam ? ) Why not Tunbridge Wells ? Oh , Mr. Beebe ! I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear Lucy this morning . I can not help her . I will say no more . Perhaps I have already said too much . I am not to talk . I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells , and she refused . "
74543	74606	74434	74435	Miss Bartlett	115	" But my feelings are of no importance . I know too well that I get on Lucy 's nerves . Our tour was a failure . She wanted to leave Florence , and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome , and all the time I felt that I was spending her mother 's money-- . "
74607	74617	74619	74620	Mr. Beebe	119	" Let us keep to the future , though , "
74622	74628	74619	74620	Mr. Beebe	119	" I want your advice . "
74629	74633	74635	74635	Charlotte	115	" Very well , "
74652	74667	74635	74635	Charlotte	115	" I for one will help her to go to Greece . Will you ? "
74672	74678	74679	74679	she	116	" It is absolutely necessary , "
74700	74707	74679	74679	she	116	" I know -- I know . "
74725	74782	74715	74715	he	119	" She must not stop here a moment , and we must keep quiet till she goes . I trust that the servants know nothing . Afterwards -- but I may have said too much already . Only , Lucy and I are helpless against Mrs. Honeychurch alone . If you help we may succeed . Otherwise-- "
74783	74786	74679	74679	she	116	" Otherwise-- ? "
74787	74790	74791	74791	she	116	" Otherwise , "
74800	74808	74810	74811	the clergyman	335	" Yes , I will help her , "
74818	74834	74810	74811	the clergyman	335	" Come , let us go back now , and settle the whole thing up . "
74890	74893	74875	74875	he	119	" another man "
74972	74986	74989	74989	his	119	" They that marry do well , but they that refrain do better . "
75185	75191	75192	75192	she	154	" It gets too dark , "
75196	75234	75192	75192	she	154	" This comes of putting off . We might have known the weather would break up soon ; and now Lucy wants to go to Greece . I do n't know what the world 's coming to . "
75235	75239	75240	75240	he	119	" Mrs. Honeychurch , "
75243	75276	75240	75240	he	119	" go to Greece she must . Come up to the house and let 's talk it over . Do you , in the first place , mind her breaking with Vyse ? "
75277	75288	75192	75192	she	154	" Mr. Beebe , I 'm thankful -- simply thankful . "
75289	75294	75296	75296	Freddy	124	" So am I , "
75298	75308	75192	75192	she	154	" Good . Now come up to the house . "
75395	75405	75406	75406	she	154	" I do n't see why Greece is necessary , "
75409	75440	75406	75406	she	154	" but as you do , I suppose it is all right . It must be something I ca n't understand . Lucy ! Let 's tell her . Lucy ! "
75441	75448	75449	75450	Mr. Beebe	119	" She is playing the piano , "
75466	75475	75406	75406	she	154	" Look not thou on beauty 's charming . "
75476	75488	75406	75406	she	154	" I did n't know that Miss Honeychurch sang , too . "
75489	75506	75406	75406	she	154	" Sit thou still when kings are arming , Taste not when the wine - cup glistens-- "
75507	75522	75406	75406	she	154	" It 's a song that Cecil gave her . How odd girls are ! "
75523	75528	75530	75530	Lucy	116	" What 's that ? "
75535	75541	75543	75544	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" All right , dear , "
75565	75586	75556	75557	Mr. Beebe	119	" I am sorry I was so cross about Greece , but it came on the top of the dahlias . "
75593	75606	75587	75590	Rather a hard voice	1931	" Thank you , mother ; that does n't matter a bit . "
75607	75632	75587	75590	Rather a hard voice	1931	" And you are right , too -- Greece will be all right ; you can go if the Miss Alans will have you . "
75633	75643	75587	75590	Rather a hard voice	1931	" Oh , splendid ! Oh , thank you ! "
75787	75804	75805	75805	she	116	" Taste not when the wine - cup glistens , Speak not when the people listens , "
75808	75814	75805	75805	she	116	" Here 's Mr. Beebe . "
75815	75823	75805	75805	she	116	" Mr. Beebe knows my rude ways . "
75824	75835	75837	75837	he	119	" It 's a beautiful song and a wise one , "
75839	75843	75837	75837	he	119	" Go on . "
75844	75851	75852	75852	she	116	" It is n't very good , "
75856	75865	75852	75852	she	116	" I forget why -- harmony or something . "
75866	75878	75805	75805	she	116	" I suspected it was unscholarly . It 's so beautiful . "
75879	75886	75888	75888	Freddy	124	" The tune 's right enough , "
75890	75903	75888	75888	Freddy	124	" but the words are rotten . Why throw up the sponge ? "
75904	75910	75912	75913	his sister	862	" How stupidly you talk ! "
75971	75981	75950	75950	Freddy	124	" This has been a day and a half . "
75982	75989	75963	75963	his	124	" Stop thine ear against the singer-- "
75990	75999	75950	75950	Freddy	124	" Wait a minute ; she is finishing . "
76000	76021	75963	75963	his	124	" From the red gold keep thy finger ; Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die . "
76022	76029	76031	76031	Freddy	124	" I love weather like this , "
76097	76104	76090	76090	she	116	" Vacant heart and hand and eye-- "
76109	76113	76090	76090	she	116	" the better part "
76153	76166	76090	76090	she	116	" Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die . "
76345	76376	76338	76338	Lucy	116	" But , of course , you know all about these things , and you have Mr. Vyse to help you . A gentleman is such a stand - by . "
76400	76413	76414	76415	Miss Catharine	146	" We think it so good of Mr. Vyse to spare you , "
76418	76443	76414	76415	Miss Catharine	146	" It is not every young man who would be so unselfish . But perhaps he will come out and join you later on . "
76444	76454	76456	76457	Miss Teresa	145	" Or does his work keep him in London ? "
76470	76491	76414	76415	Miss Catharine	146	" However , we shall see him when he sees you off . I do so long to see him . "
76492	76500	76502	76503	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" No one will see Lucy off , "
76505	76512	76502	76503	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" She does n't like it . "
76513	76522	76524	76524	Lucy	116	" No , I hate seeings - off , "
76526	76540	76587	76588	her mother	450	" Really ? How funny ! I should have thought that in this case-- "
76541	76562	76587	76588	her mother	450	" Oh , Mrs. Honeychurch , you are n't going ? It is such a pleasure to have met you ! "
76572	76585	76567	76567	Lucy	116	" That 's all right . We just got through that time . "
76592	76656	76587	76588	her mother	450	" I should be told , dear , that I am unsympathetic . But I can not see why you did n't tell your friends about Cecil and be done with it . There all the time we had to sit fencing , and almost telling lies , and be seen through , too , I dare say , which is most unpleasant . "
76693	76705	76673	76673	they	1960	" But why should n't it be everywhere in no time ? "
76706	76743	76673	76673	they	1960	" Because I settled with Cecil not to announce it until I left England . I shall tell them then . It 's much pleasanter . How wet it is ! Let 's turn in here . "
76744	76746	76673	76673	they	1960	" Here "
76806	76833	76774	76774	she	116	" Oh , well , let it be shop , then . Let 's go to Mudie 's . I 'll buy a guide - book . "
76834	76916	76774	76774	she	116	" You know , Lucy , you and Charlotte and Mr. Beebe all tell me I 'm so stupid , so I suppose I am , but I shall never understand this hole - and - corner work . You 've got rid of Cecil -- well and good , and I 'm thankful he 's gone , though I did feel angry for the minute . But why not announce it ? Why this hushing up and tip - toeing ? "
76917	76926	76774	76774	she	116	" It 's only for a few days . "
76927	76933	76774	76774	she	116	" But why at all ? "
76953	76973	76774	76774	she	116	" Because George Emerson has been bothering me , and if he hears I 've given up Cecil may begin again"--quite
77043	77082	77039	77039	She	154	" My daughter wo n't answer me ; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with Freddy and me . Any rag , tag , and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home . "
77099	77107	77094	77094	she	154	" You 're tired of Windy Corner . "
77195	77254	77191	77191	She	116	" I do not love George ; I broke off my engagement because I did not love George ; I must go to Greece because I do not love George ; it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother ; everyone else is behaving very badly . "
77284	77304	77278	77278	she	116	" Oh , mother , what rubbish you talk ! Of course I 'm not tired of Windy Corner . "
77305	77321	77278	77278	she	116	" Then why not say so at once , instead of considering half an hour ? "
77326	77334	77322	77322	She	116	" Half a minute would be nearer . "
77335	77348	77278	77278	she	116	" Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether ? "
77349	77358	77278	77278	she	116	" Hush , mother ! People will hear you "
77375	77425	77369	77369	Baedeker	126	" Of course I want to live at home ; but as we are talking about it , I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been . You see , I come into my money next year . "
77446	77449	77450	77450	Lucy	116	" eccentricity , "
77458	77520	77450	77450	Lucy	116	" I 've seen the world so little -- I felt so out of things in Italy . I have seen so little of life ; one ought to come up to London more -- not a cheap ticket like to - day , but to stop . I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl . "
77521	77531	77533	77534	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" And mess with typewriters and latch - keys , "
77536	77616	77533	77534	Mrs. Honeychurch	154	" And agitate and scream , and be carried off kicking by the police . And call it a Mission -- when no one wants you ! And call it Duty -- when it means that you ca n't stand your own home ! And call it Work -- when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is ! And then to prepare yourself , find two doddering old ladies , and go abroad with them . "
77617	77623	77625	77625	Lucy	116	" I want more independence , "
77689	77750	77686	77686	her	116	" Very well . Take your independence and be gone . Rush up and down and round the world , and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food . Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted , and our dear view -- and then share a flat with another girl . "
77759	77765	77751	77751	Lucy	116	" Perhaps I spoke hastily . "
77766	77771	77772	77773	her mother	450	" Oh , goodness ! "
77776	77786	77772	77773	her mother	450	" How you do remind me of Charlotte Bartlett ! "
77787	77790	77792	77792	Lucy	116	" Charlotte ! "
77805	77810	77751	77751	Lucy	116	" More every moment . "
77811	77832	77751	77751	Lucy	116	" I do n't know what you mean , mother ; Charlotte and I are not the very least alike . "
77833	77870	77751	77751	Lucy	116	" Well , I see the likeness . The same eternal worrying , the same taking back of words . You and Charlotte trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters . "
77871	77917	77751	77751	Lucy	116	" What rubbish ! And if you dislike Charlotte so , it 's rather a pity you asked her to stop . I warned you about her ; I begged you , implored you not to , but of course it was not listened to . "
77918	77923	77751	77751	Lucy	116	" There you go . "
77924	77930	77751	77751	Lucy	116	" I beg your pardon ? "
77931	77946	77751	77751	Lucy	116	" Charlotte again , my dear ; that 's all ; her very words . "
77952	77976	77947	77947	Lucy	116	" My point is that you ought n't to have asked Charlotte to stop . I wish you would keep to the point . "
78086	78097	78098	78098	she	116	" The crush when Charlotte gets in will be abominable , "
78135	78164	78166	78166	she	116	" We shall have to sit three a side , because the trees drop , and yet it is n't raining . Oh , for a little air ! "
78172	78182	78166	78166	she	116	hoofs--"He has not told -- he has not told . "
78192	78200	78201	78201	she	116	" CAN'T we have the hood down ? "
78214	78225	78201	78201	she	116	" Very well , old lady , stop the horse . "
78291	78301	78302	78302	she	116	" Is that house to let again , Powell ? "
78305	78310	78311	78311	he	280	" Yes , miss , "
78314	78319	78302	78302	she	116	" Have they gone ? "
78320	78358	78302	78302	she	116	" It is too far out of town for the young gentleman , and his father 's rheumatism has come on , so he ca n't stop on alone , so they are trying to let furnished , "
78363	78370	78302	78302	she	116	" They have gone , then ? "
78371	78380	78302	78302	she	116	" Yes , miss , they have gone . "
78544	78547	78549	78550	the hostess	1989	" Certainly , "
78553	78573	78549	78550	the hostess	1989	" I forgot it was Friday . Let 's all go . Powell can go round to the stables . "
78574	78577	78516	78516	she	116	" Lucy dearest-- "
78578	78587	78549	78550	the hostess	1989	" No church for me , thank you . "
78744	78752	78732	78733	Some one	2313	" A lady to wait , sir . "
78771	78782	78783	78783	he	261	" Oh , Miss Honeychurch , that you should come ! "
78827	78884	78824	78825	his father	350	" Miss Honeychurch , dear , we are so sorry ! George is so sorry ! He thought he had a right to try . I can not blame my boy , and yet I wish he had told me first . He ought not to have tried . I knew nothing about it at all . "
78900	78908	78894	78894	He	350	" But you must not scold him . "
78924	78929	78930	78930	he	350	" I taught him , "
78933	78985	78986	78986	He	350	" to trust in love . I said : ' When love comes , that is reality . ' I said : ' Passion does not blind . No . Passion is sanity , and the woman you love , she is the only person you will ever really understand . ' "
78989	79039	78986	78986	He	350	" True , everlastingly true , though my day is over , and though there is the result . Poor boy ! He is so sorry ! He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in ; that whatever you felt you did not mean . Yet"--his
79049	79057	79044	79044	he	350	certain--"Miss Honeychurch , do you remember Italy ? "
79080	79096	79077	79077	she	116	" I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son . "
79097	79104	79077	79077	she	116	" But you do remember it ? "
79105	79114	79077	79077	she	116	" He has misbehaved himself from the first . "
79115	79141	79077	79077	she	116	" I only was told that he loved you last Sunday . I never could judge behaviour . I -- I -- suppose he has . "
79182	79190	79191	79191	she	116	" Why , he has behaved abominably , "
79194	79209	79191	79191	she	116	" I am glad he is sorry . Do you know what he did ? "
79210	79216	79166	79166	his	2002	" Not ' abominably , ' "
79222	79265	79166	79166	his	2002	" He only tried when he should not have tried . You have all you want , Miss Honeychurch : you are going to marry the man you love . Do not go out of George 's life saying he is abominable . "
79266	79272	79274	79274	Lucy	116	" No , of course , "
79283	79328	79274	79274	Lucy	116	" ' Abominable ' is much too strong . I am sorry I used it about your son . I think I will go to church , after all . My mother and my cousin have gone . I shall not be so very late-- "
79329	79337	79338	79338	he	2004	" Especially as he has gone under , "
79342	79347	79274	79274	Lucy	116	" What was that ? "
79348	79353	79354	79354	He	2004	" Gone under naturally . "
79369	79375	79274	79274	Lucy	116	" I do n't understand . "
79376	79382	79274	79274	Lucy	116	" As his mother did . "
79383	79399	79274	79274	Lucy	116	" But , Mr. Emerson -- MR . EMERSON -- what are you talking about ? "
79400	79409	79411	79411	he	2004	" When I would n't have George baptized , "
79417	79446	79447	79447	He	2004	" And she agreed that baptism was nothing , but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round . She thought it a judgement . "
79450	79548	79447	79447	He	2004	" Oh , horrible , when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents . Oh , horrible -- worst of all -- worse than death , when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness , planted your little garden , let in your sunlight , and then the weeds creep in again ! A judgement ! And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church ! Is it possible , Miss Honeychurch ? Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever ? "
79549	79555	79557	79557	Lucy	116	" I do n't know , "
79559	79577	79557	79557	Lucy	116	" I do n't understand this sort of thing . I was not meant to understand it . "
79578	79632	79641	79642	his wife	2452	" But Mr. Eager -- he came when I was out , and acted according to his principles . I do n't blame him or any one ... but by the time George was well she was ill . He made her think about sin , and she went under thinking about it . "
79649	79655	79657	79657	Lucy	116	" Oh , how terrible ! "
79666	79672	79674	79676	the old man	313	" He was not baptized , "
79678	79684	79686	79686	he	313	" I did hold firm . "
79710	79721	79686	79686	he	313	" My boy shall go back to the earth untouched . "
79731	79737	79738	79738	He	313	" Oh -- last Sunday . "
79744	79835	79738	79738	He	313	" George last Sunday -- no , not ill : just gone under . He is never ill . But he is his mother 's son . Her eyes were his , and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful , and he will not think it worth while to live . It was always touch and go . He will live ; but he will not think it worth while to live . He will never think anything worth while . You remember that church at Florence ? "
79852	79884	79842	79842	she	116	" After you left Florence -- horrible . Then we took the house here , and he goes bathing with your brother , and became better . You saw him bathing ? "
79885	79907	79842	79842	she	116	" I am so sorry , but it is no good discussing this affair . I am deeply sorry about it . "
79908	79986	79842	79842	she	116	" Then there came something about a novel . I did n't follow it at all ; I had to hear so much , and he minded telling me ; he finds me too old . Ah , well , one must have failures . George comes down to - morrow , and takes me up to his London rooms . He ca n't bear to be about here , and I must be where he is . "
79987	79991	79993	79994	the girl	332	" Mr. Emerson , "
79996	80021	79993	79994	the girl	332	" do n't leave at least , not on my account . I am going to Greece . Do n't leave your comfortable house . "
80036	80069	80033	80033	he	2009	" How good everyone is ! And look at Mr. Beebe housing me -- came over this morning and heard I was going ! Here I am so comfortable with a fire . "
80070	80086	80027	80027	her	332	" Yes , but you wo n't go back to London . It 's absurd . "
80087	80136	80033	80033	he	2009	" I must be with George ; I must make him care to live , and down here he ca n't . He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you -- I am not justifying him : I am only saying what has happened . "
80137	80141	80145	80145	his	2010	" Oh , Mr. Emerson"--she
80146	80199	80027	80027	her	332	hand--"you must n't . I 've been bother enough to the world by now . I ca n't have you moving out of your house when you like it , and perhaps losing money through it -- all on my account . You must stop ! I am just going to Greece . "
80200	80207	80033	80033	he	2009	" All the way to Greece ? "
80212	80216	80033	80033	he	2009	" To Greece ? "
80217	80240	80033	80033	he	2009	" So you must stop . You wo n't talk about this business , I know . I can trust you both . "
80241	80265	80033	80033	he	2009	" Certainly you can . We either have you in our lives , or leave you to the life that you have chosen . "
80266	80271	80033	80033	he	2009	" I should n't want-- "
80272	80308	80033	80033	he	2009	" I suppose Mr. Vyse is very angry with George ? No , it was wrong of George to try . We have pushed our beliefs too far . I fancy that we deserve sorrow . "
80417	80433	80377	80379	the old man	313	" No , please sit still . I think I will sit in the carriage . "
80434	80443	80411	80411	he	118	" Miss Honeychurch , you do sound tired . "
80444	80449	80451	80451	Lucy	116	" Not a bit , "
80457	80481	80411	80411	he	118	" But you are , and there 's a look of George about you . And what were you saying about going abroad ? "
80486	80487	80491	80491	he	118	" Greece"--and
80496	80510	80491	80491	he	118	over--"Greece ; but you were to be married this year , I thought . "
80511	80520	80522	80522	Lucy	116	" Not till January , it was n't , "
80541	80567	80491	80491	he	118	" I suppose that Mr. Vyse is going with you . I hope -- it is n't because George spoke that you are both going ? "
80568	80571	80491	80491	he	118	" No . "
80572	80584	80491	80491	he	118	" I hope that you will enjoy Greece with Mr. Vyse . "
80585	80589	80491	80491	he	118	" Thank you . "
80607	80613	80614	80614	he	119	" That 's all right , "
80618	80668	80614	80614	he	119	" I counted on you two keeping each other company . It 's pouring again . The entire congregation , which consists of your cousin , your mother , and my mother , stands waiting in the church , till the carriage fetches it . Did Powell go round ? "
80669	80678	80491	80491	he	118	" I think so ; I 'll see . "
80679	80695	80614	80614	he	119	" No -- of course , I 'll see . How are the Miss Alans ? "
80696	80703	80491	80491	he	118	" Very well , thank you . "
80704	80713	80614	80614	he	119	" Did you tell Mr. Emerson about Greece ? "
80714	80720	80491	80491	he	118	" I -- I did . "
80721	80765	80767	80767	he	2018	" Do n't you think it very plucky of her , Mr. Emerson , to undertake the two Miss Alans ? Now , Miss Honeychurch , go back -- keep warm . I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling . "
80774	80780	80781	80781	she	2020	" He is not going , "
80785	80799	80781	80781	she	2020	" I made a slip . Mr. Vyse does stop behind in England . "
80939	80953	80931	80931	he	2018	" You are leaving him ? You are leaving the man you love ? "
80954	80961	80931	80931	he	2018	" I -- I had to . "
80962	80970	80931	80931	he	2018	" Why , Miss Honeychurch , why ? "
81023	81036	81038	81038	she	2020	" My dear , I am worried about you . It seems to me"--dreamily
81041	81048	81038	81038	she	2020	alarmed--"that you are in a muddle . "
81054	81209	81210	81210	She	2028	" Take an old man 's word ; there 's nothing worse than a muddle in all the world . It is easy to face Death and Fate , and the things that sound so dreadful . It is on my muddles that I look back with horror -- on the things that I might have avoided . We can help one another but little . I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life , but I know better now , and all my teaching of George has come down to this : beware of muddle . Do you remember in that church , when you pretended to be annoyed with me and were n't ? Do you remember before , when you refused the room with the view ? Those were muddles -- little , but ominous -- and I am fearing that you are in one now . "
81214	81233	81234	81234	She	2028	" Do n't trust me , Miss Honeychurch . Though life is very glorious , it is difficult . "
81239	81299	81301	81301	he	2028	" ' Life ' wrote a friend of mine , ' is a public performance on the violin , in which you must learn the instrument as you go along . ' I think he puts it well . Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along -- especially the function of Love . "
81306	81321	81301	81301	he	2028	" That 's it ; that 's what I mean . You love George ! "
81341	81346	81347	81347	he	2028	" But you do , "
81356	81392	81347	81347	he	2028	" You love the boy body and soul , plainly , directly , as he loves you , and no other word expresses it . You wo n't marry the other man for his sake . "
81393	81398	81400	81400	Lucy	116	" How dare you ! "
81411	81432	81400	81400	Lucy	116	" Oh , how like a man!--I mean , to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man . "
81433	81438	81347	81347	he	2028	" But you are . "
81444	81630	81347	81347	he	2028	" You 're shocked , but I mean to shock you . It 's the only hope at times . I can reach you no other way . You must marry , or your life will be wasted . You have gone too far to retreat . I have no time for the tenderness , and the comradeship , and the poetry , and the things that really matter , and for which you marry . I know that , with George , you will find them , and that you love him . Then be his wife . He is already part of you . Though you fly to Greece , and never see him again , or forget his very name , George will work in your thoughts till you die . It is n't possible to love and to part . You will wish that it was . You can transmute love , ignore it , muddle it , but you can never pull it out of you . I know by experience that the poets are right : love is eternal . "
81650	81773	81775	81775	he	2030	" I only wish poets would say this , too : love is of the body ; not the body , but of the body . Ah ! the misery that would be saved if we confessed that ! Ah ! for a little directness to liberate the soul ! Your soul , dear Lucy ! I hate the word now , because of all the ca nt with which superstition has wrapped it round . But we have souls . I can not say how they came nor whither they go , but we have them , and I see you ruining yours . I can not bear it . It is again the darkness creeping in ; it is hell . "
81779	81841	81775	81775	he	2030	" What nonsense I have talked -- how abstract and remote ! And I have made you cry ! Dear girl , forgive my prosiness ; marry my boy . When I think what life is , and how seldom love is answered by love -- Marry him ; it is one of the moments for which the world was made . "
81877	81881	81856	81856	he	2030	" Then , Lucy-- "
81882	81888	81889	81889	she	2031	" You 've frightened me , "
81892	81905	81906	81906	She	2031	" Cecil -- Mr. Beebe -- the ticket 's bought -- everything . "
81913	81947	81906	81906	She	2031	" I 'm caught in the tangle . I must suffer and grow old away from him . I can not break the whole of life for his sake . They trusted me . "
81958	81973	81975	81975	she	2031	" Give George my love -- once only . Tell him ' muddle . ' "
81989	81991	82026	82027	Mr. Beebe	119	" Lucy-- "
81992	82012	82026	82027	Mr. Beebe	119	" No -- they are in the hall -- oh , please not , Mr. Emerson -- they trust me-- "
82013	82025	82026	82027	Mr. Beebe	119	" But why should they , when you have deceived them ? "
82034	82040	82026	82027	Mr. Beebe	119	" Here 's my mother . "
82041	82050	82026	82027	Mr. Beebe	119	" You 're not worthy of their trust . "
82051	82056	82058	82059	Mr. Beebe	119	" What 's that ? "
82062	82077	82026	82027	Mr. Beebe	119	" I was saying , why should you trust her when she deceived you ? "
82078	82084	82085	82085	He	119	" One minute , mother . "
82093	82112	82026	82027	Mr. Beebe	119	" I do n't follow you , Mr. Emerson . To whom do you refer ? Trust whom ? "
82113	82136	82141	82143	the sobbing girl	2033	" I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love George . They have loved one another all along . "
82176	82183	82185	82185	Lucy	116	" I shall never marry him , "
82199	82203	82196	82196	he	119	" Why not ? "
82204	82217	82196	82196	he	119	" Mr. Beebe -- I have misled you -- I have misled myself-- "
82218	82226	82196	82196	he	119	" Oh , rubbish , Miss Honeychurch ! "
82227	82233	82235	82237	the old man	313	" It is not rubbish ! "
82240	82253	82235	82237	the old man	313	" It 's the part of people that you do n't understand . "
82267	82272	82196	82196	he	119	" Lucy ! Lucy ! "
82279	82288	82196	82196	he	119	" Mr. Beebe , could you help me ? "
82305	82324	82289	82289	He	119	" I am more grieved than I can possibly express . It is lamentable , lamentable -- incredible . "
82325	82333	82336	82337	the other	2517	" What 's wrong with the boy ? "
82340	82365	82289	82289	He	119	" Nothing , Mr. Emerson , except that he no longer interests me . Marry George , Miss Honeychurch . He will do admirably . "
82383	82386	82375	82375	him	119	" Lucy ! "
82415	82535	82537	82537	his	2041	" Now it is all dark . Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed . I know . But remember the mountains over Florence and the view . Ah , dear , if I were George , and gave you one kiss , it would make you brave . You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth , out into the muddle that you have made yourself ; and your mother and all your friends will despise you , oh , my darling , and rightly , if it is ever right to despise . George still dark , all the tussle and the misery without a word from him . Am I justified ? "
82543	82567	82537	82537	his	2041	" Yes , for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure ; there is Truth . Truth counts , Truth does count . "
82568	82573	82575	82576	the girl	332	" You kiss me , "
82578	82587	82575	82576	the girl	332	" You kiss me . I will try . "
82662	82667	82668	82668	she	332	" never exactly understood , "
82675	82699	82668	82668	she	332	" how he managed to strengthen her . It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once . "
82842	82849	82851	82851	Lucy	116	" No , it is n't , "
82853	82882	82851	82851	Lucy	116	" because it is the room I had , and I had your father 's room . I forget why ; Charlotte made me , for some reason . "
82898	82907	82892	82892	his	118	" George , you baby , get up . "
82908	82917	82919	82919	George	118	" Why should n't I be a baby ? "
82955	82961	82962	82962	she	116	" Oh , bother Charlotte , "
82966	82975	82962	82962	she	116	" What can such people be made of ? "
82976	82985	83041	83041	his	118	" Same stuff as parsons are made of . "
82986	82989	82962	82962	she	116	" Nonsense ! "
82990	82998	83041	83041	his	118	" Quite right . It is nonsense . "
82999	83026	82962	82962	she	116	" Now you get up off the cold floor , or you 'll be starting rheumatism next , and you stop laughing and being so silly . "
83027	83034	83035	83035	he	118	" Why should n't I laugh ? "
83051	83063	83064	83064	He	118	" What 's there to cry at ? Kiss me here . "
83130	83134	83135	83135	he	118	" Any letters ? "
83138	83145	83201	83204	The cab - driver	2331	" Just a line from Freddy . "
83146	83155	83201	83204	The cab - driver	2331	" Now kiss me here ; then here . "
83307	83330	83294	83294	others	2278	" Lucy , you come and look at the cypresses ; and the church , whatever its name is , still shows . "
83331	83342	83304	83305	his wife	2452	" San Miniato . I 'll just finish your sock . "
83343	83351	83353	83354	the cabman	2069	" Signorino , domani faremo uno giro , "
83418	83426	83450	83450	they	2070	" Anything good in Freddy 's letter ? "
83427	83431	83450	83450	they	2070	" Not yet . "
83468	83474	83450	83450	they	2070	" What does he say ? "
83475	83537	83450	83450	they	2070	" Silly boy ! He thinks he 's being dignified . He knew we should go off in the spring -- he has known it for six months -- that if mother would n't give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands . They had fair warning , and now he calls it an elopement . Ridiculous boy-- "
83538	83545	83450	83450	they	2070	" Signorino , domani faremo uno giro-- "
83546	83618	83450	83450	they	2070	" But it will all come right in the end . He has to build us both up from the beginning again . I wish , though , that Cecil had not turned so cynical about women . He has , for the second time , quite altered . Why will men have theories about women ? I have n't any about men . I wish , too , that Mr. Beebe-- "
83619	83626	83450	83450	they	2070	" You may well wish that . "
83627	83690	83450	83450	they	2070	" He will never forgive us -- I mean , he will never be interested in us again . I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner . I wish he hadn't -- But if we act the truth , the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run . "
83691	83694	83696	83696	he	2073	" Perhaps . "
83701	83728	83696	83696	he	2073	" Well , I acted the truth -- the only thing I did do -- and you came back to me . So possibly you know . "
83736	83742	83743	83743	He	2073	" Nonsense with that sock . "
83816	83821	83812	83812	They	2076	" Signorino , domani faremo-- "
83822	83829	83812	83812	They	2076	" Oh , bother that man ! "
83840	83850	83831	83831	Lucy	116	" No , do n't be rude to him . "
83862	83883	83859	83859	she	116	" Mr. Eager and Charlotte , dreadful frozen Charlotte . How cruel she would be to a man like that ! "
83884	83894	83831	83831	Lucy	116	" Look at the lights going over the bridge . "
83895	83969	83859	83859	she	116	" But this room reminds me of Charlotte . How horrible to grow old in Charlotte 's way ! To think that evening at the rectory that she should n't have heard your father was in the house . For she would have stopped me going in , and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense . You could n't have made me . When I am very happy"--she
83971	84009	83831	83831	Lucy	116	him--"I remember on how little it all hangs . If Charlotte had only known , she would have stopped me going in , and I should have gone to silly Greece , and become different for ever . "
84010	84016	84018	84018	George	118	" But she did know , "
84020	84033	84018	84018	George	118	" she did see my father , surely . He said so . "
84034	84070	83831	83831	Lucy	116	" Oh , no , she did n't see him . She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe , do n't you remember , and then went straight to the church . She said so . "
84076	84080	84082	84082	he	118	" My father , "
84084	84139	84082	84082	he	118	" saw her , and I prefer his word . He was dozing by the study fire , and he opened his eyes , and there was Miss Bartlett . A few minutes before you came in . She was turning to go as he woke up . He did n't speak to her . "
84203	84233	84194	84194	George	118	" It 's clear that she knew . Then , why did she risk the meeting ? She knew he was there , and yet she went to church . "
84262	84279	84255	84255	She	116	" How like Charlotte to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment . "
84312	84319	84309	84309	George	118	" Or did she mean it ? "
84320	84324	84301	84301	her	115	" Mean what ? "
84325	84332	84309	84309	George	118	" Signorino , domani faremo uno giro-- "
84341	84351	84333	84333	Lucy	116	" Lascia , prego , lascia . Siamo sposati . "
84352	84358	84359	84359	he	118	" Scusi tanto , signora , "
84371	84378	84301	84301	her	115	" Buona sera -- e grazie . "
84379	84382	84301	84301	her	115	" Niente . "
84389	84395	84333	84333	Lucy	116	" Mean what , George ? "
84399	84616	84396	84396	He	118	" Is it this ? Is this possible ? I 'll put a marvel to you . That your cousin has always hoped . That from the very first moment we met , she hoped , far down in her mind , that we should be like this -- of course , very far down . That she fought us on the surface , and yet she hoped . I ca n't explain her any other way . Can you ? Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer ; how she gave you no peace ; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable . The sight of us haunted her -- or she could n't have described us as she did to her friend . There are details -- it burnt . I read the book afterwards . She is not frozen , Lucy , she is not withered up all through . She tore us apart twice , but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy . We can never make friends with her or thank her . But I do believe that , far down in her heart , far below all speech and behaviour , she is glad . "
84617	84622	84624	84624	Lucy	116	" It is impossible , "
84640	84648	84637	84637	she	116	" No -- it is just possible . "
