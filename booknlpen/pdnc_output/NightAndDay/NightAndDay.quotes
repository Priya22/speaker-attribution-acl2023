251	261	247	247	he	373	" What an extremely nice house to come into ! "
334	346	317	317	Katharine	332	" Now , do you think we re enjoying ourselves enormously ? "
348	354	355	355	she	332	" Mr. Denham , mother , "
614	639	600	601	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Now , what would you do if you were married to an engineer , and had to live in Manchester , Mr. Denham ? "
640	647	650	654	a thin , elderly gentleman	392	" Surely she could learn Persian , "
656	675	650	654	a thin , elderly gentleman	392	" Is there no retired schoolmaster or man of letters in Manchester with whom she could read Persian ? "
676	690	691	691	Katharine	332	" A cousin of ours has married and gone to live in Manchester , "
803	811	812	812	he	129	" Have you ever been to Manchester ? "
816	819	820	820	she	332	" Never , "
823	833	812	812	he	129	" Why do you object to it , then ? "
976	991	992	992	she	332	" I should think there would be no one to talk to in Manchester , "
1034	1050	1051	1051	he	130	" In spite of a slight tendency to exaggeration , Katharine decidedly hits the mark , "
1192	1198	1200	1201	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Oh , Mr. Fortescue , "
1207	1239	1200	1201	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" I had just written to say how I envied her ! I was thinking of the big gardens and the dear old ladies in mittens , who read nothing but the "
1242	1275	1200	1201	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" and snuff the candles . Have they _ all _ disappeared ? I told her she would find the nice things of London without the horrid streets that depress one so . "
1276	1282	1284	1286	the thin gentleman	418	" There is the University , "
1300	1320	1322	1322	Katharine	332	" I know there are moors there , because I read about them in a book the other day , "
1324	1337	1338	1339	Mr. Hilbery	132	" I am grieved and amazed at the ignorance of my family , "
1806	1821	1822	1823	her mother	377	" Would it be the Battle of Trafalgar or the Spanish Armada , Katharine ? "
1826	1831	1784	1784	her	332	" Trafalgar , mother . "
1832	1889	1822	1823	her mother	377	" Trafalgar , of course ! How stupid of me ! Another cup of tea , with a thin slice of lemon in it , and then , dear Mr. Fortescue , please explain my absurd little puzzle . One can t help believing gentlemen with Roman noses , even if one meets them in omnibuses . "
2146	2253	2120	2120	she	128	" D you know , Mr. Denham , you remind me so much of dear Mr. Ruskin .... Is it his tie , Katharine , or his hair , or the way he sits in his chair ? Do tell me , Mr. Denham , are you an admirer of Ruskin ? Some one , the other day , said to me , Oh , no , we don t read Ruskin , Mrs. Hilbery . What _ do _ you read , I wonder ? for you can t spend all your time going up in aeroplanes and burrowing into the bowels of the earth . "
2291	2363	2364	2364	she	433	" I m sure Mr. Denham would like to see our things , Katharine . I m sure he s not like that dreadful young man , Mr. Ponting , who told me that he considered it our duty to live exclusively in the present . After all , what IS the present ? Half of it s the past , and the better half , too , I should say , "
2404	2414	2394	2394	Katharine	332	" Perhaps you would like to see the pictures , "
2602	2605	2592	2592	she	332	" There ! "
2716	2729	2731	2731	she	332	" This is his writing - table . He used this pen , "
2795	2816	2817	2817	she	332	" I think my grandfather must have been at least twice as large as any one is nowadays . This , "
2833	2863	2817	2817	she	332	" is the original manuscript of the Ode to Winter . The early poems are far less corrected than the later . Would you like to look at it ? "
2968	2981	2982	2982	she	332	" This is a copy of the first edition of the poems , "
2999	3015	3016	3016	She	332	" which contains several poems that have not been reprinted , as well as corrections . "
3036	3137	3016	3016	She	332	" That lady in blue is my great - grandmother , by Millington . Here is my uncle s walking - stick he was Sir Richard Warburton , you know , and rode with Havelock to the Relief of Lucknow . And then , let me see oh , that s the original Alardyce , 1697 , the founder of the family fortunes , with his wife . Some one gave us this bowl the other day because it has their crest and initials . We think it must have been given them to celebrate their silver wedding - day . "
3461	3474	3453	3453	he	129	" You must be very proud of your family , Miss Hilbery . "
3475	3481	3482	3482	Katharine	332	" Yes , I am , "
3489	3500	3482	3482	Katharine	332	" Do you think there s anything wrong in that ? "
3501	3524	3525	3525	he	129	" Wrong ? How should it be wrong ? It must be a bore , though , showing your things to visitors , "
3529	3537	3453	3453	he	129	" Not if the visitors like them . "
3538	3550	3551	3551	he	129	" Isn t it difficult to live up to your ancestors ? "
3554	3566	3567	3567	Katharine	332	" I dare say I shouldn t try to write poetry , "
3570	3597	3598	3598	Denham	129	" No . And that s what I should hate . I couldn t bear my grandfather to cut me out . And , after all , "
3611	3669	3670	3670	he	129	" it s not your grandfather only . You re cut out all the way round . I suppose you come of one of the most distinguished families in England . There are the Warburtons and the Mannings and you re related to the Otways , aren t you ? I read it all in some magazine , "
3673	3680	3681	3681	Katharine	332	" The Otways are my cousins , "
3684	3687	3689	3689	Denham	129	" Well , "
3705	3708	3710	3710	Katharine	332	" Well , "
3712	3723	3710	3710	Katharine	332	" I don t see that you ve proved anything . "
3818	3821	3823	3823	Denham	129	" Well , "
3924	3934	3935	3935	Katharine	332	" But aren t you proud of your family ? "
3938	3941	3943	3943	Denham	129	" No , "
3945	3967	3943	3943	Denham	129	" We ve never done anything to be proud of unless you count paying one s bills a matter for pride . "
3968	3974	3975	3975	Katharine	332	" That sounds rather dull , "
3978	3986	3987	3987	Denham	129	" You would think us horribly dull , "
3990	4010	4011	4011	Katharine	332	" Yes , I might find you dull , but I don t think I should find you ridiculous , "
4026	4050	4083	4083	he	129	" No because we re not in the least ridiculous . We re a respectable middle - class family , living at Highgate . "
4051	4069	4083	4083	he	129	" We don t live at Highgate , but we re middle class too , I suppose . "
4092	4102	4104	4104	Katharine	332	" That belonged to Clive , so we say , "
4115	4121	4122	4122	Denham	129	" Is it a lie ? "
4125	4142	4083	4083	he	129	" It s a family tradition . I don t know that we can prove it . "
4143	4156	4158	4158	Denham	129	" You see , we don t have traditions in our family , "
4160	4166	4167	4167	Katharine	332	" You sound very dull , "
4175	4180	4181	4181	Denham	129	" Merely middle class , "
4184	4206	4158	4158	Denham	129	" You pay your bills , and you speak the truth . I don t see why you should despise us . "
4221	4236	4237	4237	he	129	" I shouldn t like to be you ; that s all I said , "
4254	4268	4297	4297	her	332	" No , but one never would like to be any one else . "
4269	4283	4251	4251	he	129	" I should . I should like to be lots of other people . "
4284	4290	4291	4291	Katharine	332	" Then why not us ? "
4390	4400	4401	4401	he	129	" You ll never know anything at first hand , "
4407	4443	4401	4401	he	129	" It s all been done for you . You ll never know the pleasure of buying things after saving up for them , or reading books for the first time , or making discoveries . "
4444	4448	4449	4449	Katharine	332	" Go on , "
4477	4491	4492	4492	he	129	" Of course , I don t know how you spend your time , "
4499	4528	4529	4529	he	129	" but I suppose you have to show people round . You are writing a life of your grandfather , aren t you ? And this kind of thing "
4544	4553	4529	4529	he	129	" must take up a lot of time . "
4587	4596	4597	4597	she	332	" You ve got it very nearly right , "
4600	4614	4597	4597	she	332	" but I only help my mother . I don t write myself . "
4615	4622	4623	4623	he	129	" Do you do anything yourself ? "
4626	4632	4633	4633	she	332	" What do you mean ? "
4636	4651	4633	4633	she	332	" I don t leave the house at ten and come back at six . "
4652	4659	4669	4669	he	129	" I don t mean that . "
4727	4737	4738	4738	she	332	" Nobody ever does do anything worth doing nowadays , "
4741	4744	4745	4745	she	332	" You see "
4754	4789	4745	4745	she	332	" we don t even print as well as they did , and as for poets or painters or novelists there are none ; so , at any rate , I m not singular . "
4790	4800	4801	4801	Denham	129	" No , we haven t any great men , "
4804	4837	4801	4801	Denham	129	" I m very glad that we haven t. I hate great men . The worship of greatness in the nineteenth century seems to me to explain the worthlessness of that generation . "
5154	5157	5158	5158	she	128	" Well , "
5161	5172	5158	5158	she	128	" how do you like our things , Mr. Denham ? "
5208	5218	5219	5219	she	128	" There are some books that _ live _ , "
5222	5339	5219	5219	she	128	" They are young with us , and they grow old with us . Are you fond of poetry , Mr. Denham ? But what an absurd question to ask ! The truth is , dear Mr. Fortescue has almost tired me out . He is so eloquent and so witty , so searching and so profound that , after half an hour or so , I feel inclined to turn out all the lights . But perhaps he d be more wonderful than ever in the dark . What d you think , Katharine ? Shall we give a little party in complete darkness ? There d have to be bright rooms for the bores .... "
5348	5360	5361	5362	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" But we ve any number of things to show you ! "
5371	5471	5361	5362	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Books , pictures , china , manuscripts , and the very chair that Mary Queen of Scots sat in when she heard of Darnley s murder . I must lie down for a little , and Katharine must change her dress ( though she s wearing a very pretty one ) , but if you don t mind being left alone , supper will be at eight . I dare say you ll write a poem of your own while you re waiting . Ah , how I love the firelight ! Doesn t our room look charming ? "
5499	5503	5504	5504	she	128	" Dear things ! "
5507	5589	5504	5504	she	128	" Dear chairs and tables ! How like old friends they are faithful , silent friends . Which reminds me , Katharine , little Mr. Anning is coming to - night , and Tite Street , and Cadogan Square .... Do remember to get that drawing of your great - uncle glazed . Aunt Millicent remarked it last time she was here , and I know how it would hurt me to see _ my _ father in a broken glass . "
6184	6202	6206	6206	he	454	" She ll do .... Yes , Katharine Hilbery ll do .... I ll take Katharine Hilbery . "
7111	7125	7105	7105	her	527	" Mother says , aren t you coming down , Ralph ? Uncle Joseph "
7126	7136	7138	7138	Ralph	153	" They re to bring my dinner up here , "
7222	7225	7207	7207	he	454	" Ralph ! "
7603	7607	7616	7618	a small boy	545	" Critical Review . "
8038	8048	8057	8057	she	332	" although she s wearing such a pretty one , "
8285	8288	8290	8291	a voice	567	" Ralph ? "
8295	8298	8276	8277	The person	561	" Joan ? "
8299	8311	8276	8277	The person	561	" I was coming up , but I saw your notice . "
8312	8321	8276	8277	The person	561	" Well , come along in , then . "
8492	8538	8484	8484	She	156	" It s about Charles and Uncle John s offer .... Mother s been talking to me . She says she can t afford to pay for him after this term . She says she ll have to ask for an overdraft as it is . "
8539	8546	8548	8548	Ralph	153	" That s simply not true , "
8550	8568	8484	8484	She	156	" No . I thought not . But she won t believe me when I say it . "
8595	8601	8602	8602	she	572	" I m not interrupting ? "
8628	8641	8642	8642	he	153	" She doesn t understand that one s got to take risks , "
8647	8669	8708	8708	he	153	" I believe mother would take risks if she knew that Charles was the sort of boy to profit by it . "
8670	8680	8682	8682	Ralph	153	" He s got brains , hasn t he ? "
8728	8764	8722	8722	her	572	" In some ways he s fearfully backward , though , compared with what you were at his age . And he s difficult at home , too . He makes Molly slave for him . "
8806	8809	8803	8803	He	153	" she , "
8833	8849	8828	8828	he	153	" It s pretty hard lines to stick a boy into an office at seventeen ! "
8850	8862	8863	8863	she	572	" Nobody _ wants _ to stick him into an office , "
8965	8970	8971	8971	he	153	" The truth is , "
8975	9000	8971	8971	he	153	" that I ought to have accepted Uncle John s offer . I should have been making six hundred a year by this time . "
9001	9011	9012	9012	Joan	156	" I don t think that for a moment , "
9021	9043	9012	9012	Joan	156	" The question , to my mind , is , whether we couldn t cut down our expenses in some way . "
9044	9049	9060	9060	sister	581	" A smaller house ? "
9050	9056	9012	9012	Joan	156	" Fewer servants , perhaps . "
9088	9096	9083	9083	Ralph	153	" It s out of the question . "
9177	9184	9174	9175	his family	542	" If mother won t run risks "
9185	9197	9174	9175	his family	542	" You really can t expect her to sell out again . "
9198	9226	9174	9175	his family	542	" She ought to look upon it as an investment ; but if she won t , we must find some other way , that s all . "
9409	9425	9426	9426	she	156	" I think you d be foolish to risk your money on poor old Charles , "
9429	9454	9426	9426	she	156	" Fond as I am of him , he doesn t seem to me exactly brilliant .... Besides , why should you be sacrificed ? "
9455	9460	9461	9461	Ralph	153	" My dear Joan , "
9473	9564	9461	9461	Ralph	153	" don t you see that we ve all got to be sacrificed ? What s the use of denying it ? What s the use of struggling against it ? So it always has been , so it always will be . We ve got no money and we never shall have any money . We shall just turn round in the mill every day of our lives until we drop and die , worn out , as most people do , when one comes to think of it . "
9590	9598	9584	9584	she	156	" Aren t you happy , Ralph ? "
9599	9629	9571	9571	her	156	" No . Are you ? Perhaps I m as happy as most people , though . God knows whether I m happy or not . What is happiness ? "
9675	9678	9679	9679	she	572	" Happiness , "
9717	9725	9726	9726	she	572	" Hilda was here to - day , "
9738	9749	9750	9750	Ralph	153	" She brought Bobbie he s a fine boy now . "
10035	10042	10043	10043	Joan	156	" Shall you talk to mother ? "
10046	10077	10043	10043	Joan	156	" Because , you see , the thing s got to be settled , one way or another . Charles must write to Uncle John if he s going there . "
10082	10093	10094	10094	he	153	" I suppose it doesn t much matter either way , "
10097	10108	10094	10094	he	153	" He s doomed to misery in the long run . "
10118	10126	10127	10127	she	156	" You know you re talking nonsense , "
10130	10155	10127	10127	she	156	" It doesn t hurt any one to have to earn their own living . I m very glad I have to earn mine . "
10179	10200	10172	10172	he	153	" Isn t that only because you ve forgotten how to enjoy yourself ? You never have time for anything decent "
10201	10206	10172	10172	he	153	" As for instance ? "
10207	10240	10172	10172	he	153	" Well , going for walks , or music , or books , or seeing interesting people . You never do anything that s really worth doing any more than I do . "
10241	10257	10258	10258	she	156	" I always think you could make this room much nicer , if you liked , "
10261	10292	10172	10172	he	153	" What does it matter what sort of room I have when I m forced to spend all the best years of my life drawing up deeds in an office ? "
10293	10307	10172	10172	he	153	" You said two days ago that you found the law so interesting . "
10308	10322	10172	10172	he	153	" So it is if one could afford to know anything about it . "
10324	10335	10336	10336	Joan	156	" That s Herbert only just going to bed now , "
10348	10360	10336	10336	Joan	156	" And then he won t get up in the morning . "
10433	10441	10442	10442	he	153	" D you ever pay calls now ? "
10446	10460	10426	10426	she	156	" I don t often have the time . Why do you ask ? "
10461	10480	10426	10426	she	156	" It might be a good thing , to get to know new people , that s all . "
10481	10485	10487	10487	Joan	156	" Poor Ralph ! "
10494	10514	10487	10487	Joan	156	" You think your sister s getting very old and very dull that s it , isn t it ? "
10515	10525	10526	10526	he	153	" I don t think anything of the kind , "
10534	10576	10531	10531	he	153	" But you lead a dog s life , Joan . When you re not working in an office , you re worrying over the rest of us . And I m not much good to you , I m afraid . "
10923	10927	10928	10928	he	4488	" Hereditary Genius , "
11804	11810	11801	11801	he	444	" good and great man . "
12058	12062	12055	12055	aunts	693	" from India , "
12088	12094	12081	12081	she	128	" remember all your life . "
13364	13472	13356	13356	she	128	" Well done , Katharine ! What a wonderful head for business you ve got ! Now I shall keep this before me , and every day I shall make a little mark in my pocketbook , and on the last day of all let me think , what shall we do to celebrate the last day of all ? If it weren t the winter we could take a jaunt to Italy . They say Switzerland s very lovely in the snow , except for the cold . But , as you say , the great thing is to finish the book . Now let me see "
15280	15318	15278	15278	her	332	" your wicked old Uncle Judge Peter , who used to be heard delivering sentence of death in the bathroom . Thank Heaven , Katharine , I ve not a drop of _ him _ in me ! "
15959	15965	15966	15966	she	174	" And here we are , "
15980	15985	15966	15966	she	174	" talking about art . "
16388	16391	16392	16392	he	153	" Alone ? "
16405	16411	16412	16412	she	174	" I am sometimes alone , "
16415	16424	16425	16425	he	153	" But you expect a great many people , "
16432	16449	16425	16425	he	153	" It s like a room on the stage . Who is it to - night ? "
16450	16476	16430	16430	him	153	" William Rodney , upon the Elizabethan use of metaphor . I expect a good solid paper , with plenty of quotations from the classics . "
16501	16517	16518	16518	he	153	" I suppose you are the only woman in London who darns her own stockings , "
16521	16533	16534	16534	she	174	" I m only one of a great many thousands really , "
16537	16597	16534	16534	she	174	" though I must admit that I was thinking myself very remarkable when you came in . And now that you re here I don t think myself remarkable at all . How horrid of you ! But I m afraid you re much more remarkable than I am . You ve done much more than I ve done . "
16598	16613	16615	16615	Ralph	153	" If that s your standard , you ve nothing to be proud of , "
16618	16636	16637	16637	she	174	" Well , I must reflect with Emerson that it s being and not doing that matters , "
16640	16643	16644	16644	Ralph	153	" Emerson ? "
16650	16661	16644	16644	Ralph	153	" You don t mean to say you read Emerson ? "
16662	16677	16678	16678	she	174	" Perhaps it wasn t Emerson ; but why shouldn t I read Emerson ? "
16687	16714	16644	16644	Ralph	153	" There s no reason that I know of . It s the combination that s odd books and stockings . The combination is very odd . "
16769	16775	16776	16776	she	174	" You always say that , "
16779	16820	16776	16776	she	174	" I assure you it s a common combination , as you call it , in the houses of the clergy . The only thing that s odd about me is that I enjoy them both Emerson and the stocking . "
16830	16842	16827	16827	Ralph	153	" Damn those people ! I wish they weren t coming ! "
16843	16855	16857	16857	Mary	174	" It s only Mr. Turner , on the floor below , "
16879	16886	16887	16887	Ralph	153	" Will there be a crowd ? "
16894	16931	16860	16860	she	174	" There ll be the Morrises and the Crashaws , and Dick Osborne , and Septimus , and all that set . Katharine Hilbery is coming , by the way , so William Rodney told me . "
16932	16936	16937	16937	Ralph	153	" Katharine Hilbery ! "
16940	16945	16946	16946	Mary	174	" You know her ? "
16953	16965	16860	16860	she	174	" I went to a tea - party at her house . "
17008	17023	17024	17024	she	174	" But , in spite of what you say , I do admire her , "
17027	17050	17024	17024	she	174	" I ve only seen her once or twice , but she seems to me to be what one calls a personality . "
17051	17072	17136	17136	people	380	" I didn t mean to abuse her . I only felt that she wasn t very sympathetic to me . "
17073	17086	17024	17024	she	174	" They say she s going to marry that queer creature Rodney . "
17087	17102	17136	17136	people	380	" Marry Rodney ? Then she must be more deluded than I thought her . "
17103	17113	17114	17114	Mary	174	" Now that s my door , all right , "
17167	17170	17154	17164	women , who came in with a peculiar look of expectation	839	" Oh ! "
17403	17416	17382	17383	Mr. Rodney	181	" In undertaking to speak of the Elizabethan use of metaphor in poetry "
17723	17731	17712	17713	most people	4553	" Fancy marrying a creature like that ! "
17959	17987	17935	17935	he	181	" Well , Katharine , I hope I ve made a big enough fool of myself even for you ! It was terrible ! terrible ! terrible ! "
17988	17997	17998	17998	Katharine	332	" Hush ! You must answer their questions , "
18090	18093	18094	18094	he	175	" Idiot ! "
18097	18106	18094	18094	he	175	" He s misunderstood every word I said ! "
18107	18114	18115	18115	Katharine	332	" Well then , answer him , "
18119	18149	18150	18150	he	175	" No , I shan t ! They d only laugh at me . Why did I let you persuade me that these sort of people care for literature ? "
18512	18524	18494	18495	Mary Datchet	174	" That was what I call a first - rate paper . "
18595	18608	18610	18610	Mary	174	" Let s go and tell him how much we liked it , "
18652	18660	18661	18661	Mary	174	" That was a very interesting paper , "
18679	18691	18661	18661	Mary	174	" Will you lend me the manuscript to read in peace ? "
18712	18727	18728	18728	he	175	" Do you say that merely to disguise the fact of my ridiculous failure ? "
18741	18754	18755	18755	she	332	" He says he doesn t mind what we think of him , "
18758	18773	18755	18755	she	332	" He says we don t care a rap for art of any kind . "
18774	18787	18788	18788	Rodney	175	" I asked her to pity me , and she teases me ! "
18791	18803	18804	18804	Mary	174	" I don t intend to pity you , Mr. Rodney , "
18812	18832	18804	18804	Mary	174	" When a paper s a failure , nobody says anything , whereas now , just listen to them ! "
18869	18880	18881	18881	Rodney	175	" D you think that s all about my paper ? "
18897	18903	18905	18905	Mary	174	" Of course it is , "
18907	18915	18905	18905	Mary	174	" It was a very suggestive paper . "
18928	18950	18951	18951	he	153	" It s the ten minutes after a paper is read that proves whether it s been a success or not , "
18954	18970	18951	18951	he	153	" If I were you , Rodney , I should be very pleased with myself . "
18998	19001	18981	18981	he	153	" suggestive . "
19002	19035	18981	18981	he	153	" Did you agree at all , Denham , with what I said about Shakespeare s later use of imagery ? I m afraid I didn t altogether make my meaning plain . "
19093	19109	19086	19086	He	153	" Did you remember to get that picture glazed before your aunt came to dinner ? "
19386	19399	19400	19400	he	175	" You remember the passage just before the death of the Duchess ? "
19651	19654	19643	19643	she	174	" personality , "
19670	19684	19685	19685	she	332	" They re exactly like a flock of sheep , aren t they ? "
19706	19718	19719	19719	she	332	" I wonder what they re making such a noise about ? "
19722	19729	19685	19685	she	332	" The Elizabethans , I suppose . "
19730	19759	19685	19685	she	332	" No , I don t think it s got anything to do with the Elizabethans . There ! Didn t you hear them say , Insurance Bill ? "
19760	19770	19771	19771	Mary	174	" I wonder why men always talk about politics ? "
19774	19788	19771	19771	Mary	174	" I suppose , if we had votes , we should , too . "
19789	19810	19685	19685	she	332	" I dare say we should . And you spend your life in getting us votes , don t you ? "
19811	19815	19817	19817	Mary	174	" I do , "
19821	19833	19817	19817	Mary	174	" From ten to six every day I m at it . "
19871	19888	19889	19889	she	332	" I suppose you re one of the people who think we should all have professions , "
19908	19913	19915	19915	Mary	174	" Oh dear no , "
19919	19927	19928	19928	Katharine	332	" Well , I think I do , "
19936	19963	19928	19928	Katharine	332	" You will always be able to say that you ve done something , whereas , in a crowd like this , I feel rather melancholy . "
19964	19974	19975	19975	Mary	174	" In a crowd ? Why in a crowd ? "
19998	20023	20024	20024	she	174	" Don t you see how many different things these people care about ? And I want to beat them down I only mean , "
20028	20048	20026	20026	herself	174	" that I want to assert myself , and it s difficult , if one hasn t a profession . "
20119	20132	20133	20133	Katharine	332	" Ah , but I want to trample upon their prostrate bodies ! "
20159	20175	20176	20176	Mary	174	" One doesn t necessarily trample upon people s bodies because one runs an office , "
20179	20185	20186	20186	Katharine	332	" No . Perhaps not , "
20269	20278	20279	20279	she	174	" Yes , they re very like sheep , "
20284	20294	20295	20295	Katharine	332	" And yet they are very clever at least , "
20298	20307	20295	20295	Katharine	332	" I suppose they have all read Webster . "
20308	20344	20279	20279	she	174	" Surely you don t think that a proof of cleverness ? I ve read Webster , I ve read Ben Jonson , but I don t think myself clever not exactly , at least . "
20345	20354	20355	20355	Katharine	332	" I think you must be very clever , "
20358	20367	20279	20279	she	174	" Why ? Because I run an office ? "
20368	20391	20279	20279	she	174	" I wasn t thinking of that . I was thinking how you live alone in this room , and have parties . "
20398	20460	20279	20279	she	174	" It means , chiefly , a power of being disagreeable to one s own family , I think . I have that , perhaps . I didn t want to live at home , and I told my father . He didn t like it .... But then I have a sister , and you haven t , have you ? "
20461	20470	20279	20279	she	174	" No , I haven t any sisters . "
20471	20481	20482	20482	Mary	174	" You are writing a life of your grandfather ? "
20505	20514	20502	20502	She	332	" Yes , I am helping my mother , "
20595	20598	20588	20588	Mary	174	" egoist . "
20599	20605	20606	20606	she	174	" She s an egoist , "
20637	20651	20652	20652	Katharine	332	" Heavens , what a mess there ll be to - morrow morning ! "
20655	20669	20652	20652	Katharine	332	" I hope you don t sleep in this room , Miss Datchet ? "
20673	20680	20681	20681	Katharine	332	" What are you laughing at ? "
20684	20691	20652	20652	Katharine	332	" I won t tell you . "
20692	20709	20652	20652	Katharine	332	" Let me guess . You were laughing because you thought I d changed the conversation ? "
20710	20713	20652	20652	Katharine	332	" No . "
20714	20718	20719	20719	She	332	" Because you think "
20722	20740	20652	20652	Katharine	332	" If you want to know , I was laughing at the way you said Miss Datchet . "
20741	20752	20652	20652	Katharine	332	" Mary , then . Mary , Mary , Mary . "
20784	20788	20790	20790	Mary	174	" Mary Datchet , "
20792	20808	20790	20790	Mary	174	" It s not such an imposing name as Katharine Hilbery , I m afraid . "
20961	20977	20978	20978	His	153	" I wonder , Miss Hilbery , whether you remembered to get that picture glazed ? "
20991	20997	20998	20998	Mary	174	" Oh , you idiot ! "
21040	21043	20998	20998	Mary	174	" mensa . "
21044	21049	21050	21050	Katharine	332	" Picture what picture ? "
21053	21081	21050	21050	Katharine	332	" Oh , at home , you mean that Sunday afternoon . Was it the day Mr. Fortescue came ? Yes , I think I remembered it . "
21322	21334	21335	21335	Denham	153	" You know the names of the stars , I suppose ? "
21369	21383	21362	21362	her	332	" I know how to find the Pole star if I m lost . "
21384	21395	21362	21362	her	332	" I don t suppose that often happens to you . "
21396	21406	21407	21407	she	332	" No . Nothing interesting ever happens to me , "
21410	21425	21426	21426	he	153	" I think you make a system of saying disagreeable things , Miss Hilbery , "
21438	21459	21426	21426	he	153	" I suppose it s one of the characteristics of your class . They never talk seriously to their inferiors . "
21516	21525	21526	21526	she	332	" In what sense are you my inferior ? "
21620	21631	21632	21632	Katharine	332	" I don t think I understand what you mean , "
22027	22029	22020	22020	his	188	" hum "
22031	22034	22020	22020	his	188	" ha , "
22382	22395	22366	22366	he	188	" I hear that Bennett has given up his theory of truth . "
22603	22631	22589	22589	Rodney	175	" I promise I won t say another word about it , Katharine ! But do stop a minute and look at the moon upon the water . "
22647	22664	22665	22665	she	332	" I m sure one can smell the sea , with the wind blowing this way , "
22733	22736	22737	22737	Rodney	175	" Ah ! "
22749	22797	22798	22798	he	175	" why can t one say how beautiful it all is ? Why am I condemned for ever , Katharine , to feel what I can t express ? And the things I can give there s no use in my giving . Trust me , Katharine , "
22802	22880	22798	22798	he	175	" I won t speak of it again . But in the presence of beauty look at the iridescence round the moon ! one feels one feels Perhaps if you married me I m half a poet , you see , and I can t pretend not to feel what I do feel . If I could write ah , that would be another matter . I shouldn t bother you to marry me then , Katharine . "
22901	22912	22914	22914	Katharine	332	" But for me I suppose you would recommend marriage ? "
22924	22971	22973	22973	he	175	" Certainly I should . Not for you only , but for all women . Why , you re nothing at all without it ; you re only half alive ; using only half your faculties ; you must feel that for yourself . That is why "
22992	23011	22973	22973	he	175	" With how sad steps she climbs the sky , How silently and with how wan a face , "
23015	23031	23032	23032	Katharine	332	" I ve been told a great many unpleasant things about myself to - night , "
23040	23077	23032	23032	Katharine	332	" Mr. Denham seems to think it his mission to lecture me , though I hardly know him . By the way , William , you know him ; tell me , what is he like ? "
23084	23096	22973	22973	he	175	" We may lecture you till we re blue in the face "
23097	23105	22973	22973	he	175	" Yes but what s he like ? "
23106	23122	23123	23123	he	175	" And we write sonnets to your eyebrows , you cruel practical creature . Denham ? "
23131	23175	23127	23127	Katharine	332	" A good fellow , I should think . He cares , naturally , for the right sort of things , I expect . But you mustn t marry him , though . He scolded you , did he what did he say ? "
23176	23295	22973	22973	he	175	" What happens with Mr. Denham is this : He comes to tea . I do all I can to put him at his ease . He merely sits and scowls at me . Then I show him our manuscripts . At this he becomes really angry , and tells me I ve no business to call myself a middle - class woman . So we part in a huff ; and next time we meet , which was to - night , he walks straight up to me , and says , Go to the Devil ! That s the sort of behavior my mother complains of . I want to know , what does it mean ? "
23316	23332	22973	22973	he	175	" It means , I should say , that he finds you chilly and unsympathetic . "
23344	23361	23362	23362	she	955	" It s time I jumped into a cab and hid myself in my own house , "
23365	23387	23388	23388	Rodney	175	" Would your mother object to my being seen with you ? No one could possibly recognize us , could they ? "
23421	23467	23408	23408	she	955	" You may laugh , Katharine , but I can tell you that if any of your friends saw us together at this time of night they would talk about it , and I should find that very disagreeable . But why do you laugh ? "
23468	23494	23408	23408	she	955	" I don t know . Because you re such a queer mixture , I think . You re half poet and half old maid . "
23495	23523	23408	23408	she	955	" I know I always seem to you highly ridiculous . But I can t help having inherited certain traditions and trying to put them into practice . "
23524	23557	23408	23408	she	955	" Nonsense , William . You may come of the oldest family in Devonshire , but that s no reason why you should mind being seen alone with me on the Embankment . "
23558	23581	23408	23408	she	955	" I m ten years older than you are , Katharine , and I know more of the world than you do . "
23582	23592	23408	23408	she	955	" Very well . Leave me and go home . "
23629	23644	23620	23620	Katharine	332	" Don t call that cab for me , William . I shall walk . "
23645	23675	23706	23706	she	332	" Nonsense , Katharine ; you ll do nothing of the kind . It s nearly twelve o clock , and we ve walked too far as it is . "
23700	23705	23706	23706	she	332	" Now , William , "
23709	23744	23706	23706	she	332	" if people see me racing along the Embankment like this they _ will _ talk . You had far better say good - night , if you don t want people to talk . "
23773	23788	23789	23789	he	175	" Don t let the man see us struggling , for God s sake ! "
23800	23814	23815	23815	she	332	" There s more of the old maid in you than the poet , "
23907	23925	23926	23926	he	175	" Of all the unreasonable , inconsiderate creatures I ve ever known , she s the worst ! "
23937	23989	23926	23926	he	175	" Heaven forbid that I should ever make a fool of myself with her again . Why , I d sooner marry the daughter of my landlady than Katharine Hilbery ! She d leave me not a moment s peace and she d never understand me never , never , never ! "
24189	24192	24193	24193	Rodney	175	" Ha ! "
24313	24320	24321	24321	he	175	" You do well , Denham , "
24325	24361	24362	24362	he	175	" to have nothing to do with young women . I offer you my experience if one trusts them one invariably has cause to repent . Not that I have any reason at this moment , "
24366	24406	24362	24362	he	175	" to complain of them . It s a subject that crops up now and again for no particular reason . Miss Datchet , I dare say , is one of the exceptions . Do you like Miss Datchet ? "
24543	24561	24562	24562	he	129	" Yes , I like Mary ; I don t see how one could help liking her , "
24575	24627	24562	24562	he	129	" Ah , Denham , you re so different from me . You never give yourself away . I watched you this evening with Katharine Hilbery . My instinct is to trust the person I m talking to . That s why I m always being taken in , I suppose . "
24675	24683	24684	24684	he	129	" Who s taken you in now ? "
24687	24691	24684	24684	he	129	" Katharine Hilbery ? "
24724	24728	24729	24729	he	175	" Katharine Hilbery , "
24738	24774	24775	24775	he	175	" No , Denham , I have no illusions about that young woman . I think I made that plain to her to - night . But don t run away with a false impression , "
24836	24957	24958	24958	he	981	" You must not think that I have any bitterness against her far from it . It s not altogether her fault , poor girl . She lives , you know , one of those odious , self - centered lives at least , I think them odious for a woman feeding her wits upon everything , having control of everything , getting far too much her own way at home spoilt , in a sense , feeling that every one is at her feet , and so not realizing how she hurts that is , how rudely she behaves to people who haven t all her advantages . Still , to do her justice , she s no fool , "
24972	25005	25006	25006	he	981	" She has taste . She has sense . She can understand you when you talk to her . But she s a woman , and there s an end of it , "
25020	25032	25033	25033	Denham	129	" And did you tell her all this to - night ? "
25036	25079	25006	25006	he	981	" Oh dear me , no . I should never think of telling Katharine the truth about herself . That wouldn t do at all . One has to be in an attitude of adoration in order to get on with Katharine . "
25080	25099	25100	25100	Denham	129	" Now I ve learnt that she s refused to marry him why don t I go home ? "
25194	25205	25206	25206	he	175	" You re a slave like me , I suppose ? "
25209	25215	25277	25277	his	175	" A solicitor , yes . "
25216	25244	25277	25277	his	175	" I sometimes wonder why we don t chuck it . Why don t you emigrate , Denham ? I should have thought that would suit you . "
25245	25251	25277	25277	his	175	" I ve a family . "
25252	25273	25275	25275	he	175	" I m often on the point of going myself . And then I know I couldn t live without this "
25319	25412	25277	25277	his	175	" There are one or two people I m fond of , and there s a little good music , and a few pictures , now and then just enough to keep one dangling about here . Ah , but I couldn t live with savages ! Are you fond of books ? Music ? Pictures ? D you care at all for first editions ? I ve got a few nice things up here , things I pick up cheap , for I can t afford to give what they ask . "
25578	25605	25609	25609	himself	175	" Oh dear me , what a waste of time ! But it s over now , and so we may think no more about it . "
25667	25672	25674	25674	Rodney	175	" The Baskerville Congreve , "
25682	25693	25674	25674	Rodney	175	" I couldn t read him in a cheap edition . "
25954	25957	25980	25980	him	175	" Don Giovanni "
25963	25968	25970	25970	Denham	129	" Well , Rodney , "
25982	25991	25973	25973	he	129	" this is all very nice and comfortable . "
26015	26018	26019	26019	he	175	" Tolerable , "
26022	26041	25992	25992	Rodney	175	" But I dare say it s just as well that you have to earn your own living . "
26042	26085	26005	26006	a proprietor	1007	" If you mean that I shouldn t do anything good with leisure if I had it , I dare say you re right . But I should be ten times as happy with my whole day to spend as I liked . "
26086	26091	26092	26092	Denham	129	" I doubt that , "
26115	26126	26127	26127	Rodney	175	" I could spend three hours every day reading Shakespeare , "
26130	26148	26127	26127	Rodney	175	" And there s music and pictures , let alone the society of the people one likes . "
26149	26162	26005	26006	a proprietor	1007	" You d be bored to death in a year s time . "
26163	26184	26127	26127	Rodney	175	" Oh , I grant you I should be bored if I did nothing . But I should write plays . "
26185	26189	26005	26006	a proprietor	1007	" H m ! "
26190	26196	26197	26197	he	175	" I should write plays , "
26200	26238	26197	26197	he	175	" I ve written three - quarters of one already , and I m only waiting for a holiday to finish it . And it s not bad no , some of it s really rather nice . "
26330	26342	26343	26343	Denham	129	" Well , ... will you let me see the play ? "
26389	26400	26401	26401	he	175	" Do you really care for this kind of thing ? "
26436	26451	26429	26429	he	175	" Very few people care for poetry . I dare say it bores you . "
26452	26455	26456	26456	Denham	129	" Perhaps , "
26459	26468	26469	26469	Rodney	175	" Well , I ll lend it you , "
26523	26527	26517	26519	Sir Thomas Browne	192	" Urn Burial , "
26529	26532	26517	26519	Sir Thomas Browne	192	" Hydriotaphia , "

26679	26688	26689	26689	Denham	129	" I shall look in again some time , "
26708	26713	26697	26697	his	175	" If you like . "
28784	28799	28800	28801	Mrs. Seal	194	" The bare branches against the sky do one so much _ good _ , "
28810	28821	28823	28823	Mary	174	" But one can t lunch off trees , Sally , "
28825	28840	28841	28842	Mr. Clacton	195	" I confess I don t know how you manage it , Miss Datchet , "
28845	28869	28841	28842	Mr. Clacton	195	" I should sleep all the afternoon , I know , if I took a heavy meal in the middle of the day . "
28870	28880	28881	28881	Mary	174	" What s the very latest thing in literature ? "
29031	29040	29027	29027	she	174	" Eleanor , come and sit by me , "
29247	29254	29239	29239	she	174	" I am in love with you "
29362	29365	29366	29366	she	174	" For , "
29385	29412	29372	29372	she	174	" the wonderful thing about you is that you re ready for anything ; you re not in the least conventional , like most clever men . "
29440	29448	29449	29449	she	174	" That is what you can do , "
29460	29470	29449	29449	she	174	" You always make people do what you want . "
29508	29516	29492	29492	she	174	" I am in love with you , "
29735	29738	29722	29723	Mrs. Seal	194	" quite splendid "
29740	29747	29722	29723	Mrs. Seal	194	" really too bad for words . "
30014	30022	29992	29992	she	174	" No . The S.G.S. top floor . "
30117	30120	30121	30121	she	174	" You ! "
30124	30132	30121	30121	she	174	" We thought you were the printer . "
30143	30177	30178	30178	she	174	" No , Mr. Clacton , it s not Penningtons . I should ring them up again double three double eight , Central . Well , this is a surprise . Come in , "
30181	30190	30139	30139	she	174	" You re just in time for tea . "
30301	30313	30314	30314	she	174	" It was very clever of you to find your way , "
30501	30510	30511	30511	she	194	" Always the way , always the way , "
30514	30530	30511	30511	she	194	" Kit Markham is the only person who knows how to deal with the thing . "
30561	30578	30580	30580	Mary	174	" If we had known Miss Hilbery was coming , we should have bought a cake , "
30630	30635	30636	30636	he	195	" Salford s affiliated , "
30639	30645	30646	30647	Mrs. Seal	194	" Well done , Salford ! "
30666	30681	30683	30684	Mr. Clacton	195	" Yes , these provincial centers seem to be coming into line at last , "
30710	30715	30696	30696	he	195	" in our work . "
30716	30724	30726	30727	Mrs. Seal	194	" And the proofs still not come ? "
30753	30821	30726	30727	Mrs. Seal	194	" It s too bad too bad . At this rate we shall miss the country post . Which reminds me , Mr. Clacton , don t you think we should circularize the provinces with Partridge s last speech ? What ? You ve not read it ? Oh , it s the best thing they ve had in the House this Session . Even the Prime Minister "
30828	30839	30840	30840	she	174	" We don t allow shop at tea , Sally , "
30844	30865	30866	30866	she	174	" We fine her a penny each time she forgets , and the fines go to buying a plum cake , "
30887	30896	30897	30898	Mrs. Seal	194	" I m sorry , I m sorry , "
30901	30911	30912	30912	she	194	" It s my misfortune to be an enthusiast , "
30919	30993	30994	30994	she	194	" My father s daughter could hardly be anything else . I think I ve been on as many committees as most people . Waifs and Strays , Rescue Work , Church Work , C. O. S. local branch besides the usual civic duties which fall to one as a householder . But I ve given them all up for our work here , and I don t regret it for a second , "
30997	31011	30994	30994	she	194	" This is the root question , I feel ; until women have votes "
31012	31023	31025	31025	Mary	174	" It ll be sixpence , at least , Sally , "
31035	31049	31025	31025	Mary	174	" And we re all sick to death of women and their votes . "
31069	31075	31050	31051	Mrs. Seal	194	" tut - tut - tut "
31114	31144	31145	31145	she	194	" She s doing more for the cause than any of us . She s giving her youth for , alas ! when I was young there were domestic circumstances "
31201	31213	31215	31216	Mrs. Seal	194	" Yes , I took my little bag into the square , "
31234	31268	31269	31269	she	194	" It was really very sustaining , and the bare boughs against the sky do one so much _ good _ . But I shall have to give up going into the square , "
31276	31306	31269	31269	she	194	" The injustice of it ! Why should I have a beautiful square all to myself , when poor women who need rest have nowhere at all to sit ? "
31321	31397	31307	31307	She	194	" It s dreadful what a tyrant one still is , in spite of all one s efforts . One tries to lead a decent life , but one can t. Of course , directly one thinks of it , one sees that _ all _ squares should be open to _ every one _ . Is there any society with that object , Mr. Clacton ? If not , there should be , surely . "
31398	31404	31406	31407	Mr. Clacton	195	" A most excellent object , "
31413	31471	31472	31472	he	195	" At the same time , one must deplore the ramification of organizations , Mrs. Seal . So much excellent effort thrown away , not to speak of pounds , shillings , and pence . Now how many organizations of a philanthropic nature do you suppose there are in the City of London itself , Miss Hilbery ? "
31604	31620	31621	31621	she	332	" Well , there are more in this house than I d any notion of , "
31624	31645	31621	31621	she	332	" On the ground floor you protect natives , on the next you emigrate women and tell people to eat nuts "
31646	31657	31658	31658	Mary	174	" Why do you say that we do these things ? "
31664	31684	31658	31658	Mary	174	" We re not responsible for all the cranks who choose to lodge in the same house with us . "
31778	31789	31791	31792	Mrs. Seal	194	" You don t belong to our society , then ? "
31794	31804	31806	31806	Katharine	332	" No , I m afraid I don t , "
31844	31848	31849	31849	she	332	" But surely , "
31852	31862	31864	31865	Mr. Clacton	195	" Mrs. Seal is an enthusiast in these matters , "
31870	31893	31864	31865	Mr. Clacton	195	" We have to remind her sometimes that others have a right to their views even if they differ from our own .... "
31895	31918	31849	31849	she	332	" has a very funny picture this week , about a Suffragist and an agricultural laborer . Have you seen this week s "
31921	31925	31849	31849	she	332	" Miss Datchet ? "
31931	31934	31926	31926	Mary	174	" No . "
31989	32014	31985	31985	she	194	" But surely , if you care about the welfare of your sex at all , you must wish them to have the vote ? "
32015	32029	32030	32030	Katharine	332	" I never said I didn t wish them to have the vote , "
32033	32045	32046	32047	Mrs. Seal	194	" Then why aren t you a member of our society ? "
32091	32118	32146	32146	they	1132	" Are you in any way related , I wonder , to the poet Alardyce ? His daughter , I believe , married a Mr. Hilbery . "
32119	32129	32131	32131	Katharine	332	" Yes ; I m the poet s granddaughter , "
32151	32157	32158	32159	Mrs. Seal	194	" The poet s granddaughter ! "
32191	32202	32203	32203	he	195	" Ah , indeed . That interests me very much , "
32206	32256	32203	32203	he	195	" I owe a great debt to your grandfather , Miss Hilbery . At one time I could have repeated the greater part of him by heart . But one gets out of the way of reading poetry , unfortunately . You don t remember him , I suppose ? "
32283	32289	32269	32270	Mrs. Seal	194	" The proofs at last ! "
32296	32305	32306	32306	she	194	" Oh , it s only Mr. Denham ! "
32355	32367	32341	32341	Mary	174	" Katharine has come to see how one runs an office . "
32378	32395	32368	32368	Ralph	153	" I hope Mary hasn t persuaded you that she knows how to run an office ? "
32396	32403	32405	32405	Katharine	332	" What , doesn t she ? "
32465	32541	32457	32457	she	194	" Now , I know what you re going to say , Mr. Denham ! But it was the day Kit Markham was here , and she upsets one so with her wonderful vitality , always thinking of something new that we ought to be doing and aren t and I was conscious at the time that my dates were mixed . It had nothing to do with Mary at all , I assure you . "
32542	32551	32553	32553	Mary	174	" My dear Sally , don t apologize , "
32557	32575	32553	32553	Mary	174	" Men are such pedants they don t know what things matter , and what things don t. "
32576	32587	32589	32590	Mr. Clacton	195	" Now , Denham , speak up for our sex , "
32627	32632	32603	32603	he	195	" a mere man . "
32655	32667	32668	32668	he	195	" Doesn t it seem strange to you , Miss Hilbery , "
32671	32726	32668	32668	he	195	" that the French , with all their wealth of illustrious names , have no poet who can compare with your grandfather ? Let me see . There s Chenier and Hugo and Alfred de Musset wonderful men , but , at the same time , there s a richness , a freshness about Alardyce "
32783	32892	32911	32911	she	1139	" For if I were to tell you what I know of back - stairs intrigue , and what can be done by the power of the purse , you wouldn t credit me , Mr. Denham , you wouldn t , indeed . Which is why I feel that the only work for my father s daughter for he was one of the pioneers , Mr. Denham , and on his tombstone I had that verse from the Psalms put , about the sowers and the seed .... And what wouldn t I give that he should be alive now , seeing what we re going to see "
32977	32988	32989	32989	she	174	" The standard of morality seems to me frightfully low , "
33001	33043	33044	33044	she	174	" especially among women who aren t well educated . They don t see that small things matter , and that s where the leakage begins , and then we find ourselves in difficulties I very nearly lost my temper yesterday , "
33068	33086	33087	33087	she	174	" It makes me very angry when people tell me lies doesn t it make you angry ? "
33091	33100	33101	33101	Katharine	332	" But considering that every one tells lies , "
33208	33233	33234	33234	Mary	174	" I don t think that I tell lies , and I don t think that Ralph tells lies , do you , Ralph ? "
34132	34152	34122	34122	she	332	" Mary Datchet does that sort of work very well .... She s responsible for it , I suppose ? "
34153	34172	34122	34122	she	332	" Yes . The others don t help at all .... Has she made a convert of you ? "
34173	34186	34122	34122	she	332	" Oh no . That is , I m a convert already . "
34187	34199	34122	34122	she	332	" But she hasn t persuaded you to work for them ? "
34200	34211	34122	34122	she	332	" Oh dear no that wouldn t do at all . "
34249	34258	34259	34259	he	153	" Suppose we get on to that omnibus ? "
34279	34287	34288	34288	Katharine	332	" But which way are you going ? "
34307	34315	34316	34316	Ralph	153	" I m going to the Temple , "
34443	34449	34450	34450	she	332	" This is like Venice , "
34457	34475	34450	34450	she	332	" The motor - cars , I mean , shooting about so quickly , with their lights . "
34476	34483	34484	34484	he	153	" I ve never seen Venice , "
34487	34500	34484	34484	he	153	" I keep that and some other things for my old age . "
34501	34508	34509	34509	she	332	" What are the other things ? "
34512	34527	34484	34484	he	153	" There s Venice and India and , I think , Dante , too . "
34531	34554	34566	34566	her	332	" Think of providing for one s old age ! And would you refuse to see Venice if you had the chance ? "
34584	34618	34558	34558	her	332	" I ve planned out my life in sections ever since I was a child , to make it last longer . You see , I m always afraid that I m missing something "
34619	34625	34626	34626	Katharine	332	" And so am I ! "
34629	34635	34636	34636	she	332	" But , after all , "
34639	34646	34636	34636	she	332	" why should you miss anything ? "
34647	34659	34660	34660	Ralph	153	" Why ? Because I m poor , for one thing , "
34663	34682	34660	34660	Ralph	153	" You , I suppose , can have Venice and India and Dante every day of your life . "
34848	34869	34870	34870	she	332	" But to know that one might have things doesn t alter the fact that one hasn t got them , "
34877	34890	34891	34891	she	332	" How could I go to India , for example ? Besides , "
34924	34934	34935	34935	he	153	" I have a message to give your father , "
34938	34950	34935	34935	he	153	" Perhaps you would give it him , or I could come "
34951	34957	34958	34958	Katharine	332	" Yes , do come , "
34961	34976	34977	34977	Ralph	153	" Still , I don t see why you shouldn t go to India , "
35095	35155	35089	35091	the phantom one	1187	" And little Augustus Pelham said to me , It s the younger generation knocking at the door , and I said to him , Oh , but the younger generation comes in without knocking , Mr. Pelham . Such a feeble little joke , wasn t it , but down it went into his notebook all the same . "
35156	35174	35176	35177	Mr. Hilbery	132	" Let us congratulate ourselves that we shall be in the grave before that work is published , "
35551	35570	35572	35573	Mr. Hilbery	132	" The only excuse for you , Katharine , is that dinner is still later than you are , "
35580	35595	35597	35598	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" I don t mind her being late when the result is so charming , "
35607	35627	35628	35628	she	128	" Still , I don t know that I _ like _ your being out so late , Katharine , "
35631	35640	35628	35628	she	128	" You took a cab , I hope ? "
35879	35885	35886	35886	she	128	" That s more cheerful , "
35889	35946	35886	35886	she	128	" D you know , Katharine , that ridiculous goose came to tea with me ? Oh , how I wanted you ! He tried to make epigrams all the time , and I got so nervous , expecting them , you know , that I spilt the tea and he made an epigram about that ! "
35947	35952	35953	35953	Katharine	332	" Which ridiculous goose ? "
35958	35975	35977	35978	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Only one of my geese , happily , makes epigrams Augustus Pelham , of course , "
35980	35990	35992	35992	Katharine	332	" I m not sorry that I was out , "
35994	35998	35999	36000	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Poor Augustus ! "
36003	36024	35999	36000	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" But we re all too hard on him . Remember how devoted he is to his tiresome old mother . "
36025	36040	35977	35978	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" That s only because she is his mother . Any one connected with himself "
36041	36075	35999	36000	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" No , no , Katharine that s too bad . That s what s the word I mean , Trevor , something long and Latin the sort of word you and Katharine know "
36079	36082	35999	36000	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" cynical . "
36083	36181	35999	36000	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Well , that ll do . I don t believe in sending girls to college , but I should teach them that sort of thing . It makes one feel so dignified , bringing out these little allusions , and passing on gracefully to the next topic . But I don t know what s come over me I actually had to ask Augustus the name of the lady Hamlet was in love with , as you were out , Katharine , and Heaven knows what he mayn t put down about me in his diary . "
36182	36186	36187	36187	Katharine	332	" I wish , "
36223	36230	36231	36231	he	403	" What is it you wish ? "
36272	36295	36249	36249	she	332	" I wish mother wasn t famous . I was out at tea , and they would talk to me about poetry . "
36296	36310	36259	36259	they	1211	" Thinking you must be poetical , I see and aren t you ? "
36311	36323	36249	36249	she	332	" Who s been talking to you about poetry , Katharine ? "
36346	36400	36249	36249	she	332	" They have an office at the top of one of the old houses in Russell Square . I never saw such queer - looking people . And the man discovered I was related to the poet , and talked to me about poetry . Even Mary Datchet seems different in that atmosphere . "
36401	36414	36416	36417	Mr. Hilbery	132	" Yes , the office atmosphere is very bad for the soul , "
36419	36439	36440	36441	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" I don t remember any offices in Russell Square in the old days , when Mamma lived there , "
36444	36479	36440	36441	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" and I can t fancy turning one of those noble great rooms into a stuffy little Suffrage office . Still , if the clerks read poetry there must be something nice about them . "
36480	36494	36495	36495	Katharine	332	" No , because they don t read it as we read it , "
36498	36523	36524	36525	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" But it s nice to think of them reading your grandfather , and not filling up those dreadful little forms all day long , "
36558	36580	36581	36582	Mr. Hilbery	132	" At any rate , they haven t made a convert of Katharine , which was what I was afraid of , "
36585	36589	36591	36591	Katharine	332	" Oh no , "
36595	36605	36591	36591	Katharine	332	" I wouldn t work with them for anything . "
36606	36611	36612	36613	Mr. Hilbery	132	" It s curious , "
36621	36688	36612	36613	Mr. Hilbery	132	" how the sight of one s fellow - enthusiasts always chokes one off . They show up the faults of one s cause so much more plainly than one s antagonists . One can be enthusiastic in one s study , but directly one comes into touch with the people who agree with one , all the glamor goes . So I ve always found , "
37207	37212	37213	37213	she	128	" Oh , Katharine , "
37216	37300	37213	37213	she	128	" how you ve made me think of Mamma and the old days in Russell Square ! I can see the chandeliers , and the green silk of the piano , and Mamma sitting in her cashmere shawl by the window , singing till the little ragamuffin boys outside stopped to listen . Papa sent me in with a bunch of violets while he waited round the corner . It must have been a summer evening . That was before things were hopeless .... "
37721	37728	37729	37729	she	128	" If they d lived now , "
37732	37820	37729	37729	she	128	" I feel it wouldn t have happened . People aren t so set upon tragedy as they were then . If my father had been able to go round the world , or if she d had a rest cure , everything would have come right . But what could I do ? And then they had bad friends , both of them , who made mischief . Ah , Katharine , when you marry , be quite , quite sure that you love your husband ! "
37839	37876	37834	37834	Katharine	332	" Now this is what Mary Datchet and Mr. Denham don t understand . This is the sort of position I m always getting into . How simple it must be to live as they do ! "
37901	37906	37907	37908	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" But , Katharine , "
37920	37980	37907	37908	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" though , Heaven knows , I don t want to see you married , surely if ever a man loved a woman , William loves you . And it s a nice , rich - sounding name too Katharine Rodney , which , unfortunately , doesn t mean that he s got any money , because he hasn t. "
38006	38021	38022	38023	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" It s very dull that you can only marry one husband , certainly , "
38026	38057	38022	38023	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" I always wish that you could marry everybody who wants to marry you . Perhaps they ll come to that in time , but meanwhile I confess that dear William "
38256	38268	38205	38206	the moderns	1260	" Please , Katharine , read us something _ real _ . "
38702	38705	38706	38706	she	332	" Remember , "
38716	38772	38706	38706	she	332	" that he bears your grandfather s name , and so will the child that is to be born . The poor boy is not so much to blame as the woman who deluded him , thinking him a gentleman , which he IS , and having money , which he has _ not _ . "
38773	38782	38784	38784	Katharine	332	" What would Ralph Denham say to this ? "
38838	38848	38849	38849	she	332	" What would Mary Datchet and Ralph Denham say ? "
39787	39789	39838	39838	he	132	" of "
39792	39795	39838	39838	he	132	" and , "
39808	39812	39838	39838	he	132	" Nag s Head "
39816	39820	39838	39838	he	132	" Turkish Knight , "
40002	40010	39999	39999	She	332	" Isabella and the Pot of Basil , "
40055	40084	40046	40046	she	332	" I ve had a letter from Aunt Celia about Cyril , father .... It seems to be true about his marriage . What are we to do ? "
40085	40098	40100	40101	Mr. Hilbery	132	" Cyril seems to have been behaving in a very foolish manner , "
40143	40155	40156	40156	he	403	" He s about done for himself , I should say , "
40186	40189	40184	40184	he	403	" Humph ! "
40198	40205	40206	40206	Katharine	332	" Mother knows nothing about it , "
40209	40215	40206	40206	Katharine	332	" Will you tell her ? "
40216	40238	40184	40184	he	403	" I shall tell your mother . But I shall tell her that there is nothing whatever for us to do . "
40239	40244	40245	40245	Katharine	332	" But the marriage ? "
40263	40276	40277	40277	he	403	" What in the name of conscience did he do it for ? "
40308	40328	40302	40302	she	332	" Ibsen and Butler .... He has sent me a letter full of quotations nonsense , though clever nonsense . "
40329	40353	40354	40354	he	403	" Well , if the younger generation want to carry on its life on those lines , it s none of our affair , "
40357	40373	40374	40374	Katharine	332	" But isn t it our affair , perhaps , to make them get married ? "
40379	40389	40390	40391	her father	403	" Why the dickens should they apply to me ? "
40397	40405	40390	40390	her	332	" Only as the head of the family "
40406	40431	40433	40434	Mr. Hilbery	132	" But I m not the head of the family . Alfred s the head of the family . Let them apply to Alfred , "
40462	40481	40482	40482	she	332	" I think , perhaps , the best thing would be for me to go and see them , "
40485	40496	40497	40498	Mr. Hilbery	132	" I won t have you going anywhere near them , "
40506	40537	40497	40498	Mr. Hilbery	132	" Indeed , I don t understand why they ve dragged you into the business at all I don t see that it s got anything to do with you . "
40538	40547	40548	40548	Katharine	332	" I ve always been friends with Cyril , "
40551	40562	40563	40564	Mr. Hilbery	132	" But did he ever tell you anything about this ? "
40615	40621	40623	40624	Mr. Hilbery	132	" As to your mother , "
40643	40694	40623	40624	Mr. Hilbery	132	" you had better tell her the facts . She d better know the facts before every one begins to talk about it , though why Aunt Celia thinks it necessary to come , I m sure I don t know . And the less talk there is the better . "
40879	40885	40886	40886	she	332	" Have you told mother ? "
40918	40930	40931	40931	He	132	" My dear child , it went out of my head . "
40947	40975	40931	40931	He	132	" I ll send a note round from the office .... I m late this morning , and I ve any amount of proofs to get through . "
40976	40984	40985	40985	Katharine	332	" That wouldn t do at all , "
40989	41010	40985	40985	Katharine	332	" She must be told you or I must tell her . We ought to have told her at first . "
41295	41298	41299	41299	she	128	" Katharine , "
41308	41384	41299	41299	she	128	" I ve just made out such a queer , strange thing about your grandfather . I m three years and six months older than he was when he died . I couldn t very well have been his mother , but I might have been his elder sister , and that seems to me such a pleasant fancy . I m going to start quite fresh this morning , and get a lot done . "
42173	42203	42165	42166	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" I really believe I m bewitched ! I only want three sentences , you see , something quite straightforward and commonplace , and I can t find em . "
42240	42243	42244	42244	she	128	" Besides , "
42256	42275	42244	42244	she	128	" I don t believe this ll do . Did your grandfather ever visit the Hebrides , Katharine ? "
42287	42334	42276	42276	She	128	" My mind got running on the Hebrides , and I couldn t help writing a little description of them . Perhaps it would do at the beginning of a chapter . Chapters often begin quite differently from the way they go on , you know . "
42371	42377	42378	42378	she	332	" It s very beautiful , "
42381	42397	42378	42378	she	332	" but , you see , mother , we ought to go from point to point "
42398	42404	42405	42406	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Oh , I know , "
42409	42471	42472	42472	she	332	" And that s just what I can t do . Things keep coming into my head . It isn t that I don t know everything and feel everything ( who did know him , if I didn t ? ) , but I can t put it down , you see . There s a kind of blind spot , "
42479	42501	42472	42472	she	332	" there . And when I can t sleep o nights , I fancy I shall die without having done it . "
42682	42687	42688	42688	she	128	" Surely , Katharine , "
42691	42744	42688	42688	she	128	" the men were far handsomer in those days than they are now , in spite of their odious whiskers ? Look at old John Graham , in his white waistcoat look at Uncle Harley . That s Peter the manservant , I suppose . Uncle John brought him back from India . "
42913	42918	42919	42919	she	128	" What is nobler , "
42927	43075	42919	42919	she	128	" than to be a woman to whom every one turns , in sorrow or difficulty ? How have the young women of your generation improved upon that , Katharine ? I can see them now , sweeping over the lawns at Melbury House , in their flounces and furbelows , so calm and stately and imperial ( and the monkey and the little black dwarf following behind ) , as if nothing mattered in the world but to be beautiful and kind . But they did more than we do , I sometimes think . They WERE , and that s better than doing . They seem to me like ships , like majestic ships , holding on their way , not shoving or pushing , not fretted by little things , as we are , but taking their way , like ships with white sails . "
43258	43264	43265	43265	she	128	" That s Janie Mannering , "
43286	43370	43265	43265	she	128	" I must have told you how she found her cook drunk under the kitchen table when the Empress was coming to dinner , and tucked up her velvet sleeves ( she always dressed like an Empress herself ) , cooked the whole meal , and appeared in the drawing - room as if she d been sleeping on a bank of roses all day . She could do anything with her hands they all could make a cottage or embroider a petticoat . "
43371	43378	43379	43379	she	128	" And that s Queenie Colquhoun , "
43387	43506	43379	43379	she	128	" who took her coffin out with her to Jamaica , packed with lovely shawls and bonnets , because you couldn t get coffins in Jamaica , and she had a horror of dying there ( as she did ) , and being devoured by the white ants . And there s Sabine , the loveliest of them all ; ah ! it was like a star rising when she came into the room . And that s Miriam , in her coachman s cloak , with all the little capes on , and she wore great top - boots underneath . You young people may say you re unconventional , but you re nothing compared with her . "
43535	43541	43542	43543	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Ah , you wretch ! "
43546	43733	43734	43735	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" what a wicked old despot you were , in your day ! How we all bowed down before you ! Maggie , she used to say , if it hadn t been for me , where would you be now ? And it was true ; she brought them together , you know . She said to my father , Marry her , and he did ; and she said to poor little Clara , Fall down and worship him , and she did ; but she got up again , of course . What else could one expect ? She was a mere child eighteen and half dead with fright , too . But that old tyrant never repented . She used to say that she had given them three perfect months , and no one had a right to more ; and I sometimes think , Katharine , that s true , you know . It s more than most of us have , only we have to pretend , which was a thing neither of them could ever do . I fancy , "
43738	43765	43734	43735	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" that there was a kind of sincerity in those days between men and women which , with all your outspokenness , you haven t got . "
43790	43800	43801	43801	she	128	" They must have been good friends at heart , "
43804	43820	43801	43801	she	128	" because she used to sing his songs . Ah , how did it go ? "
43858	43866	43867	43867	she	128	" It s the vitality of them ! "
43877	44004	43867	43867	she	128	" That s what we haven t got ! We re virtuous , we re earnest , we go to meetings , we pay the poor their wages , but we don t live as they lived . As often as not , my father wasn t in bed three nights out of the seven , but always fresh as paint in the morning . I hear him now , come singing up the stairs to the nursery , and tossing the loaf for breakfast on his sword - stick , and then off we went for a day s pleasuring Richmond , Hampton Court , the Surrey Hills . Why shouldn t we go , Katharine ? It s going to be a fine day . "
44049	44053	44054	44054	She	332	" Aunt Celia ! "
44280	44294	44295	44295	she	217	" I think Aunt Celia has come to talk about Cyril , mother , "
44300	44317	44295	44295	she	217	" Aunt Celia has discovered that Cyril is married . He has a wife and children . "
44318	44328	44329	44330	Mrs. Milvain	217	" No , he is _ not _ married , "
44343	44355	44329	44330	Mrs. Milvain	217	" He has two children , and another on the way . "
44367	44383	44384	44384	Katharine	332	" We thought it better to wait until it was proved before we told you , "
44387	44401	44402	44403	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" But I met Cyril only a fortnight ago at the National Gallery ! "
44406	44416	44402	44403	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" I don t believe a word of it , "
44468	44481	44483	44484	Mrs. Milvain	217	" I didn t _ wish _ to believe it , Maggie , "
44486	44514	44483	44484	Mrs. Milvain	217	" For a long time I _ couldn t _ believe it . But now I ve seen , and I _ have _ to believe it . "
44515	44518	44519	44520	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Katharine , "
44523	44531	44519	44520	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" does your father know of this ? "
44535	44539	44540	44541	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Cyril married ! "
44544	44577	44540	44541	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" And never telling us a word , though we ve had him in our house since he was a child noble William s son ! I can t believe my ears ! "
44654	44776	44639	44639	She	128	" I have suspected for some time that he was not happy . There were new lines on his face . So I went to his rooms , when I knew he was engaged at the poor men s college . He lectures there Roman law , you know , or it may be Greek . The landlady said Mr. Alardyce only slept there about once a fortnight now . He looked so ill , she said . She had seen him with a young person . I suspected something directly . I went to his room , and there was an envelope on the mantelpiece , and a letter with an address in Seton Street , off the Kennington Road . "
44795	44802	44803	44804	Aunt Celia	218	" I went to Seton Street , "
44808	44868	44803	44804	Aunt Celia	218	" A very low place lodging - houses , you know , with canaries in the window . Number seven just like all the others . I rang , I knocked ; no one came . I went down the area . I am certain I saw some one inside children a cradle . But no reply no reply . "
44891	44898	44899	44899	she	218	" I stood in the street , "
44902	44967	44899	44899	she	218	" in case I could catch a sight of one of them . It seemed a very long time . There were rough men singing in the public - house round the corner . At last the door opened , and some one it must have been the woman herself came right past me . There was only the pillar - box between us . "
44968	44976	44977	44978	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" And what did she look like ? "
44981	44993	44997	44998	Mrs. Milvain	217	" One could see how the poor boy had been deluded , "
45005	45009	45010	45011	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Poor thing ! "
45014	45018	45019	45020	Mrs. Milvain	217	" Poor Cyril ! "
45030	45040	45041	45042	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" But they ve got nothing to live upon , "
45045	45056	45057	45057	she	128	" If he d come to us like a man , "
45061	45122	45057	45057	she	128	" and said , I ve been a fool , one would have pitied him ; one would have tried to help him . There s nothing so disgraceful after all But he s been going about all these years , pretending , letting one take it for granted , that he was single . And the poor deserted little wife "
45123	45132	45133	45134	Aunt Celia	218	" She is _ not _ his wife , "
45137	45146	45147	45148	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" I ve never heard anything so detestable ! "
45290	45301	45302	45302	she	128	" We must realize Cyril s point of view first , "
45494	45501	45484	45484	she	235	" made a life for herself , "
45512	45517	45518	45518	she	235	" This unhappy business , "
45528	45581	45518	45518	she	235	" If the train had not gone out of the station just as I arrived , I should have been with you before . Celia has doubtless told you . You will agree with me , Maggie . He must be made to marry her at once for the sake of the children "
45582	45591	45592	45593	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" But does he refuse to marry her ? "
45603	45615	45616	45617	Cousin Caroline	235	" He has written an absurd perverted letter , all quotations , "
45620	45656	45616	45617	Cousin Caroline	235	" He thinks he s doing a very fine thing , where we only see the folly of it .... The girl s every bit as infatuated as he is for which I blame him . "
45657	45662	45663	45664	Aunt Celia	218	" She entangled him , "
45695	45713	45715	45716	Cousin Caroline	235	" It s no use going into the rights and wrongs of the affair now , Celia , "
45763	45819	45746	45747	Mrs. Milvain	217	" The mischief s done , and very ugly mischief too . Are we to allow the third child to be born out of wedlock ? ( I am sorry to have to say these things before you , Katharine . ) He will bear your name , Maggie your father s name , remember . "
45820	45831	45833	45834	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" But let us hope it will be a girl , "
45909	45916	45917	45917	she	377	" It s detestable quite detestable ! "
45948	45966	45967	45967	she	377	" Nowadays , people don t think so badly of these things as they used to do , "
45970	46090	46091	46091	she	377	" It will be horribly uncomfortable for them sometimes , but if they are brave , clever children , as they will be , I dare say it ll make remarkable people of them in the end . Robert Browning used to say that every great man has Jewish blood in him , and we must try to look at it in that light . And , after all , Cyril has acted on principle . One may disagree with his principle , but , at least , one can respect it like the French Revolution , or Cromwell cutting the King s head off . Some of the most terrible things in history have been done on principle , "
46094	46107	46108	46109	Cousin Caroline	235	" I m afraid I take a very different view of principle , "
46113	46116	46117	46118	Aunt Celia	218	" Principle ! "
46134	46145	46146	46146	she	218	" I will go to - morrow and see him , "
46149	46163	46164	46165	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" But why should you take these disagreeable things upon yourself , Celia ? "
46341	46352	46353	46353	she	377	" Perhaps it would be better if I married William , "
48702	48729	48733	48733	she	332	" It s life that matters , nothing but life the process of discovering the everlasting and perpetual process , not the discovery itself at all . "
49008	49011	49012	49012	she	174	" Now , "
49023	49049	49050	49050	she	174	" I m not going to let these silly ideas come into my head .... Don t you think Mr. Asquith deserves to be hanged ? "
49151	49200	49148	49148	he	153	" How absurd Mary would think me if she knew that I almost made up my mind to walk all the way to Chelsea in order to look at Katharine s windows . She wouldn t understand it , but I like her very much as she is . "
49359	49362	49363	49363	he	153	" Here , "
49366	49381	49363	49363	he	153	" is where we differ from women ; they have no sense of romance . "
49382	49387	49388	49388	he	153	" Well , Mary , "
49393	49402	49388	49388	he	153	" why don t you say something amusing ? "
49432	49445	49427	49427	she	174	" Because I ve got nothing amusing to say , I suppose . "
49456	49469	49470	49470	he	153	" You work too hard . I don t mean your health , "
49478	49495	49470	49470	he	153	" I mean that you seem to me to be getting wrapped up in your work . "
49496	49504	49505	49505	she	174	" And is that a bad thing ? "
49515	49521	49522	49522	he	153	" I think it is , "
49526	49538	49539	49539	Her	174	" But only a week ago you were saying the opposite . "
49695	49704	49705	49705	he	153	" You don t read enough , Mary , "
49709	49717	49705	49705	he	153	" You ought to read more poetry . "
49805	49818	49800	49800	she	174	" I m behaving exactly as I said I wouldn t behave , "
49833	49844	49820	49820	she	174	" Tell me what I ought to read , then . "
49884	49891	49892	49892	he	153	" You live with your inferiors , "
49906	50065	50066	50066	he	153	" And you get into a groove because , on the whole , it s rather a pleasant groove . And you tend to forget what you re there for . You ve the feminine habit of making much of details . You don t see when things matter and when they don t. And that s what s the ruin of all these organizations . That s why the Suffragists have never done anything all these years . What s the point of drawing - room meetings and bazaars ? You want to have ideas , Mary ; get hold of something big ; never mind making mistakes , but don t niggle . Why don t you throw it all up for a year , and travel ? see something of the world . Don t be content to live with half a dozen people in a backwater all your life . But you won t , "
50069	50086	50088	50088	Mary	174	" I ve rather come to that way of thinking myself about myself , I mean , "
50096	50106	50088	50088	Mary	174	" I should like to go somewhere far away . "
50119	50137	50115	50115	Ralph	153	" But look here , Mary , you haven t been taking this seriously , have you ? "
50170	50180	50181	50181	he	153	" You won t go away , will you ? "
50193	50202	50190	50190	he	153	" Oh no , don t go away . "
50203	50215	50216	50216	she	174	" I don t know exactly what I mean to do , "
50667	50688	50690	50690	Katharine	332	" It s life that matters , nothing but life the process of discovering , the everlasting and perpetual process , "
50711	50719	50720	50720	She	332	" not the discovery itself at all . "
50962	50967	50968	50968	she	332	" Well , William , "
50971	50979	50968	50968	she	332	" I m afraid I m late . "
51245	51253	51242	51242	she	332	" I like your sonnet very much . "
51557	51566	51567	51567	she	332	" My oysters ! I had a basket , "
51570	51597	51567	51567	she	332	" and I ve left it somewhere . Uncle Dudley dines with us to - night . What in the world have I done with them ? "
51622	51631	51608	51608	William	175	" Oysters , oysters your basket of oysters ! "
51678	51683	51684	51684	she	332	" I had them , "
51687	51703	51704	51704	she	332	" in the Strand ; I sat on a seat . Well , never mind , "
51714	51728	51704	51704	she	332	" I dare say some old creature is enjoying them by this time . "
51729	51740	51741	51741	William	175	" I should have thought that you never forgot anything , "
51750	51763	51764	51764	Katharine	332	" That s part of the myth about me , I know , "
51767	51772	51773	51773	William	175	" And I wonder , "
51780	51800	51801	51801	he	175	" what the truth about you is ? But I know this sort of thing doesn t interest you , "
51811	51822	51823	51823	she	332	" No ; it doesn t interest me very much , "
51827	51835	51836	51836	he	175	" What shall we talk about then ? "
51850	51899	51839	51839	She	332	" However we start , we end by talking about the same thing about poetry , I mean . I wonder if you realize , William , that I ve never read even Shakespeare ? It s rather wonderful how I ve kept it up all these years . "
51900	51919	51920	51920	he	175	" You ve kept it up for ten years very beautifully , as far as I m concerned , "
51923	51932	51839	51839	She	332	" Ten years ? So long as that ? "
51933	51945	51946	51946	he	175	" And I don t think it s always bored you , "
52224	52234	52235	52235	he	175	" You may say you don t read books , "
52238	52277	52235	52235	he	175	" but , all the same , you know about them . Besides , who wants you to be learned ? Leave that to the poor devils who ve got nothing better to do . You you ahem ! "
52278	52294	52296	52296	Katharine	332	" Well , then , why don t you read me something before I go ? "
52303	52325	52326	52326	He	175	" Katharine , you ve only just come ! Let me see now , what have I got to show you ? "
52371	52384	52385	52385	he	175	" I believe you only ask me to read out of kindness , "
52389	52405	52385	52385	he	175	" Let s find something else to talk about . Who have you been seeing ? "
52406	52417	52418	52418	Katharine	332	" I don t generally ask things out of kindness , "
52421	52435	52418	52418	Katharine	332	" however , if you don t want to read , you needn t. "
52474	52487	52488	52488	he	175	" One can trust you , certainly , to say unpleasant things , "
52508	52572	52488	52488	he	175	" Ahem ! The Princess is lost in the wood , and she hears the sound of a horn . ( This would all be very pretty on the stage , but I can t get the effect here . ) Anyhow , Sylvano enters , accompanied by the rest of the gentlemen of Gratian s court . I begin where he soliloquizes . "
52839	52865	52819	52820	a scholar	1569	" That seems to me extremely well written , William ; although , of course , I don t know enough to criticize in detail . "
52866	52879	52819	52820	a scholar	1569	" But it s the skill that strikes you not the emotion ? "
52880	52896	52819	52820	a scholar	1569	" In a fragment like that , of course , the skill strikes one most . "
52897	52940	52819	52820	a scholar	1569	" But perhaps have you time to listen to one more short piece ? the scene between the lovers ? There s some real feeling in that , I think . Denham agrees that it s the best thing I ve done . "
52941	52950	52819	52820	a scholar	1569	" You ve read it to Ralph Denham ? "
52957	52972	52951	52951	Katharine	332	" He s a better judge than I am . What did he say ? "
52973	52978	52979	52979	Rodney	175	" My dear Katharine , "
52982	53109	52979	52979	Rodney	175	" I don t ask you for criticism , as I should ask a scholar . I dare say there are only five men in England whose opinion of my work matters a straw to me . But I trust you where feeling is concerned . I had you in my mind often when I was writing those scenes . I kept asking myself , Now is this the sort of thing Katharine would like ? I always think of you when I m writing , Katharine , even when it s the sort of thing you wouldn t know about . And I d rather yes , I really believe I d rather you thought well of my writing than any one in the world . "
53126	53137	53138	53138	she	332	" You think too much of me altogether , William , "
53153	53162	53163	53163	he	1570	" No , Katharine , I don t , "
53173	53183	53163	53163	he	1570	" It does me good to think of you . "
53627	53630	53631	53631	she	332	" William , "
53652	53655	53656	53656	she	332	" William , "
53660	53673	53656	53656	she	332	" if you still want me to marry you , I will . "
53788	54388	53778	53783	her sister - in - law	1414	" ... How stupid of me to forget the name in my telegram . Such a nice , rich , English name , too , and , in addition , he has all the graces of intellect ; he has read literally _ everything _ . I tell Katharine , I shall always put him on my right side at dinner , so as to have him by me when people begin talking about characters in Shakespeare . They won t be rich , but they ll be very , very happy . I was sitting in my room late one night , feeling that nothing nice would ever happen to me again , when I heard Katharine outside in the passage , and I thought to myself , Shall I call her in ? and then I thought ( in that hopeless , dreary way one does think , with the fire going out and one s birthday just over ) , Why should I lay my troubles on _ her ? _ But my little self - control had its reward , for next moment she tapped at the door and came in , and sat on the rug , and though we neither of us said anything , I felt so happy all of a second that I couldn t help crying , Oh , Katharine , when you come to my age , how I hope you ll have a daughter , too ! You know how silent Katharine is . She was so silent , for such a long time , that in my foolish , nervous state I dreaded something , I don t quite know what . And then she told me how , after all , she had made up her mind . She had written . She expected him to - morrow . At first I wasn t glad at all . I didn t want her to marry any one ; but when she said , It will make no difference . I shall always care for you and father most , then I saw how selfish I was , and I told her she must give him everything , everything , everything ! I told her I should be thankful to come second . But why , when everything s turned out just as one always hoped it would turn out , why then can one do nothing but cry , nothing but feel a desolate old woman whose life s been a failure , and now is nearly over , and age is so cruel ? But Katharine said to me , I am happy . I m very happy . And then I thought , though it all seemed so desperately dismal at the time , Katharine had said she was happy , and I should have a son , and it would all turn out so much more wonderfully than I could possibly imagine , for though the sermons don t say so , I do believe the world is meant for us to be happy in . She told me that they would live quite near us , and see us every day ; and she would go on with the Life , and we should finish it as we had meant to . And , after all , it would be far more horrid if she didn t marry or suppose she married some one we couldn t endure ? Suppose she had fallen in love with some one who was married already ? "
54389	54600	54703	54704	the girl	410	" And though one never thinks any one good enough for the people one s fond of , he has the kindest , truest instincts , I m sure , and though he seems nervous and his manner is not commanding , I only think these things because it s Katharine . And now I ve written this , it comes over me that , of course , all the time , Katharine has what he hasn t. She does command , she isn t nervous ; it comes naturally to her to rule and control . It s time that she should give all this to some one who will need her when we aren t there , save in our spirits , for whatever people say , I m sure I shall come back to this wonderful world where one s been so happy and so miserable , where , even now , I seem to see myself stretching out my hands for another present from the great Fairy Tree whose boughs are still hung with enchanting toys , though they are rarer now , perhaps , and between the branches one sees no longer the blue sky , but the stars and the tops of the mountains . "
54601	54660	53778	53783	her sister - in - law	1414	" One doesn t know any more , does one ? One hasn t any advice to give one s children . One can only hope that they will have the same vision and the same power to believe , without which life would be so meaningless . That is what I ask for Katharine and her husband . "
54663	54674	54675	54675	Denham	153	" Is Mr. Hilbery at home , or Mrs. Hilbery ? "
54690	54702	54703	54704	the girl	410	" No , sir . But Miss Hilbery is at home , "
54877	54883	54884	54884	she	332	" My father is out , "
54887	54899	54884	54884	she	332	" But if you can wait , I expect him soon . "
54952	54963	54964	54964	he	153	" Is that one of the moderns whom you despise ? "
54975	54978	54979	54979	she	332	" Yes , "
54982	54991	54979	54979	she	332	" I think even you would despise him . "
54992	54996	54997	54997	he	153	" Even I ? "
55000	55005	54997	54997	he	153	" Why even I ? "
55006	55020	54979	54979	she	332	" You said you liked modern things ; I said I hated them . "
55050	55061	55062	55062	she	332	" Or did I confess that I hated all books ? "
55076	55079	55067	55067	him	153	" I forget "
55080	55087	55088	55088	he	153	" Do you hate all books ? "
55091	55120	55067	55067	him	153	" It would be absurd to say that I hate all books when I ve only read ten , perhaps ; but Here she pulled herself up short . "
55121	55124	55067	55067	him	153	" Well ? "
55125	55133	55134	55134	she	332	" Yes , I do hate books , "
55137	55172	55134	55134	she	332	" Why do you want to be for ever talking about your feelings ? That s what I can t make out . And poetry s all about feelings novels are all about feelings . "
55525	55534	55535	55535	she	332	" My mother wants me to tell you , "
55538	55563	55564	55564	she	332	" that she hopes you have begun your poem . She says every one ought to write poetry .... All my relations write poetry , "
55568	55598	55564	55564	she	332	" I can t bear to think of it sometimes because , of course , it s none of it any good . But then one needn t read it "
55599	55610	55612	55612	Ralph	153	" You don t encourage me to write a poem , "
55614	55627	55628	55628	she	332	" But you re not a poet , too , are you ? "
55638	55647	55564	55564	she	332	" Should I tell you if I were ? "
55648	55659	55660	55660	she	332	" Yes . Because I think you speak the truth , "
55714	55720	55721	55721	she	332	" Are you a poet ? "
55753	55765	55766	55766	he	153	" No . I haven t written any poetry for years , "
55769	55792	55766	55766	he	153	" But all the same , I don t agree with you . I think it s the only thing worth doing . "
55793	55800	55801	55801	she	332	" Why do you say that ? "
55822	55825	55826	55826	Ralph	153	" Why ? "
55838	55854	55826	55826	Ralph	153	" Because , I suppose , it keeps an ideal alive which might die otherwise . "
55899	55913	55914	55914	she	332	" I don t know that there s much sense in having ideals , "
55917	55923	55924	55924	he	153	" But you have them , "
55928	55946	55924	55924	he	153	" Why do we call them ideals ? It s a stupid word . Dreams , I mean "
55970	55976	55967	55967	he	153	" Dreams , I mean , "
56046	56050	56051	56051	Katharine	332	" My aunts ! "
56375	56447	56367	56367	she	217	" I come from Woking , Mr. Popham . You may well ask me , why Woking ? and to that I answer , for perhaps the hundredth time , because of the sunsets . We went there for the sunsets , but that was five - and - twenty years ago . Where are the sunsets now ? Alas ! There is no sunset now nearer than the South Coast . "
56517	56524	56525	56525	she	217	" Where are the sunsets now ? "
56528	56538	56525	56525	she	217	" Do you find sunsets now , Mr. Popham ? "
56539	56545	56546	56546	he	153	" I live at Highgate , "
56549	56567	56568	56568	she	217	" At Highgate ? Yes , Highgate has its charms ; your Uncle John lived at Highgate , "
56601	56672	56674	56674	she	217	" I dare say there are very pretty lanes in Highgate . I can recollect walking with your mother , Katharine , through lanes blossoming with wild hawthorn . But where is the hawthorn now ? You remember that exquisite description in De Quincey , Mr. Popham ? but I forget , you , in your generation , with all your activity and enlightenment , at which I can only marvel "
56681	56706	56674	56674	she	217	" do not read De Quincey . You have your Belloc , your Chesterton , your Bernard Shaw why should you read De Quincey ? "
56707	56715	56716	56716	Ralph	153	" But I do read De Quincey , "
56719	56728	56716	56716	Ralph	153	" more than Belloc and Chesterton , anyhow . "
56729	56732	56734	56735	Mrs. Cosham	248	" Indeed ! "
56746	56770	56734	56735	Mrs. Cosham	248	" You are , then , a rara avis in your generation . I am delighted to meet anyone who reads De Quincey . "
56794	56802	56772	56772	she	248	" Does your friend _ write ? _ "
56803	56807	56809	56809	Katharine	332	" Mr. Denham , "
56820	56831	56809	56809	Katharine	332	" writes for the Review . He is a lawyer . "
56832	56862	56772	56772	she	248	" The clean - shaven lips , showing the expression of the mouth ! I recognize them at once . I always feel at home with lawyers , Mr. Denham "
56863	56876	56877	56878	Mrs. Milvain	217	" They used to come about so much in the old days , "
56899	56907	56908	56908	she	248	" You say you live at Highgate , "
56911	56939	56908	56908	she	248	" I wonder whether you happen to know if there is an old house called Tempest Lodge still in existence an old white house in a garden ? "
56949	56993	56994	56994	she	248	" Ah , no ; it must have been pulled down by this time , with all the other old houses . There were such pretty lanes in those days . That was how your uncle met your Aunt Emily , you know , "
56998	57006	56994	56994	she	248	" They walked home through the lanes . "
57007	57016	57017	57018	Mrs. Cosham	248	" A sprig of May in her bonnet , "
57023	57041	57017	57018	Mrs. Cosham	248	" And next Sunday he had violets in his buttonhole . And that was how we guessed . "
57086	57103	57104	57104	she	332	" Uncle John yes , poor John , you always called him . Why was that ? "
57125	57150	57151	57152	Mrs. Milvain	217	" That was what his father , old Sir Richard , always called him . Poor John , or the fool of the family , "
57158	57218	57219	57219	she	217	" The other boys were so brilliant , and he could never pass his examinations , so they sent him to India a long voyage in those days , poor fellow . You had your own room , you know , and you did it up . But he will get his knighthood and a pension , I believe , "
57226	57233	57219	57219	she	217	" only it is not England . "
57234	57237	57238	57239	Mrs. Cosham	248	" No , "
57243	57287	57288	57288	she	217	" it is not England . In those days we thought an Indian Judgeship about equal to a county - court judgeship at home . His Honor a pretty title , but still , not at the top of the tree . However , "
57291	57322	57323	57323	she	217	" if you have a wife and seven children , and people nowadays very quickly forget your father s name well , you have to take what you can get , "
57326	57331	57332	57333	Mrs. Milvain	217	" And I fancy , "
57342	57463	57464	57464	she	1633	" that John would have done more if it hadn t been for his wife , your Aunt Emily . She was a very good woman , devoted to him , of course , but she was not ambitious for him , and if a wife isn t ambitious for her husband , especially in a profession like the law , clients soon get to know of it . In our young days , Mr. Denham , we used to say that we knew which of our friends would become judges , by looking at the girls they married . And so it was , and so , I fancy , it always will be . I don t think , "
57473	57487	57464	57464	she	1633	" that any man is really happy unless he succeeds in his profession . "
57523	57620	57513	57513	her	1633	" No , men are not the same as women . I fancy Alfred Tennyson spoke the truth about that as about many other things . How I wish he d lived to write The Prince a sequel to The Princess ! I confess I m almost tired of Princesses . We want some one to show us what a good man can be . We have Laura and Beatrice , Antigone and Cordelia , but we have no heroic man . How do you , as a poet , account for that , Mr. Denham ? "
57621	57628	57630	57630	Ralph	153	" I m not a poet , "
57635	57642	57630	57630	Ralph	153	" I m only a solicitor . "
57643	57650	57651	57652	Mrs. Cosham	248	" But you write , too ? "
57674	57680	57681	57681	Denham	153	" In my spare time , "
57685	57691	57692	57693	Mrs. Cosham	248	" In your spare time ! "
57696	57706	57692	57693	Mrs. Cosham	248	" That is a proof of devotion , indeed . "
57843	57854	57855	57855	she	248	" Um um Pendennis Warrington I could never forgive Laura , "
57859	57977	57855	57855	she	248	" for not marrying George , in spite of everything . George Eliot did the very same thing ; and Lewes was a little frog - faced man , with the manner of a dancing master . But Warrington , now , had everything in his favor ; intellect , passion , romance , distinction , and the connection was a mere piece of undergraduate folly . Arthur , I confess , has always seemed to me a bit of a fop ; I can t imagine how Laura married him . But you say you re a solicitor , Mr. Denham . Now there are one or two things I should like to ask you about Shakespeare "
58000	58079	57978	57978	She	248	" They say , nowadays , that Shakespeare was a lawyer . They say , that accounts for his knowledge of human nature . There s a fine example for you , Mr. Denham . Study your clients , young man , and the world will be the richer one of these days , I have no doubt . Tell me , how do we come out of it , now ; better or worse than you expected ? "
58100	58123	58096	58096	Ralph	153	" Worse , Mrs. Cosham , a good deal worse . I m afraid the ordinary man is a bit of a rascal "
58124	58130	58096	58096	Ralph	153	" And the ordinary woman ? "
58131	58142	58096	58096	Ralph	153	" No , I don t like the ordinary woman either "
58143	58161	58162	58163	Mrs. Cosham	248	" Ah , dear me , I ve no doubt that s very true , very true . "
58166	58175	58162	58163	Mrs. Cosham	248	" Swift would have agreed with you , anyhow "
58208	58219	58220	58221	Mrs. Milvain	217	" Charles Lavington , you remember , was a solicitor , "
58245	58255	58220	58221	Mrs. Milvain	217	" But you wouldn t remember him , Katharine . "
58256	58267	58269	58269	Katharine	332	" Mr. Lavington ? Oh , yes , I do , "
58280	58308	58269	58269	Katharine	332	" The summer we had a house near Tenby . I remember the field and the pond with the tadpoles , and making haystacks with Mr. Lavington . "
58309	58323	58324	58325	Mrs. Cosham	248	" She is right . There _ was _ a pond with tadpoles , "
58328	58347	58324	58325	Mrs. Cosham	248	" Millais made studies of it for Ophelia . Some say that is the best picture he ever painted "
58348	58369	58269	58269	Katharine	332	" And I remember the dog chained up in the yard , and the dead snakes hanging in the toolhouse . "
58370	58383	58384	58385	Mrs. Milvain	217	" It was at Tenby that you were chased by the bull , "
58388	58446	58447	58447	she	217	" But that you couldn t remember , though it s true you were a wonderful child . Such eyes she had , Mr. Denham ! I used to say to her father , She s watching us , and summing us all up in her little mind . And they had a nurse in those days , "
58460	58583	58447	58447	she	217	" who was a good woman , but engaged to a sailor . When she ought to have been attending to the baby , her eyes were on the sea . And Mrs. Hilbery allowed this girl Susan her name was to have him to stay in the village . They abused her goodness , I m sorry to say , and while they walked in the lanes , they stood the perambulator alone in a field where there was a bull . The animal became enraged by the red blanket in the perambulator , and Heaven knows what might have happened if a gentleman had not been walking by in the nick of time , and rescued Katharine in his arms ! "
58584	58597	58599	58599	Katharine	332	" I think the bull was only a cow , Aunt Celia , "
58601	58642	58447	58447	she	217	" My darling , it was a great red Devonshire bull , and not long after it gored a man to death and had to be destroyed . And your mother forgave Susan a thing I could never have done . "
58643	58659	58661	58662	Mrs. Cosham	248	" Maggie s sympathies were entirely with Susan and the sailor , I am sure , "
58667	58675	58676	58676	she	248	" My sister - in - law , "
58679	58706	58676	58676	she	248	" has laid her burdens upon Providence at every crisis in her life , and Providence , I must confess , has responded nobly , so far "
58707	58710	58712	58712	Katharine	332	" Yes , "
58731	58745	58719	58719	she	332	" My mother s bulls always turn into cows at the critical moment . "
58746	58749	58751	58752	Mrs. Milvain	217	" Well , "
58754	58769	58751	58752	Mrs. Milvain	217	" I m glad you have some one to protect you from bulls now . "
58770	58782	58784	58784	Katharine	332	" I can t imagine William protecting any one from bulls , "
58810	58815	58835	58835	he	153	" Measure for Measure . "
58890	58895	58896	58896	he	153	" I like rubies , "
58901	58922	58896	58896	he	153	" To be imprison d in the viewless winds , And blown with restless violence round about The pendant world .... "
58931	58933	58896	58896	he	153	" Rodney "
58937	58939	58896	58896	he	153	" William "
59058	59070	59044	59045	Mrs. Cosham	248	" And have you settled upon a house yet , Katharine ? "
59090	59099	59082	59082	He	153	" Yes , it s a difficult passage . "
59188	59196	59197	59197	she	332	" Katharine s engaged to William Rodney , "
59208	59227	59197	59197	she	332	" a very old friend of ours . He has a wonderful knowledge of literature , too wonderful . "
59235	59242	59228	59228	She	332	" You should meet each other . "
59332	59339	59340	59340	she	332	" My father will be back , "
59343	59350	59352	59352	she	332	" Won t you sit down ? "
59380	59386	59387	59387	he	129	" I must congratulate you , "
59390	59397	59387	59387	he	129	" It was news to me . "
59412	59416	59417	59417	she	332	" My engagement ? "
59420	59431	59417	59417	she	332	" Yes , I am going to marry William Rodney . "
59483	59490	59491	59491	he	153	" Well , I must go , "
59511	59523	59524	59524	she	332	" You will come again , I hope . We always seem "
59526	59531	59491	59491	he	153	" to be interrupted . "
60165	60174	60175	60175	he	153	" In what can one trust , then ? "
60198	60229	60192	60192	he	153	" In what can one trust ? Not in men and women . Not in one s dreams about them . There s nothing nothing , nothing left at all . "
60819	60824	60825	60825	he	153	" Gracious , Mary ! "
60828	60834	60825	60825	he	153	" How you startled me ! "
60835	60849	60850	60850	she	174	" Yes . You looked as if you were walking in your sleep , "
60853	60871	60850	60850	she	174	" Are you arranging some terrible love affair ? Have you got to reconcile a desperate couple ? "
60872	60881	60882	60882	Ralph	153	" I wasn t thinking about my work , "
60888	60903	60904	60904	he	153	" And , besides , that sort of thing s not in my line , "
61018	61027	61028	61028	Mary	174	" I ve never seen sparrows so tame , "
61037	61040	61042	61042	Ralph	153	" No , "
61044	61073	61042	61042	Ralph	153	" The sparrows in Hyde Park aren t as tame as this . If we keep perfectly still , I ll get one to settle on my arm . "
61115	61118	61119	61119	he	153	" Done ! "
61211	61225	61226	61226	he	153	" That s what always happens just as I ve almost got him , "
61229	61261	61226	61226	he	153	" Here s your sixpence , Mary . But you ve only got it thanks to that brute of a boy . They oughtn t to be allowed to bowl hoops here "
61262	61279	61197	61197	his	153	" Oughtn t to be allowed to bowl hoops ! My dear Ralph , what nonsense ! "
61280	61286	61287	61287	he	153	" You always say that , "
61290	61341	61287	61287	he	153	" and it isn t nonsense . What s the point of having a garden if one can t watch birds in it ? The street does all right for hoops . And if children can t be trusted in the streets , their mothers should keep them at home . "
61378	61383	61384	61384	she	174	" Ah , well , "
61387	61416	61384	61384	she	174	" London s a fine place to live in . I believe I could sit and watch people all day long . I like my fellow - creatures .... "
61421	61435	61436	61436	she	174	" Yes , I think so , when you come to know them , "
61447	61458	61459	61459	he	153	" That s just when I don t like them , "
61462	61482	61483	61483	He	153	" Still , I don t see why you shouldn t cherish that illusion , if it pleases you . "
61497	61508	61509	61509	Mary	174	" Wake up , Ralph ! You re half asleep ! "
61518	61538	61509	61509	Mary	174	" What have you been doing with yourself ? Moping ? Working ? Despising the world , as usual ? "
61555	61568	61551	61551	she	174	" It s a bit of a pose , isn t it ? "
61569	61576	61577	61577	he	153	" Not more than most things , "
61580	61583	61584	61584	Mary	174	" Well , "
61587	61608	61584	61584	Mary	174	" I ve a great deal to say to you , but I must go on we have a committee . "
61622	61631	61632	61632	she	174	" You don t look happy , Ralph , "
61635	61645	61632	61632	she	174	" Is it anything , or is it nothing ? "
61696	61702	61703	61703	he	153	" I ve been bothered , "
61708	61737	61703	61703	he	153	" Partly by work , and partly by family troubles . Charles has been behaving like a fool . He wants to go out to Canada as a farmer "
61738	61750	61752	61752	Mary	174	" Well , there s something to be said for that , "
61930	61942	61943	61943	he	153	" What d you want to sit on a committee for ? "
61946	61956	61943	61943	he	153	" It s waste of your time , Mary . "
61957	61972	61973	61973	she	174	" I agree with you that a country walk would benefit the world more , "
61976	61980	61981	61981	she	174	" Look here , "
61985	62005	61981	61981	she	174	" why don t you come to us at Christmas ? It s almost the best time of year . "
62006	62013	62014	62014	Ralph	153	" Come to you at Disham ? "
62017	62034	62035	62035	she	174	" Yes . We won t interfere with you . But you can tell me later , "
62094	62109	62110	62110	she	174	" If I can t face a walk in a field alone with Ralph , "
62113	62148	62110	62110	she	174	" I d better buy a cat and live in a lodging at Ealing , like Sally Seal and he won t come . Or did he mean that he _ would _ come ? "
62399	62406	62407	62408	Mrs. Seal	194	" Miss Markham has already arrived , "
62415	62422	62407	62408	Mrs. Seal	194	" and this is her dog . "
62423	62431	62433	62433	Mary	174	" A very fine dog , too , "
62441	62448	62449	62450	Mrs. Seal	194	" Yes . A magnificent fellow , "
62453	62522	62535	62535	she	194	" A kind of St. Bernard , she tells me so like Kit to have a St. Bernard . And you guard your mistress well , don t you , Sailor ? You see that wicked men don t break into her larder when she s out at _ her _ work helping poor souls who have lost their way .... But we re late we must begin ! "
62798	62813	62781	62781	he	195	" I fancy , ladies and gentlemen , that we are ready to commence . "
63735	63746	63747	63747	She	1722	" My friends think all this kind of thing useless . "
63759	63770	63772	63773	Miss Markham	196	" Oh , they re that sort , are they ? "
63899	63909	63910	63910	she	174	" What do I matter compared with the cause ? "
63952	63960	63941	63942	Mrs. Seal	194	" Action ! everywhere ! at once ! "
64296	64333	64287	64287	Mary	174	" If I liked I could make you go in there or stop short ; I could make you walk in single file or in double file ; I could do what I liked with you . "
64343	64356	64357	64357	Mary	174	" Oughtn t you to put something round your shoulders , Sally ? "
64390	64398	64399	64399	Mary	174	" Well , did you enjoy yourself ? "
64441	64488	64407	64408	Mrs. Seal	194	" Ah , if only one could get every one of those people into this room , and make them understand for five minutes ! But they _ must _ see the truth some day .... If only one could _ make _ them see it .... "
64546	64553	64554	64554	she	174	" Let s have our tea , "
64568	64582	64583	64583	she	174	" It was a good meeting didn t you think so , Sally ? "
64609	64620	64622	64622	Sally	197	" But we go at such a snail s pace , "
64643	64650	64652	64652	Sally	197	" You can afford to laugh , "
64661	64693	64652	64652	Sally	197	" but I can t. I m fifty - five , and I dare say I shall be in my grave by the time we get it if we ever do . "
64694	64707	64709	64709	Mary	174	" Oh , no , you won t be in your grave , "
64713	64722	64724	64725	Mrs. Seal	194	" It ll be such a great day , "
64734	64812	64724	64725	Mrs. Seal	194	" A great day , not only for us , but for civilization . That s what I feel , you know , about these meetings . Each one of them is a step onwards in the great march humanity , you know . We do want the people after us to have a better time of it and so many don t see it . I wonder how it is that they don t see it ? "
64872	64891	64892	64892	she	194	" You mustn t wear yourself out , Sally , if you want to see the great day , "
64910	64924	64925	64925	she	194	" My dear child , what else is my old body good for ? "
64939	65039	64925	64925	she	194	" Shouldn t I be proud to give everything I have to the cause ? for I m not an intelligence like you . There were domestic circumstances I d like to tell you one of these days so I say foolish things . I lose my head , you know . You don t. Mr. Clacton doesn t. It s a great mistake , to lose one s head . But my heart s in the right place . And I m so glad Kit has a big dog , for I didn t think her looking well . "
65705	65722	65723	65723	Katharine	332	" We were passing and saw a light in your window , so we came up , "
65739	65748	65750	65750	William	175	" We have been to see some pictures , "
65752	65757	65758	65758	he	175	" Oh , dear , "
65765	65831	65758	65758	he	175	" this room reminds me of one of the worst hours in my existence when I read a paper , and you all sat round and jeered at me . Katharine was the worst . I could feel her gloating over every mistake I made . Miss Datchet was kind . Miss Datchet just made it possible for me to get through , I remember . "
65900	65912	65914	65914	Katharine	332	" We have been seeing old masters at the Grafton Gallery , "
65957	65966	65967	65967	William	175	" Would you believe it , Miss Datchet , "
65970	66024	65967	65967	William	175	" Katharine doesn t like Titian . She doesn t like apricots , she doesn t like peaches , she doesn t like green peas . She likes the Elgin marbles , and gray days without any sun . She s a typical example of the cold northern nature . I come from Devonshire "
66098	66103	66104	66104	she	332	" Perhaps , Mary , "
66108	66164	66104	66104	she	332	" you wouldn t mind giving us some tea ? We did try to get some , but the shop was so crowded , and in the next one there was a band playing ; and most of the pictures , at any rate , were very dull , whatever you may say , William . "
66186	66195	66196	66196	she	174	" What in the world are they after ? "
66255	66258	66259	66259	she	332	" William , "
66262	66278	66259	66259	she	332	" thinks that perhaps you don t know . We are going to be married . "
66313	66318	66319	66319	Katharine	332	" Let me see , "
66322	66354	66319	66319	Katharine	332	" one puts hot water into the cups first , doesn t one ? You have some dodge of your own , haven t you , William , about making tea ? "
66650	66656	66658	66658	Katharine	332	" Your tea , William , "
66734	66740	66723	66723	she	332	" Your tea , William , "
66828	66846	66847	66847	she	174	" I wonder how you find the time to know all about pictures as well as books ? "
66850	66858	66859	66859	William	175	" How do I find the time ? "
66872	66975	66976	66976	he	1799	" Why , I always travel with a notebook . And I ask my way to the picture gallery the very first thing in the morning . And then I meet men , and talk to them . There s a man in my office who knows all about the Flemish school . I was telling Miss Datchet about the Flemish school . I picked up a lot of it from him it s a way men have Gibbons , his name is . You must meet him . We ll ask him to lunch . And this not caring about art , "
66983	67026	67028	67028	he	1799	" it s one of Katharine s poses , Miss Datchet . Did you know she posed ? She pretends that she s never read Shakespeare . And why should she read Shakespeare , since she IS Shakespeare Rosalind , you know , "
67060	67063	67057	67057	he	1799	" the sex "
67065	67069	67070	67070	Constrained	1800	" the ladies . "
67084	67123	67070	67070	Constrained	1800	" She knows enough enough for all decent purposes . What do you women want with learning , when you have so much else everything , I should say everything . Leave us something , eh , Katharine ? "
67124	67129	67131	67131	Katharine	332	" Leave you something ? "
67140	67148	67131	67131	Katharine	332	" I was thinking we must be going "
67149	67170	67172	67172	Rodney	175	" Is it to - night that Lady Ferrilby dines with us ? No , we mustn t be late , "
67176	67191	67192	67192	he	175	" D you know the Ferrilbys , Miss Datchet ? They own Trantem Abbey , "
67204	67226	67192	67192	he	175	" And if Katharine makes herself very charming to - night , perhaps ll lend it to us for the honeymoon . "
67227	67243	67245	67245	Katharine	332	" I agree that may be a reason . Otherwise she s a dull woman , "
67247	67251	67252	67252	she	332	" At least , "
67262	67272	67252	67252	she	332	" I find it difficult to talk to her . "
67273	67296	67297	67297	he	175	" Because you expect every one else to take all the trouble . I ve seen her sit silent a whole evening , "
67311	67334	67336	67336	he	175	" Don t you find that , too ? Sometimes when we re alone , I ve counted the time on my watch "
67348	67382	67336	67336	he	175	" the time between one remark and the next . And once I counted ten minutes and twenty seconds , and then , if you ll believe me , she only said Um ! "
67383	67391	67392	67392	Katharine	332	" I m sure I m sorry , "
67395	67412	67392	67392	Katharine	332	" I know it s a bad habit , but then , you see , at home "
67496	67508	67509	67509	She	332	" I think being engaged is very bad for the character . "
69056	69062	69064	69064	Elizabeth	282	" But that s absurd , "
69075	69112	69064	69064	Elizabeth	282	" There are five spare rooms , even when the boys are here . Besides , he wouldn t get a room in the village . And he oughtn t to work if he s overworked . "
69113	69127	69128	69128	Mary	174	" But perhaps he doesn t want to see so much of us , "
69177	69190	69191	69191	Mary	174	" If Ralph were here , he d find this very dull , "
69300	69309	69310	69310	she	174	" A flower for your buttonhole , father , "
69317	69322	69324	69325	Mr. Datchet	1874	" Eh , dear ? "
69349	69387	69324	69325	Mr. Datchet	1874	" Where does this fellow come from ? One of Elizabeth s roses I hope you asked her leave . Elizabeth doesn t like having her roses picked without her leave , and quite right , too . "
69441	69444	69446	69446	Mary	174	" What ? "
69520	69530	69509	69509	She	174	" The garden s looking very nice , father . "
69531	69538	69540	69541	Mr. Datchet	1876	" Yes , yes , yes , "
69580	69642	69576	69576	he	1876	" The traffic s very much increased , you know . More rolling - stock needed already . Forty trucks went down yesterday by the 12.15 counted them myself . They ve taken off the 9.3 , and given us an 8.30 instead suits the business men , you know . You came by the old 3.10 yesterday , I suppose ? "
69645	69648	69650	69650	he	1876	" Yes , "
70262	70270	70271	70271	he	153	" Stogdon House , Lampsher , Lincoln , "
70275	70286	70288	70289	the man	4647	" You ll find somebody to direct you at Lincoln , "
70306	70316	70317	70317	he	153	" I ve got to walk over from Disham , "
71191	71196	71197	71197	she	174	" Well , Ralph , "
71200	71251	71197	71197	she	174	" this is better than Lincoln s Inn Fields , isn t it ? Look , there s a bird for you ! Oh , you ve brought glasses , have you ? Edward and Christopher mean to make you shoot . Can you shoot ? I shouldn t think so "
71252	71260	71262	71262	Ralph	153	" Look here , you must explain , "
71264	71276	71262	71262	Ralph	153	" Who are these young men ? Where am I staying ? "
71277	71287	71288	71288	she	174	" You are staying with us , of course , "
71292	71310	71288	71288	she	174	" Of course , you re staying with us you don t mind coming , do you ? "
71311	71322	71323	71323	he	153	" If I had , I shouldn t have come , "
71383	71399	71400	71400	he	153	" This is the sort of country I thought you d live in , Mary , "
71416	71425	71400	71400	he	153	" Real country . No gentlemen s seats . "
71449	71461	71463	71463	Mary	174	" Now we have to find our way through a hedge , "
71488	71498	71500	71500	Mary	174	" It s quite right that they should poach , "
71509	71543	71544	71544	she	174	" I wonder whether it was Alfred Duggins or Sid Rankin ? How can one expect them not to , when they only make fifteen shillings a week ? Fifteen shillings a week , "
71577	71588	71544	71544	she	174	" I could live on fifteen shillings a week easily . "
71589	71593	71595	71595	Ralph	153	" Could you ? "
71597	71605	71606	71606	he	153	" I don t believe you could , "
71609	71636	71638	71638	Mary	174	" Oh yes . They have a cottage thrown in , and a garden where one can grow vegetables . It wouldn t be half bad , "
71649	71658	71659	71659	he	153	" But you d get tired of it , "
71662	71678	71679	71679	she	174	" I sometimes think it s the only thing one would never get tired of , "
71713	71749	71659	71659	he	153	" But wouldn t it be on the main road , or next door to a woman with six squalling children , who d always be hanging her washing out to dry across your garden ? "
71750	71765	71831	71831	he	153	" The cottage I m thinking of stands by itself in a little orchard . "
71766	71773	71774	71774	he	153	" And what about the Suffrage ? "
71780	71794	71795	71795	she	174	" Oh , there are other things in the world besides the Suffrage , "
71896	71906	71907	71907	he	153	" D you know the points of the compass ? "
71910	71916	71918	71918	Mary	174	" Well , of course , "
71920	71933	71934	71934	She	174	" What d you take me for ? a Cockney like you ? "
71949	71958	71959	71959	she	174	" It s my native land , this , "
71962	71972	71959	71959	she	174	" I could smell my way about it blindfold . "
72125	72141	72142	72142	she	174	" That s Christopher , come in already , and gone to feed his chickens , "
72476	72486	72488	72491	the Reverend Wyndham Datchet	291	" You came by the 3.10 , Mr. Denham ? "
72516	72571	72488	72491	the Reverend Wyndham Datchet	291	" They treat us very well , on the whole . Considering the increase of traffic , they treat us very well indeed . I have the curiosity sometimes to count the trucks on the goods trains , and they re well over fifty well over fifty , at this season of the year . "
72761	72769	72770	72770	Elizabeth	282	" It s not the kitchen really , "
72778	72784	72770	72770	Elizabeth	282	" but we call it so "
72785	72795	72797	72797	Edward	284	" It s the nicest room in the house , "
72799	72820	72822	72822	Elizabeth	282	" It s got the old rests by the side of the fireplace , where the men hung their guns , "
72841	72894	72895	72895	She	282	" Show Mr. Denham the steps , Christopher .... When the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were here two years ago they said this was the most interesting part of the house . These narrow bricks prove that it is five hundred years old five hundred years , I think they may have said six . "
73136	73148	73150	73150	Christopher	199	" Will you come out shooting with us to - morrow ? "
73169	73182	73184	73184	Ralph	153	" I won t shoot , but I ll come with you , "
73186	73194	73196	73196	Edward	284	" Don t you care about shooting ? "
73207	73216	73218	73218	Ralph	153	" I ve never shot in my life , "
73240	73253	73255	73255	Christopher	199	" You wouldn t have much chance in London , I suppose , "
73257	73270	73255	73255	Christopher	199	" But won t you find it rather dull just watching us ? "
73271	73277	73278	73278	Ralph	153	" I shall watch birds , "
73285	73296	73298	73298	Edward	284	" I can show you the place for watching birds , "
73300	73360	73298	73298	Edward	284	" if that s what you like doing . I know a fellow who comes down from London about this time every year to watch them . It s a great place for the wild geese and the ducks . I ve heard this man say that it s one of the best places for birds in the country . "
73361	73371	73372	73372	Ralph	153	" It s about the best place in England , "
73572	73586	73588	73588	Christopher	199	" Piper ! oh , damn ! I shall have to get up , "
73590	73600	73601	73601	Edward	284	" It s not Piper , it s Pitch , "
73604	73616	73617	73617	Christopher	199	" All the same , I shall have to get up , "
73654	73663	73664	73664	Mary	174	" Do come in and shut the door ! "
73673	73684	73686	73686	Christopher	199	" We shall have a fine day to - morrow , "
73781	73793	73794	73794	Ralph	153	" I should like Mary to stroke my head like that , "
74684	74827	74669	74669	she	332	" To begin with , I m very fond of William . You can t deny that . I know him better than any one , almost . But why I m marrying him is , partly , I admit I m being quite honest with you , and you mustn t tell any one partly because I want to get married . I want to have a house of my own . It isn t possible at home . It s all very well for you , Henry ; you can go your own way . I have to be there always . Besides , you know what our house is . You wouldn t be happy either , if you didn t do something . It isn t that I haven t the time at home it s the atmosphere . "
74856	74867	74848	74848	his	2021	" Well , but what do you want to do ? "
74888	74893	74894	74894	she	332	" I should like , "
74916	74926	74904	74904	she	332	" to study mathematics to know about the stars . "
74973	75095	74962	74962	Katharine	332	" I don t care much whether I ever get to know anything but I want to work out something in figures something that hasn t got to do with human beings . I don t want people particularly . In some ways , Henry , I m a humbug I mean , I m not what you all take me for . I m not domestic , or very practical or sensible , really . And if I could calculate things , and use a telescope , and have to work out figures , and know to a fraction where I was wrong , I should be perfectly happy , and I believe I should give William all he wants . "
76188	76197	76198	76198	he	375	" You have fled , too , then ? "
76219	76222	76223	76223	she	2023	" Fled ? "
76226	76254	76223	76223	she	2023	" From whom d you mean ? Oh , the family party . Yes , it was hot down there , so I went into the garden . "
76255	76263	76264	76264	Henry	301	" And aren t you very cold ? "
76316	76322	76323	76323	she	2023	" Thank you , Henry , "
76326	76333	76323	76323	she	2023	" I m not disturbing you ? "
76334	76345	76346	76346	he	301	" I m not here . I m at Bungay , "
76349	76392	76346	76346	he	301	" I m giving a music lesson to Harold and Julia . That was why I had to leave the table with the ladies I m spending the night there , and I shan t be back till late on Christmas Eve . "
76393	76397	76398	76398	Katharine	332	" How I wish "
76405	76415	76416	76416	she	2023	" I think these parties are a great mistake , "
76423	76428	76429	76429	he	301	" Oh , horrible ! "
76662	76673	76675	76675	Henry	188	" Well , what s the date of the wedding ? "
76683	76691	76692	76692	she	332	" I think some time in March , "
76695	76699	76700	76700	he	188	" And afterwards ? "
76703	76716	76742	76742	her	332	" We take a house , I suppose , somewhere in Chelsea . "
76717	76723	76724	76724	he	188	" It s very interesting , "
76787	76796	76784	76784	Henry	188	" Perhaps marriage will make you more human . "
76823	76845	76846	76846	she	332	" When you consider things like the stars , our affairs don t seem to matter very much , do they ? "
76850	76864	76865	76865	Henry	188	" I don t think I ever do consider things like the stars , "
76868	76882	76883	76883	he	188	" I m not sure that that s not the explanation , though , "
76891	76900	76901	76901	she	332	" I doubt whether there is an explanation , "
76913	76921	76922	76922	he	188	" What ? No explanation of anything ? "
76929	76940	76941	76941	she	332	" Oh , things happen . That s about all , "
76951	76962	76963	76963	Henry	188	" That certainly seems to explain some of your actions , "
76968	76986	76987	76987	he	188	" One thing s about as good as another , and one s got to do something , "
77024	77039	77017	77017	she	332	" Well , if you believe that your life must be simple , Henry . "
77040	77048	77049	77049	he	188	" But I don t believe it , "
77053	77059	77060	77060	she	332	" No more do I , "
77063	77069	77070	77070	he	188	" What about the stars ? "
77076	77088	77070	77070	he	188	" I understand that you rule your life by the stars ? "
77123	77145	77146	77146	she	332	" But do you always understand why you do everything ? Ought one to understand ? People like my mother understand , "
77149	77167	77146	77146	she	332	" Now I must go down to them , I suppose , and see what s happening . "
77168	77174	77175	77175	Henry	188	" What could be happening ? "
77178	77188	77189	77189	she	332	" Oh , they may want to settle something , "
77220	77227	77228	77228	she	332	" And then there s William , "
77246	77258	77259	77259	she	332	" Do they know what coals are made of , Henry ? "
77266	77273	77274	77274	he	188	" Mares tails , I believe , "
77277	77288	77289	77289	she	332	" Have you ever been down a coal - mine ? "
77293	77306	77307	77307	he	188	" Don t let s talk about coal - mines , Katharine , "
77310	77324	77307	77307	he	188	" We shall probably never see each other again . When you re married "
77339	77347	77348	77348	she	332	" Why do you all tease me ? "
77351	77357	77348	77348	she	332	" It isn t kind . "
77411	77419	77420	77420	she	332	" Things aren t easy , anyhow , "
77433	77452	77495	77495	her	332	" Promise me , Katharine , that if I can ever help you , you will let me . "
77476	77483	77484	77484	she	332	" Yes , I promise that , "
77565	77572	77573	77573	Rodney	175	" Well , here you are ! "
77603	77614	77615	77615	he	175	" That s where you ve been all the time , "
77622	77632	77633	77633	she	332	" I ve only been here about ten minutes , "
77636	77652	77679	77680	another man	2071	" My dear Katharine , you left the drawing - room over an hour ago . "
77657	77664	77665	77665	Henry	188	" Does it very much matter ? "
77688	77695	77696	77696	he	175	" They don t like it , "
77699	77730	77696	77696	he	175	" It isn t kind to old people to leave them alone although I ve no doubt it s much more amusing to sit up here and talk to Henry . "
77731	77739	77741	77742	Henry urbanely	188	" We were discussing coal - mines , "
77744	77759	77761	77761	Katharine	332	" Yes . But we were talking about much more interesting things before that , "
77792	77799	77801	77801	Rodney	175	" I can quite understand that , "
77841	77849	77850	77850	Katharine	332	" Was it very dull , William ? "
77868	77875	77876	77876	William	175	" Of course it was dull , "
77880	77896	77897	77897	she	332	" Well , you stay and talk to Henry , and I ll go down , "
77957	77965	77967	77967	William	175	" I shall come down with you , "
77984	77988	77989	77989	she	332	" Oh no , "
77993	78002	77989	77989	she	332	" You stay here and talk to Henry . "
78003	78008	78010	78010	Henry	188	" Yes , do , "
78049	78059	78046	78046	he	175	" No . I want to come with you . "
78082	78103	78079	78079	her	332	" It s useless for you to come . I shall go to bed in ten minutes . Good night . "
78214	78222	78198	78198	he	175	" The situation is becoming most uncomfortable . "
78442	78453	78454	78454	he	175	" You ve several big estates round here , Otway , "
78457	78478	78454	78454	he	175	" Any good hunting ? Let me see , what pack would it be ? Who s your great man ? "
78479	78503	78454	78454	he	175	" Sir William Budge , the sugar king , has the biggest estate . He bought out poor Stanham , who went bankrupt . "
78504	78515	78454	78454	he	175	" Which Stanham would that be ? Verney or Alfred ? "
78516	78546	78547	78547	he	2079	" Alfred .... I don t hunt myself . You re a great huntsman , aren t you ? You have a great reputation as a horseman , anyhow , "
78562	78569	78570	78570	Rodney	175	" Oh , I love riding , "
78573	78610	78570	78570	Rodney	175	" Could I get a horse down here ? Stupid of me ! I forgot to bring any clothes . I can t imagine , though , who told you I was anything of a rider ? "
78697	78706	78707	78707	Rodney	175	" I don t care much for shooting , "
78710	78773	78707	78707	Rodney	175	" but one has to do it , unless one wants to be altogether out of things . I dare say there s some very pretty country round here . I stayed once at Bolham Hall . Young Cranthorpe was up with you , wasn t he ? He married old Lord Bolham s daughter . Very nice people in their way . "
78774	78783	78784	78784	Henry	301	" I don t mix in that society , "
78844	78851	78852	78852	he	175	" Oh , but you should , "
78856	78882	78852	78852	he	175	" It s well worth staying there , anyhow , once a year . They make one very comfortable , and the women are ravishing . "
78883	78887	78891	78891	himself	301	" The women ? "
78896	78905	78888	78888	Henry	301	" What could any woman see in you ? "
78987	79000	79001	79001	he	301	" I don t think I should get on in that society , "
79004	79023	79001	79001	he	301	" I don t think I should know what to say to Lady Rose if I met her . "
79024	79032	79033	79033	Rodney	175	" I don t find any difficulty , "
79036	79102	79033	79033	Rodney	175	" You talk to them about their children , if they have any , or their accomplishments painting , gardening , poetry they re so delightfully sympathetic . Seriously , you know I think a woman s opinion of one s poetry is always worth having . Don t ask them for their reasons . Just ask them for their feelings . Katharine , for example "
79103	79106	79108	79108	Henry	301	" Katharine , "
79128	79136	79108	79108	Henry	301	" Katharine is very unlike most women . "
79137	79140	79141	79141	Rodney	175	" Quite , "
79144	79147	79148	79148	He	175	" She is "
79163	79170	79171	79171	he	175	" She s looking very well , "
79197	79212	79153	79153	her	2089	" But , as a family , you re given to moods , eh ? "
79213	79217	79219	79219	Henry	301	" Not Katharine , "
79224	79228	79229	79229	Rodney	175	" Not Katharine , "
79242	79259	79260	79260	he	175	" No , perhaps you re right . But her engagement has changed her . Naturally , "
79263	79272	79260	79260	he	175	" one would expect that to be so . "
79287	79299	79300	79300	he	175	" Katharine has had a difficult life , in some ways , "
79303	79319	79300	79300	he	175	" I expect that marriage will be good for her . She has great powers . "
79320	79323	79325	79325	Henry	301	" Great , "
79330	79342	79300	79300	he	175	" Yes but now what direction d you think they take ? "
79369	79375	79376	79376	Henry	301	" I don t know , "
79380	79407	79350	79354	a man of the world	2090	" D you think children a household that sort of thing d you think that ll satisfy her ? Mind , I m out all day . "
79408	79416	79417	79417	Henry	301	" She would certainly be very competent , "
79420	79428	79430	79430	Rodney	175	" Oh , she s wonderfully competent , "
79432	79466	79430	79430	Rodney	175	" But I get absorbed in my poetry . Well , Katharine hasn t got that . She admires my poetry , you know , but that wouldn t be enough for her ? "
79467	79470	79472	79472	Henry	301	" No , "
79477	79484	79485	79485	he	301	" I think you re right , "
79497	79516	79485	79485	he	301	" Katharine hasn t found herself yet . Life isn t altogether real to her yet I sometimes think "
79517	79520	79521	79521	Rodney	175	" Yes ? "
79534	79539	79540	79540	he	175	" That is what I "
80776	80798	80799	80799	she	332	" I wish you could help her to take an interest in something that other people are interested in , Katharine , "
80809	80848	80799	80799	she	332	" It s all Henry s doing , you know , giving up her parties and taking to these nasty insects . It doesn t follow that if a man can do a thing a woman may too . "
81029	81036	81038	81039	Lady Otway	286	" It s so very pleasant , "
81041	81062	81038	81039	Lady Otway	286	" to knit while one s talking . And now , my dear Katharine , tell me about your plans . "
81189	81202	81203	81203	she	286	" What a perfect daughter , or daughter - in - law ! "
81225	81228	81229	81229	she	286	" Yes , "
81250	81269	81229	81229	she	286	" Katharine is like the girls of my youth . We took the serious things of life seriously . "
81335	81348	81349	81349	she	128	" I never _ shall _ know my way about this house ! "
81352	81379	81349	81349	she	128	" I m on my way to the library , and I don t want to interrupt . You and Katharine were having a little chat ? "
81429	81441	81442	81442	she	286	" I was telling Katharine a few little commonplaces about marriage , "
81450	81462	81442	81442	she	286	" Are none of my children looking after you , Maggie ? "
81463	81466	81468	81469	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Marriage , "
81484	81513	81514	81514	she	128	" I always say marriage is a school . And you don t get the prizes unless you go to school . Charlotte has won all the prizes , "
81549	81568	81570	81570	Katharine	332	" Aunt Charlotte was saying that it s no good being married unless you submit to your husband , "
81615	81637	81638	81638	she	286	" Well , I really don t advise a woman who wants to have things her own way to get married , "
81685	81692	81693	81693	she	128	" What a shame it was ! "
81710	81773	81774	81774	she	128	" But , Charlotte , it would have been much worse if Frank had disgraced himself in any way . And it isn t what our husbands GET , but what they _ are _ . I used to dream of white horses and palanquins , too ; but still , I like the ink - pots best . And who knows ? "
81781	81793	81774	81774	she	128	" your father may be made a baronet to - morrow . "
81817	81822	81812	81813	the Hilberys	148	" that old Turk , "
81843	81854	81855	81855	she	128	" But if you can give way to your husband , "
81872	81884	81855	81855	she	128	" a happy marriage is the happiest thing in the world . "
81885	81888	81890	81890	Katharine	332	" Yes , "
81892	81894	81890	81890	Katharine	332	" but "
82172	82180	82181	82181	she	128	" We ve all had perfect husbands , "
82195	82219	82220	82220	she	128	" Not that I think a bad temper is really a fault in a man . I don t mean a bad temper , "
82235	82264	82267	82267	she	128	" I should say a quick , impatient temper . Most , in fact _ all _ great men have had bad tempers except your grandfather , Katharine , "
82285	82303	82305	82305	Katharine	332	" But in the ordinary marriage , is it necessary to give way to one s husband ? "
82337	82345	82347	82348	Lady Otway	286	" I should say yes , certainly , "
82358	82375	82376	82376	Katharine	332	" Then one ought to make up one s mind to that before one is married , "
82421	82431	82432	82432	she	128	" Do look at that lovely little blue bird ! "
82482	82496	82497	82498	Lady Otway	286	" Most women know by instinct whether they can give it or not , "
82529	82544	82511	82511	she	286	" And if not well then , my advice would be don t marry . "
82545	82558	82560	82561	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Oh , but marriage is the happiest life for a woman , "
82590	82600	82601	82601	she	128	" It s the most _ interesting _ life , "
82947	82958	82960	82961	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Why don t we all live in the country ? "
82971	83059	82960	82961	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" I m sure one would think such beautiful things if one lived in the country . No horrid slum houses to depress one , no trams or motor - cars ; and the people all looking so plump and cheerful . Isn t there some little cottage near you , Charlotte , which would do for us , with a spare room , perhaps , in case we asked a friend down ? And we should save so much money that we should be able to travel "
83060	83078	83080	83081	Lady Otway	286	" Yes . You would find it very nice for a week or two , no doubt , "
83083	83095	83096	83096	she	286	" But what hour would you like the carriage this morning ? "
83103	83108	83110	83111	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Katharine shall decide , "
83123	83227	83110	83111	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" And I was just going to tell you , Katharine , how , when I woke this morning , everything seemed so clear in my head that if I d had a pencil I believe I could have written quite a long chapter . When we re out on our drive I shall find us a house . A few trees round it , and a little garden , a pond with a Chinese duck , a study for your father , a study for me , and a sitting room for Katharine , because then she ll be a married lady . "
83286	83299	83300	83300	she	332	" Let me look at your engagement - ring , Aunt Charlotte , "
83331	83348	83349	83350	Lady Otway	286	" That poor old ring was a sad disappointment to me when I first had it , "
83353	83380	83349	83350	Lady Otway	286	" I d set my heart on a diamond ring , but I never liked to tell Frank , naturally . He bought it at Simla . "
83785	83794	83796	83797	Lady Otway	286	" Why didn t Andrews tell me himself ? "
83899	83901	83889	83889	himself	300	" Times "
84305	84308	84302	84302	she	332	" Hum ! "
84834	84865	84823	84823	she	174	" I love you ; I shall never love anybody else . Marry me or leave me ; think what you like of me I don t care a straw . "
84927	84932	84924	84924	she	174	" I love you , "
84938	84946	84935	84935	she	174	" I love the beech - trees , "
84949	84955	84935	84935	she	174	" I love I love . "
84956	84963	84964	84964	Ralph	153	" Do you know , Mary , "
84969	84977	84964	84964	Ralph	153	" I ve made up my mind . "
85021	85067	85068	85068	He	153	" I ve made up my mind to chuck my work and live down here . I want you to tell me about that cottage you spoke of . However , I suppose there ll be no difficulty about getting a cottage , will there ? "
85110	85120	85121	85121	he	153	" I can t stand the office any longer , "
85124	85149	85121	85121	he	153	" I don t know what my family will say ; but I m sure I m right . Don t you think so ? "
85150	85157	85158	85158	she	174	" Live down here by yourself ? "
85161	85173	85174	85174	he	153	" Some old woman would do for me , I suppose , "
85177	85186	85187	85187	he	153	" I m sick of the whole thing , "
85211	85272	85187	85187	he	153	" I tell you , Mary , it s utter destruction , working away , day after day , at stuff that doesn t matter a damn to any one . I ve stood eight years of it , and I m not going to stand it any longer . I suppose this all seems to you mad , though ? "
85284	85294	85295	85295	she	174	" No . I thought you weren t happy , "
85298	85305	85306	85306	he	153	" Why did you think that ? "
85313	85326	85327	85327	she	174	" Don t you remember that morning in Lincoln s Inn Fields ? "
85330	85333	85335	85335	Ralph	153	" Yes , "
85375	85382	85383	85383	he	153	" You re right , Mary , "
85392	85403	85383	85383	he	153	" though I don t know how you guessed it . "
85428	85435	85436	85436	he	153	" I was unhappy very unhappy , "
85608	85616	85617	85617	he	153	" Unhappiness is a state of mind , "
85620	85637	85617	85617	he	153	" by which I mean that it is not necessarily the result of any particular cause . "
85672	85681	85682	85682	he	153	" I began to find my life unsatisfactory , "
85686	85693	85682	85682	he	153	" It seemed to me meaningless . "
85720	85850	85682	85682	he	153	" All this money - making and working ten hours a day in an office , what s it FOR ? When one s a boy , you see , one s head is so full of dreams that it doesn t seem to matter what one does . And if you re ambitious , you re all right ; you ve got a reason for going on . Now my reasons ceased to satisfy me . Perhaps I never had any . That s very likely now I come to think of it . ( What reason is there for anything , though ? ) Still , it s impossible , after a certain age , to take oneself in satisfactorily . And I know what carried me on "
85859	85949	86010	86010	she	174	" I wanted to be the savior of my family and all that kind of thing . I wanted them to get on in the world . That was a lie , of course a kind of self - glorification , too . Like most people , I suppose , I ve lived almost entirely among delusions , and now I m at the awkward stage of finding it out . I want another delusion to go on with . That s what my unhappiness amounts to , Mary . "
85995	86009	86010	86010	she	174	" I don t think it will be difficult to find a cottage , "
86024	86038	86039	86039	she	174	" You ve got a little money , haven t you ? Yes , "
86042	86057	86039	86039	she	174	" I don t see why it shouldn t be a very good plan . "
86184	86225	86226	86226	she	174	" Yes , Ralph , it s time you made a break . I ve come to the same conclusion myself . Only it won t be a country cottage in my case ; it ll be America . America ! "
86229	86261	86226	86226	she	174	" That s the place for me ! They ll teach me something about organizing a movement there , and I ll come back and show you how to do it . "
86369	86377	86378	86378	he	153	" Don t go away , Mary ! "
86384	86394	86395	86395	she	174	" That s what you said before , Ralph , "
86403	86429	86395	86395	she	174	" You want to go away yourself and you don t want me to go away . That s not very sensible , is it ? "
86430	86433	86434	86434	he	153	" Mary , "
86450	86460	86434	86434	he	153	" what a brute I ve been to you ! "
86778	86783	86784	86784	he	153	" Katharine , Katharine , "
86840	86845	86846	86846	he	153	" Katharine , Katharine , "
87015	87027	87006	87006	he	153	" Now , Mary , what s all this about America ? "
87271	87280	87281	87281	she	174	" You must see that there s water , "
87331	87337	87338	87338	he	153	" One of the rooms , "
87341	87362	87338	87338	he	153	" must be my study , for , you see , Mary , I m going to write a book . "
87397	87407	87408	87408	she	174	" And what s your book to be about ? "
88230	88235	88237	88237	her	174	" Well , Mary ? "
88264	88269	88256	88256	he	153	" Well , Mary ? "
88576	88581	88563	88563	he	153	" Well , Mary ? "
88699	88714	88686	88686	she	174	" There , there . Don t cry ! Tell me why you re crying "
88755	88762	88763	88763	he	153	" How damnable this all is ! "
88767	88774	88775	88775	she	174	" What are you talking about ? "
88815	88818	88819	88819	he	153	" Mary , "
88822	88845	88819	88819	he	153	" I want to talk to you . Haven t we nearly done ? Why don t they take away these plates ? "
88872	88881	88882	88882	she	174	" They ll come all in good time , "
88911	88917	88918	88918	Ralph	153	" I want to apologize , "
88954	89018	88918	88918	Ralph	153	" I think I ve treated you very badly . That is , I ve told you lies . Did you guess that I was lying to you ? Once in Lincoln s Inn Fields and again to - day on our walk . I am a liar , Mary . Did you know that ? Do you think you do know me ? "
89019	89025	89026	89026	she	2373	" I think I do , "
89038	89052	89053	89053	he	2374	" It s true I don t want you to go to America , "
89064	89080	89081	89081	he	2374	" In fact , my feelings towards you seem to be utterly and damnably bad , "
89093	89153	89159	89159	his	2374	" If I weren t a selfish beast I should tell you to have nothing more to do with me . And yet , Mary , in spite of the fact that I believe what I m saying , I also believe that it s good we should know each other the world being what it is , you see "
89170	89207	89161	89161	he	2374	" for , of course , in an ideal state of things , in a decent community even , there s no doubt you shouldn t have anything to do with me seriously , that is . "
89208	89221	89223	89223	Mary	174	" You forget that I m not an ideal character , either , "
89279	89321	89323	89323	she	174	" I m much more selfish than I let on , and I m worldly a little more than you think , anyhow . I like bossing things perhaps that s my greatest fault . I ve none of your passion for "
89340	89345	89346	89346	she	174	" for the truth , "
89359	89369	89370	89370	Ralph	153	" I ve told you I m a liar , "
89374	89385	89386	89386	she	174	" Oh , in little things , I dare say , "
89390	89422	89423	89423	she	174	" But not in real ones , and that s what matters . I dare say I m more truthful than you are in small ways . But I could never care "
89442	89473	89474	89474	Her	174	" for any one who was a liar in that way . I love the truth a certain amount a considerable amount but not in the way you love it . "
89493	89497	89498	89498	Ralph	153	" Good heavens ! "
89503	89530	89498	89498	Ralph	153	" She loves me ! Why did I never see it before ? She s going to cry ; no , but she can t speak . "
90062	90068	90042	90042	He	153	" That was Katharine Hilbery . "
90069	90078	90079	90079	she	174	" Katharine Hilbery ? What do you mean ? "
90095	90099	90100	90100	he	153	" Katharine Hilbery , "
90103	90110	90100	90100	he	153	" But she s gone now . "
90111	90115	90116	90116	Mary	174	" Katharine Hilbery ! "
90126	90136	90137	90137	She	174	" I ve always known it was Katharine Hilbery ! "
90582	90630	90671	90673	the attentive shopman	2399	" I m not mistaken ? Surely Mr. Denham ? I caught a glimpse of your coat through the window , and I felt sure that I knew your coat . Have you seen Katharine or William ? I m wandering about Lincoln looking for the ruins . "
90651	90662	90663	90663	she	128	" First of all , tell me where I am , "
90680	90765	90675	90675	she	128	" The ruins my party is waiting for me at the ruins . The Roman ruins or Greek , Mr. Denham ? Your town has a great many beautiful things in it , but I wish it hadn t so many ruins . I never saw such delightful little pots of honey in my life are they made by your own bees ? Please give me one of those little pots , and tell me how I shall find my way to the ruins . "
90766	90770	90771	90771	she	128	" And now , "
90855	90858	90859	90859	she	128	" Now , "
90862	90886	90887	90887	she	128	" please tell me what you re doing here , Mr. Denham for you _ are _ Mr. Denham , aren t you ? "
90902	90966	90887	90887	she	128	" The brilliant young man who writes for the Review , I mean ? Only yesterday my husband was telling me he thought you one of the cleverest young men he knew . Certainly , you ve been the messenger of Providence to me , for unless I d seen you I m sure I should never have found the ruins at all . "
91011	91021	91022	91022	she	128	" I ve found something much better than ruins ! "
91025	91067	91022	91022	she	128	" I ve found two friends who told me how to find you , which I could never have done without them . They must come and have tea with us . What a pity that we ve just had luncheon . "
91188	91216	91217	91217	she	332	" I never knew you lived here . Why didn t you say so , and we could have met ? And are you staying with Mary ? "
91224	91234	91217	91217	she	332	" What a pity we didn t meet before . "
91504	91509	91511	91511	Katharine	332	" Do you know , "
91523	91557	91511	91511	Katharine	332	" I thought I saw you this morning , standing at a window . But I decided that it couldn t be you . And it must have been you all the same . "
91558	91572	91573	91573	he	153	" Yes , I thought I saw you but it wasn t you , "
91654	91661	91662	91662	she	332	" I expect it was me , "
91665	91763	91662	91662	she	332	" I was looking for my mother . It happens every time we come to Lincoln . In fact , there never was a family so unable to take care of itself as ours is . Not that it very much matters , because some one always turns up in the nick of time to help us out of our scrapes . Once I was left in a field with a bull when I was a baby but where did we leave the carriage ? Down that street or the next ? The next , I think . "
91789	91797	91798	91798	she	332	" But what are you doing here ? "
91801	91835	91770	91771	the others	4750	" I m buying a cottage . I m going to live here as soon as I can find a cottage , and Mary tells me there ll be no difficulty about that . "
91836	91839	91840	91840	she	332	" But , "
91850	91860	91840	91840	she	332	" you will give up the Bar , then ? "
91875	91889	91840	91840	she	332	" The solicitor s office ? Yes . I m giving that up . "
91890	91894	91895	91895	she	332	" But why ? "
91917	91935	91898	91898	She	332	" I think you re very wise to give it up . You will be much happier . "
91999	92010	92011	92011	he	2428	" I don t know what one means by happiness , "
92029	92078	92011	92011	he	2428	" Why do you think I shall be happy ? I don t expect to be anything of the kind . I expect to be rather less unhappy . I shall write a book and curse my charwoman if happiness consists in that . What do you think ? "
92118	92147	92107	92107	Rodney	175	" Henry is going to drive home with your mother , and I suggest that they should put us down half - way and let us walk back . "
92163	92180	92181	92181	he	175	" Unfortunately we go in opposite directions , or we might have given you a lift , "
92240	92260	92225	92225	She	332	" I want to see you . Are you going back to London at once ? I will write . "
92797	92807	92808	92808	he	175	" There s no need for us to race , "
92852	92860	92831	92831	he	175	" I ve not enjoyed my holiday . "
92861	92864	92831	92831	he	175	" No ? "
92865	92879	92831	92831	he	175	" No . I shall be glad to get back to work again . "
92880	92893	92894	92894	she	332	" Saturday , Sunday , Monday there are only three days more , "
92897	92910	92911	92911	he	175	" No one enjoys being made a fool of before other people , "
92940	92949	92950	92950	she	332	" That refers to me , I suppose , "
92954	92972	92973	92973	he	175	" Every day since we ve been here you ve done something to make me appear ridiculous , "
92977	93097	92973	92973	he	175	" Of course , so long as it amuses you , you re welcome ; but we have to remember that we are going to spend our lives together . I asked you , only this morning , for example , to come out and take a turn with me in the garden . I was waiting for you ten minutes , and you never came . Every one saw me waiting . The stable - boys saw me . I was so ashamed that I went in . Then , on the drive you hardly spoke to me . Henry noticed it . Every one notices it .... You find no difficulty in talking to Henry , though . "
93132	93143	93144	93144	she	2462	" None of these things seem to me to matter , "
93147	93161	93162	93162	he	2463	" Very well , then . I may as well hold my tongue , "
93165	93187	93188	93188	she	2462	" In themselves they don t seem to me to matter ; if they hurt you , of course they matter , "
93210	93220	93221	93221	he	2463	" And we might be so happy , Katharine ! "
93237	93253	93254	93254	she	2462	" As long as you let yourself feel like this we shall never be happy , "
93402	93410	93411	93411	he	2463	" What do I feel about Katharine ? "
93536	93563	93564	93564	he	2463	" If she were callous all the time and had only led me on to laugh at me I couldn t have felt that about her , "
93567	93605	93606	93606	he	2463	" I m not a fool , after all . I can t have been utterly mistaken all these years . And yet , when she speaks to me like that ! The truth of it is , "
93609	93662	93606	93606	he	2463	" that I ve got such despicable faults that no one could help speaking to me like that . Katharine is quite right . And yet those are not my serious feelings , as she knows quite well . How can I change myself ? What would make her care for me ? "
93925	93947	93922	93922	his	2463	" If you have no feeling for me , wouldn t it be kinder to say so to me in private ? "
93948	93953	93954	93954	she	332	" Oh , William , "
93969	94001	93954	93954	she	332	" how you go on about feelings ! Isn t it better not to talk so much , not to be worrying always about small things that don t really matter ? "
94002	94009	94010	94010	he	2463	" That s the question precisely , "
94013	94062	94010	94010	he	2463	" I only want you to tell me that they don t matter . There are times when you seem indifferent to everything . I m vain , I ve a thousand faults ; but you know they re not everything ; you know I care for you . "
94063	94080	93954	93954	she	332	" And if I say that I care for you , don t you believe me ? "
94081	94104	94010	94010	he	2463	" Say it , Katharine ! Say it as if you meant it ! Make me feel that you care for me ! "
94459	94482	94447	94447	she	2475	" I was wrong to get engaged to you . I shall never make you happy . I have never loved you . "
94483	94486	94487	94487	he	2478	" Katharine ! "
94490	94495	94496	94496	she	2475	" No , never , "
94500	94518	94496	94496	she	2475	" Not rightly . Don t you see , I didn t know what I was doing ? "
94519	94526	94527	94527	he	2478	" You love some one else ? "
94532	94537	94496	94496	she	2475	" Absolutely no one . "
94538	94541	94542	94542	he	2478	" Henry ? "
94545	94557	94496	94496	she	2475	" Henry ? I should have thought , William , even you "
94558	94564	94565	94565	he	2478	" There is some one , "
94568	94591	94565	94565	he	2478	" There has been a change in the last few weeks . You owe it to me to be honest , Katharine . "
94592	94600	94601	94601	she	2475	" If I could , I would , "
94604	94617	94618	94618	he	2478	" Why did you tell me you would marry me , then ? "
94708	94723	94724	94724	Rodney	175	" But you re not a child you re not a woman of moods , "
94727	94741	94742	94742	he	2478	" You couldn t have accepted me if you hadn t loved me ! "
94914	94928	94929	94929	she	2475	" I did say I would marry you , but it was wrong , "
94955	95004	94936	94936	she	2475	" for I don t love you , William ; you ve noticed it , every one s noticed it ; why should we go on pretending ? When I told you I loved you , I was wrong . I said what I knew to be untrue . "
95304	95315	95316	95316	he	2486	" When did you begin to feel this , Katharine ? "
95319	95414	95316	95316	he	2486	" for it isn t true to say that you ve always felt it . I admit I was unreasonable the first night when you found that your clothes had been left behind . Still , where s the fault in that ? I could promise you never to interfere with your clothes again . I admit I was cross when I found you upstairs with Henry . Perhaps I showed it too openly . But that s not unreasonable either when one s engaged . Ask your mother . And now this terrible thing "
95428	95454	95415	95415	He	2486	" This decision you say you ve come to have you discussed it with any one ? Your mother , for example , or Henry ? "
95455	95464	95465	95465	she	2490	" No , no , of course not , "
95475	95484	95465	95465	she	2490	" But you don t understand me , William "
95485	95491	95415	95415	He	2486	" Help me to understand you "
95492	95538	95539	95539	she	2490	" You don t understand , I mean , my real feelings ; how could you ? I ve only now faced them myself . But I haven t got the sort of feeling love , I mean I don t know what to call it "
95548	95561	95465	95465	she	2490	" but , anyhow , without it our marriage would be a farce "
95562	95567	95568	95568	he	2492	" How a farce ? "
95571	95580	95581	95581	he	2492	" But this kind of analysis is disastrous ! "
95584	95592	95593	95593	she	2490	" I should have done it before , "
95597	95608	95609	95609	he	2492	" You make yourself think things you don t think , "
95623	95780	95781	95781	he	2493	" Believe me , Katharine , before we came here we were perfectly happy . You were full of plans for our house the chair - covers , don t you remember ? like any other woman who is about to be married . Now , for no reason whatever , you begin to fret about your feeling and about my feeling , with the usual result . I assure you , Katharine , I ve been through it all myself . At one time I was always asking myself absurd questions which came to nothing either . What you want , if I may say so , is some occupation to take you out of yourself when this morbid mood comes on . If it hadn t been for my poetry , I assure you , I should often have been very much in the same state myself . To let you into a secret , "
95795	95858	95785	95785	his	2493	" I ve often gone home from seeing you in such a state of nerves that I had to force myself to write a page or two before I could get you out of my head . Ask Denham ; he ll tell you how he met me one night ; he ll tell you what a state he found me in . "
96201	96213	96214	96214	he	175	" She will make a perfect mother a mother of sons , "
96237	96244	96245	96245	he	175	" A farce , a farce , "
96250	96261	96245	96245	he	175	" She said that our marriage would be a farce , "
96603	96606	96607	96607	she	332	" William , "
96610	96624	96607	96607	she	332	" I will marry you . I will try to make you happy . "
96972	97041	97042	97042	He	153	" What I was going to say when we were interrupted at lunch was that if you go to America I shall come , too . It can t be harder to earn a living there than it is here . However , that s not the point . The point is , Mary , that I want to marry you . Well , what do you say ? "
97058	97072	97073	97073	he	153	" You know me by this time , the good and the bad , "
97077	97102	97073	97073	he	153	" You know my tempers . I ve tried to let you know my faults . Well , what do you say , Mary ? "
97116	97182	97184	97184	he	153	" In most ways , at least in the important ways , as you said , we know each other and we think alike . I believe you are the only person in the world I could live with happily . And if you feel the same about me as you do , don t you , Mary ? we should make each other happy . "
97210	97223	97224	97224	Mary	174	" Yes , but I m afraid I couldn t do it , "
97278	97285	97286	97286	he	153	" You couldn t do it ? "
97289	97298	97299	97299	she	174	" No , I couldn t marry you , "
97302	97310	97273	97273	she	174	" You don t care for me ? "
97316	97321	97322	97322	he	153	" Well , Mary , "
97330	97344	97322	97322	he	153	" I must be an arrant fool , for I thought you did . "
97369	97386	97357	97357	he	153	" I don t believe you , Mary . You re not telling me the truth . "
97387	97397	97398	97398	she	174	" I m too tired to argue , Ralph , "
97408	97432	97398	97398	she	174	" I ask you to believe what I say . I can t marry you ; I don t want to marry you . "
97627	97710	97613	97613	he	153	" Haven t I always been thinking of Katharine while I was with Mary ? I might have loved Mary if it hadn t been for that idiocy of mine . She cared for me once , I m certain of that , but I tormented her so with my humors that I let my chances slip , and now she won t risk marrying me . And this is what I ve made of my life nothing , nothing , nothing . "
97927	97937	97938	97938	Ralph	153	" If you don t want to marry me , "
97950	97980	97938	97938	Ralph	153	" there is no need why we should cease to see each other , is there ? Or would you rather that we should keep apart for the present ? "
97981	97995	97938	97938	Ralph	153	" Keep apart ? I don t know I must think about it . "
97996	98004	98005	98005	he	153	" Tell me one thing , Mary , "
98008	98022	98005	98005	he	153	" have I done anything to make you change your mind about me ? "
98266	98272	98273	98273	he	153	" You needn t answer , "
98277	98303	98273	98273	he	153	" There are reasons enough , I know . But must they kill our friendship , Mary ? Let me keep that , at least . "
98304	98307	98308	98308	she	174	" Oh , "
98328	98344	98308	98308	she	174	" it has come to this to this when I could have given him everything ! "
98345	98354	98355	98355	she	174	" Yes , we can still be friends , "
98365	98372	98373	98373	he	153	" I shall want your friendship , "
98379	98407	98376	98376	He	153	" If you find it possible , let me see you as often as you can . The oftener the better . I shall want your help . "
98644	98659	98660	98660	she	174	" You asked me if I had changed my mind about you , Ralph , "
98663	98705	98660	98660	she	174	" I think there s only one thing . When you asked me to marry you , I don t think you meant it . That made me angry for the moment . Before , you d always spoken the truth . "
98751	98759	98760	98760	he	153	" I never said I loved you , "
98798	98811	98812	98812	she	174	" And to me marriage without love doesn t seem worth while , "
98815	98828	98829	98829	he	153	" Well , Mary , I m not going to press you , "
98832	98990	98829	98829	he	153	" I see you don t want to marry me . But love don t we all talk a great deal of nonsense about it ? What does one mean ? I believe I care for you more genuinely than nine men out of ten care for the women they re in love with . It s only a story one makes up in one s mind about another person , and one knows all the time it isn t true . Of course one knows ; why , one s always taking care not to destroy the illusion . One takes care not to see them too often , or to be alone with them for too long together . It s a pleasant illusion , but if you re thinking of the risks of marriage , it seems to me that the risk of marrying a person you re in love with is something colossal . "
98991	99011	99012	99012	she	2531	" I don t believe a word of that , and what s more you don t , either , "
99017	99032	99012	99012	she	2531	" However , we don t agree ; I only wanted you to understand . "
99248	99259	99260	99260	he	153	" I doubt that one human being ever understands another , "
99278	99336	99337	99337	he	153	" Such damned liars as we all are , how can we ? But we can try . If you don t want to marry me , don t ; but the position you take up about love , and not seeing each other isn t that mere sentimentality ? You think I ve behaved very badly , "

99747	99792	99793	99793	she	174	" are as far beyond them as they ever were . We can only look upon ourselves , Mary , as pioneers in a wilderness . We can only go on patiently putting the truth before them . It isn t _ them _ , "
99805	99865	99793	99793	she	174	" it s their leaders . It s those gentlemen sitting in Parliament and drawing four hundred a year of the people s money . If we had to put our case to the people , we should soon have justice done to us . I have always believed in the people , and I do so still . But "

We must have our fingers upon the pulse of the community ; we want to know what people all over England are thinking ; we want to put them in the way of thinking rightly . "

103173	103286	103287	103287	she	2614	" To last a lifetime ? My dear child , it will last all our lifetimes . As one falls another steps into the breach . My father , in his generation , a pioneer I , coming after him , do my little best . What , alas ! can one do more ? And now it s you young women we look to you the future looks to you . Ah , my dear , if I d a thousand lives , I d give them all to our cause . The cause of women , d you say ? I say the cause of humanity . And there are some "
103293	103346	103347	103347	she	2614	" who don t see it ! There are some who are satisfied to go on , year after year , refusing to admit the truth . And we who have the vision the kettle boiling over ? No , no , let me see to it we who know the truth , "
103379	103388	103365	103365	she	2614	" It s all so _ simple _ . "
103465	103471	103472	103472	she	2614	" One would have thought , "
103475	103504	103505	103505	she	2614	" that men of University training , like Mr. Asquith one would have thought that an appeal to reason would not be unheard by them . But reason , "
103508	103515	103472	103472	she	2614	" what is reason without Reality ? "
103610	103628	103629	103629	he	195	" But , Mrs. Seal , we have to aim at a judicious combination of the two , "
103644	103670	103671	103671	he	195	" Reality has to be voiced by reason before it can make itself felt . The weak point of all these movements , Miss Datchet , "
103695	103737	103738	103738	he	195	" is that they are not based upon sufficiently intellectual grounds . A mistake , in my opinion . The British public likes a pellet of reason in its jam of eloquence a pill of reason in its pudding of sentiment , "

107371	107407	107361	107361	her	332	" Yes , because he would do something worth while ; he would write a book . My father always says that he s the most remarkable of the young men who write for him . "

108236	108259	108260	108260	she	174	" That is what puzzles me about this question of being in love . I ve always prided myself upon being reasonable , "
108263	108290	108292	108292	she	174	" I didn t think I could have felt this I mean if the other person didn t. I was foolish . I let myself pretend . "
108295	108303	108304	108304	she	174	" For , you see , Katharine , "
108315	108337	108304	108304	she	174	" I AM in love . There s no doubt about that .... I m tremendously in love ... with Ralph . "
108374	108382	108369	108369	Katharine	332	" That s how it feels then . "

108421	108464	108465	108465	She	174	" I ve got that . One wouldn t _ not _ be in love .... But I didn t mean to talk about that ; I only wanted you to know . There s another thing I want to tell you ... "
108468	108493	108465	108465	She	174	" I haven t any authority from Ralph to say it ; but I m sure of this he s in love with you . "
108569	108579	108581	108581	Katharine	332	" That proves that you re mistaken utterly mistaken , "
108705	108711	108712	108712	she	174	" I ve told you , "
108715	108754	108712	108712	she	174	" because I want you to help me . I don t want to be jealous of you . And I am I m fearfully jealous . The only way , I thought , was to tell you . "
108771	108915	108945	108945	he	2695	" If I tell you , then we can talk ; and when I m jealous , I can tell you . And if I m tempted to do something frightfully mean , I can tell you ; you could make me tell you . I find talking so difficult ; but loneliness frightens me . I should shut it up in my mind . Yes , that s what I m afraid of . Going about with something in my mind all my life that never changes . I find it so difficult to change . When I think a thing s wrong I never stop thinking it wrong , and Ralph was quite right , I see , when he said that there s no such thing as right and wrong ; no such thing , I mean , as judging people "
108916	108922	108924	108924	Katharine	332	" Ralph Denham said that ? "
109003	109008	109009	109009	she	174	" No , no , "
109012	109037	109009	109009	she	174	" you don t understand . If there s any fault it s mine entirely ; after all , if one chooses to run risks "
109354	109359	109348	109348	he	153	" Well , Mary ? "
109659	109679	109680	109680	Katharine	332	" She sat up straight and looked at me , and then she said , I m in love , "

112195	112221	112225	112225	she	332	" You ve been neglecting my education lately , by the way . I wish you d read something . Let me choose a book . "

112555	112568	112569	112569	he	175	" I think it s a little odd , don t you ? "
112579	112615	112569	112569	he	175	" Most people , I mean , would be seriously upset if their marriage was put off for six months or so . But we aren t ; now how do you account for that ? "
112634	112639	112640	112640	he	175	" I attribute it , "
112651	112798	112640	112640	he	175	" to the fact that neither of us is in the least romantic about the other . That may be partly , no doubt , because we ve known each other so long ; but I m inclined to think there s more in it than that . There s something temperamental . I think you re a trifle cold , and I suspect I m a trifle self - absorbed . If that were so it goes a long way to explaining our odd lack of illusion about each other . I m not saying that the most satisfactory marriages aren t founded upon this sort of understanding . But certainly it struck me as odd this morning , when Wilson told me , how little upset I felt . By the way , you re sure we haven t committed ourselves to that house ? "
112799	112827	112931	112931	He	2736	" I ve kept the letters , and I ll go through them to - morrow ; but I m certain we re on the safe side . "
112828	112837	112838	112838	he	2736	" Thanks . As to the psychological problem , "
112852	112895	112838	112838	he	2736	" there s no doubt , I think , that either of us is capable of feeling what , for reasons of simplicity , I call romance for a third person at least , I ve little doubt in my own case . "
113053	113059	113060	113060	she	2737	" What is this romance ? "
113063	113089	113090	113090	he	2736	" Ah , that s the question . I ve never come across a definition that satisfied me , though there are some very good ones "
113099	113114	113115	113115	she	2737	" It s not altogether knowing the other person , perhaps it s ignorance , "
113118	113134	113171	113171	his	2736	" Some authorities say it s a question of distance romance in literature , that is "
113135	113153	113154	113154	she	2737	" Possibly , in the case of art . But in the case of people it may be "
113157	113166	113167	113167	he	2736	" Have you no personal experience of it ? "
113181	113190	113191	113191	she	2737	" I believe it s influenced me enormously , "
113211	113224	113225	113225	she	2737	" but in my life there s so little scope for it , "
113320	113327	113328	113328	William	175	" But isn t it curious , "
113331	113346	113328	113328	William	175	" that you should neither feel it for me , nor I for you ? "
113442	113459	113460	113460	she	2737	" I think you might be very happy with some one you loved in that way , "
113463	113478	113408	113408	she	2737	" You assume that romance survives a closer knowledge of the person one loves ? "
113686	113699	113700	113700	she	332	" I don t see why it shouldn t last with you , "
113703	113712	113713	113713	she	332	" I can imagine a certain sort of person "
113761	113765	113766	113766	she	332	" A person , "
113783	113829	113766	113766	she	332	" like Cassandra Otway , for instance . Cassandra is the most interesting of the Otways with the exception of Henry . Even so , I like Cassandra better . She has more than mere cleverness . She is a character a person by herself . "
113830	113835	113838	113838	William	175	" Those dreadful insects ! "
113869	113906	113866	113866	she	332	" You could insist that she confined herself to to something else .... But she cares for music ; I believe she writes poetry ; and there can be no doubt that she has a peculiar charm "
113928	113934	113924	113924	William	175	" I thought her affectionate ? "
113935	113959	113866	113866	she	332	" Extremely affectionate . She worships Henry . When you think what a house that is Uncle Francis always in one mood or another "
113960	113967	113968	113968	William	175	" Dear , dear , dear , "
113971	113980	113866	113866	she	332	" And you have so much in common . "
113981	113986	113987	113987	William	175	" My dear Katharine ! "
114008	114024	113987	113987	William	175	" I really don t know what we re talking about .... I assure you .... "
114140	114153	114154	114154	she	332	" We re talking about things that interest us both very much , "
114157	114199	114154	114154	she	332	" Shan t we go on talking , and leave Swift for another time ? I don t feel in the mood for Swift , and it s a pity to read any one when that s the case particularly Swift . "
114374	114398	114368	114368	He	175	" You ve stirred up all these odious and violent emotions , and now you must do the best you can with them . "
114456	114468	114469	114469	he	175	" I wish to do whatever you tell me to do , "
114472	114483	114469	114469	he	175	" I put myself entirely in your hands , Katharine . "
114484	114495	114496	114496	she	332	" You must try to tell me what you feel , "
114499	114533	114534	114534	He	175	" My dear , I feel a thousand things every second . I don t know , I m sure , what I feel . That afternoon on the heath it was then then "
114548	114573	114574	114574	he	175	" Your ghastly good sense , as usual , has convinced me for the moment but what the truth is , Heaven only knows ! "
114577	114596	114597	114597	she	332	" Isn t it the truth that you are , or might be , in love with Cassandra ? "
114614	114623	114611	114611	he	175	" I believe you re right , Katharine . "
114715	114722	114723	114723	he	175	" Katharine , I worship you , "
114731	114734	114735	114735	she	332	" Yes , "
114744	114752	114735	114735	she	332	" but you must open the door . "
115142	115156	115158	115158	Denham	153	" I d rather live here than anywhere in the whole of London , "
115161	115169	115171	115171	Katharine	332	" And I ve got nowhere to live "
115179	115194	115195	115195	Rodney	175	" You could get rooms here , no doubt , if you wanted to , "
115198	115218	115171	115171	Katharine	332	" But I m just leaving London for good I ve taken that cottage I was telling you about . "
115232	115256	115171	115171	Katharine	332	" Indeed ? that s sad .... You must give me your address . But you won t cut yourself off altogether , surely "
115257	115268	115269	115269	Denham	153	" You ll be moving , too , I suppose , "
115286	115295	115280	115280	Katharine	332	" Where is the cottage you ve taken ? "
115596	115608	115609	115609	she	332	" But what will you find to do in the country ? "
115680	115687	115674	115674	he	175	" Yes , yes , yes . "
115798	115803	115788	115788	He	153	" Yes , yes , "
115972	115984	115958	115958	Denham	153	" I m going , too . Shall we go together ? "
116272	116287	116265	116265	Denham	153	" There seem to be no cabs . Shall we walk on a little ? "
116288	116292	116293	116293	she	332	" Very well , "
116741	116752	116753	116753	he	153	" Should you mind if we walked a little farther ? "
116756	116767	116753	116753	he	153	" There s something I want to say to you . "
116768	116772	116773	116773	she	2786	" Very well , "
116788	116796	116797	116797	he	153	" It s quieter by the river , "
116806	116815	116816	116816	he	153	" I want to ask you merely this , "
116870	116908	116853	116853	he	153	" I ve made you my standard ever since I saw you . I ve dreamt about you ; I ve thought of nothing but you ; you represent to me the only reality in the world . "
116946	116989	116990	116990	he	153	" And now things have come to such a pass that , unless I can speak to you openly , I believe I shall go mad . I think of you as the most beautiful , the truest thing in the world , "
117029	117072	117083	117083	she	2796	" I see you everywhere , in the stars , in the river ; to me you re everything that exists ; the reality of everything . Life , I tell you , would be impossible without you . And now I want "
117121	117127	117128	117128	she	2796	" I don t understand , "
117131	117142	117128	117128	she	2796	" You re saying things that you don t mean . "
117143	117151	117152	117152	he	153	" I mean every word I say , "
117176	117185	117186	117186	They	2797	" Ralph Denham is in love with you . "
117204	117212	117213	117213	she	2796	" I saw Mary Datchet this afternoon , "
117235	117251	117216	117216	He	153	" She told you that I had asked her to marry me , I suppose ? "
117252	117255	117256	117256	Katharine	332	" No ! "
117262	117277	117278	117278	he	153	" I did though . It was the day I saw you at Lincoln , "
117281	117359	117278	117278	he	153	" I had meant to ask her to marry me , and then I looked out of the window and saw you . After that I didn t want to ask any one to marry me . But I did it ; and she knew I was lying , and refused me . I thought then , and still think , that she cares for me . I behaved very badly . I don t defend myself . "
117360	117363	117365	117365	Katharine	332	" No , "
117367	117392	117365	117365	Katharine	332	" I should hope not . There s no defence that I can think of . If any conduct is wrong , that is . "
117409	117415	117416	117416	she	332	" It seems to me , "
117424	117441	117416	117416	she	332	" that people are bound to be honest . There s no excuse for such behavior . "
117466	117488	117463	117463	he	2798	" I am not telling you that I am in love with you . I am not in love with you . "
117489	117496	117497	117497	she	332	" I didn t think that , "
117505	117520	117521	117521	he	2798	" I have not spoken a word to you that I do not mean , "
117524	117535	117536	117536	she	332	" Tell me then what it is that you mean , "
117568	117579	117580	117580	Ralph	153	" You say that we ve got to be honest , "
117583	117668	117669	117669	He	153	" Very well . I will try to tell you the facts ; but I warn you , you ll think me mad . It s a fact , though , that since I first saw you four or five months ago I have made you , in an utterly absurd way , I expect , my ideal . I m almost ashamed to tell you what lengths I ve gone to . It s become the thing that matters most in my life . "
117673	117785	117669	117669	He	153	" Without knowing you , except that you re beautiful , and all that , I ve come to believe that we re in some sort of agreement ; that we re after something together ; that we see something .... I ve got into the habit of imagining you ; I m always thinking what you d say or do ; I walk along the street talking to you ; I dream of you . It s merely a bad habit , a schoolboy habit , day - dreaming ; it s a common experience ; half one s friends do the same ; well , those are the facts . "
117795	117809	117810	117810	she	2803	" If you were to know me you would feel none of this , "
117813	117839	117840	117840	she	2803	" We don t know each other we ve always been interrupted .... Were you going to tell me this that day my aunts came ? "
117853	117863	117864	117864	he	2804	" The day you told me of your engagement , "
117881	117896	117897	117897	he	2804	" I deny that I should cease to feel this if I knew you , "
117901	117938	117939	117939	he	2804	" I should feel it more reasonably that s all . I shouldn t talk the kind of nonsense I ve talked to - night .... But it wasn t nonsense . It was the truth , "
117943	117983	117984	117984	he	2804	" It s the important thing . You can force me to talk as if this feeling for you were an hallucination , but all our feelings are that . The best of them are half illusions . Still , "
117993	118019	117984	117984	he	2804	" if it weren t as real a feeling as I m capable of , I shouldn t be changing my life on your account . "
118020	118026	118027	118027	she	2805	" What do you mean ? "
118030	118048	117984	117984	he	2804	" I told you . I m taking a cottage . I m giving up my profession . "
118049	118054	118055	118055	she	2805	" On my account ? "
118061	118068	118069	118069	he	2804	" Yes , on your account , "
118079	118090	118091	118091	she	2805	" But I don t know you or your circumstances , "
118101	118114	118130	118130	his	2804	" You have no opinion about me one way or the other ? "
118115	118124	118125	118125	she	2805	" Yes , I suppose I have an opinion "
118154	118174	118144	118144	she	2805	" I thought that you criticized me perhaps disliked me . I thought of you as a person who judges "
118175	118185	118186	118186	he	2804	" No ; I m a person who feels , "
118194	118207	118208	118208	she	2805	" Tell me , then , what has made you do this ? "
118413	118434	118407	118407	She	2805	" Yes , I see .... But how would that help you ? ... Your brother has passed his examination ? "
119035	119050	119051	119051	he	153	" Then you will let me know your decision as soon as you can ? "
119082	119087	119088	119088	she	332	" I will write , "
119092	119095	119096	119096	she	332	" No , "
119123	119133	119096	119096	she	332	" I don t see how to manage it . "
119174	119189	119190	119190	he	153	" There s only one place to discuss things satisfactorily that I know of , "
119194	119199	119190	119190	he	153	" that s Kew . "
119200	119203	119171	119171	she	332	" Kew ? "
119204	119207	119208	119208	he	153	" Kew , "
120444	120454	120436	120436	she	332	" D you think he ever passed this house ? "
120472	120482	120483	120484	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" On his way to Blackfriars , I mean , "
120487	120502	120483	120484	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" for you know the latest discovery is that he owned a house there . "
120516	120556	120512	120513	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Which is a proof that he wasn t as poor as they ve sometimes said . I should like to think that he had enough , though I don t in the least want him to be rich . "
120573	120623	120624	120624	she	128	" My dear , I m not talking about _ your _ William , though that s another reason for liking him . I m talking , I m thinking , I m dreaming of _ my _ William William Shakespeare , of course . Isn t it odd , "
120638	120737	120624	120624	she	128	" that for all one can see , that dear old thing in the blue bonnet , crossing the road with her basket on her arm , has never heard that there was such a person ? Yet it all goes on : lawyers hurrying to their work , cabmen squabbling for their fares , little boys rolling their hoops , little girls throwing bread to the gulls , as if there weren t a Shakespeare in the world . I should like to stand at that crossing all day long and say : People , read Shakespeare ! "
120869	120880	120881	120882	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Katharine ! I ve hit upon a brilliant idea ! "
120884	121056	121057	121057	she	2871	" to lay out , say , a hundred pounds or so on copies of Shakespeare , and give them to working men . Some of your clever friends who get up meetings might help us , Katharine . And that might lead to a playhouse , where we could all take parts . You d be Rosalind but you ve a dash of the old nurse in you . Your father s Hamlet , come to years of discretion ; and I m well , I m a bit of them all ; I m quite a large bit of the fool , but the fools in Shakespeare say all the clever things . Now who shall William be ? A hero ? Hotspur ? Henry the Fifth ? No , William s got a touch of Hamlet in him , too . I can fancy that William talks to himself when he s alone . Ah , Katharine , you must say very beautiful things when you re together ! "
121080	121090	121092	121092	Katharine	332	" Oh , we talk a lot of nonsense , "
121118	121131	121133	121134	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" It won t seem to you nonsense in ten years time , "
121136	121198	121199	121199	she	377	" Believe me , Katharine , you ll look back on these days afterwards ; you ll remember all the silly things you ve said ; and you ll find that your life has been built on them . The best of life is built on what we say when we re in love . It isn t nonsense , Katharine , "
121202	121214	121199	121199	she	377	" it s the truth , it s the only truth . "
121364	121368	121369	121369	Katharine	332	" Mary Datchet , "
121373	121442	121369	121369	Katharine	332	" Ah I half wish I d called you Mary , but it wouldn t have gone with Hilbery , and it wouldn t have gone with Rodney . Now this isn t the passage I wanted . ( I never can find what I want . ) But it s spring ; it s the daffodils ; it s the green fields ; it s the birds . "
121464	121477	121478	121479	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" My dear child , how odious the triumphs of science are ! "
121485	121500	121478	121479	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" They ll be linking us with the moon next but who was that ? "
121501	121504	121505	121505	Katharine	332	" William , "
121511	121540	121478	121479	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" I ll forgive William anything , for I m certain that there aren t any Williams in the moon . I hope he s coming to luncheon ? "
121541	121548	121478	121479	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" He s coming to tea . "
121549	121566	121478	121479	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Well , that s better than nothing , and I promise to leave you alone . "
121567	121578	121580	121580	Katharine	332	" There s no need for you to do that , "
122276	122280	122281	122281	she	332	" Whose voice ? "
122358	122387	122404	122404	Katharine	332	" I ve looked out the train .... Early on Saturday afternoon would suit me best .... I m Ralph Denham .... But I ll write it down .... "
122407	122424	122404	122404	Katharine	332	" I think I could come . I ll look at my engagements .... Hold on . "
122742	122752	122753	122753	she	332	" Who is lying ill in bed , Katharine ? "
122756	122806	122807	122807	she	332	" Which of our friends wants cheering up ? Who feels that they ve been forgotten and passed over , and that nobody wants them ? Whose water rates are overdue , and the cook leaving in a temper without waiting for her wages ? There was somebody I know "
123241	123245	123246	123246	Katharine	332	" Good Heavens ! "
123256	123267	123246	123246	Katharine	332	" I suppose I ought to make up my mind . "
124034	124043	124025	124025	she	332	" I m in love I m in love "
125157	125161	125162	125162	Katharine	332	" our things . "
125205	125238	125189	125189	She	332	" This table is my grandfather s writing - table . Most of the later poems were written at it . And this is his pen the last pen he ever used . "
125254	125257	125258	125258	she	332	" Here , "
125261	125297	125298	125298	she	332	" is the original manuscript of the Ode to Winter . The early manuscripts are far less corrected than the later ones , as you will see directly .... Oh , do take it yourself , "
125328	125339	125340	125342	the American lady	2966	" You are wonderfully like your grandfather , Miss Hilbery , "
125352	125373	125374	125374	she	332	" especially about the eyes . Come , now , I expect she writes poetry herself , doesn t she ? "
125385	125455	125461	125461	she	332	" Quite one s ideal of a poet , is it not , Mr. Rodney ? I can not tell you what a privilege I feel it to be standing just here with the poet s granddaughter . You must know we think a great deal of your grandfather in America , Miss Hilbery . We have societies for reading him aloud . What ! His very own slippers ! "
125834	125837	125817	125817	she	297	" fascinating . "
126789	126813	126772	126772	She	332	" Come and sit down , William . How glad I was you were here ! I felt myself getting ruder and ruder . "
126814	126824	126825	126825	he	175	" You are not good at hiding your feelings , "
126829	126843	126846	126846	him	175	" Oh , don t scold me I ve had a horrid afternoon . "
127137	127143	127145	127145	Katharine	332	" A letter from Cassandra ? "
127160	127179	127145	127145	Katharine	332	" I ve just written to ask her to come here , only I forgot to post it . "
127214	127217	127218	127218	she	332	" Yes , "
127223	127229	127218	127218	she	332	" a very charming letter . "
127262	127268	127269	127269	William	175	" I see no harm , "
127273	127292	127269	127269	William	175	" in helping her with Greek , for example if she really cares for that sort of thing . "
127293	127304	127306	127306	Katharine	332	" There s no reason why she shouldn t care , "
127314	127336	127306	127306	Katharine	332	" In fact ah , here it is The Greek alphabet is absolutely _ fascinating _ . Obviously she does care . "
127337	127426	127269	127269	William	175	" Well , Greek may be rather a large order . I was thinking chiefly of English . Her criticisms of my play , though they re too generous , evidently immature she can t be more than twenty - two , I suppose ? they certainly show the sort of thing one wants : real feeling for poetry , understanding , not formed , of course , but it s at the root of everything after all . There d be no harm in lending her books ? "
127427	127433	127306	127306	Katharine	332	" No . Certainly not . "
127434	127468	127469	127469	he	175	" But if it hum led to a correspondence ? I mean , Katharine , I take it , without going into matters which seem to me a little morbid , I mean , "
127472	127510	127469	127469	he	175	" you , from your point of view , feel that there s nothing disagreeable to you in the notion ? If so , you ve only to speak , and I never think of it again . "
127651	127656	127657	127657	he	175	" She loves me , "
127925	127936	127937	127937	she	128	" The best of all my treasures , Mr. Pelham ! "
127940	127959	127937	127937	she	128	" Don t move , Katharine . Sit still , William . Mr. Pelham will come another day . "
128010	128018	128019	128019	she	332	" As I told you last night , "
128022	128078	128019	128019	she	332	" I think it s your duty , if there s a chance that you care for Cassandra , to discover what your feeling is for her now . It s your duty to her , as well as to me . But we must tell my mother . We can t go on pretending . "
128079	128090	128092	128092	Rodney	175	" That is entirely in your hands , of course , "
128108	128112	128114	128114	Katharine	332	" Very well , "
128147	128152	128153	128153	Rodney	175	" But , Katharine , "
128168	128182	128153	128153	Rodney	175	" if Cassandra should Cassandra you ve asked Cassandra to stay with you . "
128183	128194	128206	128206	his	175	" Yes ; but I ve not posted the letter . "
128399	128412	128413	128413	she	332	" I m to give up my freedom for an indefinite time , "
128416	128471	128413	128413	she	332	" in order that William may see Cassandra here at his ease . He s not the courage to manage it without my help he s too much of a coward to tell me openly what he wants . He hates the notion of a public breach . He wants to keep us both . "
128702	128709	128710	128710	he	175	" I leave you , then , "
128733	128747	128710	128710	he	175	" to tell your mother that our engagement is ended by your desire . "
128756	128763	128764	128764	she	332	" You don t trust me ? "
128767	128773	128774	128774	he	175	" I do , absolutely , "
128777	128794	128750	128750	his	175	" No . You don t trust me to help you .... I could help you ? "
128795	128803	128804	128804	he	175	" I m hopeless without your help ! "
128835	128892	128893	128893	he	175	" It s useless to pretend that I don t understand what you re offering , Katharine . I admit what you say . Speaking to you perfectly frankly , I believe at this moment that I do love your cousin ; there is a chance that , with your help , I might but no , "
128897	128918	128893	128893	he	175	" it s impossible , it s wrong I m infinitely to blame for having allowed this situation to arise . "
128919	128928	128827	128827	him	175	" Sit beside me . Let s consider sensibly "
128929	128936	128937	128937	he	175	" Your sense has been our undoing "
128940	128946	128827	128827	him	175	" I accept the responsibility . "
128947	128956	128957	128957	he	175	" Ah , but can I allow that ? "
128960	128994	128957	128957	he	175	" It would mean for we must face it , Katharine that we let our engagement stand for the time nominally ; in fact , of course , your freedom would be absolute . "
128995	129000	128827	128827	him	175	" And yours too . "
129001	129062	128957	128957	he	175	" Yes , we should both be free . Let us say that I saw Cassandra once , twice , perhaps , under these conditions ; and then if , as I think certain , the whole thing proves a dream , we tell your mother instantly . Why not tell her now , indeed , under pledge of secrecy ? "
129063	129085	128827	128827	him	175	" Why not ? It would be over London in ten minutes , besides , she would never even remotely understand . "
129086	129100	128957	128957	he	175	" Your father , then ? This secrecy is detestable it s dishonorable . "
129101	129112	128827	128827	him	175	" My father would understand even less than my mother . "
129113	129123	129124	129124	Rodney	175	" Ah , who could be expected to understand ? "
129127	129172	129124	129124	Rodney	175	" but it s from your point of view that we must look at it . It s not only asking too much , it s putting you into a position a position in which I could not endure to see my own sister . "
129173	129181	129182	129182	she	3037	" We re not brothers and sisters , "
129186	129203	129204	129204	she	3037	" and if we can t decide , who can ? I m not talking nonsense , "
129207	129250	129204	129204	she	3037	" I ve done my best to think this out from every point of view , and I ve come to the conclusion that there are risks which have to be taken , though I don t deny that they hurt horribly . "
129251	129263	129124	129124	Rodney	175	" Katharine , you mind ? You ll mind too much . "
129264	129270	129271	129271	she	3037	" No I shan t , "
129275	129327	129271	129271	she	3037	" I shall mind a good deal , but I m prepared for that ; I shall get through it , because you will help me . You ll both help me . In fact , we ll help each other . That s a Christian doctrine , isn t it ? "
129328	129337	129338	129338	Rodney	175	" It sounds more like Paganism to me , "
129537	129544	129545	129545	he	175	" We will help each other , "
129575	129581	129582	129582	she	332	" He s already gone , "
129585	129595	129582	129582	she	332	" far away he thinks of me no more . "
129734	129738	129739	129739	she	128	" Dearest William , "
129768	129772	129773	129773	she	128	" Dearest children , "
130370	130382	130383	130383	he	153	" Here she comes , like a ship in full sail , "
130461	130477	130478	130478	she	3052	" Why did you never tell me ? I didn t know there was this , "
130530	130538	130539	130539	Denham	153	" You ve never been to Kew ? "
130670	130676	130677	130677	she	3052	" It s so peaceful , "
131753	131762	131745	131745	She	332	" I ve left my bag somewhere where ? "
131863	131873	131874	131874	Katharine	332	" A purse a ticket some letters , papers , "
132042	132052	132037	132037	He	153	" Don t let s discuss that dreary business . "
132053	132057	132016	132016	she	332	" But I thought "
132058	132072	132037	132037	He	153	" It s a dreary business . I ought never to have bothered you "
132073	132080	132016	132016	she	332	" Have you decided , then ? "
132087	132096	132081	132081	He	153	" It s not a thing that matters . "
132104	132107	132097	132097	She	332	" Oh ! "
132108	132126	132127	132127	he	153	" I mean it matters to me , but it matters to no one else . Anyhow , "
132133	132149	132127	132127	he	153	" I see no reason why you should be bothered with other people s nuisances . "
132168	132179	132180	132180	she	332	" I m afraid I ve been absent - minded , "
132194	132207	132208	132208	he	153	" You have a good deal to make you absent - minded , "
132211	132214	132215	132215	she	332	" Yes , "
132220	132223	132224	132224	she	332	" No , "
132228	132276	132226	132226	herself	332	" Nothing particular , I mean . But I was thinking about plants . I was enjoying myself . In fact , I ve seldom enjoyed an afternoon more . But I want to hear what you ve settled , if you don t mind telling me . "
132277	132285	132286	132286	he	153	" Oh , it s all settled , "
132289	132303	132286	132286	he	153	" I m going to this infernal cottage to write a worthless book . "
132304	132310	132311	132311	she	332	" How I envy you , "
132319	132333	132286	132286	he	153	" Well , cottages are to be had for fifteen shillings a week . "
132334	132342	132343	132343	she	332	" Cottages are to be had yes , "
132346	132350	132351	132351	She	332	" The question is "
132355	132364	132365	132365	she	332	" Two rooms are all I should want , "
132373	132445	132365	132365	she	332	" one for eating , one for sleeping . Oh , but I should like another , a large one at the top , and a little garden where one could grow flowers . A path so down to a river , or up to a wood , and the sea not very far off , so that one could hear the waves at night . Ships just vanishing on the horizon "
132450	132458	132446	132446	She	332	" Shall you be near the sea ? "
132459	132466	132467	132467	he	3088	" My notion of perfect happiness , "
132476	132485	132467	132467	he	3088	" is to live as you ve said . "
132486	132500	132501	132501	she	332	" Well , now you can . You will work , I suppose , "
132504	132532	132501	132501	she	332	" you ll work all the morning and again after tea and perhaps at night . You won t have people always coming about you to interrupt . "
132533	132541	132542	132542	he	3088	" How far can one live alone ? "
132545	132551	132542	132542	he	3088	" Have you tried ever ? "
132552	132558	132559	132559	she	332	" Once for three weeks , "
132562	132645	132646	132646	she	3089	" My father and mother were in Italy , and something happened so that I couldn t join them . For three weeks I lived entirely by myself , and the only person I spoke to was a stranger in a shop where I lunched a man with a beard . Then I went back to my room by myself and well , I did what I liked . It doesn t make me out an amiable character , I m afraid , "
132649	132704	132646	132646	she	3089	" but I can t endure living with other people . An occasional man with a beard is interesting ; he s detached ; he lets me go my way , and we know we shall never meet again . Therefore , we are perfectly sincere a thing not possible with one s friends . "
132705	132708	132709	132709	Denham	153	" Nonsense , "
132713	132717	132718	132718	she	3089	" Why nonsense ? "
132721	132731	132732	132732	he	153	" Because you don t mean what you say , "
132735	132741	132742	132742	she	3089	" You re very positive , "
132860	132869	132870	132870	she	3089	" I don t mean what I say , "
132876	132879	132870	132870	she	3089	" Well ? "
132880	132893	132894	132894	he	153	" I doubt whether you make absolute sincerity your standard in life , "
133024	133036	133037	133037	she	3089	" Absolute sincerity is rather difficult , don t you think ? "
133046	133056	133057	133057	he	153	" There are people one credits even with that , "
133234	133250	133251	133251	She	3089	" I went back to my room by myself and I did what I liked . "
133442	133464	133465	133465	she	3089	" Don t you see that if you have no relations with people it s easier to be honest with them ? "
133468	133528	133465	133465	she	3089	" That is what I meant . One needn t cajole them ; one s under no obligation to them . Surely you must have found with your own family that it s impossible to discuss what matters to you most because you re all herded together , because you re in a conspiracy , because the position is false "
133597	133602	133603	133603	he	153	" I m convinced , "
133606	133648	133603	133603	he	153	" that there are cases in which perfect sincerity is possible cases where there s no relationship , though the people live together , if you like , where each is free , where there s no obligation upon either side . "
133649	133655	133656	133656	she	3089	" For a time perhaps , "
133663	133693	133703	133703	she	3089	" But obligations always grow up . There are feelings to be considered . People aren t simple , and though they may mean to be reasonable , they end "
133709	133714	133703	133703	she	3089	" in a muddle . "
133715	133718	133719	133719	Denham	153	" Because , "
133723	133742	133743	133743	he	153	" they don t make themselves understood at the beginning . I could undertake , at this instant , "
133760	133777	133743	133743	he	153	" to lay down terms for a friendship which should be perfectly sincere and perfectly straightforward . "
133855	133868	133869	133869	he	153	" In the first place , such a friendship must be unemotional , "
133875	133947	133869	133869	he	153	" At least , on both sides it must be understood that if either chooses to fall in love , he or she does so entirely at his own risk . Neither is under any obligation to the other . They must be at liberty to break or to alter at any moment . They must be able to say whatever they wish to say . All this must be understood . "
133948	133956	133957	133957	she	3089	" And they gain something worth having ? "
133960	133972	133973	133973	he	153	" It s a risk of course it s a risk , "
133994	134008	134009	134009	he	153	" But it s the only way if you think friendship worth having , "
134012	134021	134022	134022	she	3089	" Perhaps under those conditions it might be , "
134026	134029	134030	134030	he	153	" Well , "
134033	134047	134030	134030	he	153	" those are the terms of the friendship I wish to offer you . "
134082	134088	134089	134089	she	3089	" I should like it , "
134092	134094	134089	134089	she	3089	" but "
134095	134100	134030	134030	he	153	" Would Rodney mind ? "
134101	134105	134106	134106	she	3089	" Oh no , "
134110	134120	134121	134121	she	3089	" No , no , it isn t that , "
134475	134478	134479	134479	she	3089	" Now , "
134482	134490	134479	134479	she	3089	" let s go and have tea . "
135557	135562	135573	135573	she	332	" cab fares and dissipation "
135913	135917	135918	135918	Cassandra	332	" My dear , "
135928	135953	135918	135918	Cassandra	332	" my whole life s changed from this moment ! I must write the man s name down at once , or I shall forget "
135984	135992	135993	135993	Cassandra	332	" May I sit and watch you ? "
136001	136008	135993	135993	Cassandra	332	" I got ready on purpose . "
136009	136019	136021	136021	Katharine	332	" Oh , you re ready , are you ? "
136051	136058	136059	136059	she	332	" There are people dining here , "
136145	136152	136153	136153	Cassandra	332	" Who s coming to dinner ? "
136162	136178	136126	136129	the light angular figure	3169	" There s William , and , I believe , Aunt Eleanor and Uncle Aubrey . "
136179	136216	136126	136129	the light angular figure	3169	" I m so glad William is coming . Did he tell you that he sent me his manuscript ? I think it s wonderful I think he s almost good enough for you , Katharine . "
136217	136233	136126	136129	the light angular figure	3169	" You shall sit next to him and tell him what you think of him . "
136234	136242	136243	136243	Cassandra	332	" I shan t dare do that , "
136246	136259	136126	136129	the light angular figure	3169	" Why ? You re not afraid of him , are you ? "
136260	136270	136126	136129	the light angular figure	3169	" A little because he s connected with you . "
136274	136371	136271	136271	Katharine	332	" But then , with your well - known fidelity , considering that you re staying here at least a fortnight , you won t have any illusions left about me by the time you go . I give you a week , Cassandra . I shall see my power fading day by day . Now it s at the climax ; but to - morrow it ll have begun to fade . What am I to wear , I wonder ? Find me a blue dress , Cassandra , over there in the long wardrobe . "
136908	136911	136906	136906	she	332	" reality . "
137110	137119	137120	137120	he	337	" Were there any buds on the trees ? "
137123	137131	137120	137120	he	337	" Which line did she travel by ? "
137309	137326	137327	137327	she	332	" There s no doubt what _ you _ do in a railway carriage , William , "
137340	137360	137327	137327	she	332	" You never _ once _ look out of the window ; you read _ all _ the time . "
137361	137371	137372	137373	Mr. Peyton	337	" And what facts do you deduce from that ? "
137376	137388	137390	137390	Cassandra	332	" Oh , that he s a poet , of course , "
137392	137417	137418	137418	she	332	" But I must confess that I knew that before , so it isn t fair . I ve got your manuscript with me , "
137430	137446	137418	137418	she	332	" I ve got all sorts of things I want to ask you about it . "
137535	137540	137541	137541	she	332	" First of all , "
137544	137557	137541	137541	she	332	" I want to know why you chose to write a play ? "
137558	137568	137530	137530	her	332	" Ah ! You mean it s not dramatic ? "
137569	137630	137631	137631	she	332	" I mean that I don t see what it would gain by being acted . But then does Shakespeare gain ? Henry and I are always arguing about Shakespeare . I m certain he s wrong , but I can t prove it because I ve only seen Shakespeare acted once in Lincoln . But I m quite positive , "
137634	137642	137631	137631	she	332	" that Shakespeare wrote for the stage . "
137643	137649	137650	137650	Rodney	175	" You re perfectly right , "
137653	137694	137650	137650	Rodney	175	" I was hoping you were on that side . Henry s wrong entirely wrong . Of course , I ve failed , as all the moderns fail . Dear , dear , I wish I d consulted you before . "
137815	137823	137824	137824	she	128	" You ve not read The Idiot ! "
137827	137835	137836	137836	William	175	" I ve read War and Peace , "
137843	137850	137851	137851	she	128	" _ War and Peace _ ! "
137860	137870	137917	137917	he	1961	" I confess I don t understand the Russians . "
137871	137878	137880	137881	Uncle Aubrey	336	" Shake hands ! Shake hands ! "
137887	137902	137880	137881	Uncle Aubrey	336	" Neither do I. And I hazard the opinion that they don t themselves . "
138022	138032	138033	138033	she	198	" Insanity is not a fit subject for fiction , "
138037	138048	138049	138050	Mr. Hilbery	132	" There s the well - known case of Hamlet , "
138062	138072	138074	138075	Aunt Eleanor	198	" Ah , but poetry s different , Trevor , "
138089	138121	138143	138143	she	198	" Different altogether . And I ve never thought , for my part , that Hamlet was as mad as they make out . What is your opinion , Mr. Peyton ? "
138218	138224	138225	138225	she	128	" Lovely , lovely Ophelia ! "
138228	138315	138225	138225	she	128	" What a wonderful power it is poetry ! I wake up in the morning all bedraggled ; there s a yellow fog outside ; little Emily turns on the electric light when she brings me my tea , and says , Oh , ma am , the water s frozen in the cistern , and cook s cut her finger to the bone . And then I open a little green book , and the birds are singing , the stars shining , the flowers twinkling "
138335	138344	138345	138346	Aunt Eleanor	198	" Has the cook cut her finger badly ? "
138355	138370	138372	138373	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Oh , the cook s finger is only my way of putting it , "
138375	138393	138394	138394	she	128	" But if she had cut her arm off , Katharine would have sewn it on again , "
138415	138423	138424	138424	she	128	" But what horrid , horrid thoughts , "
138438	138452	138424	138424	she	128	" Come , let us find something more cheerful to talk about upstairs . "
138653	138660	138661	138661	Katharine	332	" What are you laughing at ? "
138675	138697	138698	138698	Katharine	332	" It was nothing ridiculous in the worst of taste , but still , if you half shut your eyes and looked "
138777	138785	138786	138786	Cassandra	332	" I utterly refuse to tell you ! "
138841	138858	138859	138859	he	175	" Ah , but you re cruel to make me feel the barbarity of my sex , "
138882	138911	138859	138859	he	175	" We ve been discussing all sorts of dull things , and now I shall never know what I want to know more than anything in the world . "
138912	138922	138923	138923	she	332	" You don t deceive us for a minute ! "
138926	138949	138923	138923	she	332	" Not for a second . We both know that you ve been enjoying yourself immensely . Hasn t he , Katharine ? "
138950	138953	138954	138954	she	332	" No , "
138957	138974	138954	138954	she	332	" I think he s speaking the truth . He doesn t care much for politics . "
139005	139010	138993	138993	William	175	" I detest politics . "
139011	139025	139027	139027	Cassandra	332	" I don t think any man has the right to say that , "
139032	139043	139044	139044	he	175	" I agree . I mean that I detest politicians , "
139049	139063	139064	139064	Katharine	332	" You see , I believe Cassandra is what they call a Feminist , "
139068	139111	139112	139112	She	332	" Or rather , she was a Feminist six months ago , but it s no good supposing that she is now what she was then . That is one of her greatest charms in my eyes . One never can tell . "
139123	139134	139135	139135	Cassandra	332	" Katharine , you make one feel so horribly small ! "
139138	139150	139151	139151	Rodney	175	" No , no , that s not what she means , "
139154	139179	139151	139151	Rodney	175	" I quite agree that women have an immense advantage over us there . One misses a lot by attempting to know things thoroughly . "
139180	139186	139188	139188	Katharine	332	" He knows Greek thoroughly , "
139190	139221	139188	139188	Katharine	332	" But then he also knows a good deal about painting , and a certain amount about music . He s very cultivated perhaps the most cultivated person I know . "
139222	139226	139227	139227	Cassandra	332	" And poetry , "
139230	139239	139240	139240	Katharine	332	" Yes , I was forgetting his play , "
139293	139296	139297	139297	she	332	" Henry , "
139302	139340	139297	139297	she	332	" would say that a stage ought to be no bigger than this drawing - room . He wants there to be singing and dancing as well as acting only all the opposite of Wagner you understand ? "
139460	139477	139478	139478	she	332	" If anybody says anything , I shall say that I m looking at the river , "
139918	139925	139927	139928	Mr. Hilbery	132	" Ah , there she is , "
139947	139965	139966	139966	he	132	" Come here , Katharine . I couldn t see where you d got to our children , "
139970	140032	139966	139966	he	132	" have their uses I want you to go to my study , Katharine ; go to the third shelf on the right - hand side of the door ; take down Trelawny s Recollections of Shelley ; bring it to me . Then , Peyton , you will have to admit to the assembled company that you have been mistaken . "
140033	140050	140051	140051	Katharine	332	" Trelawny s Recollections of Shelley . The third shelf on the right of the door , "
140085	140090	140092	140092	William	175	" Stop , Katharine , "
140107	140112	140113	140113	He	175	" Let me go . "
140164	140169	140170	140170	she	332	" Are you happy ? "
140173	140179	140180	140180	Cassandra	332	" Oh , my dear ! "
140191	140204	140205	140205	she	332	" Of course , we disagree about every subject under the sun , "
140208	140229	140230	140230	she	332	" but I think he s the cleverest man I ve ever met and you re the most beautiful woman , "
140268	140279	140281	140281	Katharine	332	" Ah , but it s only ten o clock , "
140284	140292	140293	140293	She	332	" As late as that ! Well ? "
140298	140329	140330	140330	Cassandra	332	" At twelve my horses turn into rats and off I go . The illusion fades . But I accept my fate . I make hay while the sun shines . "
140339	140357	140358	140358	she	332	" Here s Katharine talking about rats , and hay , and all sorts of odd things , "
140372	140379	140367	140367	He	175	" Can you make her out ? "
140414	140449	140402	140402	She	332	" I really am off , though . I wish you d explain if they say anything , William . I shan t be late , but I ve got to see some one . "
140450	140457	140458	140458	Cassandra	332	" At this time of night ? "
140461	140469	140470	140470	William	175	" Whom have you got to see ? "
140473	140477	140478	140478	she	332	" A friend , "
140514	140522	140524	140524	William	175	" Katharine has a great many friends , "
140780	140787	140788	140788	Mary	174	" Have you been dining out ? "
140791	140796	140797	140797	Katharine	332	" Are you working ? "
140821	140827	140828	140828	Mary	174	" Well , not exactly , "
140831	140860	140828	140828	Mary	174	" Mr. Basnett had brought some papers to show me . We were going through them , but we d almost done .... Tell us about your party . "
140961	140966	140956	140993	one of that group of " very able young men " suspected by Mr. Clacton , justly as it turned out , of an influence upon Mary Datchet . He had come down from one of the Universities	3266	" very able young men "
141169	141173	141185	141185	societies	3279	" in strictest confidence "
141262	141267	141257	141257	Her	3276	" Am I to understand "
141279	141282	141257	141257	Her	3276	" we . "
141299	141302	141291	141291	she	3276	" we , "
141311	141313	141306	141307	Mr. Basnett	342	" our "
141316	141318	141306	141307	Mr. Basnett	342	" our "
141321	141323	141306	141307	Mr. Basnett	342	" our "
141376	141383	141384	141384	she	3276	" You ve been dining out ? "
141406	141418	141419	141419	Katharine	332	" No , at home . Are you starting something new ? "
141430	141434	141435	141436	Mr. Basnett	342	" We are , "
141444	141456	141457	141457	Mary	342	" I m thinking of leaving our friends in Russell Square , "
141460	141472	141504	141506	no sensible person	3282	" I see . And then you will do something else . "
141473	141483	141485	141485	Mary	342	" Well , I m afraid I like working , "
141487	141490	141492	141493	Mr. Basnett	342	" Afraid , "
141515	141518	141520	141520	Katharine	332	" Yes , "
141531	141551	141520	141520	Katharine	332	" I should like to start something something off one s own bat that s what I should like . "
141552	141560	141562	141563	Mr. Basnett	342	" Yes , that s the fun , "
141580	141593	141595	141595	Mary	342	" But you can t limit work that s what I mean , "
141597	141618	141595	141595	Mary	342	" I mean there are other sorts of work . No one works harder than a woman with little children . "
141619	141623	141625	141626	Mr. Basnett	342	" Quite so , "
141628	141643	141644	141644	He	342	" It s precisely the women with babies we want to get hold of . "
141737	141744	141745	141745	she	332	" When will the public know ? "
141748	141756	141757	141758	Mr. Basnett	342	" What d you mean about us ? "
141766	141773	141775	141775	Mary	342	" That depends upon many things , "
141805	141827	141828	141829	Mr. Basnett	342	" In starting a society such as we wish to start ( we can t say any more at present ) , "
141840	141909	141828	141829	Mr. Basnett	342	" there are two things to remember the Press and the public . Other societies , which shall be nameless , have gone under because they ve appealed only to cranks . If you don t want a mutual admiration society , which dies as soon as you ve all discovered each other s faults , you must nobble the Press . You must appeal to the public . "
141910	141916	141918	141918	Mary	342	" That s the difficulty , "
141921	141929	141931	141932	Mr. Basnett	342	" That s where she comes in , "
141942	141997	141998	141998	he	342	" She s the only one of us who s a capitalist . She can make a whole - time job of it . I m tied to an office ; I can only give my spare time . Are you , by any chance , on the look - out for a job ? "
142011	142019	142020	142020	Mary	342	" Marriage is her job at present , "
142025	142031	142033	142034	Mr. Basnett	342	" Oh , I see , "
142292	142309	142286	142286	she	332	" Well , you ll ask me to join when the time comes , I hope . "
142383	142387	142388	142388	Katharine	332	" Go back , "
142403	142416	142418	142418	Mary	342	" You can t wander about the streets alone in those clothes , "
142486	142492	142493	142493	she	332	" Have you seen Ralph ? "
142500	142503	142505	142505	Katharine	332	" Yes , "
142541	142548	142550	142550	Mary	342	" I believe I m jealous , "
142552	142557	142559	142559	Katharine	332	" Nonsense , Mary , "
142582	142606	142607	142607	Mary	342	" Let me see ; we went to Kew , and we agreed to be friends . Yes , that s what happened . "
142626	142635	142636	142636	Mary	342	" It s not a question of friendship , "
142648	142666	142667	142667	She	332	" You know it s not . How can it be ? I ve no right to interfere "
142670	142680	142681	142681	she	332	" Only I d rather Ralph wasn t hurt , "
142684	142696	142697	142697	Katharine	332	" I think he seems able to take care of himself , "
142716	142726	142728	142728	Mary	342	" Do you really think it s worth it ? "
142734	142740	142741	142741	Katharine	332	" How can one tell ? "
142744	142753	142754	142754	Mary	342	" Have you ever cared for any one ? "
142760	142783	142714	142714	them	3307	" I can t wander about London discussing my feelings Here s a cab no , there s some one in it . "
142784	142792	142794	142794	Mary	342	" We don t want to quarrel , "
142796	142811	142812	142812	Katharine	332	" Ought I to have told him that I wouldn t be his friend ? "
142815	142832	142812	142812	Katharine	332	" Shall I tell him that ? If so , what reason shall I give him ? "
142833	142843	142845	142845	Mary	342	" Of course you can t tell him that , "
142850	142858	142860	142860	Katharine	332	" I believe I shall , though , "
142863	142880	142812	142812	Katharine	332	" I lost my temper , Katharine ; I shouldn t have said what I did . "
142881	142888	142890	142890	Katharine	332	" The whole thing s foolish , "
142894	142907	142908	142908	She	332	" That s what I say . It s not worth it . "
142956	142967	142968	142968	Katharine	332	" No , no , it s not worth it , "
142971	143002	143003	143003	she	332	" Suppose , as you say , it s out of the question this friendship ; he falls in love with me . I don t want that . Still , "
143006	143025	143003	143003	she	332	" I believe you exaggerate ; love s not everything ; marriage itself is only one of the things "
143105	143114	143116	143116	Mary	342	" I don t lay down any rules , "
143133	143151	143152	143152	she	332	" All I say is that you should know what you re about for certain ; but , "
143155	143161	143152	143152	she	332	" I expect you do . "
143232	143238	143240	143240	Katharine	332	" You must go in , "
143245	143259	143240	143240	Katharine	332	" He s waiting all this time to go on with his reading . "
143315	143326	143327	143327	she	332	" I think you underrate the value of that emotion , "
143388	143400	143401	143401	she	332	" Remember , I want to belong to your society remember , "
143536	143546	143547	143547	he	342	" I ll go on where I left off , "
143550	143559	143547	143547	he	342	" Stop me if you want anything explained . "
143860	143863	143864	143864	he	175	" Katharine ! "
143867	143873	143874	143874	he	175	" You ve been out ? "
143877	143885	143856	143856	her	332	" Yes .... Are they still up ? "
143906	143918	143919	143919	he	175	" It s been more wonderful than I can tell you , "
143922	143927	143919	143919	he	175	" I m incredibly happy "
143959	143992	143954	143954	he	175	" But tell me , how did it seem to you ? What did you think , Katharine ? Is there a chance that she likes me ? Tell me , Katharine ! "
144033	144062	144013	144013	He	175	" Good night , Katharine . Go to bed now . I shall see you soon . I hope I shall be able to come to - morrow . "
144125	144135	144136	144136	she	332	" What do you read in bed , Katharine ? "
144147	144154	144156	144156	Katharine	332	" Sometimes one thing sometimes another , "
144164	144174	144175	144175	she	332	" D you know , you re extraordinarily queer , "
144178	144196	144175	144175	she	332	" Every one seems to me a little queer . Perhaps it s the effect of London . "
144197	144204	144205	144205	Katharine	332	" Is William queer , too ? "
144208	144218	144219	144219	Cassandra	332	" Well , I think he is a little , "
144222	144251	144252	144252	she	332	" Queer , but very fascinating . I shall read Milton to - night . It s been one of the happiest nights of my life , Katharine , "
144553	144558	144545	144546	The Hilberys	148	" knew every one , "
145056	145062	145063	145063	she	332	" There s Ralph Denham ! "
145066	145075	145076	145076	she	332	" I told him to meet us here , "
145198	145205	145206	145206	he	175	" One of Katharine s friends , "
145471	145481	145482	145482	Ralph	153	" What have you been doing since we met ? "
145487	145490	145491	145491	she	332	" Doing ? "
145494	145513	145514	145514	she	332	" Walking in and out of other people s houses . I wonder if these animals are happy ? "
145543	145554	145555	145555	Ralph	153	" I m afraid Rodney didn t like my coming , "
145558	145569	145570	145570	she	332	" No . But he ll soon get over that , "
145643	145649	145650	145650	he	153	" The bears seem happy , "
145653	145679	145650	145650	he	153	" But we must buy them a bag of something . There s the place to buy buns . Let s go and get them . "
145736	145742	145744	145744	Ralph	153	" I wish to pay , "
145754	145764	145765	145765	he	153	" I have a reason for what I do , "
145777	145787	145788	145788	she	332	" I believe you have a reason for everything , "
145804	145823	145788	145788	she	332	" but I can t believe it s a good one this time . What is your reason ? "
146275	146291	146269	146269	She	332	" Here you are ! Do prevent William from torturing this unfortunate aye - aye . "
146292	146300	146302	146302	William	175	" We thought we d lost you , "
146360	146368	146369	146369	she	332	" William isn t kind to animals , "
146372	146387	146369	146369	she	332	" He doesn t know what they like and what they don t like . "
146388	146402	146404	146404	Rodney	175	" I take it you re well versed in these matters , Denham , "
146413	146426	146427	146427	Denham	153	" It s mainly a question of knowing how to stroke them , "
146430	146440	146443	146443	him	175	" Which is the way to the Reptile House ? "
146492	146502	146503	146503	William	175	" I hope you ve had a pleasant afternoon , "
146506	146512	146513	146513	she	332	" I like Ralph Denham , "
146516	146521	146522	146522	William	175	" a se voit , "
146548	146556	146544	146544	Katharine	332	" Are you coming back to tea ? "
146557	146573	146574	146574	he	175	" Cassandra and I thought of having tea at a little shop in Portland Place , "
146577	146592	146574	146574	he	175	" I don t know whether you and Denham would care to join us . "
146593	146599	146600	146600	she	332	" I ll ask him , "
146668	146686	146664	146664	William	175	" If you come , I hope you won t do your best to make me ridiculous . "
146687	146702	146703	146703	Katharine	332	" If that s what you re afraid of I certainly shan t come , "
146863	146872	146873	146873	William	175	" You seem to delight in hurting me , "
146876	146890	146892	146892	he	175	" Why did you say that just now about my behavior to animals ? "
146918	146932	146933	146933	she	332	" Because it s true . You never see what any one feels , "
146936	146945	146933	146933	she	332	" You think of no one but yourself . "
146946	146952	146954	146954	William	175	" That is not true , "
147070	147081	147082	147082	he	175	" I don t know what you re laughing at , "
147465	147468	147469	147469	he	153	" Anyhow , "
147472	147490	147469	147469	he	153	" I think we ve seen enough for one afternoon . Where have the others got to ? "
147509	147533	147491	147491	He	153	" We d better be independent of them . The best plan will be for you to come back to tea with me . "
147534	147543	147544	147544	she	3418	" Why shouldn t you come with me ? "
147547	147557	147558	147558	he	153	" Because we re next door to Highgate here , "
147766	147772	147748	147751	the tremulous old lady	3431	" my son s friends , "
147846	147857	147859	147859	Ralph	153	" I must warn you to expect a family party , "
147861	147877	147859	147859	Ralph	153	" They re mostly in on Sundays . We can go to my room afterwards . "
147878	147886	147887	147887	she	3418	" Have you many brothers and sisters ? "
147895	147900	147901	147901	he	153	" Six or seven , "
148029	148037	148038	148038	he	153	" Mother , this is Miss Hilbery , "
148064	148082	148083	148083	she	3437	" I beg your pardon . I thought you were one of my own girls . Dorothy , "
148100	148128	148129	148129	she	3437	" we shall want some more methylated spirits unless the lamp itself is out of order . If one of you could invent a good spirit - lamp "
148298	148369	148288	148289	Mrs. Denham	347	" You see , Miss Hilbery , my children all come in at different hours and want different things . ( The tray should go up if you ve done , Johnnie . ) My boy Charles is in bed with a cold . What else can you expect ? standing in the wet playing football . We did try drawing - room tea , but it didn t do . "
148430	148438	148440	148440	Katharine	332	" It s much nicer like this , "
148563	148569	148570	148570	she	347	" When I first married , "
148573	148615	148570	148570	she	347	" Highgate was quite separate from London , Miss Hilbery , and this house , though you wouldn t believe it , had a view of apple orchards . That was before the Middletons built their house in front of us . "
148616	148632	148634	148634	Katharine	332	" It must be a great advantage to live at the top of a hill , "
148652	148663	148664	148664	she	347	" Yes , indeed , we find it very healthy , "
148726	148737	148739	148739	Hester	349	" The ceiling s fallen down in the pantry again , "
148748	148760	148761	148761	James	328	" The whole house will be down one of these days , "
148764	148767	148769	148770	Mrs. Denham	347	" Nonsense , "
148772	148801	148769	148770	Mrs. Denham	347	" It s only a little bit of plaster I don t see how any house could be expected to stand the wear and tear you give it . "
148822	148832	148833	148833	she	347	" Miss Hilbery s thinking us all so rude , "
149312	149326	149270	149275	these people round the untidy table	3459	" Hullo , Joan ! There s nothing left for you to eat , "
149509	149522	149523	149523	Johnnie	348	" Now , just let me hear you decline amo I love , "
149526	149538	149540	149540	Joan	156	" No , Johnnie , no Greek at meal - times , "
149546	149576	149577	149577	she	156	" She s up at all hours of the night over her books , Miss Hilbery , and I m sure that s not the way to pass examinations , "
149608	149621	149622	149622	Ralph	153	" Joan , you don t really think that amo is Greek ? "
149625	149656	149577	149577	she	156	" Did I say Greek ? Well , never mind . No dead languages at tea - time . My dear boy , don t trouble to make me any toast "
149657	149672	149674	149675	Mrs. Denham	347	" Or if you do , surely there s the toasting - fork somewhere ? "
149690	149701	149702	149702	she	347	" Do one of you ring and ask for one , "
149714	149725	149726	149726	she	347	" But is Ann coming to be with Uncle Joseph ? "
149729	149741	149726	149726	she	347	" If so , surely they had better send Amy to us "
149870	149886	149888	149888	Johnnie	348	" You see , James likes to lie in bed and sleep like a hog , "
149909	149933	149903	149903	his	328	" Because Sundays are my one chance in the week of having my sleep out . Johnnie messes with stinking chemicals in the pantry "
150046	150063	150064	150064	he	153	" Yes , yes , that s what I mean . She s got it right , "
150276	150286	150287	150287	he	153	" Won t you come up to my room ? "
150336	150363	150331	150331	she	332	" The question is , then , at what point is it right for the individual to assert his will against the will of the State . "
150438	150445	150446	150446	she	332	" Your brothers are very clever , "
150449	150460	150446	150446	she	332	" I suppose you re in the habit of arguing ? "
150461	150473	150474	150474	Ralph	153	" James and Johnnie will go on like that for hours , "
150477	150490	150474	150474	Ralph	153	" So will Hester , if you start her upon Elizabethan dramatists . "
150491	150500	150530	150530	sisters	511	" And the little girl with the pigtail ? "
150501	150517	150474	150474	Ralph	153	" Molly ? She s only ten . But they re always arguing among themselves . "
150549	150561	150562	150562	Katharine	332	" I see that it must be difficult to leave them , "
150693	150698	150699	150699	he	153	" My tame rook , "
150703	150713	150699	150699	he	153	" A cat had bitten one of its legs . "
150730	150737	150738	150738	she	332	" You sit here and read ? "
150762	150784	150785	150785	He	153	" The great advantage of Highgate is the view over London . At night the view from my window is splendid . "
150869	150875	150876	150876	she	332	" It must be late , "
150879	150885	150876	150876	she	332	" I must be going . "
150999	151005	151006	151006	he	153	" You ve won again , "
151014	151019	151020	151020	she	332	" I ve won ? "
151028	151040	151041	151041	he	153	" I wish to God I hadn t asked you here , "
151045	151051	151006	151006	he	153	" What do you mean ? "
151052	151090	151091	151091	He	153	" When you re here , it s different I m happy . You ve only to walk to the window you ve only to talk about liberty . When I saw you down there among them all "
151095	151103	151006	151006	he	153	" You thought how ordinary I was . "
151104	151120	151006	151006	he	153	" I tried to think so . But I thought you more wonderful than ever . "
151145	151152	151153	151153	she	332	" I thought you disliked me , "
151156	151162	151163	151163	he	153	" God knows I tried , "
151166	151238	151163	151163	he	153	" I ve done my best to see you as you are , without any of this damned romantic nonsense . That was why I asked you here , and it s increased my folly . When you re gone I shall look out of that window and think of you . I shall waste the whole evening thinking of you . I shall waste my whole life , I believe . "
151262	151282	151283	151283	He	153	" This is what I foretold . We shall gain nothing but unhappiness . Look at me , Ralph . "
151288	151370	151283	151283	He	153	" I assure you that I m far more ordinary than I appear . Beauty means nothing whatever . In fact , the most beautiful women are generally the most stupid . I m not that , but I m a matter - of - fact , prosaic , rather ordinary character ; I order the dinner , I pay the bills , I do the accounts , I wind up the clock , and I never look at a book . "
151371	151374	151375	151375	he	153	" You forget "
151386	151475	151476	151476	she	332	" You come and see me among flowers and pictures , and think me mysterious , romantic , and all the rest of it . Being yourself very inexperienced and very emotional , you go home and invent a story about me , and now you can t separate me from the person you ve imagined me to be . You call that , I suppose , being in love ; as a matter of fact it s being in delusion . All romantic people are the same , "
151479	151513	151476	151476	she	332	" My mother spends her life in making stories about the people she s fond of . But I won t have you do it about me , if I can help it . "
151514	151521	151522	151522	he	3494	" You can t help it , "
151525	151537	151476	151476	she	332	" I warn you it s the source of all evil . "
151538	151544	151545	151545	he	3494	" And of all good , "
151548	151562	151476	151476	she	332	" You ll find out that I m not what you think me . "
151563	151575	151476	151476	she	332	" Perhaps . But I shall gain more than I lose . "
151576	151584	151476	151476	she	332	" If such gain s worth having . "
151592	151602	151603	151603	he	3494	" That may be what we have to face , "
151606	151619	151603	151603	he	3494	" There may be nothing else . Nothing but what we imagine . "
151620	151627	151628	151628	she	3496	" The reason of our loneliness , "
151639	151647	151648	151648	he	3494	" When are you to be married ? "
151658	151672	151603	151603	he	3494	" Not till September , I think . It s been put off . "
151673	151681	151682	151682	he	3494	" You won t be lonely then , "
151685	151727	151728	151728	He	3494	" According to what people say , marriage is a very queer business . They say it s different from anything else . It may be true . I ve known one or two cases where it seems to be true . "
151793	151804	151805	151805	she	3496	" It may be put off even longer than that , "
151814	151842	151805	151805	she	3496	" Some one in the office is ill , and William has to take his place . We may put it off for some time in fact . "
151843	151855	151856	151856	Ralph	153	" That s rather hard on him , isn t it ? "
151859	151865	151866	151866	she	3496	" He has his work , "
151869	151888	151889	151889	she	3496	" He has lots of things that interest him .... I know I ve been to that place , "
151898	151922	151889	151889	she	3496	" But I can t remember where it is oh , of course it s Oxford . Now , what about your cottage ? "
151923	151932	151889	151889	she	3496	" I m not going to take it . "
151933	151940	151941	151941	she	3496	" How you change your mind ! "
151944	151950	151951	151951	he	153	" It s not that , "
151955	151969	151951	151951	he	153	" It s that I want to be where I can see you . "
151970	151985	151986	151986	she	3496	" Our compact is going to hold in spite of all I ve said ? "
151989	152000	152001	152001	he	153	" For ever , so far as I m concerned , "
152004	152042	151951	151951	he	153	" You re going to go on dreaming and imagining and making up stories about me as you walk along the street , and pretending that we re riding in a forest , or landing on an island "
152043	152066	152123	152123	his	153	" No . I shall think of you ordering dinner , paying bills , doing the accounts , showing old ladies the relics "
152067	152072	152073	152073	she	3496	" That s better , "
152076	152096	152073	152073	she	3496	" You can think of me to - morrow morning looking up dates in the Dictionary of National Biography . "
152097	152103	152104	152104	Ralph	153	" And forgetting your purse , "
153254	153259	153224	153224	she	332	" I love her . "
153271	153273	153224	153224	she	332	" love "
153304	153307	153308	153308	he	153	" love , "
153320	153329	153330	153330	he	153	" But I m in love with you ! "
153598	153605	153606	153606	she	3521	" Do you know each other ? "
153637	153646	153648	153648	Mary	342	" We were just going through some papers , "
153650	153675	153676	153676	she	3521	" Mr. Basnett has to help me , because I don t know much about my work yet . It s the new society , "
153679	153693	153676	153676	she	3521	" I m the secretary . I m no longer at Russell Square . "
153711	153717	153719	153719	Ralph	153	" What are your aims ? "
153813	153817	153819	153819	Ralph	153	" I see , "
153826	153833	153834	153834	he	153	" D you know , Mary , "
153838	153853	153834	153834	he	153	" I believe I m in for a cold . Have you any quinine ? "
153927	153936	153937	153937	she	3532	" Of course , I agree with you , "
153951	153978	153939	153939	Ralph	153	" But there s more that might be done . Have you seen Judson , for instance ? You should make a point of getting him . "
153985	153990	153991	153992	Mr. Basnett	342	" Judson s address ? "
154070	154073	154075	154075	Ralph	153	" Mary , "
154090	154093	154094	154094	he	153	" Mary , "
154185	154192	154193	154193	she	332	" What is it , Ralph ? "
154340	154347	154348	154348	she	332	" You ll stay and dine ? "
154357	154360	154361	154361	Ralph	153	" No , "
154399	154407	154408	154408	Ralph	153	" That s a clever young man , "
154416	154525	154526	154526	She	3538	" I m glad you thought so . It s tremendously interesting work , and considering everything , I think we ve done very well . But I m inclined to agree with you ; we ought to try to be more conciliatory . We re absurdly strict . It s difficult to see that there may be sense in what one s opponents say , though they are one s opponents . Horace Basnett is certainly too uncompromising . I mustn t forget to see that he writes that letter to Judson . You re too busy , I suppose , to come on to our committee ? "
154534	154542	154543	154543	Ralph	153	" I may be out of town , "
154552	154562	154563	154563	she	3538	" Our executive meets every week , of course , "
154566	154600	154563	154563	she	3538	" But some of our members don t come more than once a month . Members of Parliament are the worst ; it was a mistake , I think , to ask them . "
154608	154616	154617	154617	she	3538	" You ve not taken your quinine , "
154630	154637	154639	154639	Ralph	153	" I don t want it , "
154642	154649	154650	154650	she	3538	" Well , you know best , "
154654	154662	154663	154663	he	153	" Mary , I m a brute ! "
154666	154683	154663	154663	he	153	" Here I come and waste your time , and do nothing but make myself disagreeable . "
154684	154695	154696	154696	she	3538	" A cold coming on does make one feel wretched , "
154699	154756	154757	154757	He	153	" I ve not got a cold . That was a lie . There s nothing the matter with me . I m mad , I suppose . I ought to have had the decency to keep away . But I wanted to see you I wanted to tell you I m in love , Mary . "
154775	154782	154783	154783	she	3538	" In love , are you ? "
154787	154794	154783	154783	she	3538	" I m glad , Ralph . "
154795	154940	154765	154765	he	153	" I suppose I m in love . Anyhow , I m out of my mind . I can t think , I can t work , I don t care a hang for anything in the world . Good Heavens , Mary ! I m in torment ! One moment I m happy ; next I m miserable . I hate her for half an hour ; then I d give my whole life to be with her for ten minutes ; all the time I don t know what I feel , or why I feel it ; it s insanity , and yet it s perfectly reasonable . Can you make any sense of it ? Can you see what s happened ? I m raving , I know ; don t listen , Mary ; go on with your work . "
155035	155040	155042	155042	Mary	342	" Do sit down , "
155045	155050	155042	155042	Mary	342	" You make me so "
155070	155086	155133	155133	he	153	" You haven t told me her name you d rather not , I suppose ? "
155087	155094	155133	155133	he	153	" Her name ? Katharine Hilbery . "
155095	155100	155133	155133	he	153	" But she s engaged "
155101	155113	155133	155133	he	153	" To Rodney . They re to be married in September . "
155114	155118	155120	155120	Mary	342	" I see , "
155331	155342	155343	155343	she	3541	" Is there anything that I could do for you ? "
155355	155378	155379	155379	He	153	" You could see her no , that s not what I want ; you mustn t bother about me , Mary . "
155387	155400	155401	155401	she	3541	" I m afraid no third person can do anything to help , "
155404	155407	155408	155408	he	153	" No , "
155413	155425	155408	155408	he	153	" Katharine was saying to - day how lonely we are . "
155500	155506	155507	155507	she	3541	" There s always work , "
155518	155527	155528	155528	he	153	" Do you want to be working now ? "
155531	155540	155541	155541	she	3541	" No , no . It s Sunday , "
155544	155595	155541	155541	she	3541	" I was thinking of Katharine . She doesn t understand about work . She s never had to . She doesn t know what work is . I ve only found out myself quite lately . But it s the thing that saves one I m sure of that . "
155596	155606	155607	155607	he	153	" There are other things , aren t there ? "
155610	155618	155619	155619	she	3541	" Nothing that one can count upon , "
155622	155628	155629	155629	she	3541	" After all , other people "
155639	155686	155629	155629	she	3541	" Where should I be now if I hadn t got to go to my office every day ? Thousands of people would tell you the same thing thousands of women . I tell you , work is the only thing that saved me , Ralph . "
155781	155791	155792	155792	she	3541	" It s all turned out splendidly for me , "
155795	155819	155792	155792	she	3541	" It will for you , too . I m sure of that . Because , after all , Katharine is worth it . "
155820	155823	155824	155824	he	153	" Mary ! "
155845	155852	155853	155853	he	153	" Mary , you re splendid , "
157521	157532	157533	157533	he	175	" Goodness , Denham , what are you doing here ? "
158051	158061	158062	158062	he	175	" Did you stay long after we d left ? "
158066	158076	158040	158040	she	332	" No . We went back to my house . "
158103	158111	158112	158112	he	175	" Women are incomprehensible creatures , Denham ! "
158116	158119	158121	158121	Denham	153	" Um , "
158172	158202	158226	158226	he	175	" You say something and they fly into a passion . Or for no reason at all , they laugh . I take it that no amount of education will "
158351	158363	158344	158345	the other	1416	" You couldn t laugh at some one you cared for . "
158399	158404	158344	158345	the other	1416	" You love her . "
158425	158435	158344	158345	the other	1416	" I ve suffered tortures , Denham , tortures ! "
158436	158445	158344	158345	the other	1416	" Yes , yes , I know that . "
158446	158453	158344	158345	the other	1416	" She s laughed at me . "
158454	158459	158344	158345	the other	1416	" Never to me . "
158478	158485	158524	158524	him	175	" How I ve loved her ! "
158560	158579	158524	158524	him	175	" I am in love with Katharine myself . That is why I am here to - night . "
158602	158611	158612	158612	he	175	" Ah , I ve always known it , "
158615	158629	158612	158612	he	175	" I ve known it from the first . You ll marry her ! "
158665	158677	158678	158678	Rodney	175	" My God , Denham , what fools we both are ! "
158926	158933	158908	158908	her	332	" Are you awake , Katharine ? "
158934	158945	158908	158908	her	332	" Yes , I m awake . What is it ? "
158964	158995	158908	158908	her	332	" I couldn t sleep , and I thought I d come and speak to you only for a moment , though . I m going home to - morrow . "
158996	159005	158908	158908	her	332	" Home ? Why , what has happened ? "
159006	159022	158908	158908	her	332	" Something happened to - day which makes it impossible for me to stay here . "
159056	159086	158908	158908	her	332	" I have decided to tell you the whole truth , Katharine . William allowed himself to behave in a way which made me extremely uncomfortable to - day . "
159103	159108	159109	159109	she	332	" At the Zoo ? "
159112	159125	158908	158908	her	332	" No , on the way home . When we had tea . "
159158	159166	159167	159167	she	332	" There s a train at eleven , "
159170	159213	159167	159167	she	332	" I shall tell Aunt Maggie that I have to go suddenly .... I shall make Violet s visit an excuse . But , after thinking it over , I don t see how I can go without telling you the truth . "
159232	159246	159248	159248	Katharine	332	" But I don t see the least reason why you should go , "
159315	159331	159332	159332	Cassandra	332	" Because I can t allow any man to behave to me in that way , "
159339	159353	159336	159336	she	332	" particularly when I know that he is engaged to some one else . "
159354	159364	159365	159365	Katharine	332	" But you like him , don t you ? "
159368	159378	159379	159379	Cassandra	332	" That s got nothing to do with it , "
159383	159396	159379	159379	Cassandra	332	" I consider his conduct , under the circumstances , most disgraceful . "
159431	159443	159428	159428	Katharine	332	" I should say it had everything to do with it , "
159452	159484	159428	159428	Katharine	332	" I don t understand you in the least , Katharine . How can you behave as you behave ? Ever since I came here I ve been amazed by you ! "
159485	159495	159496	159496	Katharine	332	" You ve enjoyed yourself , haven t you ? "
159499	159505	159506	159506	Cassandra	332	" Yes , I have , "
159509	159520	159428	159428	Katharine	332	" Anyhow , my behavior hasn t spoiled your visit . "
159521	159524	159525	159525	Cassandra	332	" No , "
159619	159631	159632	159632	she	332	" Do you think I ve been very foolish about it ? "
159719	159727	159704	159704	Katharine	332	" But do you care for William ? "
159748	159760	159761	159761	Cassandra	332	" Do you mean , am I in love with him ? "
159773	159781	159782	159782	Katharine	332	" Yes , in love with him , "
159785	159798	159799	159799	Cassandra	332	" How can I love the man you re engaged to marry ? "
159803	159812	159742	159742	she	332	" He may be in love with you . "
159813	159829	159830	159830	Cassandra	332	" I don t think you ve any right to say such things , Katharine , "
159833	159865	159830	159830	Cassandra	332	" Why do you say them ? Don t you mind in the least how William behaves to other women ? If I were engaged , I couldn t bear it ! "
159866	159872	159874	159874	Katharine	332	" We re not engaged , "
159880	159883	159884	159884	Cassandra	332	" Katharine ! "
159887	159895	159896	159896	Katharine	332	" No , we re not engaged , "
159899	159908	159896	159896	Katharine	332	" But no one knows it but ourselves . "
159909	159921	159922	159922	Cassandra	332	" But why I don t understand you re not engaged ! "
159926	159949	159922	159922	Cassandra	332	" Oh , that explains it ! You re not in love with him ! You don t want to marry him ! "
159950	159962	159964	159964	Katharine	332	" We aren t in love with each other any longer , "
159976	159992	159993	159993	Cassandra	332	" How queer , how strange , how unlike other people you are , Katharine , "
160023	160032	159996	159996	her	332	" You re not in love with him ? "
160033	160039	160041	160041	Katharine	332	" But I love him , "
160102	160111	160112	160112	she	332	" D you know what time it is ? "
160182	160195	160196	160196	Cassandra	332	" There s no reason why I should go home , then ? "
160201	160221	160196	160196	Cassandra	332	" Unless you want me to go , Katharine ? What _ do _ you want me to do ? "
160230	160239	160240	160240	Cassandra	332	" You wanted us to fall in love , "
160330	160335	160337	160338	the maid	517	" Please , miss , "
160349	160357	160337	160338	the maid	517	" Mrs. Milvain is in the kitchen . "
160444	160451	160433	160434	the maid	517	" You know what that means . "
160457	160465	160466	160466	Katharine	332	" Aunt Celia is in the kitchen , "
160469	160475	160476	160476	Cassandra	332	" Why in the kitchen ? "
160482	160490	160491	160491	Katharine	332	" Probably because she s discovered something , "
160505	160509	160510	160510	she	332	" About us ? "
160513	160517	160518	160518	Katharine	332	" Heaven knows , "
160521	160541	160518	160518	Katharine	332	" I shan t let her stay in the kitchen , though . I shall bring her up here . "
160566	160573	160574	160574	Cassandra	332	" For goodness sake , Katharine , "
160587	160604	160574	160574	Cassandra	332	" don t be rash . Don t let her suspect . Remember , nothing s certain "
160776	160792	160793	160793	she	217	" I ve something that I want to say to you in _ private _ , "
160805	160812	160793	160793	she	217	" The drawing - room is empty "
160813	160830	160831	160832	Mrs. Milvain	217	" But we might meet your mother upon the stairs . We might disturb your father , "
160910	160916	160917	160917	she	217	" Nobody will overhear us ? "
160933	160942	160943	160943	she	217	" I see that I have interrupted you , "
160961	160969	160958	160958	she	217	" Was some one sitting with you ? "
160981	160993	160995	160995	Katharine	332	" Cassandra was helping me to put the flowers in water , "
161032	161041	161042	161042	she	217	" Ah , Cassandra is still with you , "
161045	161055	161042	161042	she	217	" And did William send you those lovely flowers ? "
161156	161163	161165	161165	Katharine	332	" They re from Stogdon House , "
161235	161279	161219	161220	Mrs. Milvain	217	" People are talking about you , Katharine . That is why I have come this morning . You forgive me for saying what I d much rather not say ? What I say is only for your own sake , my child . "
161280	161291	161293	161293	Katharine	332	" There s nothing to forgive yet , Aunt Celia , "
161300	161380	161293	161293	Katharine	332	" People are saying that William goes everywhere with you and Cassandra , and that he is always paying her attentions . At the Markhams dance he sat out five dances with her . At the Zoo they were seen alone together . They left together . They never came back here till seven in the evening . But that is not all . They say his manner is very marked he is quite different when she is there . "
161509	161512	161513	161513	she	332	" Well ? "
161536	161577	161513	161513	she	332	" We all know how good you are how unselfish how you sacrifice yourself to others . But you ve been too unselfish , Katharine . You have made Cassandra happy , and she has taken advantage of your goodness . "
161578	161587	161589	161589	Katharine	332	" I don t understand , Aunt Celia , "
161591	161597	161589	161589	Katharine	332	" What has Cassandra done ? "
161598	161613	161615	161616	Mrs. Milvain	217	" Cassandra has behaved in a way that I could not have thought possible , "
161619	161637	161615	161616	Mrs. Milvain	217	" She has been utterly selfish utterly heartless . I must speak to her before I go . "
161638	161644	161645	161645	Katharine	332	" I don t understand , "
161684	161692	161674	161674	She	217	" Cassandra has stolen William s love . "
161703	161708	161710	161710	Katharine	332	" Do you mean , "
161712	161722	161710	161710	Katharine	332	" that he has fallen in love with her ? "
161723	161740	161752	161752	she	217	" There are ways of _ making _ men fall in love with one , Katharine . "
161756	161811	161752	161752	she	217	" Nothing would have made me say these things but your own good . I have not wished to interfere ; I have not wished to give you pain . I am a useless old woman . I have no children of my own . I only want to see you happy , Katharine . "
161824	161836	161838	161838	Katharine	332	" You are not going to say these things to Cassandra , "
161841	161853	161838	161838	Katharine	332	" You ve said them to me ; that s enough . "
161884	161896	161897	161897	she	332	" I ve made you angry ! I knew I should ! "
161935	161938	161940	161940	Katharine	332	" Yes , "
161945	161977	161940	161940	Katharine	332	" I m so angry that I don t want to say anything more . I think you d better go , Aunt Celia . We don t understand each other . "
162054	162058	162059	162059	she	217	" Married love , "
162069	162130	162059	162059	she	217	" is the most sacred of all loves . The love of husband and wife is the most holy we know . That is the lesson Mamma s children learnt from her ; that is what they can never forget . I have tried to speak as she would have wished her daughter to speak . You are her grandchild . "
162149	162163	162164	162164	she	217	" I don t see that there is any excuse for your behavior , "
162408	162416	162394	162394	he	175	" These are for you , Katharine . "
162588	162593	162594	162594	she	217	" I must go , "
162682	162690	162691	162691	he	175	" I ve come to be forgiven , "
162694	162722	162691	162691	he	175	" Our quarrel was perfectly hateful to me . I ve not slept all night . You re not angry with me , are you , Katharine ? "
162778	162786	162787	162787	she	332	" She s been spying upon us , "
162790	162801	162787	162787	she	332	" following us about London , overhearing what people are saying "
162802	162806	162807	162807	Rodney	175	" Mrs. Milvain ? "
162810	162817	162807	162807	Rodney	175	" What has she told you ? "
162826	162849	162787	162787	she	332	" Oh , people are saying that you re in love with Cassandra , and that you don t care for me . "
162850	162856	162857	162857	he	175	" They have seen us ? "
162860	162872	162787	162787	she	332	" Everything we ve done for a fortnight has been seen . "
162873	162881	162882	162882	he	175	" I told you that would happen ! "
162933	162941	162942	162942	he	175	" It s all been a mistake , "
162945	162979	162942	162942	he	175	" I blame myself for it . I should have known better . I let you persuade me in a moment of madness . I beg you to forget my insanity , Katharine . "
162980	162988	162989	162989	Katharine	332	" She wished even to persecute Cassandra ! "
162998	163017	162989	162989	Katharine	332	" She threatened to speak to her . She s capable of it she s capable of anything ! "
163018	163058	163067	163067	he	175	" Mrs. Milvain is not tactful , I know , but you exaggerate , Katharine . People are talking about us . She was right to tell us . It only confirms my own feeling the position is monstrous . "
163070	163082	163083	163083	she	332	" You don t mean that this influences you , William ? "
163088	163092	163093	163093	he	175	" It does , "
163098	163124	163125	163125	He	175	" It s intensely disagreeable to me . I can t endure that people should gossip about us . And then there s your cousin Cassandra "
163130	163139	163140	163140	he	175	" I came here this morning , Katharine , "
163149	163205	163140	163140	he	175	" to ask you to forget my folly , my bad temper , my inconceivable behavior . I came , Katharine , to ask whether we can t return to the position we were in before this this season of lunacy . Will you take me back , Katharine , once more and for ever ? "
163314	163326	163327	163327	she	332	" I was as much to blame as you were yesterday , "
163335	163367	163327	163327	she	332	" I confess , William , the sight of you and Cassandra together made me jealous , and I couldn t control myself . I laughed at you , I know . "
163368	163372	163373	163373	William	175	" You jealous ! "
163376	163455	163373	163373	William	175	" I assure you , Katharine , you ve not the slightest reason to be jealous . Cassandra dislikes me , so far as she feels about me at all . I was foolish enough to try to explain the nature of our relationship . I couldn t resist telling her what I supposed myself to feel for her . She refused to listen , very rightly . But she left me in no doubt of her scorn . "
163507	163512	163513	163513	Rodney	175	" She charmed me , "
163516	163573	163513	163513	Rodney	175	" I thought I loved her . But that s a thing of the past . It s all over , Katharine . It was a dream an hallucination . We were both equally to blame , but no harm s done if you believe how truly I care for you . Say you believe me ! "
163761	163768	163769	163769	he	175	" Yes , yes , yes , "
163772	163783	163769	163769	he	175	" you accept me , Katharine . You love me . "
163797	163806	163794	163794	her	332	" Cassandra loves you more than I do . "
163807	163810	163811	163811	he	175	" Cassandra ? "
163814	163819	163820	163820	Katharine	332	" She loves you , "
163835	163840	163823	163823	She	332	" She loves you . "
163994	163999	164000	164000	she	332	" Yes , yes , "
164009	164022	164000	164000	she	332	" it s true . I know what she feels for you . "
164023	164028	163972	163976	the most admired of women	3685	" She loves me ? "
164032	164073	164000	164000	she	332	" Ah , but who knows what I feel ? How can I be sure of my feeling myself ? Ten minutes ago I asked you to marry me . I still wish it I don t know what I wish "
164089	164098	164082	164082	He	175	" Tell me what you feel for Denham . "
164099	164104	164105	164105	she	332	" For Ralph Denham ? "
164108	164111	164112	164112	she	332	" Yes ! "
164128	164168	164112	164112	she	332	" You re jealous of me , William ; but you re not in love with me . I m jealous of you . Therefore , for both our sakes , I say , speak to Cassandra at once . "
164224	164229	164230	164230	he	175	" You re right , "
164251	164256	164230	164230	he	175	" I love Cassandra . "
164280	164287	164288	164288	she	332	" I have overheard every word ! "
164305	164320	164297	164297	Rodney	175	" Then you know what I wish to ask you . Give me your answer "
164341	164346	164347	164347	she	332	" What Katharine said , "
164350	164353	164354	164354	she	332	" But , "
164375	164404	164354	164354	she	332	" how frightfully difficult it all is ! Our feelings , I mean yours and mine and Katharine s. Katharine , tell me , are we doing right ? "
164405	164414	164415	164415	William	175	" Right of course we re doing right , "
164419	164440	164415	164415	William	175	" if , after what you ve heard , you can marry a man of such incomprehensible confusion , such deplorable "
164441	164447	164448	164448	Katharine	332	" Don t , William , "
164451	164473	164448	164448	Katharine	332	" Cassandra has heard us ; she can judge what we are ; she knows better than we could tell her . "
164531	164541	164542	164542	she	332	" I must be first with him , Katharine ! "
164545	164555	164542	164542	she	332	" I can t share him even with you . "
164556	164563	164565	164565	Katharine	332	" I shall never ask that , "
164585	164593	164594	164594	Cassandra	332	" But you ve shared with me , "
164597	164618	164619	164619	she	332	" Why can t I share with you ? Why am I so mean ? I know why it is , "
164622	164643	164619	164619	she	332	" We understand each other , William and I. You ve never understood each other . You re too different . "
164644	164652	164653	164653	William	175	" I ve never admired anybody more , "
164656	164661	164662	164662	Cassandra	332	" It s not that "
164667	164672	164619	164619	she	332	" it s understanding . "
164673	164688	164619	164619	she	332	" Have I never understood you , Katharine ? Have I been very selfish ? "
164689	164692	164693	164693	Cassandra	332	" Yes , "
164696	164745	164693	164693	Cassandra	332	" You ve asked her for sympathy , and she s not sympathetic ; you ve wanted her to be practical , and she s not practical . You ve been selfish ; you ve been exacting and so has Katharine but it wasn t anybody s fault . "
164786	164792	164793	164793	she	332	" It s quite true , "
164796	164803	164793	164793	she	332	" It was nobody s fault . "
164804	164818	164819	164819	Cassandra	332	" There are many things that he ll always come to you for , "
164829	164864	164819	164819	Cassandra	332	" I accept that , Katharine . I shall never dispute it . I want to be generous as you ve been generous . But being in love makes it more difficult for me . "
164876	164885	164886	164886	he	175	" One thing I beg of you both , "
164902	164950	164897	164897	he	175	" We will never discuss these matters again . It s not that I m timid and conventional , as you think , Katharine . It s that it spoils things to discuss them ; it unsettles people s minds ; and now we re all so happy "
164986	164993	164994	164994	she	332	" Yes , I m happy , "
164998	165011	164994	164994	she	332	" And I agree . We will never talk about it again . "
165012	165019	165020	165020	Cassandra	332	" Oh , Katharine , Katharine ! "
165154	165159	165150	165150	she	128	" The Duchess of Malfi "
165505	165510	165511	165511	she	332	" What is it ? "
165568	165574	165575	165575	he	175	" There he is again , "
165578	165588	165575	165575	he	175	" Look , there under the lamp - post . "
165697	165700	165702	165702	Rodney	175	" Denham , "
165704	165712	165713	165713	He	175	" He was there last night too . "
165762	165768	165769	165769	she	332	" If he chooses to come "
165773	165791	165792	165792	Rodney	175	" You can t let him wait out there . I shall tell him to come in . "
165821	165824	165825	165825	she	332	" Wait ! "
165828	165835	165825	165825	she	332	" I don t allow you . "
165836	165842	165843	165843	he	175	" You can t wait , "
165846	165853	165854	165854	His	175	" You ve gone too far . "
165861	165870	165871	165871	he	175	" Why don t you admit , Katharine , "
165889	165906	165871	165871	he	175	" that you love him ? Are you going to treat him as you treated me ? "
165928	165937	165938	165938	she	332	" I forbid you to draw the curtain , "
165951	165959	165960	165960	he	175	" I ve no right to interfere , "
165963	165985	165960	165960	he	175	" I ll leave you . Or , if you like , we ll go back to the drawing - room . "
165986	165995	165996	165996	she	332	" No . I can t go back , "
166010	166017	166018	166018	Rodney	175	" You love him , Katharine , "
166055	166060	166061	166061	she	332	" I love him ? "
166136	166139	166140	166140	she	332	" Now , "
166193	166199	166200	166200	she	332	" He s not there ! "
166248	166251	166252	166252	William	175	" Denham ! "
166255	166258	166260	166260	Katharine	332	" Ralph ! "
166331	166334	166325	166325	his	153	" Rodney ! "
166335	166345	166346	166346	Rodney	175	" There you are ! Come in , Denham . "
166356	166361	166362	166362	he	175	" Here he is , "
166467	166479	166480	166480	he	175	" You re the first to hear the news , Denham , "
166483	166495	166480	166480	he	175	" Katharine isn t going to marry me , after all . "
166496	166501	166462	166462	he	175	" Where shall I put "
166595	166602	166604	166604	Katharine	332	" William is engaged to Cassandra , "
166671	166676	166678	166678	Denham	153	" I congratulate you , "
166680	166697	166698	166698	he	175	" Yes , yes . We re all mad quite out of our minds , Denham , "
166701	166711	166698	166698	he	175	" It s partly Katharine s doing partly mine . "
166739	166743	166744	166744	he	175	" Quite mad , "
166747	166750	166744	166744	he	175	" Even Katharine "
166783	166788	166789	166789	he	175	" Katharine shall explain , "
166896	166904	166905	166905	she	332	" Why were you waiting out there ? "
166908	166916	166917	166917	he	175	" For the chance of seeing you , "
166920	166956	166894	166894	them	3736	" You would have waited all night if it hadn t been for William . It s windy too . You must have been cold . What could you see ? Nothing but our windows . "
166957	166969	167008	167008	her	332	" It was worth it . I heard you call me . "
166970	166975	166976	166976	She	332	" I called you ? "
166981	166988	166989	166989	she	332	" They were engaged this morning , "
166997	167002	167003	167003	he	175	" You re glad ? "
167011	167016	167017	167017	she	332	" Yes , yes , "
167020	167036	167037	167037	Ralph	153	" But you don t know how good he is what he s done for me "
167044	167052	167053	167053	she	332	" You waited there last night too ? "
167056	167063	167064	167064	Denham	153	" Yes . I can wait , "
167121	167127	167128	167128	she	332	" Waiting in the dark , "
167145	167152	167128	167128	she	332	" Ah , but it s different "
167157	167174	167153	167153	She	332	" I m not the person you think me . Until you realize that it s impossible "
167257	167264	167265	167265	he	153	" No , you re right , "
167268	167281	167265	167265	he	153	" I don t know you . I ve never known you . "
167282	167294	167295	167295	she	332	" Yet perhaps you know me better than any one else , "
167373	167383	167384	167384	he	153	" I say I do know you , Katharine , "
167391	167402	167384	167384	he	153	" It s only for moments that I go mad . "
167403	167413	167358	167366	a man with a voluminous white shirt - collar	3745	" Do you call two whole nights a moment ? "
167414	167461	167384	167384	he	153	" I swear to you that now , at this instant , I see you precisely as you are . No one has ever known you as I know you .... Could you have taken down that book just now if I hadn t known you ? "
167462	167467	167468	167468	she	3746	" That s true , "
167471	167531	167532	167532	she	3746	" but you can t think how I m divided how I m at my ease with you , and how I m bewildered . The unreality the dark the waiting outside in the wind yes , when you look at me , not seeing me , and I don t see you either .... But I do see , "
167544	167553	167532	167532	she	3746	" heaps of things , only not you . "
167554	167561	167562	167562	he	3747	" Tell me what you see , "
167623	167626	167627	167627	she	3746	" Impossible , "
167644	167649	167650	167650	Ralph	153	" Try , Katharine , "
167654	167675	167676	167676	She	3746	" But I can t I m talking a sort of nonsense the sort of nonsense one talks to oneself . "
167690	167703	167704	167704	she	3746	" I was thinking about a mountain in the North of England , "
167707	167718	167704	167704	she	3746	" It s too silly I won t go on . "
167719	167725	167726	167726	he	3747	" We were there together ? "
167730	167737	167738	167738	She	3746	" No . I was alone . "
167753	167760	167704	167704	she	3746	" You re always alone there ? "
167761	167767	167768	167768	She	3746	" I can t explain . "
167779	167806	167768	167768	She	3746	" It s not a mountain in the North of England . It s an imagination a story one tells oneself . You have yours too ? "
167807	167826	167773	167773	she	3746	" You re with me in mine . You re the thing I make up , you see . "
167827	167833	167834	167834	she	3746	" Oh , I see , "
167837	167846	167834	167834	she	3746	" That s why it s so impossible . "
167854	167862	167863	167863	she	3746	" You must try to stop it , "
167866	167871	167872	167872	he	3752	" I won t , "
167876	167879	167872	167872	he	3752	" because I "
168009	168017	168018	168018	he	3752	" Because I love you , Katharine , "
168182	168189	168190	168190	he	3752	" You don t believe me ? "
168205	168224	168225	168225	she	332	" As far as I understand you but what should you advise me to do with this ring ? "
168232	168245	168246	168246	he	3752	" I should advise you to let me keep it for you , "
168259	168280	168193	168193	His	3752	" After what you ve said , I can hardly trust you unless you ll unsay what you ve said ? "
168281	168293	168350	168350	him	3752	" Very well . I m not in love with you . "
168294	168313	168314	168314	she	332	" But I think you _ are _ in love with me .... As I am with you , "
168319	168323	168324	168324	she	332	" At least , "
168335	168346	168324	168324	she	332	" what other word describes the state we re in ? "
168362	168381	168382	168382	he	3752	" It s when I m with you that I doubt it , not when I m alone , "
168385	168390	168391	168391	she	332	" So I thought , "
168428	168438	168439	168439	she	332	" And then you went raving about the streets , "
168442	168488	168489	168489	she	332	" Well , it s bad enough . But my state is worse than yours , because it hasn t anything to do with facts . It s an hallucination , pure and simple an intoxication .... One can be in love with pure reason ? "
168492	168515	168489	168489	she	332	" Because if you re in love with a vision , I believe that that s what I m in love with . "
168550	168561	168562	168562	he	153	" Rodney seems to know his own mind well enough , "
168597	168607	168608	168608	she	332	" Cassandra never doubted for a moment . But we "
168619	168628	168608	168608	she	332	" we see each other only now and then "
168629	168635	168608	168608	she	332	" Like lights in a storm "
168636	168644	168645	168645	she	332	" In the midst of a hurricane , "
168767	168777	168778	168778	she	332	" Please don t let me interrupt you , Mr. "
168801	168812	168813	168813	she	332	" I hope you ve found something nice to read , "
168824	168839	168840	168840	she	332	" Byron ah , Byron . I ve known people who knew Lord Byron , "
168933	168945	168946	168946	Katharine	332	" My dear mother , why aren t you in bed ? "
168966	168973	168946	168946	Katharine	332	" Why are you wandering about ? "
168974	168991	168993	168994	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" I m sure I should like your poetry better than I like Lord Byron s , "
169000	169019	169020	169020	Katharine	332	" Mr. Denham doesn t write poetry ; he has written articles for father , for the Review , "
169029	169036	169037	169038	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Oh dear ! How dull ! "
169071	169092	169093	169094	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" But I m sure you read poetry at night . I always judge by the expression of the eyes , "
169098	169105	169106	169106	she	128	" The windows of the soul , "
169111	169121	169122	169122	she	128	" I don t know much about the law , "
169126	169159	169160	169160	she	128	" though many of my relations were lawyers . Some of them looked very handsome , too , in their wigs . But I think I do know a little about poetry , "
169163	169176	169177	169177	She	128	" And all the things that aren t written down , but but "
169195	169219	169220	169220	she	128	" The night and the stars , the dawn coming up , the barges swimming past , the sun setting .... Ah dear , "
169223	169253	169220	169220	she	128	" well , the sunset is very lovely too . I sometimes think that poetry isn t so much what we write as what we feel , Mr. Denham . "
169421	169433	169434	169434	she	128	" Tell me , shall we ever do without it all ? "
169539	169550	169515	169516	her mother	377	" Please find out the best way of getting there , "
169555	169585	169515	169516	her mother	377	" and wire to dear Sir John Burdett to expect me , with my love . I ve been dreaming all night of you and Shakespeare , dearest Katharine . "
170078	170087	170088	170088	she	332	" Doesn t everything look odd this morning ? "
170091	170109	170088	170088	she	332	" Are you really going to spend the morning with those dull old letters , because if so "
170158	170162	170154	170154	she	332	" History of England "
170211	170219	170229	170229	herself	332	" I wonder what he was like ? "
170232	170248	170249	170249	Cassandra	332	" Oh , a fraud like the rest of them at least Henry says so , "
170252	170262	170263	170263	she	332	" Though I don t believe everything Henry says , "
170307	170317	170318	170318	Katharine	332	" Must you read Macaulay s History , Cassandra ? "
170328	170332	170333	170333	Cassandra	332	" I must , "
170337	170353	170284	170284	his	132	" Well , I m going to leave you to look for it by yourself . "
170354	170396	170284	170284	his	132	" Oh , no , Katharine . Please stay and help me . You see you see I told William I d read a little every day . And I want to tell him that I ve begun when he comes . "
170397	170403	170404	170404	Katharine	332	" When does William come ? "
170413	170422	170284	170284	his	132	" To tea , if that suits you ? "
170423	170437	170284	170284	his	132	" If it suits me to be out , I suppose you mean . "
170438	170450	170284	170284	his	132	" Oh , you re horrid .... Why shouldn t you ? "
170451	170454	170284	170284	his	132	" Yes ? "
170455	170464	170284	170284	his	132	" Why shouldn t you be happy too ? "
170465	170471	170472	170472	Katharine	332	" I am quite happy , "
170475	170484	170485	170485	she	332	" I mean as I am . Katharine , "
170489	170500	170485	170485	she	332	" do let s be married on the same day . "
170501	170507	170284	170284	his	132	" To the same man ? "
170508	170525	170485	170485	she	332	" Oh , no , no . But why shouldn t you marry some one else ? "
170526	170532	170534	170534	Katharine	332	" Here s your Macaulay , "
170545	170568	170534	170534	Katharine	332	" I should say you d better begin to read at once if you mean to be educated by tea - time . "
170569	170574	170576	170576	Cassandra	332	" Damn Lord Macaulay ! "
170585	170592	170576	170576	Cassandra	332	" Would you rather not talk ? "
170593	170600	170601	170601	Katharine	332	" We ve talked enough already , "
170605	170618	170620	170620	Cassandra	332	" I know I shan t be able to settle to Macaulay , "
170660	170668	170669	170669	she	332	" Have _ you _ read Macaulay ? "
170672	170682	170684	170684	she	332	" No . William never tried to educate me . "
170737	170743	170744	170744	she	332	" We weren t serious , "
170748	170755	170757	170757	Cassandra	332	" But I m fearfully serious , "
170955	170960	170961	170961	she	332	" Was that him ? "
170964	170970	170971	170971	Katharine	332	" It was Ralph Denham , "
170974	170980	170938	170938	she	332	" I meant Ralph Denham . "
170981	170998	170961	170961	she	332	" Why did you mean Ralph Denham ? What has William told you about Ralph Denham ? "
171032	171045	171046	171046	she	332	" Now , when are you and William going to be married ? "
171181	171261	171149	171149	he	321	" ... a thousand pities ahem I fear we shall cause a great deal of natural annoyance . If , on the other hand , what I have reason to think will happen , should happen within reasonable time , and the present position is not in any way offensive to you , delay would , in my opinion , serve all our interests better than a premature explanation , which is bound to cause more surprise than is desirable "
171262	171267	171268	171268	Katharine	332	" Very like William , "
171289	171296	171297	171297	Cassandra	332	" I quite understand his feelings , "
171300	171331	171297	171297	Cassandra	332	" I quite agree with them . I think it would be much better , if you intend to marry Mr. Denham , that we should wait as William says . "
171332	171353	171377	171377	she	332	" But , then , if I don t marry him for months or , perhaps , not at all ? "
171422	171437	171371	171371	she	332	" I m Ralph Denham speaking . I m in my right senses now . "
171438	171448	171371	171371	she	332	" How long did you wait outside the house ? "
171449	171464	171371	171371	she	332	" I went home and wrote you a letter . I tore it up . "
171465	171473	171371	171371	she	332	" I shall tear up everything too . "
171474	171479	171371	171371	she	332	" I shall come . "
171480	171488	171371	171371	she	332	" Yes . Come to - day . "
171489	171495	171371	171371	she	332	" I must explain to you "
171496	171502	171371	171371	she	332	" Yes . We must explain "
171520	171523	171508	171508	Ralph	153	" Nothing . "
171665	171702	171655	171655	She	332	" If you don t want to tell people yourselves , I ll do it for you . I know William has feelings about these matters that make it very difficult for him to do anything . "
171703	171715	171717	171717	Cassandra	332	" Because he s fearfully sensitive about other people s feelings , "
171719	171738	171717	171717	Cassandra	332	" The idea that he could upset Aunt Maggie or Uncle Trevor would make him ill for weeks . "
171768	171775	171776	171776	she	332	" Yes , you re right , "
171779	171821	171758	171758	she	332	" And then he worships beauty . He wants life to be beautiful in every part of it . Have you ever noticed how exquisitely he finishes everything ? Look at the address on that envelope . Every letter is perfect . "
171884	171887	171888	171888	she	332	" Yes , "
171891	171896	171888	171888	she	332	" he loves beauty . "
171897	171908	171910	171910	Cassandra	332	" I hope we shall have a great many children , "
171912	171917	171910	171910	Cassandra	332	" He loves children . "
172046	172051	172042	172042	Cassandra	332	" History of England . "
172214	172222	172208	172208	Cassandra	332	" How like Aunt Maggie you look ! "
172223	172226	172228	172228	Katharine	332	" Nonsense , "
172759	172766	172755	172755	he	321	" Has Katharine spoken to you ? "
172767	172792	172755	172755	he	321	" Yes . But she says she s not engaged . She doesn t seem to think she s ever going to be engaged . "
172800	172819	172820	172820	Cassandra	332	" They telephoned this morning , and she behaves very oddly . She forgets to help the pudding , "
172828	172859	172820	172820	Cassandra	332	" My dear child , after what I saw and heard last night , it s not a question of guessing or suspecting . Either she s engaged to him or "
172948	172958	172945	172945	Cassandra	332	" Don t you think everything looks quite different ? "
172959	172966	172967	172967	he	321	" You ve moved the sofa ? "
172970	172978	172980	172980	Katharine	332	" No . Nothing s been touched , "
172982	172989	172992	172992	she	332	" Everything s exactly the same . "
173163	173172	173155	173155	she	332	" Then I m afraid I must go . "
173193	173200	173201	173201	Cassandra	332	" Well , she IS queer ! "
173247	173259	173260	173260	she	332	" If I m late , don t wait for me , "
173263	173269	173260	173260	she	332	" I shall have dined , "
173278	173283	173284	173284	William	321	" But she can t "
173292	173305	173284	173284	William	321	" not without any gloves and bread and butter in her hand ! "
173328	173338	173339	173339	Cassandra	332	" She must have gone to meet Mr. Denham , "
173342	173346	173347	173347	William	321	" Goodness knows ! "
173372	173383	173385	173385	Cassandra	332	" It s the sort of way Aunt Maggie behaves , "
173408	173417	173418	173418	he	321	" This is what I ve been foretelling , "
173422	173458	173418	173418	he	321	" Once set the ordinary conventions aside Thank Heaven Mrs. Hilbery is away . But there s Mr. Hilbery . How are we to explain it to him ? I shall have to leave you . "
173459	173472	173473	173473	Cassandra	332	" But Uncle Trevor won t be back for hours , William ! "
173476	173529	173418	173418	he	321	" You never can tell . He may be on his way already . Or suppose Mrs. Milvain your Aunt Celia or Mrs. Cosham , or any other of your aunts or uncles should be shown in and find us alone together . You know what they re saying about us already . "
173551	173556	173557	173557	she	332	" We might hide , "
173573	173583	173585	173585	William	321	" I refuse entirely to get under the table , "
173770	173776	173759	173759	William	321	" unless it bored her ? "
174854	174877	174879	174879	she	332	" I came to meet you and I have missed you . I could not face William and Cassandra . They want us "
174882	174890	174891	174891	she	332	" They insist that we are engaged , "
174894	174909	174891	174891	she	332	" and we couldn t talk at all , or explain anything . I want "
174970	174979	174980	174980	she	332	" ... to say all kinds of things , "
175929	175934	175935	175935	Katharine	332	" Yes , yes , "
175951	175957	175905	175922	a person who has come on an errand of such importance that it must be broached without preface	3931	" Have you had tea ? "
175958	175962	175963	175963	she	332	" Oh yes , "
176011	176029	176000	176000	Katharine	332	" Don t light the fire for me .... I want to know Ralph Denham s address . "
176050	176061	176062	176062	Mary	342	" The Apple Orchard , Mount Ararat Road , Highgate , "
176071	176078	176079	176079	Katharine	332	" Oh , I remember now ! "
176089	176102	176079	176079	Katharine	332	" I suppose it wouldn t take twenty minutes to drive there ? "
176116	176124	176126	176126	Mary	342	" But you won t find him , "
176152	176159	176160	176160	she	332	" Why ? Where is he ? "
176163	176172	176150	176150	her	332	" He won t have left his office . "
176173	176181	176182	176182	she	332	" But he has left the office , "
176185	176233	176182	176182	she	332	" The only question is will he have reached home yet ? He went to see me at Chelsea ; I tried to meet him and missed him . He will have found no message to explain . So I must find him as soon as possible . "
176243	176249	176250	176250	she	332	" But why not telephone ? "
176270	176282	176283	176283	she	332	" Of course ! Why didn t I think of that ! "
176360	176366	176445	176445	she	332	" Has Mr. Denham called ? "
176367	176372	176445	176445	she	332	" Yes , miss . "
176373	176380	176445	176445	she	332	" Did he ask for me ? "
176381	176392	176445	176445	she	332	" Yes . We said you were out , miss . "
176393	176400	176445	176445	she	332	" Did he leave any message ? "
176401	176415	176445	176445	she	332	" No . He went away . About twenty minutes ago , miss . "
176454	176457	176445	176445	she	332	" Mary . "
176475	176478	176479	176479	she	3936	" Yes , "
176482	176490	176479	176479	she	3936	" I shan t be a moment . "
176636	176645	176627	176627	She	332	" Well , did you get an answer ? "
176646	176653	176654	176654	Katharine	332	" He has left Chelsea already , "
176657	176667	176669	176669	Mary	342	" Still , he won t be home yet , "
176696	176710	176711	176711	Mary	342	" I ll ring up his home and ask whether he s back . "
176727	176740	176711	176711	Mary	342	" No . His sister says he hasn t come back yet . "
176741	176744	176745	176745	She	332	" Ah ! "
176755	176770	176745	176745	She	332	" They ve had a message . He won t be back to dinner . "
176771	176780	176711	176711	Mary	342	" Then what is he going to do ? "
176838	176845	176834	176834	Mary	342	" I really don t know . "
176886	176893	176894	176894	Mary	342	" Possibly he may come here , "
176906	176925	176926	176926	She	332	" It would be worth your while to wait if you want to see him to - night . "
176950	176958	176959	176959	she	332	" I ll wait half an hour , "
177099	177107	177109	177109	Katharine	332	" What would be the time now ? "
177122	177131	177133	177133	Mary	342	" I m going to get dinner ready , "
177140	177146	177148	177148	Katharine	332	" Then I ll go , "
177150	177162	177170	177170	her	332	" Why don t you stay ? Where are you going ? "
177176	177183	177184	177184	she	332	" Perhaps I might find him , "
177187	177201	177163	177163	Katharine	332	" But why should it matter ? You ll see him another day . "
177213	177221	177222	177222	Katharine	332	" I was wrong to come here , "
177235	177245	177246	177246	Mary	342	" You had a perfect right to come here , "
177284	177294	177295	177295	Mary	342	" Of course you had a right to come , "
177305	177308	177310	177310	Katharine	332	" No , "
177312	177361	177310	177310	Katharine	332	" Except that when one s desperate one has a sort of right . I am desperate . How do I know what s happening to him now ? He may do anything . He may wander about the streets all night . Anything may happen to him . "
177377	177388	177389	177389	she	332	" You know you exaggerate ; you re talking nonsense , "
177393	177403	177362	177362	She	332	" Mary , I must talk I must tell you "
177404	177412	177413	177413	Mary	342	" You needn t tell me anything , "
177417	177425	177413	177413	Mary	342	" Can t I see for myself ? "
177426	177431	177432	177432	Katharine	332	" No , no , "
177435	177440	177432	177432	Katharine	332	" It s not that "
177517	177539	177514	177514	she	332	" You forget that I loved him too . I thought I knew him . I _ did _ know him . "
177692	177700	177701	177701	she	332	" There are different ways of loving , "
177730	177743	177744	177744	she	332	" Perhaps he s waiting in the street again to - night , "
177747	177758	177744	177744	she	332	" I ll go now . I might find him . "
177759	177771	177773	177773	Mary	342	" It s far more likely that he ll come here , "
177786	177795	177776	177776	Katharine	332	" I ll wait another half - hour . "
178134	178142	178143	178143	Mary	342	" But where are you going to ? "
178152	178165	178143	178143	Mary	342	" Oh , I m going home no , to Highgate perhaps . "
178520	178528	178529	178529	Mary	342	" Look here where are you going ? "
178538	178548	178529	178529	Mary	342	" We must take that cab and go home . "
178576	178580	178581	178581	she	332	" Very well , "
178584	178595	178581	178581	she	332	" We may as well go there as anywhere else . "
178637	178646	178647	178647	she	332	" I m sure we shall find him , "
178657	178664	178665	178665	Katharine	332	" It may be too late , "
178683	178686	178687	178687	she	332	" Nonsense , "
178697	178712	178687	178687	she	332	" If we don t find him there we shall find him somewhere else . "
178713	178727	178679	178679	she	332	" But suppose he s walking about the streets for hours and hours ? "
178738	178749	178750	178750	she	332	" He may refuse ever to speak to me again , "
178811	178817	178818	178818	she	332	" Don t be frightened , "
178826	178847	178818	178818	she	332	" I m not going to jump out of the cab . It wouldn t do much good after all . "
178857	178864	178865	178865	Katharine	332	" I ought to have apologized , "
178872	178993	178865	178865	Katharine	332	" for bringing you into all this business ; I haven t told you half , either . I m no longer engaged to William Rodney . He is to marry Cassandra Otway . It s all arranged all perfectly right .... And after he d waited in the streets for hours and hours , William made me bring him in . He was standing under the lamp - post watching our windows . He was perfectly white when he came into the room . William left us alone , and we sat and talked . It seems ages and ages ago , now . Was it last night ? Have I been out long ? What s the time ? "
179017	179024	179025	179025	she	3965	" Only half - past eight ! "
179028	179036	179037	179037	She	3965	" Then he may be there still . "
179051	179076	179045	179046	the cabman	3966	" But if he s not there , what shall I do ? Where could I find him ? The streets are so crowded . "
179077	179083	179084	179084	Mary	342	" We shall find him , "
179460	179464	179465	179465	Katharine	332	" At last , "
179527	179545	179521	179522	the maid	517	" Mr. Denham called again , miss . He has been waiting for you for some time . "
180064	180101	180102	180102	he	175	" That doesn t matter with me , of course , but suppose it happened with somebody else ? What would they think ? They would suspect something merely from her expression . She looked she looked "
180104	180113	180115	180115	Cassandra	332	" like some one walking in her sleep . "
180157	180163	180164	180164	he	175	" Once throw conventions aside , "
180167	180177	180164	180164	he	175	" once do the things that people don t do "
180508	180517	180518	180518	she	332	" We re not going to interrupt you , "
180696	180708	180709	180709	he	175	" But don t you think it s a little unsociable ? "
180712	180736	180709	180709	he	175	" Why not do something amusing ? go to the play , for instance ? Why not ask Katharine and Ralph , eh ? "
180754	180763	180764	180764	she	332	" Don t you think they must be ? "
180774	180797	180764	180764	she	332	" Oh , I know nothing about that . I only thought we might amuse ourselves , as your uncle s out . "
181403	181409	181410	181411	the musicians	4026	" God Save the King , "
181857	181861	181854	181854	she	332	" How can Cassandra "
181878	181888	181854	181854	she	332	" how could she herself have been so blind ? "
182081	182096	182097	182097	she	332	" She looks as if she were offering up a sacrifice ! Very beautiful , "
182311	182318	182320	182320	Katharine	332	" The only hope for us , "
182322	182343	182320	182320	Katharine	332	" is that William shall die , and Cassandra shall be given rooms as the widow of a distinguished poet . "
182344	182346	182347	182347	Cassandra	332	" Or "
182493	182505	182480	182480	they	3408	" We have been wondering whether they ever catch a fish ... "
182508	182518	182480	182480	they	3408	" We must leave time to visit the Maze . "
183099	183106	183107	183107	he	132	" Katharine is out this afternoon , "
183110	183127	183107	183107	he	132	" Why not come round later and discuss it with her with us both , eh ? "
183128	183149	183080	183080	she	217	" My dear Trevor , I have particular reasons for wishing to talk to you alone .... Where is Katharine ? "
183150	183181	183182	183182	He	132	" She s out with her young man , naturally . Cassandra plays the part of chaperone very usefully . A charming young woman that a great favorite of mine . "
183219	183223	183224	183225	Mrs. Milvain	217	" With Cassandra , "
183229	183233	183224	183225	Mrs. Milvain	217	" With Cassandra . "
183234	183240	183241	183242	Mr. Hilbery	132	" Yes , with Cassandra , "
183251	183296	183297	183297	He	132	" I think they said they were going to Hampton Court , and I rather believe they were taking a protege of mine , Ralph Denham , a very clever fellow , too , to amuse Cassandra . I thought the arrangement very suitable . "
183324	183386	183387	183388	Mr. Hilbery	132	" Hampton Court always seems to me an ideal spot for engaged couples . There s the Maze , there s a nice place for having tea I forget what they call it and then , if the young man knows his business he contrives to take his lady upon the river . Full of possibilities full . Cake , Celia ? "
183391	183422	183387	183388	Mr. Hilbery	132	" I respect my dinner too much , but that can t possibly apply to you . You ve never observed that feast , so far as I can remember . "
183452	183459	183460	183460	she	217	" Who is this Mr. Denham ? "
183463	183467	183469	183470	Mr. Hilbery	132	" Ralph Denham ? "
183482	183526	183469	183470	Mr. Hilbery	132	" A very interesting young man . I ve a great belief in him . He s an authority upon our mediaeval institutions , and if he weren t forced to earn his living he would write a book that very much wants writing "
183527	183536	183537	183538	Mrs. Milvain	217	" He is not well off , then ? "
183541	183561	183469	183470	Mr. Hilbery	132	" Hasn t a penny , I m afraid , and a family more or less dependent on him . "
183562	183573	183469	183470	Mr. Hilbery	132	" A mother and sisters ? His father is dead ? "
183574	183584	183586	183587	Mr. Hilbery	132	" Yes , his father died some years ago , "
183628	183646	183586	183587	Mr. Hilbery	132	" His father has been dead some time , and this young man had to take his place "
183647	183652	183653	183654	Mrs. Milvain	217	" A legal family ? "
183657	183667	183653	183654	Mrs. Milvain	217	" I fancy I ve seen the name somewhere . "
183674	183691	183692	183692	he	132	" I should be inclined to doubt whether they were altogether in that walk of life , "
183695	183740	183741	183741	he	132	" I fancy that Denham once told me that his father was a corn merchant . Perhaps he said a stockbroker . He came to grief , anyhow , as stockbrokers have a way of doing . I ve a great respect for Denham , "
183777	183788	183789	183789	he	132	" Cassandra s grown into a very charming young woman , "
183793	183819	183789	183789	he	132	" Charming to look at , and charming to talk to , though her historical knowledge is not altogether profound . Another cup of tea ? "
183847	183857	183858	183858	she	217	" It is Cassandra that I have come about , "
183861	183920	183858	183858	she	217	" I am very sorry to say that Cassandra is not at all what you think her , Trevor . She has imposed upon your and Maggie s goodness . She has behaved in a way that would have seemed incredible in this house of all houses were it not for other circumstances that are still more incredible . "
183934	183941	183942	183942	he	132	" It all sounds very black , "
183955	183966	183942	183942	he	132	" But I own I am completely in the dark . "
183984	184069	183974	183974	her	217	" Who has Cassandra gone out with ? William Rodney . Who has Katharine gone out with ? Ralph Denham . Why are they for ever meeting each other round street corners , and going to music - halls , and taking cabs late at night ? Why will Katharine not tell me the truth when I question her ? I understand the reason now . Katharine has entangled herself with this unknown lawyer ; she has seen fit to condone Cassandra s conduct . "
184076	184092	184093	184094	Mr. Hilbery	132	" Ah , well , Katharine will no doubt have some explanation to give me , "
184098	184138	184093	184094	Mr. Hilbery	132	" It s a little too complicated for me to take in all at once , I confess and , if you won t think me rude , Celia , I think I ll be getting along towards Knightsbridge . "
184145	184159	184160	184160	she	217	" She has condoned Cassandra s conduct and entangled herself with Ralph Denham , "
184347	184361	184331	184331	he	575	" She has condoned Cassandra s conduct and entangled herself with Ralph Denham . "
184599	184726	184746	184746	she	332	" I m sorry to bother you , my dear . I heard you come in , and thought I d better make myself disagreeable at once as it seems , unfortunately , that fathers are expected to make themselves disagreeable . Now , your Aunt Celia has been to see me ; your Aunt Celia has taken it into her head apparently that you and Cassandra have been let us say a little foolish . This going about together these pleasant little parties there s been some kind of misunderstanding . I told her I saw no harm in it , but I should just like to hear from yourself . Has Cassandra been left a little too much in the company of Mr. Denham ? "
184754	184777	184746	184746	she	332	" I don t see why I should answer Aunt Celia s questions . I ve told her already that I won t. "
184801	184879	184746	184746	she	332	" Very good . Then you authorize me to tell her that she s been mistaken , and there was nothing but a little fun in it ? You ve no doubt , Katharine , in your own mind ? Cassandra is in our charge , and I don t intend that people should gossip about her . I suggest that you should be a little more careful in future . Invite me to your next entertainment . "
184933	184940	184941	184941	he	132	" Have you a guilty conscience ? "
184945	184951	184952	184952	he	132	" Tell me , Katharine , "
184967	184979	184980	184980	she	4110	" I ve been meaning to tell you for some time , "
184983	184992	184980	184980	she	4110	" I m not going to marry William . "
184993	184999	185000	185000	he	132	" You re not going ! "
185011	185021	185000	185000	he	132	" Why ? When ? Explain yourself , Katharine . "
185022	185034	185035	185035	Katharine	332	" Oh , some time ago a week , perhaps more . "
185052	185072	185000	185000	he	132	" But may I ask why have I not been told of this what do you mean by it ? "
185073	185085	185140	185140	she	332	" We don t wish to be married that s all . "
185086	185097	185000	185000	he	132	" This is William s wish as well as yours ? "
185098	185107	185140	185140	she	332	" Oh , yes . We agree perfectly . "
185226	185249	185250	185250	he	132	" I confess I find great difficulty in following you . I should like to hear William s side of the story , "
185254	185269	185250	185250	he	132	" I think he ought to have spoken to me in the first instance . "
185270	185277	185279	185279	Katharine	332	" I wouldn t let him , "
185281	185292	185293	185293	she	332	" I know it must seem to you very strange , "
185296	185313	185293	185293	she	332	" But I assure you , if you d wait a little until mother comes back . "
185458	185463	185464	185464	Katharine	332	" Here s William , "
185473	185483	185484	185484	she	332	" I ve told father we re not engaged , "
185489	185501	185484	185484	she	332	" I ve explained that I prevented you from telling him . "
185580	185600	185561	185561	He	132	" I should like your account of this affair , Rodney if Katharine no longer prevents you from speaking . "
185608	185616	185617	185617	he	175	" Our engagement is at an end , "
185625	185636	185561	185561	He	132	" Has this been arrived at by your joint desire ? "
185656	185661	185647	185647	Katharine	332	" Oh , yes . "
185682	185712	185713	185713	he	132	" I can only suggest that you should postpone any decision until the effect of this misunderstanding has had time to wear off . You have now known each other "
185716	185723	185724	185724	Katharine	332	" There s been no misunderstanding , "
185727	185732	185724	185724	Katharine	332	" Nothing at all . "
185888	185901	185902	185902	he	403	" Look here , we must get to the bottom of this , "
185919	185999	185902	185902	he	403	" You ve had some difference of opinion , eh ? Take my word for it , most people go through this sort of thing when they re engaged . I ve seen more trouble come from long engagements than from any other form of human folly . Take my advice and put the whole matter out of your minds both of you . I prescribe a complete abstinence from emotion . Visit some cheerful seaside resort , Rodney . "
186201	186206	186190	186190	He	132	" I love Cassandra . "
186255	186260	186261	186262	Mr. Hilbery	132	" You have the impudence "
186312	186316	186317	186317	she	332	" Uncle Trevor , "
186320	186329	186317	186317	she	332	" I insist upon telling you the truth ! "
186382	186389	186390	186390	she	332	" You must know the truth , "
186397	186411	186412	186413	Mr. Hilbery	132	" You have the impudence to tell me this in Katharine s presence ? "
186425	186432	186433	186433	Rodney	175	" I am aware , quite aware "
186464	186476	186477	186477	he	175	" I am quite aware what you must think of me , "
186493	186509	186510	186511	Mr. Hilbery	132	" I could express my views on the subject more fully if we were alone , "
186514	186520	186522	186522	Katharine	332	" But you forget me , "
186550	186574	186532	186532	her	332	" I think William has behaved perfectly rightly , and , after all , it is I who am concerned I and Cassandra . "
186634	186692	186697	186697	his	132	" Cassandra and Rodney have a perfect right to settle their own affairs according to their own wishes ; but I see no reason why they should do so either in my room or in my house .... I wish to be quite clear on this point , however ; you are no longer engaged to Rodney . "
186781	186784	186785	186786	Mr. Hilbery	132	" Wait , "
186789	186798	186799	186799	he	132	" I wish to speak to you alone , "
186810	186816	186817	186817	she	332	" I ll come back , "
186911	186915	186916	186916	Cassandra	332	" Uncle Trevor , "
186920	186942	186916	186916	Cassandra	332	" don t be angry , please . I couldn t help it ; I do beg you to forgive me . "
186965	186975	186976	186976	he	2052	" I suppose you have communicated with the Otways , "
186982	186992	186993	186993	Cassandra	332	" Uncle Trevor , we wanted to tell you , "
186998	187001	187002	187002	she	332	" We waited "
187016	187025	187026	187027	her uncle	2052	" Yes ? What were you waiting for ? "
187079	187090	187091	187091	he	2052	" This is a most unpleasant business for all parties , "
187125	187133	187134	187134	he	2052	" Why don t you sit down ? "
187173	187185	187186	187186	he	175	" I think Cassandra can explain matters better in my absence , "
187289	187304	187281	187281	Denham	129	" Anyhow , there s no reason why we shouldn t see each other . "
187305	187321	187322	187322	Katharine	332	" Or stay together . It s only marriage that s out of the question , "
187325	187339	187281	187281	Denham	129	" But if I find myself coming to want you more and more ? "
187340	187350	187281	187281	Denham	129	" If our lapses come more and more often ? "
187362	187367	187368	187368	he	129	" But at least , "
187371	187400	187401	187401	he	129	" we ve established the fact that my lapses are still in some odd way connected with you ; yours have nothing to do with me . Katharine , "
187414	187490	187404	187404	his	129	" I assure you that we are in love what other people call love . Remember that night . We had no doubts whatever then . We were absolutely happy for half an hour . You had no lapse until the day after ; I had no lapse until yesterday morning . We ve been happy at intervals all day until I went off my head , and you , quite naturally , were bored . "
187491	187494	187495	187495	she	4156	" Ah , "
187505	187525	187526	187526	she	4156	" I can t make you understand . It s not boredom I m never bored . Reality reality , "
187549	187600	187530	187530	her	4156	" I cease to be real to you . It s the faces in a storm again the vision in a hurricane . We come together for a moment and we part . It s my fault , too . I m as bad as you are worse , perhaps . "
187631	187633	187627	187627	they	4157	" lapses "
188333	188338	188339	188339	he	153	" Now , Katharine , "
188352	188363	188339	188339	he	153	" you will , perhaps , have the kindness to explain "
188368	188378	188379	188379	he	153	" What inferences do you expect me to draw ? "
188383	188421	188422	188422	he	153	" You tell me that you are not engaged to Rodney ; I see you on what appear to be extremely intimate terms with another with Ralph Denham . What am I to conclude ? Are you , "
188431	188437	188422	188422	he	153	" engaged to Ralph Denham ? "
188438	188441	188442	188442	she	332	" No , "
188486	188530	188531	188531	he	153	" Then all I can say is that you ve very strange ideas of the proper way to behave .... People have drawn certain conclusions , nor am I surprised .... The more I think of it the more inexplicable I find it , "
188542	188634	188531	188531	he	153	" Why am I left in ignorance of what is going on in my own house ? Why am I left to hear of these events for the first time from my sister ? Most disagreeable most upsetting . How I m to explain to your Uncle Francis but I wash my hands of it . Cassandra goes tomorrow . I forbid Rodney the house . As for the other young man , the sooner he makes himself scarce the better . After placing the most implicit trust in you , Katharine "
188754	188761	188762	188762	he	153	" I ll speak to Denham , "
188778	188785	188786	188786	Katharine	332	" I shall come with you , "
188793	188799	188801	188802	her father	403	" You will stay here , "
188804	188814	188815	188815	she	332	" What are you going to say to him ? "
188818	188832	188833	188833	he	153	" I suppose I may say what I like in my own house ? "
188836	188843	188844	188844	she	332	" Then I go , too , "
188892	188906	188907	188907	he	132	" I understood you to say that you were not engaged to him , "
188919	188925	188926	188926	she	332	" We are not engaged , "
188929	188964	188965	188965	he	132	" It should be a matter of indifference to you , then , whether he comes here or not I will not have you listening to other things when I am speaking to you ! "
188981	188995	188965	188965	he	132	" Answer me frankly , what is your relationship with this young man ? "
188996	189007	189008	189008	she	332	" Nothing that I can explain to a third person , "
189012	189022	189023	189023	he	132	" I will have no more of these equivocations , "
189026	189032	189033	189033	she	332	" I refuse to explain , "
189047	189050	189051	189051	she	332	" There ! "
189054	189059	189060	189060	She	332	" He is gone ! "
189082	189093	189094	189094	he	132	" For God s sake , Katharine , control yourself ! "
189162	189172	189173	189173	he	132	" These emotions have been very upsetting , naturally , "
189195	189265	189185	189185	he	132	" You ve been placed in a very difficult position , as I understand from Cassandra . Now let us come to terms ; we will leave these agitating questions in peace for the present . Meanwhile , let us try to behave like civilized beings . Let us read Sir Walter Scott . What d you say to The Antiquary , eh ? Or The Bride of Lammermoor ? "
190123	190129	190131	190132	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" From Shakespeare s tomb ! "
190165	190171	190172	190172	she	128	" Thank God , Katharine ! "
190175	190179	190180	190180	she	128	" Thank God ! "
190183	190189	190191	190191	Katharine	332	" You ve come back ? "
190257	190265	190266	190267	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Nothing else matters in the world ! "
190270	190321	190266	190267	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Names aren t everything ; it s what we feel that s everything . I didn t want silly , kind , interfering letters . I didn t want your father to tell me . I knew it from the first . I prayed that it might be so . "
190322	190327	190328	190328	Katharine	332	" You knew it ? "
190342	190349	190350	190350	She	332	" How did you know it ? "
190368	190405	190330	190331	her mother	377	" The first evening you told me , Katharine . Oh , and thousands of times dinner - parties talking about books the way he came into the room your voice when you spoke of him . "
190421	190435	190417	190417	she	332	" I m not going to marry William . And then there s Cassandra "
190436	190443	190445	190446	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Yes , there s Cassandra , "
190448	190477	190478	190478	she	128	" I own I was a little grudging at first , but , after all , she plays the piano so beautifully . Do tell me , Katharine , "
190482	190500	190478	190478	she	128	" where did you go that evening she played Mozart , and you thought I was asleep ? "
190506	190512	190513	190513	she	332	" To Mary Datchet s , "
190516	190519	190521	190522	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Ah ! "
190534	190544	190521	190522	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" I had my little romance my little speculation . "
190575	190585	190586	190586	she	332	" I m not in love with Ralph Denham , "
190589	190599	190601	190602	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Don t marry unless you re in love ! "
190606	190609	190610	190610	she	128	" But , "
190619	190629	190610	190610	she	128	" aren t there different ways , Katharine different ? "
190630	190646	190647	190647	Katharine	332	" We want to meet as often as we like , but to be free , "
190650	190667	190668	190669	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" To meet here , to meet in his house , to meet in the street . "
190711	190714	190709	190709	she	128	" kind letters "
190726	190737	190738	190738	Katharine	332	" Yes . Or to stay away in the country , "
190755	190782	190719	190724	her sister - in - law	1414	" What a comfort he was in that shop how he took me and found the ruins at once how _ safe _ I felt with him "
190783	190840	190719	190724	her sister - in - law	1414	" Safe ? Oh , no , he s fearfully rash he s always taking risks . He wants to throw up his profession and live in a little cottage and write books , though he hasn t a penny of his own , and there are any number of sisters and brothers dependent on him . "
190841	190849	190850	190851	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Ah , he has a mother ? "
190854	190869	190870	190870	Katharine	332	" Yes . Rather a fine - looking old lady , with white hair . "
190935	190950	190951	190951	she	332	" A wretched old bird in a corner , with half its feathers out , "
190990	191002	190951	190951	she	332	" But , Katharine , you _ are _ in love ! "
191235	191270	191227	191227	She	128	" It s all done in five minutes at a Registry Office nowadays , if you think the Church service a little florid which it is , though there are noble things in it . "
191271	191281	191282	191282	Katharine	332	" But we don t want to be married , "
191289	191307	191282	191282	Katharine	332	" Why , after all , isn t it perfectly possible to live together without being married ? "
191349	191379	191346	191346	she	128	" A plus B minus C equals _ x y z _ . It s so dreadfully ugly , Katharine . That s what I feel so dreadfully ugly . "
191415	191425	191426	191426	she	332	" Well , I don t know about ugliness , "
191431	191441	191442	191443	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" But he doesn t ask it of you ? "
191446	191458	191442	191443	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Not that grave young man with the steady brown eyes ? "
191459	191472	191426	191426	she	332	" He doesn t ask anything we neither of us ask anything . "
191473	191489	191442	191443	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" If I could help you , Katharine , by the memory of what I felt "
191490	191499	191426	191426	she	332	" Yes , tell me what you felt . "
191548	191563	191564	191564	she	128	" We were in a little boat going out to a ship at night , "
191567	191638	191564	191564	she	128	" The sun had set and the moon was rising over our heads . There were lovely silver lights upon the waves and three green lights upon the steamer in the middle of the bay . Your father s head looked so grand against the mast . It was life , it was death . The great sea was round us . It was the voyage for ever and ever . "
191745	191749	191751	191752	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Who knows , "
191758	191790	191791	191791	she	128	" where we are bound for , or why , or who has sent us , or what we shall find who knows anything , except that love is our faith love "
191872	191888	191859	191860	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" And you won t think those ugly thoughts again , will you , Katharine ? "
191957	191961	191962	191962	she	128	" But then , "
191972	191988	191989	191989	she	128	" you knew you were in love ; but we re different . It seems , "
192004	192124	192125	192125	she	128	" as if something came to an end suddenly gave out faded an illusion as if when we think we re in love we make it up we imagine what doesn t exist . That s why it s impossible that we should ever marry . Always to be finding the other an illusion , and going off and forgetting about them , never to be certain that you cared , or that he wasn t caring for some one not you at all , the horror of changing from one state to the other , being happy one moment and miserable the next that s the reason why we can t possibly marry . At the same time , "
192128	192138	192125	192125	she	128	" we can t live without each other , because "
192161	192171	192125	192125	she	128	" We have to have faith in our vision , "
192198	192204	192172	192173	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" otherwise , as you say "
192226	192247	192248	192248	she	128	" Believe me , Katharine , it s the same for every one for me , too for your father , "
192277	192292	192270	192270	she	128	" But where is Ralph ? Why isn t he here to see me ? "
192299	192309	192310	192310	she	332	" Because he s not allowed to come here , "
192320	192332	192333	192333	she	128	" Would there be time to send for him before luncheon ? "
192410	192418	192419	192419	she	332	" I m not happy without him , "
193421	193436	193437	193437	she	3384	" I hope you re not disposing of somebody s fortune in a hurry , "
193448	193678	193437	193437	she	3384	" or cutting off an entail at one blow , because I want to ask you to do me a favor . And Anderson won t keep his horse waiting . ( Anderson is a perfect tyrant , but he drove my dear father to the Abbey the day they buried him . ) I made bold to come to you , Mr. Denham , not exactly in search of legal assistance ( though I don t know who I d rather come to , if I were in trouble ) , but in order to ask your help in settling some tiresome little domestic affairs that have arisen in my absence . I ve been to Stratford - on - Avon ( I must tell you all about that one of these days ) , and there I got a letter from my sister - in - law , a dear kind goose who likes interfering with other people s children because she s got none of her own . ( We re dreadfully afraid that she s going to lose the sight of one of her eyes , and I always feel that our physical ailments are so apt to turn into mental ailments . I think Matthew Arnold says something of the same kind about Lord Byron . ) But that s neither here nor there . "
193736	193748	193749	193750	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" I didn t come here to talk about Lord Byron , "
193758	193782	193749	193750	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" though I know that both you and Katharine , unlike other young people of your generation , still find him worth reading . "
193786	193801	193802	193802	she	128	" I m so glad you ve made Katharine read poetry , Mr. Denham ! "
193805	193829	193802	193802	she	128	" and feel poetry , and look poetry ! She can t talk it yet , but she will oh , she will ! "
193872	193879	193880	193881	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" But you care for her ? "
193884	193888	193889	193889	he	153	" Good God ! "
193901	193914	193915	193916	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" It s the Church of England service you both object to ? "
193920	193932	193933	193933	Ralph	153	" I don t care a damn what service it is , "
193936	193952	193953	193954	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" You would marry her in Westminster Abbey if the worst came to the worst ? "
193957	193968	193969	193969	Ralph	153	" I would marry her in St. Paul s Cathedral , "
194045	194049	194051	194052	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Thank God ! "
194333	194337	194338	194338	she	128	" Never mind , "
194341	194384	194338	194338	she	128	" we ll go to St. Paul s another day , and it may turn out , though I can t promise that it _ will _ , that he ll take us past Westminster Abbey , which would be even better . "
194569	194579	194580	194580	she	128	" There s plenty of room for us all , "
194584	194600	194601	194601	she	128	" Plenty of room . We could find space for FOUR of you , William , "
194765	194768	194769	194769	she	128	" Now , "
194778	194783	194769	194769	she	128	" here we are ! "
194838	194847	194848	194848	He	175	" You go in , Denham . I ... "
194923	194926	194927	194927	she	128	" Ah , "
194930	194964	194927	194927	she	128	" Katharine s not here . She must be upstairs in her room . You have something to say to her , I know , Mr. Denham . You can find your way ? "
195077	195083	195084	195084	he	4319	" May I come in ? "
195092	195095	195084	195084	he	4319	" Yes . "
195213	195222	195223	195223	she	332	" Don t move , don t go , "
195317	195330	195332	195332	Ralph	153	" Those were the papers you left on the seat at Kew , "
195336	195351	195332	195332	Ralph	153	" You folded them so quickly that I couldn t see what they were . "
195568	195580	195581	195581	she	332	" I like your little dot with the flames round it , "
195785	195798	195773	195773	She	332	" Yes , the world looks something like that to me too . "
196066	196069	196064	196064	he	153	" Cassandra ! "
196101	196109	196110	196110	she	332	" Nobody must know I m here , "
196117	196147	196110	196110	she	332	" I missed my train . I have been wandering about London all day . I can bear it no longer . Katharine , what am I to do ? "
196176	196181	196183	196183	Ralph	153	" William s upstairs , "
196194	196207	196183	196183	Ralph	153	" I ll go and ask him to come down to you . "
196305	196312	196300	196300	she	332	" But where s your luggage ? "
196333	196340	196329	196329	Cassandra	332	" I ve lost my luggage , "
196350	196357	196358	196358	she	332	" You ve lost your luggage , "
196462	196473	196452	196452	her	332	" I believe it will fit you without any alteration . "
196504	196515	196494	196494	Ralph	153	" Why don t you tell us you re glad ? "
196635	196648	196649	196649	she	332	" I won t take that unless William gives it me himself , "
196652	196660	196649	196649	she	332	" Keep it for me , Katharine . "
196661	196671	196673	196673	Ralph	153	" I assure you everything s perfectly all right , "
196675	196680	196673	196673	Ralph	153	" Let me tell William "
196729	196734	196735	196735	she	128	" My dear Cassandra ! "
196738	196751	196752	196752	she	128	" How delightful to see you back again ! What a coincidence ! "
196760	196787	196788	196788	She	128	" William is upstairs . The kettle boils over . Where s Katharine , I say ? I go to look , and I find Cassandra ! "
196809	196814	196815	196815	she	128	" I find Cassandra , "
196818	196824	196825	196825	Katharine	332	" She missed her train , "
196836	196839	196841	196842	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Life , "
196854	196862	196864	196864	she	128	" consists in missing trains and in finding "
197049	197066	197067	197067	she	128	" So much earth and so much water and that sublime spirit brooding over it all , "
197170	197175	197176	197176	she	128	" Katharine and Ralph , "
197186	197191	197176	197176	she	128	" William and Cassandra . "
197192	197202	197204	197204	William	175	" I feel myself in an entirely false position , "
197216	197248	197204	197204	William	175	" I ve no right to be sitting here . Mr. Hilbery told me yesterday to leave the house . I d no intention of coming back again . I shall now "
197249	197256	197257	197257	Cassandra	332	" I feel the same too , "
197260	197270	197257	197257	Cassandra	332	" After what Uncle Trevor said to me last night "
197271	197282	197283	197283	Rodney	175	" I have put you into a most odious position , "
197302	197327	197328	197328	he	175	" Until I have your father s consent I have no right to speak to you let alone in this house , where my conduct "
197338	197351	197352	197352	he	175	" where my conduct has been reprehensible and inexcusable in the extreme , "
197358	197401	197402	197402	he	175	" I have explained everything to your mother . She is so generous as to try and make me believe that I have done no harm you have convinced her that my behavior , selfish and weak as it was selfish and weak "
197482	197494	197471	197471	she	332	" You ve nothing to reproach yourself with you ve been always "
197703	197715	197698	197698	her	332	" Well , that s my last attempt at the dramatic . "
197716	197726	197728	197728	Ralph	153	" It s astonishing what a distance they roll , "
197740	197752	197698	197698	her	332	" Don t trouble don t bother . We shall find it "
197765	197780	197753	197754	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Oh , Trevor , we re looking for Cassandra s engagement - ring ! "
197991	198011	198016	198016	her	128	" Oh , Trevor , please tell me , what was the date of the first performance of Hamlet ? "
198414	198438	198386	198387	Mrs. Hilbery	128	" Don t stay if you want to go , Katharine . There s the little room over there . Perhaps you and Ralph "
198439	198444	198446	198446	Katharine	332	" We re engaged , "
198532	198542	198543	198543	he	132	" I gathered something of the kind last night , "
198546	198554	198543	198543	he	132	" I hope you ll deserve her . "
198884	198888	198889	198889	she	332	" At last ! "
199153	199158	199159	199159	he	132	" Are you cold ? "
199169	199176	199177	199177	she	4407	" Yes , I am rather , "
199295	199301	199302	199302	she	4407	" Oh , that cottage , "
199305	199314	199302	199302	she	4407	" We must take it and go there . "
199315	199321	199322	199322	he	153	" And leave all this ? "
199325	199330	199331	199331	she	4407	" As you like , "
199383	199391	199393	199393	Ralph	153	" I ve something on my mind , "
199396	199423	199393	199393	Ralph	153	" I mean I ve been thinking of Mary Datchet . We re very near her rooms now . Would you mind if we went there ? "
199506	199513	199514	199514	she	4407	" Did you treat her badly ? "
199522	199528	199529	199529	he	153	" I could defend myself , "
199535	199557	199558	199558	he	153	" But what s the use , if one feels a thing ? I won t be with her a minute , "
199561	199567	199558	199558	he	153	" I ll just tell her "
199568	199577	199579	199579	Katharine	332	" Of course , you must tell her , "
199614	199619	199620	199620	she	332	" I wish I wish "
199650	199655	199657	199657	Ralph	153	" I regret nothing , "
199708	199712	199713	199713	she	332	" Go on , "
199716	199720	199713	199713	she	332	" You regret nothing "
199721	199725	199726	199726	he	153	" Nothing nothing , "
199729	199734	199735	199735	she	332	" What a fire ! "
199778	199782	199783	199783	she	332	" Why nothing ? "
199813	199822	199823	199823	he	153	" What are you thinking of , Katharine ? "
199837	199889	199911	199911	her	332	" I was thinking of you yes , I swear it . Always of you , but you take such strange shapes in my mind . You ve destroyed my loneliness . Am I to tell you how I see you ? No , tell me tell me from the beginning . "
199937	199965	199929	199929	She	332	" But it was foolish to stand outside and look at the windows . Suppose William hadn t seen you . Would you have gone to bed ? "
199991	200003	200004	200004	she	332	" But it was then I first knew I loved you ! "
200007	200014	200015	200015	he	153	" Tell me from the beginning , "
200019	200032	200033	200033	she	332	" No , I m a person who can t tell things , "
200036	200055	200033	200033	she	332	" I shall say something ridiculous something about flames fires . No , I can t tell you . "
200366	200376	200378	200378	Ralph	153	" That is the light in Mary s room , "
200380	200387	200388	200388	He	153	" She must be at home . "
200401	200419	200420	200420	she	332	" Is she alone , working at this time of night ? What is she working at ? "
200423	200430	200431	200431	she	332	" Why should we interrupt her ? "
200435	200449	200450	200450	she	332	" What have we got to give her ? She s happy too , "
200453	200459	200460	200460	Her	332	" She has her work . "
200478	200489	200490	200490	Ralph	153	" You don t want me to go to her ? "
200493	200506	200507	200507	she	332	" Go , if you like ; tell her what you like , "
200611	200616	200617	200617	she	332	" How they burn ! "
200676	200688	200689	200689	he	153	" I didn t go in I couldn t bring myself , "
200813	200820	200821	200821	he	153	" Do you remember Sally Seal ? "
200829	200835	200836	200836	he	153	" Your mother and Mary ? "
200840	200851	200836	200836	he	153	" Rodney and Cassandra ? Old Joan up at Highgate ? "
200918	200930	200931	200931	Katherine	332	" It s all so easy it s all so simple , "
201496	201500	201501	201501	he	175	" Good night , "
201504	201508	201509	201509	she	332	" Good night , "
