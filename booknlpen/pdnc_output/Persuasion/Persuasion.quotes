138	144	256	257	his family	221	" ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL . "
145	227	256	257	his family	221	" Walter Elliot , born March 1 , 1760 , married , July 15 , 1784 , Elizabeth , daughter of James Stevenson , Esq . of South Park , in the county of Gloucester , by which lady ( who died 1800 ) he has issue Elizabeth , born June 1 , 1785 ; Anne , born August 9 , 1787 ; a still - born son , November 5 , 1789 ; Mary , born November 20 , 1791 . "
269	297	242	243	Sir Walter	90	" Married , December 16 , 1810 , Charles , son and heir of Charles Musgrove , Esq . of Uppercross , in the county of Somerset , "
403	415	417	418	Sir Walter	90	motto:--"Principal seat , Kellynch Hall , in the county of Somerset , "
425	444	417	418	Sir Walter	90	" Heir presumptive , William Walter Elliot , Esq . , great grandson of the second Sir Walter . "
2144	2153	2154	2154	he	90	" For they must have been seen together , "
2157	2174	2154	2154	he	90	" once at Tattersall 's , and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons . "
2732	2754	2722	2722	he	102	" Can we retrench ? Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench ? "
3576	3587	3589	3590	Lady Russell	101	" If we can persuade your father to all this , "
3597	3800	3589	3590	Lady Russell	101	" much may be done . If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth , that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which can not be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle . What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ? There will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct . I have great hope of prevailing . We must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man . "
3999	4058	4126	4126	he	103	" What ! every comfort of life knocked off ! Journeys , London , servants , horses , table -- contractions and restrictions every where ! To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman ! No , he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once , than remain in it on such disgraceful terms . "
4059	4064	4126	4126	he	103	" Quit Kellynch Hall . "
4104	4125	4126	4126	he	103	" Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate , he had no scruple , "
4129	4208	4126	4126	he	103	" in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side . It did not appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support . In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself ; and would be looked up to , as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household . "
4852	4855	4845	4846	Mr Shepherd	103	" advertise , "
5335	5346	5348	5349	Mr Shepherd	103	" I must take leave to observe , Sir Walter , "
5363	5439	5357	5357	he	103	" that the present juncture is much in our favour . This peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore . They will be all wanting a home . Could not be a better time , Sir Walter , for having a choice of tenants , very responsible tenants . Many a noble fortune has been made during the war . If a rich admiral were to come in our way , Sir Walter-- "
5440	5451	5453	5454	Sir Walter	90	" He would be a very lucky man , Shepherd , "
5456	5495	5453	5454	Sir Walter	90	" that 's all I have to remark . A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him ; rather the greatest prize of all , let him have taken ever so many before ; hey , Shepherd ? "
5513	5787	5501	5501	he	103	" I presume to observe , Sir Walter , that , in the way of business , gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with . I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business ; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions , and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with . Therefore , Sir Walter , what I would take leave to suggest is , that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention ; which must be contemplated as a possible thing , because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other ; consequence has its tax ; I , John Shepherd , might conceal any family - matters that I chose , for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me ; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude ; and therefore , thus much I venture upon , that it will not greatly surprise me if , with all our caution , some rumour of the truth should get abroad ; in the supposition of which , as I was going to observe , since applications will unquestionably follow , I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to ; and beg leave to add , that two hours will bring me over at any time , to save you the trouble of replying . "
5806	5835	5501	5501	he	103	" There are few among the gentlemen of the navy , I imagine , who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description . "
5836	5852	5854	5855	Mrs Clay	105	" They would look around them , no doubt , and bless their good fortune , "
5887	6002	5501	5501	he	103	" but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant . I have known a good deal of the profession ; and besides their liberality , they are so neat and careful in all their ways ! These valuable pictures of yours , Sir Walter , if you chose to leave them , would be perfectly safe . Everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of ! The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now . You need not be afraid , Miss Elliot , of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected . "
6003	6009	6011	6012	Sir Walter	90	" As to all that , "
6015	6160	6011	6012	Sir Walter	90	" supposing I were induced to let my house , I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it . I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant . The park would be open to him of course , and few navy officers , or men of any other description , can have had such a range ; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure - grounds , is another thing . I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable ; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden . I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour , I assure you , be he sailor or soldier . "
6171	6247	5501	5501	he	103	" In all these cases , there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant . Your interest , Sir Walter , is in pretty safe hands . Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights . I venture to hint , that Sir Walter Elliot can not be half so jealous for his own , as John Shepherd will be for him . "
6251	6306	6249	6249	Anne	93	" The navy , I think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give . Sailors work hard enough for their comforts , we must all allow . "
6307	6323	6325	6326	Mr Shepherd	103	" Very true , very true . What Miss Anne says , is very true , "
6331	6336	6338	6339	his daughter	329	" Oh ! certainly , "
6351	6373	6249	6249	Anne	93	" The profession has its utility , but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it . "
6374	6377	6249	6249	Anne	93	" Indeed ! "
6389	6811	6249	6249	Anne	93	" Yes ; it is in two points offensive to me ; I have two strong grounds of objection to it . First , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man 's youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man . I have observed it all my life . A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line . One day last spring , in town , I was in company with two men , striking instances of what I am talking of ; Lord St Ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; I was to give place to Lord St Ives , and a certain Admiral Baldwin , the most deplorable - looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top . ' In the name of heaven , who is that old fellow ? ' said I to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( Sir Basil Morley ) . ' Old fellow ! ' cried Sir Basil , ' it is Admiral Baldwin . What do you take his age to be ? ' ' Sixty , ' said I , ' or perhaps sixty - two . ' ' Forty , ' replied Sir Basil , ' forty , and no more . ' Picture to yourselves my amazement ; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin . I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea - faring life can do ; but to a degree , I know it is the same with them all : they are all knocked about , and exposed to every climate , and every weather , till they are not fit to be seen . It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once , before they reach Admiral Baldwin 's age . "
6812	6818	6820	6821	Mrs Clay	105	" Nay , Sir Walter , "
6823	6970	6971	6971	she	105	" this is being severe indeed . Have a little mercy on the poor men . We are not all born to be handsome . The sea is no beautifier , certainly ; sailors do grow old betimes ; I have observed it ; they soon lose the look of youth . But then , is not it the same with many other professions , perhaps most other ? Soldiers , in active service , are not at all better off : and even in the quieter professions , there is a toil and a labour of the mind , if not of the body , which seldom leaves a man 's looks to the natural effect of time . The lawyer plods , quite care - worn ; the physician is up at all hours , and travelling in all weather ; and even the clergyman-- "
6982	7130	6249	6249	Anne	93	clergyman;--"and even the clergyman , you know is obliged to go into infected rooms , and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere . In fact , as I have long been convinced , though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn , it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any , who can live in a regular way , in the country , choosing their own hours , following their own pursuits , and living on their own property , without the torment of trying for more ; it is only their lot , I say , to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost : I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young . "
7389	7396	7398	7399	Sir Walter	90	" And who is Admiral Croft ? "
7433	7470	7423	7423	Anne	93	" He is a rear admiral of the white . He was in the Trafalgar action , and has been in the East Indies since ; he was stationed there , I believe , several years . "
7471	7479	7481	7482	Sir Walter	90	" Then I take it for granted , "
7484	7501	7481	7482	Sir Walter	90	" that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery . "
7789	7807	7809	7809	he	103	" And a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be , "
7811	7948	7809	7809	he	103	" asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the Admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , Sir Walter , I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford . Bless me ! what was his name ? At this moment I can not recollect his name , though I have heard it so lately . Penelope , my dear , can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford : Mrs Croft 's brother ? "
7968	7995	7809	7809	he	103	" I have no conception whom you can mean , Shepherd ; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent . "
7996	8096	7809	7809	he	103	" Bless me ! how very odd ! I shall forget my own name soon , I suppose . A name that I am so very well acquainted with ; knew the gentleman so well by sight ; seen him a hundred times ; came to consult me once , I remember , about a trespass of one of his neighbours ; farmer 's man breaking into his orchard ; wall torn down ; apples stolen ; caught in the fact ; and afterwards , contrary to my judgement , submitted to an amicable compromise . Very odd indeed ! "
8101	8110	8112	8112	Anne	93	" You mean Mr Wentworth , I suppose ? "
8120	8176	8114	8115	Mr Shepherd	103	" Wentworth was the very name ! Mr Wentworth was the very man . He had the curacy of Monkford , you know , Sir Walter , some time back , for two or three years . Came there about the year ---5 , I take it . You remember him , I am sure . "
8177	8242	8114	8115	Mr Shepherd	103	" Wentworth ? Oh ! ay,--Mr Wentworth , the curate of Monkford . You misled me by the term gentleman . I thought you were speaking of some man of property : Mr Wentworth was nobody , I remember ; quite unconnected ; nothing to do with the Strafford family . One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common . "
8515	8525	8565	8565	his	454	" I have let my house to Admiral Croft , "
8713	8729	8699	8699	she	93	" A few months more , and he , perhaps , may be walking here . "
11078	11083	11084	11085	Sir Walter	90	" This indenture sheweth . "
11161	11205	11142	11143	the Admiral	411	" I thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at Taunton . The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him . "--reciprocal
11519	11528	11530	11530	Mary	94	" I can not possibly do without Anne , "
11540	11558	11535	11535	Elizabeth	91	" Then I am sure Anne had better stay , for nobody will want her in Bath . "
12053	12057	12059	12059	she	91	" Mrs Clay , "
12063	12307	12059	12059	she	91	" never forgets who she is ; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , I can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people . And as to my father , I really should not have thought that he , who has kept himself single so long for our sakes , need be suspected now . If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman , I grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , I am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy . But poor Mrs Clay who , with all her merits , can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty , I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety . One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes , though I know you must fifty times . That tooth of her 's and those freckles . Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him . I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few , but he abominates them . You must have heard him notice Mrs Clay 's freckles . "
12308	12316	12318	12318	Anne	93	" There is hardly any personal defect , "
12320	12332	12318	12318	Anne	93	" which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to . "
12333	12339	12341	12341	Elizabeth	91	" I think very differently , "
12345	12398	12341	12341	Elizabeth	91	" an agreeable manner may set off handsome features , but can never alter plain ones . However , at any rate , as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have , I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me . "
13003	13008	12982	12982	she	94	" a fine girl . "
13057	13095	13055	13055	her	94	" So , you are come at last ! I began to think I should never see you . I am so ill I can hardly speak . I have not seen a creature the whole morning ! "
13096	13105	13107	13107	Anne	93	" I am sorry to find you unwell , "
13109	13122	13107	13107	Anne	93	" You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday ! "
13123	13226	13055	13055	her	94	" Yes , I made the best of it ; I always do : but I was very far from well at the time ; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning : very unfit to be left alone , I am sure . Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way , and not able to ring the bell ! So , Lady Russell would not get out . I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer . "
13239	13307	13227	13227	Anne	93	" Oh ! Charles is out shooting . I have not seen him since seven o'clock . He would go , though I told him how ill I was . He said he should not stay out long ; but he has never come back , and now it is almost one . I assure you , I have not seen a soul this whole long morning . "
13308	13318	13055	13055	her	94	" You have had your little boys with you ? "
13319	13363	13227	13227	Anne	93	" Yes , as long as I could bear their noise ; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good . Little Charles does not mind a word I say , and Walter is growing quite as bad . "
13364	13374	13376	13376	Anne	93	" Well , you will soon be better now , "
13380	13400	13376	13376	Anne	93	" You know I always cure you when I come . How are your neighbours at the Great House ? "
13401	13484	13227	13227	Anne	93	" I can give you no account of them . I have not seen one of them to - day , except Mr Musgrove , who just stopped and spoke through the window , but without getting off his horse ; and though I told him how ill I was , not one of them have been near me . It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves , I suppose , and they never put themselves out of their way . "
13485	13504	13376	13376	Anne	93	" You will see them yet , perhaps , before the morning is gone . It is early . "
13505	13549	13227	13227	Anne	93	" I never want them , I assure you . They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me . Oh ! Anne , I am so very unwell ! It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday . "
13550	13645	13376	13376	Anne	93	" My dear Mary , recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself ! You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner . "
13646	13658	13227	13227	Anne	93	" Dear me ! what can you possibly have to do ? "
13659	13824	13376	13376	Anne	93	" A great many things , I assure you . More than I can recollect in a moment ; but I can tell you some . I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father 's books and pictures . I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie , trying to understand , and make him understand , which of Elizabeth 's plants are for Lady Russell . I have had all my own little concerns to arrange , books and music to divide , and all my trunks to repack , from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons : and one thing I have had to do , Mary , of a more trying nature : going to almost every house in the parish , as a sort of take - leave . I was told that they wished it . But all these things took up a great deal of time . "
13825	13830	13227	13227	Anne	93	" Oh ! well ! "
13838	13855	13227	13227	Anne	93	" but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday . "
13856	13882	13227	13227	Anne	93	" Did you go then ? I have made no enquiries , because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party . "
13883	13918	13227	13227	Anne	93	" Oh yes ! I went . I was very well yesterday ; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning . It would have been strange if I had not gone . "
13919	13938	13227	13227	Anne	93	" I am very glad you were well enough , and I hope you had a pleasant party . "
13939	14042	13227	13227	Anne	93	" Nothing remarkable . One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one 's own . Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me , and we were so crowded ! They are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward . So , there was I , crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louisa ; and I think it very likely that my illness to - day may be owing to it . "
14131	14137	14139	14139	she	93	" Where shall we go ? "
14146	14167	14139	14139	she	93	" I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you ? "
14168	14179	14181	14181	Anne	93	" I have not the smallest objection on that account , "
14183	14206	14181	14181	Anne	93	" I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves . "
14207	14263	14139	14139	she	93	" Oh ! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible . They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister . However , we may as well go and sit with them a little while , and when we have that over , we can enjoy our walk . "
14951	14978	14946	14949	Mr and Mrs Musgrove	120	" So , Miss Anne , Sir Walter and your sister are gone ; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in ? "
14998	15036	14991	14993	the young ladies	603	" I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter ; but remember , papa , if we do go , we must be in a good situation : none of your Queen Squares for us ! "
15045	15068	14991	14993	the young ladies	603	of--"Upon my word , I shall be pretty well off , when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath ! "
15631	15648	15654	15654	him	612	" I could manage them very well , if it were not for Mary 's interference , "
15676	15692	15693	15693	she	93	" Charles spoils the children so that I can not get them into any order , "
15702	15706	15693	15693	she	93	" Very true . "
15771	15786	15788	15788	Charles	96	" I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill , "
15803	15857	15801	15801	Mary	94	" I do believe if Charles were to see me dying , he would not think there was anything the matter with me . I am sure , Anne , if you would , you might persuade him that I really am very ill -- a great deal worse than I ever own . "
15863	15922	15858	15858	Mary	94	" I hate sending the children to the Great House , though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them , for she humours and indulges them to such a degree , and gives them so much trash and sweet things , that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day . "
15939	16099	15924	15925	Mrs Musgrove	96	" Oh ! Miss Anne , I can not help wishing Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children . They are quite different creatures with you ! But to be sure , in general they are so spoilt ! It is a pity you can not put your sister in the way of managing them . They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen , poor little dears ! without partiality ; but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated-- ! Bless me ! how troublesome they are sometimes . I assure you , Miss Anne , it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should . I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; "
16105	16107	15858	15858	Mary	94	" and "
16113	16132	15858	15858	Mary	94	" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them . "
16143	16263	15858	15858	Mary	94	" Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady , that it would be high treason to call it in question ; but I am sure , without exaggeration , that her upper house - maid and laundry - maid , instead of being in their business , are gadding about the village , all day long . I meet them wherever I go ; and I declare , I never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them . If Jemima were not the trustiest , steadiest creature in the world , it would be enough to spoil her ; for she tells me , they are always tempting her to take a walk with them . "
16274	16425	15858	15858	Mary	94	" I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter - in - law 's concerns , for I know it would not do ; but I shall tell you , Miss Anne , because you may be able to set things to rights , that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles 's nursery - maid : I hear strange stories of her ; she is always upon the gad ; and from my own knowledge , I can declare , she is such a fine - dressing lady , that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near . Mrs Charles quite swears by her , I know ; but I just give you this hint , that you may be upon the watch ; because , if you see anything amiss , you need not be afraid of mentioning it . "
16516	16642	16499	16499	them	627	" I have no scruple of observing to you , how nonsensical some persons are about their place , because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it ; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious , especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma . Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma , but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it . It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world , but I know it is taken notice of by many persons . "
17193	17217	17173	17173	her	93	compliment;--"Well done , Miss Anne ! very well done indeed ! Lord bless me ! how those little fingers of yours fly about ! "
17309	17343	17291	17291	Mary	94	" Dear me , is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch ? I am glad I did not think of it before . How low it makes me ! "
17366	17386	17359	17359	Mary	94	" Nobody knew how much she should suffer . She should put it off as long as she could ; "
17780	17811	17827	17827	she	93	" It was you , and not your sister , I find , that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with , when he was in this country . "
17832	17844	17846	17847	Mrs Croft	112	" Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married ? "
17961	17983	17956	17957	the Admiral	411	" We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft 's here soon ; I dare say you know him by name . "
18225	18234	18235	18235	she	124	" And I will tell you our reason , "
18238	18482	18235	18235	she	124	" and all about it . I am come on to give you notice , that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening , especially mamma ; she is thinking so much of poor Richard ! And we agreed it would be best to have the harp , for it seems to amuse her more than the piano - forte . I will tell you why she is out of spirits . When the Crofts called this morning , ( they called here afterwards , did not they ? ) , they happened to say , that her brother , Captain Wentworth , is just returned to England , or paid off , or something , and is coming to see them almost directly ; and most unluckily it came into mamma 's head , when they were gone , that Wentworth , or something very like it , was the name of poor Richard 's captain at one time ; I do not know when or where , but a great while before he died , poor fellow ! And upon looking over his letters and things , she found it was so , and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man , and her head is quite full of it , and of poor Richard ! So we must be as merry as we can , that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things . "
18613	18617	18605	18605	they	688	" poor Richard , "
19174	19187	19192	19192	themselves	697	" a fine dashing felow , only two perticular about the schoolmaster , "
20041	20052	20054	20054	father	267	" Oh no ; as to leaving the little boy , "
20102	20152	20156	20156	he	120	" the child was going on so well , and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth , that , perhaps , he might join them in the evening ; he would not dine from home , but he might walk in for half an hour . "
20165	20191	20156	20156	he	120	" Oh ! no , indeed , Charles , I can not bear to have you go away . Only think if anything should happen ? "
20364	20375	20377	20377	he	120	" Nothing can be going on better than the child , "
20379	20447	20377	20377	he	120	" so I told my father , just now , that I would come , and he thought me quite right . Your sister being with you , my love , I have no scruple at all . You would not like to leave him yourself , but you see I can be of no use . Anne will send for me if anything is the matter . "
20513	20732	20496	20496	he	752	" So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves , with this poor sick child ; and not a creature coming near us all the evening ! I knew how it would be . This is always my luck . If there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it , and Charles is as bad as any of them . Very unfeeling ! I must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy . Talks of his being going on so well ! How does he know that he is going on well , or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence ? I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling . So here he is to go away and enjoy himself , and because I am the poor mother , I am not to be allowed to stir ; and yet , I am sure , I am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child . My being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried . I am not at all equal to it . You saw how hysterical I was yesterday . "
20733	20827	20496	20496	he	752	" But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm -- of the shock . You will not be hysterical again . I dare say we shall have nothing to distress us . I perfectly understand Mr Robinson 's directions , and have no fears ; and indeed , Mary , I can not wonder at your husband . Nursing does not belong to a man ; it is not his province . A sick child is always the mother 's property : her own feelings generally make it so . "
20828	20913	20496	20496	he	752	" I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother , but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick - room than Charles , for I can not be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if I told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about . I have not nerves for the sort of thing . "
20914	20935	20496	20496	he	752	" But , could you be comfortable yourself , to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy ? "
20936	21013	20496	20496	he	752	" Yes ; you see his papa can , and why should not I ? Jemima is so careful ; and she could send us word every hour how he was . I really think Charles might as well have told his father we would all come . I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is . I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday , but the case is very different to - day . "
21014	21065	20496	20496	he	752	" Well , if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself , suppose you were to go , as well as your husband . Leave little Charles to my care . Mr and Mrs Musgrove can not think it wrong while I remain with him . "
21066	21071	21073	21073	Mary	94	" Are you serious ? "
21079	21297	21073	21073	Mary	94	" Dear me ! that 's a very good thought , very good , indeed . To be sure , I may just as well go as not , for I am of no use at home -- am I ? and it only harasses me . You , who have not a mother 's feelings , are a great deal the properest person . You can make little Charles do anything ; he always minds you at a word . It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima . Oh ! I shall certainly go ; I am sure I ought if I can , quite as much as Charles , for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth , and I know you do not mind being left alone . An excellent thought of yours , indeed , Anne . I will go and tell Charles , and get ready directly . You can send for us , you know , at a moment 's notice , if anything is the matter ; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you . I should not go , you may be sure , if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child . "
21343	21446	21301	21301	she	754	" I mean to go with you , Charles , for I am of no more use at home than you are . If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child , I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like . Anne will stay ; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him . It is Anne 's own proposal , and so I shall go with you , which will be a great deal better , for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday . "
21447	21455	21457	21458	her husband	2315	" This is very kind of Anne , "
21462	21495	21457	21458	her husband	2315	" and I should be very glad to have you go ; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself , to nurse our sick child . "
22284	22293	22294	22294	she	93	" It is over ! it is over ! "
22306	22312	22294	22294	she	93	" The worst is over ! "
22543	22595	22536	22536	she	94	" Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you , Anne , though he was so attentive to me . Henrietta asked him what he thought of you , when they went away , and he said , ' You were so altered he should not have known you again . ' "
22624	22630	22631	22631	Anne	93	" Altered beyond his knowledge . "
22729	22741	22726	22727	Frederick Wentworth	117	" So altered that he should not have known her again ! "
23062	23135	23051	23051	he	792	" Yes , here I am , Sophia , quite ready to make a foolish match . Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking . A little beauty , and a few smiles , and a few compliments to the navy , and I am a lost man . Should not this be enough for a sailor , who has had no society among women to make him nice ? "
23183	23193	23155	23155	he	792	" A strong mind , with sweetness of manner , "
23204	23212	23214	23214	he	792	" That is the woman I want , "
23216	23261	23214	23214	he	792	" Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with , but it must not be much . If I am a fool , I shall be a fool indeed , for I have thought on the subject more than most men . "
23395	23403	23386	23386	his	792	" That was in the year six ; "
23404	23417	23386	23386	his	792	" That happened before I went to sea in the year six , "
23834	23865	23901	23902	the others	359	" Ah ! Miss Anne , if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son , I dare say he would have been just such another by this time . "
23966	23983	24037	24038	The girls	655	" Your first was the Asp , I remember ; we will look for the Asp . "
23984	24036	23916	23916	she	93	" You will not find her there . Quite worn out and broken up . I was the last man who commanded her . Hardly fit for service then . Reported fit for home service for a year or two , and so I was sent off to the West Indies . "
24043	24047	24048	24048	he	117	" The Admiralty , "
24051	24118	24048	24048	he	117	" entertain themselves now and then , with sending a few hundred men to sea , in a ship not fit to be employed . But they have a great many to provide for ; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not , it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed . "
24119	24124	24126	24127	the Admiral	411	" Phoo ! phoo ! "
24129	24202	24126	24127	the Admiral	411	" what stuff these young fellows talk ! Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day . For an old built sloop , you would not see her equal . Lucky fellow to get her ! He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time . Lucky fellow to get anything so soon , with no more interest than his . "
24203	24215	24217	24218	Captain Wentworth	117	" I felt my luck , Admiral , I assure you ; "
24222	24263	24217	24218	Captain Wentworth	117	" I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire . It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea ; a very great object , I wanted to be doing something . "
24264	24302	24126	24127	the Admiral	411	" To be sure you did . What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together ? If a man had not a wife , he soon wants to be afloat again . "
24303	24309	24311	24311	Louisa	124	" But , Captain Wentworth , "
24313	24338	24311	24311	Louisa	124	" how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp , to see what an old thing they had given you . "
24339	24351	24353	24353	he	823	" I knew pretty well what she was before that day ; "
24357	24618	24619	24619	Anne	93	" I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse , which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember , and which at last , on some very wet day , is lent to yourself . Ah ! she was a dear old Asp to me . She did all that I wanted . I knew she would . I knew that we should either go to the bottom together , or that she would be the making of me ; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her ; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining , I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn , to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted . I brought her into Plymouth ; and here another instance of luck . We had not been six hours in the Sound , when a gale came on , which lasted four days and nights , and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time ; our touch with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition . Four - and - twenty hours later , and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth , in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers ; and being lost in only a sloop , nobody would have thought about me . "
24648	24656	24658	24659	Mrs Musgrove	120	" And so then , I suppose , "
24671	24695	24658	24659	Mrs Musgrove	120	" so then he went away to the Laconia , and there he met with our poor boy . Charles , my dear , "
24703	24723	24658	24659	Mrs Musgrove	120	" do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother . I always forgot . "
24724	24754	24658	24659	Mrs Musgrove	120	" It was at Gibraltar , mother , I know . Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar , with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth . "
24755	24796	24658	24659	Mrs Musgrove	120	" Oh ! but , Charles , tell Captain Wentworth , he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me , for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend . "
24890	24991	24877	24877	she	827	" Ah ! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia ! How fast I made money in her . A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands . Poor Harville , sister ! You know how much he wanted money : worse than myself . He had a wife . Excellent fellow . I shall never forget his happiness . He felt it all , so much for her sake . I wished for him again the next summer , when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean . "
24992	25000	25002	25003	Mrs Musgrove	96	" And I am sure , Sir , "
25005	25031	25002	25003	Mrs Musgrove	96	" it was a lucky day for us , when you were put captain into that ship . We shall never forget what you did . "
25072	25076	25078	25081	one of the girls	830	" My brother , "
25083	25091	25078	25081	one of the girls	830	" mamma is thinking of poor Richard . "
25092	25097	25099	25100	Mrs Musgrove	96	" Poor dear fellow ! "
25102	25155	25099	25100	Mrs Musgrove	96	" he was grown so steady , and such an excellent correspondent , while he was under your care ! Ah ! it would have been a happy thing , if he had never left you . I assure you , Captain Wentworth , we are very sorry he ever left you . "
25562	25595	25624	25624	himself	411	" If you had been a week later at Lisbon , last spring , Frederick , you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her daughters . "
25596	25611	25624	25624	himself	411	" Should I ? I am glad I was not a week later then . "
25659	25667	25669	25669	he	411	" But , if I know myself , "
25671	25783	25669	25669	he	411	" this is from no want of gallantry towards them . It is rather from feeling how impossible it is , with all one 's efforts , and all one 's sacrifices , to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have . There can be no want of gallantry , Admiral , in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high , and this is what I do . I hate to hear of women on board , or to see them on board ; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere , if I can help it . "
25791	25868	25634	25641	any ladies on board a ship of his	847	" Oh ! Frederick ! But I can not believe it of you.--All idle refinement!--Women may be as comfortable on board , as in the best house in England . I believe I have lived as much on board as most women , and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man - of - war . I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me , even at Kellynch Hall , "
25878	25901	25634	25641	any ladies on board a ship of his	847	" beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in ; and they have been five altogether . "
25902	25908	25910	25911	her brother	2431	" Nothing to the purpose , "
25913	25929	25910	25911	her brother	2431	" You were living with your husband , and were the only woman on board . "
25930	25969	25634	25641	any ladies on board a ship of his	847	" But you , yourself , brought Mrs Harville , her sister , her cousin , and three children , round from Portsmouth to Plymouth . Where was this superfine , extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then ? "
25970	26025	25910	25911	her brother	2431	" All merged in my friendship , Sophia . I would assist any brother officer 's wife that I could , and I would bring anything of Harville 's from the world 's end , if he wanted it . But do not imagine that I did not feel it an evil in itself . "
26026	26037	25634	25641	any ladies on board a ship of his	847	" Depend upon it , they were all perfectly comfortable . "
26038	26066	25910	25911	her brother	2431	" I might not like them the better for that perhaps . Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board . "
26067	26112	25634	25641	any ladies on board a ship of his	847	" My dear Frederick , you are talking quite idly . Pray , what would become of us poor sailors ' wives , who often want to be conveyed to one port or another , after our husbands , if everybody had your feelings ? "
26113	26134	25910	25911	her brother	2431	" My feelings , you see , did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all her family to Plymouth . "
26135	26177	25634	25641	any ladies on board a ship of his	847	" But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman , and as if women were all fine ladies , instead of rational creatures . We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days . "
26178	26184	26186	26187	the Admiral	411	" Ah ! my dear , "
26189	26255	26186	26187	the Admiral	411	" when he had got a wife , he will sing a different tune . When he is married , if we have the good luck to live to another war , we shall see him do as you and I , and a great many others , have done . We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife . "
26256	26263	25634	25641	any ladies on board a ship of his	847	" Ay , that we shall . "
26264	26270	26272	26273	Captain Wentworth	117	" Now I have done , "
26275	26332	26272	26273	Captain Wentworth	117	" When once married people begin to attack me with,--'Oh ! you will think very differently , when you are married . ' I can only say , ' No , I shall not ; ' and then they say again , ' Yes , you will , ' and there is an end of it . "
26340	26352	26354	26355	Mrs Musgrove	96	" What a great traveller you must have been , ma'am ! "
26360	26452	26480	26480	her	96	" Pretty well , ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage ; though many women have done more . I have crossed the Atlantic four times , and have been once to the East Indies , and back again , and only once ; besides being in different places about home : Cork , and Lisbon , and Gibraltar . But I never went beyond the Streights , and never was in the West Indies . We do not call Bermuda or Bahama , you know , the West Indies . "
26483	26492	26494	26495	Mrs Croft	112	" And I do assure you , ma'am , "
26497	26740	26494	26495	Mrs Croft	112	" that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man - of - war ; I speak , you know , of the higher rates . When you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and I can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship . While we were together , you know , there was nothing to be feared . Thank God ! I have always been blessed with excellent health , and no climate disagrees with me . A little disordered always the first twenty - four hours of going to sea , but never knew what sickness was afterwards . The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind , the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell , or had any ideas of danger , was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal , when the Admiral ( Captain Croft then ) was in the North Seas . I lived in perpetual fright at that time , and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself , or when I should hear from him next ; but as long as we could be together , nothing ever ailed me , and I never met with the smallest inconvenience . "
26741	26765	26767	26768	Mrs Musgrove	96	" Aye , to be sure . Yes , indeed , oh yes ! I am quite of your opinion , Mrs Croft , "
26773	26821	26767	26768	Mrs Musgrove	96	" There is nothing so bad as a separation . I am quite of your opinion . I know what it is , for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes , and I am so glad when they are over , and he is safe back again . "
27123	27149	27154	27154	he	117	" Oh , no ; never ; she has quite given up dancing . She had rather play . She is never tired of playing . "
27218	27231	27234	27234	she	93	" I beg your pardon , madam , this is your seat ; "
27876	27891	27893	27893	Henrietta	123	" It would not be a great match for her ; but if Henrietta liked him,"--
28136	28236	28135	28135	Charles	95	" had never seen a pleasanter man in his life ; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say , was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war . Here was a fortune at once ; besides which , there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war ; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy . Oh ! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters . "
28237	28244	28246	28246	Mary	94	" Upon my word it would , "
28248	28332	28246	28246	Mary	94	" Dear me ! If he should rise to any very great honours ! If he should ever be made a baronet ! ' Lady Wentworth ' sounds very well . That would be a noble thing , indeed , for Henrietta ! She would take place of me then , and Henrietta would not dislike that . Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth ! It would be but a new creation , however , and I never think much of your new creations . "
28397	28401	28403	28403	she	94	" You know , "
28405	28506	28403	28403	she	94	" I can not think him at all a fit match for Henrietta ; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made , she has no right to throw herself away . I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family , and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them . And , pray , who is Charles Hayter ? Nothing but a country curate . A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross . "
28545	28554	28557	28557	his	2315	" Now you are talking nonsense , Mary , "
28560	28786	28557	28557	his	2315	" It would not be a great match for Henrietta , but Charles has a very fair chance , through the Spicers , of getting something from the Bishop in the course of a year or two ; and you will please to remember , that he is the eldest son ; whenever my uncle dies , he steps into very pretty property . The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres , besides the farm near Taunton , which is some of the best land in the country . I grant you , that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta , and indeed it could not be ; he is the only one that could be possible ; but he is a very good - natured , good sort of a fellow ; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands , he will make a different sort of place of it , and live in a very different sort of way ; and with that property , he will never be a contemptible man -- good , freehold property . No , no ; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter ; and if she has him , and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth , I shall be very well satisfied . "
28787	28795	28797	28797	Mary	94	" Charles may say what he pleases , "
28811	28969	28797	28797	Mary	94	" but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter ; a very bad thing for her , and still worse for me ; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head , and I have very little doubt that he has . She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday . I wish you had been there to see her behaviour . And as to Captain Wentworth 's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta , it is nonsense to say so ; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best . But Charles is so positive ! I wish you had been with us yesterday , for then you might have decided between us ; and I am sure you would have thought as I did , unless you had been determined to give it against me . "
29538	29596	29617	29618	Captain Wentworth	117	" Well , I am very glad indeed : but I always thought you would have it ; I always thought you sure . It did not appear to me that -- in short , you know , Dr Shirley must have a curate , and you had secured his promise . Is he coming , Louisa ? "
29673	29693	29665	29665	he	117	" I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here : Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here , "
29712	29734	29737	29737	Anne	93	" They are up stairs with my sister : they will be down in a few moments , I dare say , "
29799	29808	29786	29786	He	117	" I hope the little boy is better , "
29918	29937	29912	29912	She	93	" How do you do ? Will you not sit down ? The others will be here presently . "
30151	30154	30156	30156	she	804	" Walter , "
30158	30176	30156	30156	she	804	" get down this moment . You are extremely troublesome . I am very angry with you . "
30177	30180	30182	30183	Charles Hayter	95	" Walter , "
30185	30215	30182	30183	Charles Hayter	95	" why do you not do as you are bid ? Do not you hear your aunt speak ? Come to me , Walter , come to cousin Charles . "
30505	30524	30488	30488	his	95	" You ought to have minded me , Walter ; I told you not to teaze your aunt ; "
31110	31133	31134	31134	Anne	93	" Oh , yes , I should like to join you very much , I am very fond of a long walk ; "
31251	31268	31270	31270	Mary	94	" I can not imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk , "
31278	31326	31270	31270	Mary	94	" Everybody is always supposing that I am not a good walker ; and yet they would not have been pleased , if we had refused to join them . When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us , how can one say no ? "
31702	31785	31699	31700	Captain Wentworth	117	" What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister ! They meant to take a long drive this morning ; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills . They talked of coming into this side of the country . I wonder whereabouts they will upset to - day . Oh ! it does happen very often , I assure you ; but my sister makes nothing of it ; she would as lieve be tossed out as not . "
31786	31799	31801	31801	Louisa	124	" Ah ! You make the most of it , I know , "
31803	31862	31801	31801	Louisa	124	" but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place . If I loved a man , as she loves the Admiral , I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else . "
31869	31873	31875	31875	he	987	" Had you ? "
31882	31887	31875	31875	he	987	" I honour you ! "
31974	31985	31959	31959	She	93	" Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop ? "
32141	32172	32138	32138	Mary	94	" Bless me ! here is Winthrop . I declare I had no idea ! Well now , I think we had better turn back ; I am excessively tired . "
32204	32207	32209	32210	Charles Musgrove	96	" No ! "
32213	32218	32220	32220	Louisa	124	" No , no ! "
32322	32348	32318	32318	she	1007	" Oh ! no , indeed ! walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good ; "
32468	32497	32453	32453	Mary	94	" It is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life . "
32817	32944	32792	32792	Louisa	124	" And so , I made her go . I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . What ! would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do , and that I knew to be right , by the airs and interference of such a person , or of any person I may say ? No , I have no idea of being so easily persuaded . When I have made up my mind , I have made it ; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to - day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance ! "
32945	32957	32792	32792	Louisa	124	" She would have turned back then , but for you ? "
32958	32971	32792	32792	Louisa	124	" She would indeed . I am almost ashamed to say it . "
32972	33197	33199	33199	he	1023	" Happy for her , to have such a mind as yours at hand ! After the hints you gave just now , which did but confirm my own observations , the last time I was in company with him , I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on . I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this . Your sister is an amiable creature ; but yours is the character of decision and firmness , I see . If you value her conduct or happiness , infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can . But this , no doubt , you have been always doing . It is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character , that no influence over it can be depended on . You are never sure of a good impression being durable ; everybody may sway it . Let those who would be happy be firm . Here is a nut , "
33209	33246	33247	33247	he	1023	" to exemplify : a beautiful glossy nut , which , blessed with original strength , has outlived all the storms of autumn . Not a puncture , not a weak spot anywhere . This nut , "
33254	33287	33247	33247	he	1023	" while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot , is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of . "
33294	33336	33247	33247	he	1023	tone--"My first wish for all whom I am interested in , is that they should be firm . If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life , she will cherish all her present powers of mind . "
33425	33436	33438	33438	she	124	" Mary is good - natured enough in many respects , "
33440	33492	33438	33438	she	124	" but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride -- the Elliot pride . She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride . We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead . I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne ? "
33502	33511	33407	33407	they	1024	" Do you mean that she refused him ? "
33512	33519	33407	33407	they	1024	" Oh ! yes ; certainly . "
33520	33526	33407	33407	they	1024	" When did that happen ? "
33527	33621	33407	33407	they	1024	" I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary . I wish she had accepted him . We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell 's doing , that she did not . They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell , and that therefore , she persuaded Anne to refuse him . "
34349	34360	34362	34363	Mrs Croft	112	" Miss Elliot , I am sure you are tired , "
34365	34410	34362	34363	Mrs Croft	112	" Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home . Here is excellent room for three , I assure you . If we were all like you , I believe we might sit four . You must , indeed , you must . "
34732	34735	34726	34726	She	222	" Frederick . "
34736	34752	34754	34755	the Admiral	411	" He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , Sophy , "
34757	34856	34754	34755	the Admiral	411	" but there is no saying which . He has been running after them , too , long enough , one would think , to make up his mind . Ay , this comes of the peace . If it were war now , he would have settled it long ago . We sailors , Miss Elliot , can not afford to make long courtships in time of war . How many days was it , my dear , between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth ? "
34857	34869	34871	34872	Mrs Croft	112	" We had better not talk about it , my dear , "
34876	34916	34871	34872	Mrs Croft	112	" for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding , she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together . I had known you by character , however , long before . "
34917	35001	35038	35038	them	1060	" Well , and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl , and what were we to wait for besides ? I do not like having such things so long in hand . I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass , and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch . Then there would always be company for them . And very nice young ladies they both are ; I hardly know one from the other . "
35002	35012	35014	35015	Mrs Croft	112	" Very good humoured , unaffected girls , indeed , "
35046	35076	35014	35015	Mrs Croft	112	" and a very respectable family . One could not be connected with better people . My dear Admiral , that post ! we shall certainly take that post . "
36934	36938	36940	36940	Anne	93	" And yet , "
36954	37012	36940	36940	Anne	93	" he has not , perhaps , a more sorrowing heart than I have . I can not believe his prospects so blighted for ever . He is younger than I am ; younger in feeling , if not in fact ; younger as a man . He will rally again , and be happy with another . "
37311	37320	37326	37326	she	93	" These would have been all my friends , "
37788	37795	37819	37823	the heads of the inn	1176	" so entirely out of season , "
37798	37804	37819	37823	the heads of the inn	1176	" no thoroughfare of Lyme , "
37807	37813	37819	37823	the heads of the inn	1176	" no expectation of company , "
38714	39119	38709	38709	Henrietta	123	" Oh ! yes,--I am quite convinced that , with very few exceptions , the sea - air always does good . There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to Dr Shirley , after his illness , last spring twelve - month . He declares himself , that coming to Lyme for a month , did him more good than all the medicine he took ; and , that being by the sea , always makes him feel young again . Now , I can not help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea . I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely , and fix at Lyme . Do not you , Anne ? Do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and Mrs Shirley ? She has cousins here , you know , and many acquaintance , which would make it cheerful for her , and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand , in case of his having another seizure . Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley , who have been doing good all their lives , wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross , where , excepting our family , they seem shut out from all the world . I wish his friends would propose it to him . I really think they ought . And , as to procuring a dispensation , there could be no difficulty at his time of life , and with his character . My only doubt is , whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish . He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions ; over - scrupulous I must say . Do not you think , Anne , it is being over - scrupulous ? Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience , when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties , which may be just as well performed by another person ? And at Lyme too , only seventeen miles off , he would be near enough to hear , if people thought there was anything to complain of . "
39240	39244	39246	39246	Henrietta	123	" I wish , "
39255	39343	39246	39246	Henrietta	123	" I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross , and were intimate with Dr Shirley . I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody ! I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything ! I am afraid of her , as I have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but I respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross . "
39647	39670	39630	39630	He	117	" That man is struck with you , and even I , at this moment , see something like Anne Elliot again . "
40003	40006	40008	40009	Captain Wentworth	117	" Ah ! "
40021	40030	40008	40009	Captain Wentworth	117	" it is the very man we passed . "
40069	40072	40074	40075	Captain Wentworth	117	" Pray , "
40079	40095	40074	40075	Captain Wentworth	117	" can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away ? "
40096	40148	40060	40061	The waiter	1250	" Yes , Sir , a Mr Elliot , a gentleman of large fortune , came in last night from Sidmouth . Dare say you heard the carriage , sir , while you were at dinner ; and going on now for Crewkherne , in his way to Bath and London . "
40149	40152	40074	40075	Captain Wentworth	117	" Elliot ! "
40184	40188	40190	40190	Mary	94	" Bless me ! "
40192	40264	40267	40268	the waiter	1250	" it must be our cousin ; it must be our Mr Elliot , it must , indeed ! Charles , Anne , must not it ? In mourning , you see , just as our Mr Elliot must be . How very extraordinary ! In the very same inn with us ! Anne , must not it be our Mr Elliot ? my father 's next heir ? Pray sir , "
40270	40289	40267	40268	the waiter	1250	" did not you hear , did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynch family ? "
40290	40322	40181	40182	a waiter	1255	" No , ma'am , he did not mention no particular family ; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman , and would be a baronight some day . "
40323	40329	40331	40331	Mary	94	" There ! you see ! "
40336	40533	40331	40331	Mary	94	" just as I said ! Heir to Sir Walter Elliot ! I was sure that would come out , if it was so . Depend upon it , that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish , wherever he goes . But , Anne , only conceive how extraordinary ! I wish I had looked at him more . I wish we had been aware in time , who it was , that he might have been introduced to us . What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other ! Do you think he had the Elliot countenance ? I hardly looked at him , I was looking at the horses ; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance , I wonder the arms did not strike me ! Oh ! the great - coat was hanging over the panel , and hid the arms , so it did ; otherwise , I am sure , I should have observed them , and the livery too ; if the servant had not been in mourning , one should have known him by the livery . "
40534	40543	40545	40546	Captain Wentworth	117	" Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together , "
40548	40570	40545	40546	Captain Wentworth	117	" we must consider it to be the arrangement of Providence , that you should not be introduced to your cousin . "
40743	40747	40749	40749	Mary	94	" Of course , "
40751	40785	40749	40749	Mary	94	" you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot , the next time you write to Bath . I think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him . "
41047	41051	41053	41053	he	155	" Miss Elliot , "
41059	41112	41053	41053	he	155	" you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much . I wish he could have such company oftener . It is bad for him , I know , to be shut up as he is ; but what can we do ? We can not part . "
41113	41116	41118	41118	Anne	93	" No , "
41120	41173	41118	41118	Anne	93	" that I can easily believe to be impossible ; but in time , perhaps -- we know what time does in every case of affliction , and you must remember , Captain Harville , that your friend may yet be called a young mourner -- only last summer , I understand . "
41174	41180	41039	41039	she	93	" Ay , true enough , "
41187	41191	41039	41039	she	93	" only June . "
41192	41204	41053	41053	he	155	" And not known to him , perhaps , so soon . "
41205	41291	41039	41039	she	93	" Not till the first week of August , when he came home from the Cape , just made into the Grappler . I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him ; he sent in letters , but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth . There the news must follow him , but who was to tell it ? not I. I would as soon have been run up to the yard - arm . Nobody could do it , but that good fellow "
41299	41398	41039	41039	she	93	" The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before ; no danger of her being sent to sea again . He stood his chance for the rest ; wrote up for leave of absence , but without waiting the return , travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth , rowed off to the Grappler that instant , and never left the poor fellow for a week . That 's what he did , and nobody else could have saved poor James . You may think , Miss Elliot , whether he is dear to us ! "
41648	41652	41645	41646	Lord Byron	164	" dark blue seas "
41843	41850	41838	41838	she	124	" I am determined I will : "
41955	41964	41966	41966	Mary	94	" She is dead ! she is dead ! "
42025	42034	42042	42043	Captain Wentworth	117	" Is there no one to help me ? "
42061	42070	42072	42072	Anne	93	" Go to him , go to him , "
42074	42115	42072	42072	Anne	93	" for heaven 's sake go to him . I can support her myself . Leave me , and go to him . Rub her hands , rub her temples ; here are salts ; take them , take them . "
42181	42190	42165	42166	Captain Wentworth	117	" Oh God ! her father and mother ! "
42191	42195	42197	42197	Anne	93	" A surgeon ! "
42215	42225	42165	42166	Captain Wentworth	117	" True , true , a surgeon this instant , "
42234	42257	42165	42166	Captain Wentworth	117	" Captain Benwick , would not it be better for Captain Benwick ? He knows where a surgeon is to be found . "
42462	42467	42469	42469	Charles	96	" Anne , Anne , "
42471	42492	42469	42469	Charles	96	" What is to be done next ? What , in heaven 's name , is to be done next ? "
42503	42527	42579	42580	the workmen	1296	" Had not she better be carried to the inn ? Yes , I am sure : carry her gently to the inn . "
42528	42537	42539	42540	Captain Wentworth	117	" Yes , yes , to the inn , "
42552	42567	42539	42540	Captain Wentworth	117	" I will carry her myself . Musgrove , take care of the others . "
43076	43080	43084	43085	Captain Wentworth	117	" Thank God ! "
43294	43311	43312	43312	they	1305	" putting the children away in the maid 's room , or swinging a cot somewhere , "
43453	43509	43513	43513	they	1328	" Uppercross , the necessity of some one 's going to Uppercross ; the news to be conveyed ; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove ; the lateness of the morning ; an hour already gone since they ought to have been off ; the impossibility of being in tolerable time . "
43539	43578	43532	43533	Captain Wentworth	117	" We must be decided , and without the loss of another minute . Every minute is valuable . Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly . Musgrove , either you or I must go . "
43762	43770	43772	43773	Captain Wentworth	117	" Then it is settled , Musgrove , "
43775	43849	43772	43773	Captain Wentworth	117	" that you stay , and that I take care of your sister home . But as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist Mrs Harville , I think it need be only one . Mrs Charles Musgrove will , of course , wish to get back to her children ; but if Anne will stay , no one so proper , so capable as Anne . "
43881	43897	43899	43899	he	117	" You will stay , I am sure ; you will stay and nurse her ; "
43946	43987	43936	43936	herself	1336	" It was what she had been thinking of , and wishing to be allowed to do . A bed on the floor in Louisa 's room would be sufficient for her , if Mrs Harville would but think so . "
44774	44787	44788	44788	he	155	" Do n't talk of it , do n't talk of it , "
44791	44827	44788	44788	he	155	" Oh God ! that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment ! Had I done as I ought ! But so eager and so resolute ! Dear , sweet Louisa ! "
45043	45105	45041	45041	he	117	" I have been considering what we had best do . She must not appear at first . She could not stand it . I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her , while I go in and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove . Do you think this is a good plan ? "
45398	45486	45376	45376	he	117	" She really left nothing for Mary to do . He and Mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night . Mary had been hysterical again this morning . When he came away , she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good . He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do . "
45773	45789	45757	45757	Anne	93	" What should they do without her ? They were wretched comforters for one another . "
46947	46990	47006	47006	she	93	" I must call on Mrs Croft ; I really must call upon her soon . Anne , have you courage to go with me , and pay a visit in that house ? It will be some trial to us both . "
47011	47050	47006	47006	she	93	" I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two ; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine . By remaining in the neighbourhood , I am become inured to it . "
47201	47237	47192	47192	Anne	93	" These rooms ought to belong only to us . Oh , how fallen in their destination ! How unworthily occupied ! An ancient family to be so driven away ! Strangers filling their place ! "
47554	47605	47546	47547	The Admiral	411	" Ay , a very bad business indeed . A new sort of way this , for a young fellow to be making love , by breaking his mistress 's head , is not it , Miss Elliot ? This is breaking a head and giving a plaster , truly ! "
47637	47648	47650	47650	he	117	" Now , this must be very bad for you , "
47659	47710	47650	47650	he	117	" to be coming and finding us here . I had not recollected it before , I declare , but it must be very bad . But now , do not stand upon ceremony . Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it . "
47711	47724	47546	47547	The Admiral	411	" Another time , Sir , I thank you , not now . "
47725	47768	47771	47771	himself	117	" Well , whenever it suits you . You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time ; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door . A good place is not it ? But , "
47774	47848	47771	47771	himself	117	" you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler 's room . Ay , so it always is , I believe . One man 's ways may be as good as another 's , but we all like our own best . And so you must judge for yourself , whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not . "
47863	47872	47874	47875	the Admiral	411	" We have made very few changes either , "
47882	48041	47874	47875	the Admiral	411	" Very few . We told you about the laundry - door , at Uppercross . That has been a very great improvement . The wonder was , how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did , so long ! You will tell Sir Walter what we have done , and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had . Indeed , I must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better . My wife should have the credit of them , however . I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking - glasses from my dressing - room , which was your father 's . A very good man , and very much the gentleman I am sure : but I should think , Miss Elliot , "
48049	48130	47874	47875	the Admiral	411	" I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life . Such a number of looking - glasses ! oh Lord ! there was no getting away from one 's self . So I got Sophy to lend me a hand , and we soon shifted their quarters ; and now I am quite snug , with my little shaving glass in one corner , and another great thing that I never go near . "
48167	48298	48147	48148	the Admiral	411	" The next time you write to your good father , Miss Elliot , pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft 's , and say that we are settled here quite to our liking , and have no fault at all to find with the place . The breakfast - room chimney smokes a little , I grant you , but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard , which may not happen three times a winter . And take it altogether , now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge , there is not one that we like better than this . Pray say so , with my compliments . He will be glad to hear it . "
48874	49041	48858	48858	Anne	93	" Oh ! Captain Benwick is very well , I believe , but he is a very odd young man . I do not know what he would be at . We asked him to come home with us for a day or two : Charles undertook to give him some shooting , and he seemed quite delighted , and , for my part , I thought it was all settled ; when behold ! on Tuesday night , he made a very awkward sort of excuse ; ' he never shot ' and he had ' been quite misunderstood , ' and he had promised this and he had promised that , and the end of it was , I found , that he did not mean to come . I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull ; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart - broken man as Captain Benwick . "
49048	49067	49042	49042	Charles	95	" Now Mary , you know very well how it really was . It was all your doing , "
49074	49139	49042	49042	Charles	95	" He fancied that if he went with us , he should find you close by : he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross ; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off , his heart failed him , and he had not courage to come . That is the fact , upon my honour . Mary knows it is . "
49220	49228	49230	49230	Charles	95	" Oh ! he talks of you , "
49232	49236	49239	49239	him	95	" in such terms-- "
49241	49274	49239	49239	him	95	" I declare , Charles , I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there . I declare , Anne , he never talks of you at all . "
49275	49278	49280	49280	Charles	95	" No , "
49282	49434	49280	49280	Charles	95	" I do not know that he ever does , in a general way ; but however , it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly . His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation , and he wants to talk to you about them ; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks -- oh ! I can not pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine -- I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it ; and then ' Miss Elliot ' was spoken of in the highest terms ! Now Mary , I declare it was so , I heard it myself , and you were in the other room . ' Elegance , sweetness , beauty . ' Oh ! there was no end of Miss Elliot 's charms . "
49435	49441	49443	49443	Mary	94	" And I am sure , "
49447	49492	49443	49443	Mary	94	" it was a very little to his credit , if he did . Miss Harville only died last June . Such a heart is very little worth having ; is it , Lady Russell ? I am sure you will agree with me . "
49493	49503	49505	49506	Lady Russell	101	" I must see Captain Benwick before I decide , "
49510	49529	49531	49531	Charles	95	" And that you are very likely to do very soon , I can tell you , ma'am , "
49533	49657	49531	49531	Charles	95	" Though he had not nerves for coming away with us , and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here , he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself , you may depend on it . I told him the distance and the road , and I told him of the church 's being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , I thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon . So , I give you notice , Lady Russell . "
49658	49671	49673	49674	Lady Russell	101	" Any acquaintance of Anne 's will always be welcome to me , "
49679	49689	49691	49691	Mary	94	" Oh ! as to being Anne 's acquaintance , "
49693	49714	49691	49691	Mary	94	" I think he is rather my acquaintance , for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight . "
49715	49735	49673	49674	Lady Russell	101	" Well , as your joint acquaintance , then , I shall be very happy to see Captain Benwick . "
49736	49809	49691	49691	Mary	94	" You will not find anything very agreeable in him , I assure you , ma'am . He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived . He has walked with me , sometimes , from one end of the sands to the other , without saying a word . He is not at all a well - bred young man . I am sure you will not like him . "
49810	49817	49819	49819	Anne	93	" There we differ , Mary , "
49821	49854	49819	49819	Anne	93	" I think Lady Russell would like him . I think she would be so much pleased with his mind , that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner . "
49855	49862	49864	49864	Charles	95	" So do I , Anne , "
49866	49897	49864	49864	Charles	95	" I am sure Lady Russell would like him . He is just Lady Russell 's sort . Give him a book , and he will read all day long . "
49898	49905	49907	49907	Mary	94	" Yes , that he will ! "
49911	49952	49907	49907	Mary	94	" He will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drops one 's scissors , or anything that happens . Do you think Lady Russell would like that ? "
49960	49965	49967	49967	she	101	" Upon my word , "
49969	50055	49967	49967	she	101	" I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture , steady and matter of fact as I may call myself . I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions . I wish he may be induced to call here . And when he does , Mary , you may depend upon hearing my opinion ; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand . "
50056	50069	50152	50152	her	94	" You will not like him , I will answer for it . "
50096	50102	50104	50105	Lady Russell	101	" He is a man , "
50107	50142	50104	50105	Lady Russell	101	" whom I have no wish to see . His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family , has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me . "
50907	50917	50919	50920	Lady Russell	101	" I hope I shall remember , in future , "
50932	50943	50919	50920	Lady Russell	101	" not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays . "
51307	51318	51319	51319	She	93	" a man whom she had no wish to see . "
51477	51487	51456	51456	Anne	93	" Oh ! when shall I leave you again ? "
52983	53008	53009	53009	They	1563	" Oh ! yes , perhaps , it had been Mr Elliot . They did not know . It might be him , perhaps . "
53061	53123	53125	53126	Sir Walter	90	" must lament his being very much under - hung , a defect which time seemed to have increased ; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse . Mr Elliot appeared to think that he ( Sir Walter ) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted ; "
53128	53175	53125	53126	Sir Walter	90	" not been able to return the compliment entirely , which had embarrassed him . He did not mean to complain , however . Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men , and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere . "
53193	53215	53219	53221	a Mrs Wallis	173	" Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them ! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should ! "
53249	53264	53243	53244	Mr Elliot	102	" a most charming woman , quite worthy of being known in Camden Place , "
53297	53565	53566	53568	Modest Sir Walter	174	" He longed to see her . He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets . The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women . He did not mean to say that there were no pretty women , but the number of the plain was out of all proportion . He had frequently observed , as he walked , that one handsome face would be followed by thirty , or five - and - thirty frights ; and once , as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street , he had counted eighty - seven women go by , one after another , without there being a tolerable face among them . It had been a frosty morning , to be sure , a sharp frost , which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of . But still , there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath ; and as for the men ! they were infinitely worse . Such scarecrows as the streets were full of ! It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable , by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced . He had never walked anywhere arm - in - arm with Colonel Wallis ( who was a fine military figure , though sandy - haired ) without observing that every woman 's eye was upon him ; every woman 's eye was sure to be upon Colonel Wallis . "
53610	53616	53618	53619	Sir Walter	174	" How is Mary looking ? "
53629	53652	53618	53619	Sir Walter	174	" The last time I saw her she had a red nose , but I hope that may not happen every day . "
53653	53681	53618	53619	Sir Walter	174	" Oh ! no , that must have been quite accidental . In general she has been in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas . "
53682	53712	53618	53619	Sir Walter	174	" If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , I would send her a new hat and pelisse . "
53748	53816	53817	53818	Mrs Clay	105	" A knock at the door ! and so late ! It was ten o'clock . Could it be Mr Elliot ? They knew he was to dine in Lansdown Crescent . It was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did . They could think of no one else . Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot 's knock . "
53888	53912	53875	53876	her sister	476	" he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before , "
53948	53962	53940	53941	Sir Walter	174	" Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter "
54368	54413	54361	54361	Musgrove	144	" Well , it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn , which he had adopted , when quite a young man , on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious . "
54414	54428	54430	54430	he	102	" The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty , "
54432	54489	54430	54430	he	102	" as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing , are more absurd , I believe , than those of any other set of beings in the world . The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view . "
54558	54562	54563	54563	he	102	" an accident , "
54650	54657	54659	54660	the watchman	1592	" eleven with its silver sounds , "
54817	54833	54810	54811	Mrs Clay	105	" now Miss Anne was come , she could not suppose herself at all wanted ; "
54844	54872	54835	54835	Elizabeth	91	" That must not be any reason , indeed . I assure you I feel it none . She is nothing to me , compared with you ; "
54885	54955	54874	54874	she	93	" My dear madam , this must not be . As yet , you have seen nothing of Bath . You have been here only to be useful . You must not run away from us now . You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis , the beautiful Mrs Wallis . To your fine mind , I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification . "
55057	55090	55044	55044	he	274	" less thin in her person , in her cheeks ; her skin , her complexion , greatly improved ; clearer , fresher . Had she been using any thing in particular ? "
55091	55096	55044	55044	he	274	" No , nothing . "
55097	55101	55044	55044	he	274	" Merely Gowland , "
55105	55112	55044	55044	he	274	" No , nothing at all . "
55113	55122	55044	55044	he	274	" Ha ! he was surprised at that ; "
55126	55195	55044	55044	he	274	" certainly you can not do better than to continue as you are ; you can not be better than well ; or I should recommend Gowland , the constant use of Gowland , during the spring months . Mrs Clay has been using it at my recommendation , and you see what it has done for her . You see how it has carried away her freckles . "
55411	55418	55402	55402	she	105	" Can this be Mr Elliot ? "
55781	55784	55785	55786	Lady Russell	101	" Elizabeth . "
55797	55806	55785	55786	Lady Russell	101	reply:--"Elizabeth ! very well ; time will explain . "
55855	55859	55845	55845	she	91	" Miss Elliot , "
56253	56262	56297	56301	the rest of the family	1631	" our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret ; "
56263	56270	56297	56301	the rest of the family	1631	" our cousins , the Dalrymples , "
56463	56550	56558	56558	his	174	" Family connexions were always worth preserving , good company always worth seeking ; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house , for three months , in Laura Place , and would be living in style . She had been at Bath the year before , and Lady Russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman . It was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed , if it could be done , without any compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots . "
56615	56630	56580	56583	his right honourable cousin	1636	" She was very much honoured , and should be happy in their acquaintance . "
56675	56680	56683	56684	Lady Dalrymple	180	" Our cousins in Laura Place,"--"Our
56689	56695	56683	56684	Lady Dalrymple	180	" were talked of to everybody .
56747	56752	56740	56741	Lady Dalrymple	180	" a charming woman , "
56807	56815	56799	56799	she	101	" it was an acquaintance worth having ; "
56873	56910	56868	56868	Anne	93	" My idea of good company , Mr Elliot , is the company of clever , well - informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what I call good company . "
56911	56916	56918	56918	he	102	" You are mistaken , "
56921	57005	56918	56918	he	102	" that is not good company ; that is the best . Good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice . Birth and good manners are essential ; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company ; on the contrary , it will do very well . My cousin Anne shakes her head . She is not satisfied . She is fastidious . My dear cousin "
57013	57131	56868	56868	Anne	93	" you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman I know ; but will it answer ? Will it make you happy ? Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place , and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible ? You may depend upon it , that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter , and as rank is rank , your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family ( our family let me say ) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for . "
57132	57135	57137	57137	Anne	93	" Yes , "
57139	57153	57165	57165	she	93	" we shall , indeed , be known to be related to them ! "
57168	57189	57165	57165	she	93	" I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance . I suppose "
57193	57238	57165	57165	she	93	" I have more pride than any of you ; but I confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them . "
57239	57295	57165	57165	she	93	" Pardon me , dear cousin , you are unjust in your own claims . In London , perhaps , in your present quiet style of living , it might be as you say : but in Bath ; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing : always acceptable as acquaintance . "
57296	57299	57301	57301	Anne	93	" Well , "
57303	57322	57301	57301	Anne	93	" I certainly am proud , too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place . "
57323	57329	57331	57331	he	1643	" I love your indignation , "
57333	57432	57434	57434	he	1643	" it is very natural . But here you are in Bath , and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot . You talk of being proud ; I am called proud , I know , and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise ; for our pride , if investigated , would have the same object , I have no doubt , though the kind may seem a little different . In one point , I am sure , my dear cousin , "
57450	57497	57434	57434	he	1643	" in one point , I am sure , we must feel alike . We must feel that every addition to your father 's society , among his equals or superiors , may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him . "
58814	58818	58820	58821	Mrs Smith	182	" And she , "
58823	59136	58820	58821	Mrs Smith	182	" besides nursing me most admirably , has really proved an invaluable acquaintance . As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit , which has been a great amusement ; and she put me in the way of making these little thread - cases , pin - cushions and card - racks , which you always find me so busy about , and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood . She had a large acquaintance , of course professionally , among those who can afford to buy , and she disposes of my merchandise . She always takes the right time for applying . Everybody 's heart is open , you know , when they have recently escaped from severe pain , or are recovering the blessing of health , and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak . She is a shrewd , intelligent , sensible woman . Hers is a line for seeing human nature ; and she has a fund of good sense and observation , which , as a companion , make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received ' the best education in the world , ' know nothing worth attending to . Call it gossip , if you will , but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour 's leisure to bestow on me , she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable : something that makes one know one 's species better . One likes to hear what is going on , to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly . To me , who live so much alone , her conversation , I assure you , is a treat . "
59150	59271	59137	59137	Anne	93	" I can easily believe it . Women of that class have great opportunities , and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to . Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing ! And it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting . What instances must pass before them of ardent , disinterested , self - denying attachment , of heroism , fortitude , patience , resignation : of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most . A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes . "
59272	59275	59277	59278	Mrs Smith	182	" Yes , "
59282	59363	59277	59278	Mrs Smith	182	" sometimes it may , though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe . Here and there , human nature may be great in times of trial ; but generally speaking , it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber : it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude , that one hears of . There is so little real friendship in the world ! and unfortunately "
59370	59387	59277	59278	Mrs Smith	182	" there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late . "
59453	59553	59441	59441	she	182	" I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me . She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings ; a mere pretty , silly , expensive , fashionable woman , I believe ; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery . I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis , however . She has plenty of money , and I intend she shall buy all the high - priced things I have in hand now . "
59682	59694	59674	59674	she	180	alacrity--"She was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow . "
59734	59738	59740	59740	he	90	" Westgate Buildings ! "
59742	59878	59740	59740	he	90	" and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be visiting in Westgate Buildings ? A Mrs Smith . A widow Mrs Smith ; and who was her husband ? One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere . And what is her attraction ? That she is old and sickly . Upon my word , Miss Anne Elliot , you have the most extraordinary taste ! Everything that revolts other people , low company , paltry rooms , foul air , disgusting associations are inviting to you . But surely you may put off this old lady till to - morrow : she is not so near her end , I presume , but that she may hope to see another day . What is her age ? Forty ? "
59879	59948	59719	59721	this old schoolfellow	1708	" No , sir , she is not one - and - thirty ; but I do not think I can put off my engagement , because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself . She goes into the warm bath to - morrow , and for the rest of the week , you know , we are engaged . "
59949	59960	59962	59962	Elizabeth	91	" But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance ? "
59964	59973	59975	59975	Anne	93	" She sees nothing to blame in it , "
59977	59999	59975	59975	Anne	93	" on the contrary , she approves it , and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs Smith . "
60000	60020	60022	60023	Sir Walter	90	" Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement , "
60025	60142	60022	60023	Sir Walter	90	" Sir Henry Russell 's widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot . A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings ! A poor widow barely able to live , between thirty and forty ; a mere Mrs Smith , an every - day Mrs Smith , of all people and all names in the world , to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot , and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland ! Mrs Smith ! Such a name ! "
60660	60673	60675	60676	Lady Russell	101	" I am no match - maker , as you well know , "
60678	60754	60675	60676	Lady Russell	101	" being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations . I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together . A most suitable connection everybody must consider it , but I think it might be a very happy one . "
60755	60774	60776	60776	Anne	93	" Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man , and in many respects I think highly of him , "
60778	60785	60776	60776	Anne	93	" but we should not suit . "
60798	60933	60786	60787	Lady Russell	101	" I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future Lady Elliot , to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother 's place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me . You are your mother 's self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued ! My dearest Anne , it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! "
60996	60999	60985	60986	her mother	263	" Lady Elliot "
61097	61100	61117	61117	her	93	" Lady Elliot "
61784	61789	61791	61792	Sir Walter	90	" What is this ? "
61794	61814	61791	61792	Sir Walter	90	" The Crofts have arrived in Bath ? The Crofts who rent Kellynch ? What have they brought you ? "
61815	61824	61875	61877	the poor Admiral	1749	" A letter from Uppercross Cottage , Sir . "
61825	61861	61791	61792	Sir Walter	90	" Oh ! those letters are convenient passports . They secure an introduction . I should have visited Admiral Croft , however , at any rate . I know what is due to my tenant . "
61895	61899	61875	61877	the poor Admiral	1749	" February 1st . "
61900	62474	61875	61877	the poor Admiral	1749	" My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence , because I know how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath . You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross , which , as you well know , affords little to write about . We have had a very dull Christmas ; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays . I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody . The holidays , however , are over at last : I believe no children ever had such long ones . I am sure I had not . The house was cleared yesterday , except of the little Harvilles ; but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home . Mrs Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long . I do not understand it . They are not at all nice children , in my opinion ; but Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well , if not better , than her grandchildren . What dreadful weather we have had ! It may not be felt in Bath , with your nice pavements ; but in the country it is of some consequence . I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January , except Charles Hayter , who had been calling much oftener than was welcome . Between ourselves , I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa ; it would have kept her a little out of his way . The carriage is gone to - day , to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to - morrow . We are not asked to dine with them , however , till the day after , Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey , which is not very likely , considering the care that will be taken of her ; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to - morrow . I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable , and wish I could be acquainted with him too ; but I have my usual luck : I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on ; always the last of my family to be noticed . What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth ! Does she never mean to go away ? But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant , we might not be invited . Let me know what you think of this . I do not expect my children to be asked , you know . I can leave them at the Great House very well , for a month or six weeks . I have this moment heard that the Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately ; they think the Admiral gouty . Charles heard it quite by chance ; they have not had the civility to give me any notice , or of offering to take anything . I do not think they improve at all as neighbours . We see nothing of them , and this is really an instance of gross inattention . Charles joins me in love , and everything proper . Yours affectionately , "
62475	62479	61875	61877	the poor Admiral	1749	" Mary M--- . "
62480	62539	61875	61877	the poor Admiral	1749	" I am sorry to say that I am very far from well ; and Jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore - throat very much about . I dare say I shall catch it ; and my sore - throats , you know , are always worse than anybody 's . "
62561	63053	63103	63103	she	188	" I kept my letter open , that I might send you word how Louisa bore her journey , and now I am extremely glad I did , having a great deal to add . In the first place , I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday , offering to convey anything to you ; a very kind , friendly note indeed , addressed to me , just as it ought ; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like . The Admiral does not seem very ill , and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants . I shall be truly glad to have them back again . Our neighbourhood can not spare such a pleasant family . But now for Louisa . I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little . She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely , and in the evening we went to ask her how she did , when we were rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party , for he had been invited as well as the Harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ? Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa , and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove ; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by Captain Harville . True , upon my honour ! Are not you astonished ? I shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it , for I never did . Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter . We are all very well pleased , however , for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth , it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter ; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent , and Captain Benwick is expected to - day . Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister 's account ; but , however , Louisa is a great favourite with both . Indeed , Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her . Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say ; but if you remember , I never thought him attached to Louisa ; I never could see anything of it . And this is the end , you see , of Captain Benwick 's being supposed to be an admirer of yours . How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me . I hope he will be more agreeable now . Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove , but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters . "
63179	63184	63186	63186	Elizabeth	91	" How is Mary ? "
63195	63205	63186	63186	Elizabeth	91	" And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath ? "
63206	63222	63149	63149	they	2421	" They come on the Admiral 's account . He is thought to be gouty . "
63223	63228	63230	63231	Sir Walter	90	" Gout and decrepitude ! "
63233	63238	63230	63231	Sir Walter	90	" Poor old gentleman . "
63239	63246	63248	63248	Elizabeth	91	" Have they any acquaintance here ? "
63250	63289	63149	63149	they	2421	" I do not know ; but I can hardly suppose that , at Admiral Croft 's time of life , and in his profession , he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this . "
63290	63294	63296	63297	Sir Walter	90	" I suspect , "
63300	63332	63296	63297	Sir Walter	90	" that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall . Elizabeth , may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place ? "
63333	63434	63470	63473	her fine little boys	1755	" Oh , no ! I think not . Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple , cousins , we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve . If we were not related , it would not signify ; but as cousins , she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours . We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level . There are several odd - looking men walking about here , who , I am told , are sailors . The Crofts will associate with them . "
64527	64672	64520	64520	his	411	" Ha ! is it you ? Thank you , thank you . This is treating me like a friend . Here I am , you see , staring at a picture . I can never get by this shop without stopping . But what a thing here is , by way of a boat ! Do look at it . Did you ever see the like ? What queer fellows your fine painters must be , to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that ? And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease , and looking about them at the rocks and mountains , as if they were not to be upset the next moment , which they certainly must be . I wonder where that boat was built ! "
64678	64691	64520	64520	his	411	" I would not venture over a horsepond in it . Well , "
64697	64723	64520	64520	his	411	" now , where are you bound ? Can I go anywhere for you , or with you ? Can I be of any use ? "
64724	64754	64520	64520	his	411	" None , I thank you , unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together . I am going home . "
64755	64824	64520	64520	his	411	" That I will , with all my heart , and farther , too . Yes , yes we will have a snug walk together , and I have something to tell you as we go along . There , take my arm ; that 's right ; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there . Lord ! what a boat it is ! "
64841	64855	64520	64520	his	411	" Did you say that you had something to tell me , sir ? "
64856	65192	64520	64520	his	411	" Yes , I have , presently . But here comes a friend , Captain Brigden ; I shall only say , ' How d'ye do ? ' as we pass , however . I shall not stop . ' How d'ye do ? ' Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife . She , poor soul , is tied by the leg . She has a blister on one of her heels , as large as a three - shilling piece . If you look across the street , you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother . Shabby fellows , both of them ! I am glad they are not on this side of the way . Sophy can not bear them . They played me a pitiful trick once : got away with some of my best men . I will tell you the whole story another time . There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson . Look , he sees us ; he kisses his hand to you ; he takes you for my wife . Ah ! the peace has come too soon for that younker . Poor old Sir Archibald ! How do you like Bath , Miss Elliot ? It suits us very well . We are always meeting with some old friend or other ; the streets full of them every morning ; sure to have plenty of chat ; and then we get away from them all , and shut ourselves in our lodgings , and draw in our chairs , and are as snug as if we were at Kellynch , ay , or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal . We do not like our lodgings here the worse , I can tell you , for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth . The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way . "
65286	65360	65284	65284	he	1785	" Well , now you shall hear something that will surprise you . But first of all , you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about . That young lady , you know , that we have all been so concerned for . The Miss Musgrove , that all this has been happening to . Her Christian name : I always forget her Christian name . "
65385	65388	65378	65378	she	93	" Louisa . "
65389	65613	65271	65271	his	1785	" Ay , ay , Miss Louisa Musgrove , that is the name . I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names . I should never be out if they were all Sophys , or something of that sort . Well , this Miss Louisa , we all thought , you know , was to marry Frederick . He was courting her week after week . The only wonder was , what they could be waiting for , till the business at Lyme came ; then , indeed , it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right . But even then there was something odd in their way of going on . Instead of staying at Lyme , he went off to Plymouth , and then he went off to see Edward . When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward 's , and there he has been ever since . We have seen nothing of him since November . Even Sophy could not understand it . But now , the matter has taken the strangest turn of all ; for this young lady , the same Miss Musgrove , instead of being to marry Frederick , is to marry James Benwick . You know James Benwick . "
65614	65627	65378	65378	she	93	" A little . I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick . "
65628	65657	65271	65271	his	1785	" Well , she is to marry him . Nay , most likely they are married already , for I do not know what they should wait for . "
65658	65669	65671	65671	Anne	93	" I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man , "
65673	65684	65671	65671	Anne	93	" and I understand that he bears an excellent character . "
65685	65781	65271	65271	his	1785	" Oh ! yes , yes , there is not a word to be said against James Benwick . He is only a commander , it is true , made last summer , and these are bad times for getting on , but he has not another fault that I know of . An excellent , good - hearted fellow , I assure you ; a very active , zealous officer too , which is more than you would think for , perhaps , for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice . "
65782	65822	65671	65671	Anne	93	" Indeed you are mistaken there , sir ; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick 's manners . I thought them particularly pleasing , and I will answer for it , they would generally please . "
65823	65878	65271	65271	his	1785	" Well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality , Sophy and I can not help thinking Frederick 's manners better than his . There is something about Frederick more to our taste . "
65934	65947	65928	65928	she	93	" I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends , "
65954	66023	65949	65950	the Admiral	411	" And the thing is certainly true . It is not a mere bit of gossip . We have it from Frederick himself . His sister had a letter from him yesterday , in which he tells us of it , and he had just had it in a letter from Harville , written upon the spot , from Uppercross . I fancy they are all at Uppercross . "
66039	66122	66034	66034	she	93	" I hope , Admiral , I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth 's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy . It did seem , last autumn , as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove ; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally , and without violence . I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill - used man . "
66123	66145	66034	66034	she	93	" Not at all , not at all ; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end . "
66154	66194	66034	66034	she	93	" No , no ; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that . If the girl likes another man better , it is very fit she should have him . "
66195	66276	66034	66034	she	93	" Certainly . But what I mean is , that I hope there is nothing in Captain Wentworth 's manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill - used by his friend , which might appear , you know , without its being absolutely said . I should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be destroyed , or even wounded , by a circumstance of this sort . "
66277	66388	66034	66034	she	93	" Yes , yes , I understand you . But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter . He does not give the least fling at Benwick ; does not so much as say , ' I wonder at it , I have a reason of my own for wondering at it . ' No , you would not guess , from his way of writing , that he had ever thought of this Miss ( what 's her name ? ) for himself . He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together ; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that , I think . "
66438	66442	66444	66444	he	411	" Poor Frederick ! "
66448	66540	66444	66444	he	411	" Now he must begin all over again with somebody else . I think we must get him to Bath . Sophy must write , and beg him to come to Bath . Here are pretty girls enough , I am sure . It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again , for that other Miss Musgrove , I find , is bespoke by her cousin , the young parson . Do not you think , Miss Elliot , we had better try to get him to Bath ? "
67712	67720	67722	67722	her	93	" I am much obliged to you , "
67725	67749	67722	67722	her	93	" but I am not going with them . The carriage would not accommodate so many . I walk : I prefer walking . "
67750	67755	67773	67773	he	117	" But it rains . "
67756	67767	67722	67722	her	93	" Oh ! very little , Nothing that I regard . "
67776	67795	67773	67773	he	117	" Though I came only yesterday , I have equipped myself properly for Bath already , you see , "
67804	67837	67773	67773	he	117	" I wish you would make use of it , if you are determined to walk ; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair . "
67868	67889	67852	67852	her	93	" I am only waiting for Mr Elliot . He will be here in a moment , I am sure . "
68014	68020	68024	68024	she	93	" Good morning to you ! "
68055	68067	68024	68024	she	93	" Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin , I fancy ? "
68068	68109	68024	68024	she	93	" Oh ! no , that is clear enough . One can guess what will happen there . He is always with them ; half lives in the family , I believe . What a very good - looking man ! "
68110	68140	68024	68024	she	93	" Yes , and Miss Atkinson , who dined with him once at the Wallises , says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with . "
68141	68183	68024	68024	she	93	" She is pretty , I think ; Anne Elliot ; very pretty , when one comes to look at her . It is not the fashion to say so , but I confess I admire her more than her sister . "
68184	68190	68024	68024	she	93	" Oh ! so do I. "
68191	68216	68024	68024	she	93	" And so do I. No comparison . But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot . Anne is too delicate for them . "
68807	68817	68800	68801	Lady Russell	101	" Now , how would she speak of him ? "
68818	68823	68825	68825	she	93	" You will wonder , "
68827	68935	68825	68825	she	93	" what has been fixing my eye so long ; but I was looking after some window - curtains , which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night . They described the drawing - room window - curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way , and this part of the street , as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath , but could not recollect the exact number , and I have been trying to find out which it could be ; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description . "
69233	69238	69240	69240	she	182	" By all means , "
69242	69260	69240	69240	she	182	" only tell me all about it , when you do come . Who is your party ? "
69290	69332	69274	69274	she	182	" Well , I heartily wish your concert may answer ; and do not fail me to - morrow if you can come ; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you . "
69463	69469	69461	69461	her	93	" How do you do ? "
69702	69737	69700	69700	he	117	" I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme . I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock , and the more from its not overpowering you at the time . "
69746	69753	69755	69755	he	117	" It was a frightful hour , "
69757	69762	69755	69755	he	117	" a frightful day ! "
69792	69855	69764	69764	he	117	" The day has produced some effects however ; has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful . When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon , you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery . "
69856	69889	69742	69742	she	93	" Certainly I could have none . But it appears -- I should hope it would be a very happy match . There are on both sides good principles and good temper . "
69890	69893	69895	69895	he	117	" Yes , "
69902	69992	69895	69895	he	117	" but there , I think , ends the resemblance . With all my soul I wish them happy , and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it . They have no difficulties to contend with at home , no opposition , no caprice , no delays . The Musgroves are behaving like themselves , most honourably and kindly , only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter 's comfort . All this is much , very much in favour of their happiness ; more than perhaps-- "
70036	70243	70033	70033	he	117	" I confess that I do think there is a disparity , too great a disparity , and in a point no less essential than mind . I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable , sweet - tempered girl , and not deficient in understanding , but Benwick is something more . He is a clever man , a reading man ; and I confess , that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise . Had it been the effect of gratitude , had he learnt to love her , because he believed her to be preferring him , it would have been another thing . But I have no reason to suppose it so . It seems , on the contrary , to have been a perfectly spontaneous , untaught feeling on his side , and this surprises me . A man like him , in his situation ! with a heart pierced , wounded , almost broken ! Fanny Harville was a very superior creature , and his attachment to her was indeed attachment . A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman . He ought not ; he does not . "
70386	70398	70378	70378	she	93	" You were a good while at Lyme , I think ? "
70399	70484	70378	70378	she	93	" About a fortnight . I could not leave it till Louisa 's doing well was quite ascertained . I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace . It had been my doing , solely mine . She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak . The country round Lyme is very fine . I walked and rode a great deal ; and the more I saw , the more I found to admire . "
70485	70496	70498	70498	Anne	93	" I should very much like to see Lyme again , "
70500	70556	70378	70378	she	93	" Indeed ! I should not have supposed that you could have found anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling . The horror and distress you were involved in , the stretch of mind , the wear of spirits ! I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust . "
70557	70566	70568	70568	Anne	93	" The last hours were certainly very painful , "
70570	70678	70568	70568	Anne	93	" but when pain is over , the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure . One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it , unless it has been all suffering , nothing but suffering , which was by no means the case at Lyme . We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours , and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment . So much novelty and beauty ! I have travelled so little , that every fresh place would be interesting to me ; but there is real beauty at Lyme ; and in short "
70689	70700	70568	70568	Anne	93	" altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable . "
70722	70729	70568	70568	Anne	93	" Lady Dalrymple , Lady Dalrymple , "
70995	71043	70983	70983	he	117	" they should meet again . He would look for her , he would find her out before the evening were over , and at present , perhaps , it was as well to be asunder . She was in need of a little interval for recollection . "
71682	71685	71687	71687	she	93	" This , "
71689	71749	71687	71687	she	93	" is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an Italian love - song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give ; for I do not pretend to understand the language . I am a very poor Italian scholar . "
71750	71813	71663	71663	she	93	" Yes , yes , I see you are . I see you know nothing of the matter . You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted , transposed , curtailed Italian lines , into clear , comprehensible , elegant English . You need not say anything more of your ignorance . Here is complete proof . "
71814	71836	71687	71687	she	93	" I will not oppose such kind politeness ; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient . "
71837	71852	71854	71854	he	102	" I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long , "
71856	71903	71854	71854	he	102	" without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot ; and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments , and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman . "
71904	71926	71687	71687	she	93	" For shame ! for shame ! this is too much flattery . I forget what we are to have next , "
71932	71935	71937	71938	Mr Elliot	102	" Perhaps , "
71943	71959	71937	71938	Mr Elliot	102	" I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of . "
71960	71994	71854	71854	he	102	" Indeed ! How so ? You can have been acquainted with it only since I came to Bath , excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family . "
71995	72048	71937	71938	Mr Elliot	102	" I knew you by report long before you came to Bath . I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately . I have been acquainted with you by character many years . Your person , your disposition , accomplishments , manner ; they were all present to me . "
72121	72191	72196	72197	no one	479	" No , no , some time or other , perhaps , but not now . He would mention no names now ; but such , he could assure her , had been the fact . He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her . "
72242	72249	72251	72251	he	102	" The name of Anne Elliot , "
72253	72292	72251	72251	he	102	" has long had an interesting sound to me . Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy ; and , if I dared , I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change . "
72337	72344	72346	72347	Sir Walter	90	" A well - looking man , "
72349	72357	72346	72347	Sir Walter	90	" a very well - looking man . "
72358	72366	72368	72369	Lady Dalrymple	180	" A very fine young man indeed ! "
72371	72387	72368	72369	Lady Dalrymple	180	" More air than one often sees in Bath . Irish , I dare say . "
72388	72424	72346	72347	Sir Walter	90	" No , I just know his name . A bowing acquaintance . Wentworth ; Captain Wentworth of the navy . His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire , the Croft , who rents Kellynch . "
73337	73359	73325	73326	Captain Wentworth	117	" He must wish her good night ; he was going ; he should get home as fast as he could . "
73360	73369	73371	73371	Anne	93	" Is not this song worth staying for ? "
73388	73391	73392	73392	he	117	" No ! "
73396	73405	73407	73407	he	117	" there is nothing worth my staying for ; "
73930	73940	73942	73942	she	93	" The little Durands were there , I conclude , "
73944	73968	73942	73942	she	93	" with their mouths open to catch the music , like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed . They never miss a concert . "
73969	73991	74225	74225	she	93	" Yes ; I did not see them myself , but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in the room . "
73992	74021	73942	73942	she	93	" The Ibbotsons , were they there ? and the two new beauties , with the tall Irish officer , who is talked of for one of them . "
74022	74035	74225	74225	she	93	" I do not know . I do not think they were . "
74036	74095	73942	73942	she	93	" Old Lady Mary Maclean ? I need not ask after her . She never misses , I know ; and you must have seen her . She must have been in your own circle ; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple , you were in the seats of grandeur , round the orchestra , of course . "
74096	74157	74225	74225	she	93	" No , that was what I dreaded . It would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect . But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be farther off ; and we were exceedingly well placed , that is , for hearing ; I must not say for seeing , because I appear to have seen very little . "
74158	74207	73942	73942	she	93	" Oh ! you saw enough for your own amusement . I can understand . There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd , and this you had . You were a large party in yourselves , and you wanted nothing beyond . "
74208	74219	74221	74221	Anne	93	" But I ought to have looked about me more , "
74247	74304	74225	74225	she	93	" No , no ; you were better employed . You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening . I see it in your eye . I perfectly see how the hours passed : that you had always something agreeable to listen to . In the intervals of the concert it was conversation . "
74311	74320	74305	74305	Anne	93	" Do you see that in my eye ? "
74321	74372	74225	74225	she	93	" Yes , I do . Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world , the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together . "
74385	74392	74394	74395	Mrs Smith	182	" And such being the case , "
74402	74449	74394	74395	Mrs Smith	182	" I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning . It is really very good of you to come and sit with me , when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time . "
74489	74492	74494	74495	Mrs Smith	182	" Pray , "
74497	74517	74494	74495	Mrs Smith	182	" is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me ? Does he know that I am in Bath ? "
74518	74522	74524	74524	Anne	93	" Mr Elliot ! "
74564	74572	74550	74550	her	93	" Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot ? "
74573	74584	74586	74587	Mrs Smith	182	" I have been a good deal acquainted with him , "
74591	74608	74586	74587	Mrs Smith	182	" but it seems worn out now . It is a great while since we met . "
74609	74643	74550	74550	her	93	" I was not at all aware of this . You never mentioned it before . Had I known it , I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you . "
74644	74650	74652	74653	Mrs Smith	182	" To confess the truth , "
74662	74728	74652	74653	Mrs Smith	182	" that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have . I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot . I want your interest with him . He can be of essential service to me ; and if you would have the goodness , my dear Miss Elliot , to make it an object to yourself , of course it is done . "
74729	74754	74756	74756	Anne	93	" I should be extremely happy ; I hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you , "
74758	74843	74756	74756	Anne	93	" but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot , a greater right to influence him , than is really the case . I am sure you have , somehow or other , imbibed such a notion . You must consider me only as Mr Elliot 's relation . If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me . "
74858	74940	74652	74653	Mrs Smith	182	" I have been a little premature , I perceive ; I beg your pardon . I ought to have waited for official information . But now , my dear Miss Elliot , as an old friend , do give me a hint as to when I may speak . Next week ? To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled , and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot 's good fortune . "
74941	74944	74946	74946	Anne	93	" No , "
74948	74997	74946	74946	Anne	93	" nor next week , nor next , nor next . I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week . I am not going to marry Mr Elliot . I should like to know why you imagine I am ? "
75016	75171	74652	74653	Mrs Smith	182	" Now , how I do wish I understood you ! How I do wish I knew what you were at ! I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel , when the right moment occurs . Till it does come , you know , we women never mean to have anybody . It is a thing of course among us , that every man is refused , till he offers . But why should you be cruel ? Let me plead for my -- present friend I can not call him , but for my former friend . Where can you look for a more suitable match ? Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike , agreeable man ? Let me recommend Mr Elliot . I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis ; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis ? "
75172	75207	74652	74653	Mrs Smith	182	" My dear Mrs Smith , Mr Elliot 's wife has not been dead much above half a year . He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one . "
75208	75218	75220	75221	Mrs Smith	182	" Oh ! if these are your only objections , "
75225	75410	75220	75221	Mrs Smith	182	" Mr Elliot is safe , and I shall give myself no more trouble about him . Do not forget me when you are married , that 's all . Let him know me to be a friend of yours , and then he will think little of the trouble required , which it is very natural for him now , with so many affairs and engagements of his own , to avoid and get rid of as he can ; very natural , perhaps . Ninety - nine out of a hundred would do the same . Of course , he can not be aware of the importance to me . Well , my dear Miss Elliot , I hope and trust you will be very happy . Mr Elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman . Your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been . You are safe in all worldly matters , and safe in his character . He will not be led astray ; he will not be misled by others to his ruin . "
75411	75414	75416	75416	Anne	93	" No , "
75418	75609	75416	75416	Anne	93	" I can readily believe all that of my cousin . He seems to have a calm decided temper , not at all open to dangerous impressions . I consider him with great respect . I have no reason , from any thing that has fallen within my observation , to do otherwise . But I have not known him long ; and he is not a man , I think , to be known intimately soon . Will not this manner of speaking of him , Mrs Smith , convince you that he is nothing to me ? Surely this must be calm enough . And , upon my word , he is nothing to me . Should he ever propose to me ( which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing ) , I shall not accept him . I assure you I shall not . I assure you , Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing , in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford : not Mr Elliot ; it is not Mr Elliot that-- "
75719	75731	75695	75695	she	1913	" Do tell me how it first came into your head . "
75732	75740	75742	75743	Mrs Smith	182	" It first came into my head , "
75745	75809	75742	75743	Mrs Smith	182	" upon finding how much you were together , and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you ; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way . But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago . "
75810	75819	75695	75695	she	1913	" And has it indeed been spoken of ? "
75820	75837	75742	75743	Mrs Smith	182	" Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday ? "
75838	75861	75695	75695	she	1913	" No . Was not it Mrs Speed , as usual , or the maid ? I observed no one in particular . "
75862	75959	75742	75743	Mrs Smith	182	" It was my friend Mrs Rooke ; Nurse Rooke ; who , by - the - bye , had a great curiosity to see you , and was delighted to be in the way to let you in . She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday ; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot . She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself , which did not seem bad authority . She sat an hour with me on Monday evening , and gave me the whole history . "
75960	75965	75967	75967	Anne	93	" The whole history , "
75971	75993	75967	75967	Anne	93	" She could not make a very long history , I think , of one such little article of unfounded news . "
75999	76002	76004	76004	Anne	93	" But , "
76008	76057	76004	76004	Anne	93	" though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot , I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could . Shall I mention to him your being in Bath ? Shall I take any message ? "
76058	76115	75742	75743	Mrs Smith	182	" No , I thank you : no , certainly not . In the warmth of the moment , and under a mistaken impression , I might , perhaps , have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances ; but not now . No , I thank you , I have nothing to trouble you with . "
76116	76129	76004	76004	Anne	93	" I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years ? "
76130	76134	75742	75743	Mrs Smith	182	" I did . "
76135	76145	76004	76004	Anne	93	" Not before he was married , I suppose ? "
76146	76159	75742	75743	Mrs Smith	182	" Yes ; he was not married when I knew him first . "
76160	76168	76004	76004	Anne	93	" And -- were you much acquainted ? "
76169	76172	75742	75743	Mrs Smith	182	" Intimately . "
76173	76216	76004	76004	Anne	93	" Indeed ! Then do tell me what he was at that time of life . I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man . Was he at all such as he appears now ? "
76217	76228	75742	75743	Mrs Smith	182	" I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years , "
76274	76285	76286	76286	she	182	" I beg your pardon , my dear Miss Elliot , "
76296	76576	76286	76286	she	182	" I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you , but I have been uncertain what I ought to do . I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you . There were many things to be taken into the account . One hates to be officious , to be giving bad impressions , making mischief . Even the smooth surface of family - union seems worth preserving , though there may be nothing durable beneath . However , I have determined ; I think I am right ; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot 's real character . Though I fully believe that , at present , you have not the smallest intention of accepting him , there is no saying what may happen . You might , some time or other , be differently affected towards him . Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced . Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience ; a designing , wary , cold - blooded being , who thinks only of himself ; whom for his own interest or ease , would be guilty of any cruelty , or any treachery , that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character . He has no feeling for others . Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin , he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction . He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion . Oh ! he is black at heart , hollow and black ! "
76600	76863	76597	76597	she	93	" My expressions startle you . You must allow for an injured , angry woman . But I will try to command myself . I will not abuse him . I will only tell you what I have found him . Facts shall speak . He was the intimate friend of my dear husband , who trusted and loved him , and thought him as good as himself . The intimacy had been formed before our marriage . I found them most intimate friends ; and I , too , became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot , and entertained the highest opinion of him . At nineteen , you know , one does not think very seriously ; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others , and much more agreeable than most others , and we were almost always together . We were principally in town , living in very good style . He was then the inferior in circumstances ; he was then the poor one ; he had chambers in the Temple , and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman . He had always a home with us whenever he chose it ; he was always welcome ; he was like a brother . My poor Charles , who had the finest , most generous spirit in the world , would have divided his last farthing with him ; and I know that his purse was open to him ; I know that he often assisted him . "
76864	76879	76881	76881	Anne	93	" This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot 's life , "
76883	76969	76881	76881	Anne	93	" which has always excited my particular curiosity . It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister . I never knew him myself ; I only heard of him ; but there was a something in his conduct then , with regard to my father and sister , and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage , which I never could quite reconcile with present times . It seemed to announce a different sort of man . "
76970	76981	76983	76984	Mrs Smith	182	" I know it all , I know it all , "
76986	77140	76983	76984	Mrs Smith	182	" He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him , but I heard him speak of them for ever . I know he was invited and encouraged , and I know he did not choose to go . I can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , I knew all about it at the time . I was privy to all the fors and againsts ; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans ; and though I did not know his wife previously , her inferior situation in society , indeed , rendered that impossible , yet I knew her all her life afterwards , or at least till within the last two years of her life , and can answer any question you may wish to put . "
77141	77144	77146	77146	Anne	93	" Nay , "
77148	77218	77146	77146	Anne	93	" I have no particular enquiry to make about her . I have always understood they were not a happy couple . But I should like to know why , at that time of his life , he should slight my father 's acquaintance as he did . My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him . Why did Mr Elliot draw back ? "
77219	77223	77225	77226	Mrs Smith	182	" Mr Elliot , "
77228	77430	77225	77226	Mrs Smith	182	" at that period of his life , had one object in view : to make his fortune , and by a rather quicker process than the law . He was determined to make it by marriage . He was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and I know it was his belief ( whether justly or not , of course I can not decide ) , that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence . That was his motive for drawing back , I can assure you . He told me the whole story . He had no concealments with me . It was curious , that having just left you behind me in Bath , my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin ; and that , through him , I should be continually hearing of your father and sister . He described one Miss Elliot , and I thought very affectionately of the other . "
77431	77434	77436	77436	Anne	93	" Perhaps , "
77444	77454	77436	77436	Anne	93	" you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot ? "
77455	77485	77225	77226	Mrs Smith	182	" To be sure I did ; very often . I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot , and vouch for your being a very different creature from-- "
77493	77505	77507	77507	Anne	93	" This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night , "
77509	77581	77507	77507	Anne	93	" This explains it . I found he had been used to hear of me . I could not comprehend how . What wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned ! How sure to be mistaken ! But I beg your pardon ; I have interrupted you . Mr Elliot married then completely for money ? The circumstances , probably , which first opened your eyes to his character . "
77589	77704	77582	77583	Mrs Smith	182	" Oh ! those things are too common . When one lives in the world , a man or woman 's marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought . I was very young , and associated only with the young , and we were a thoughtless , gay set , without any strict rules of conduct . We lived for enjoyment . I think differently now ; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions ; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing . ' To do the best for himself , ' passed as a duty . "
77705	77715	77225	77226	Mrs Smith	182	" But was not she a very low woman ? "
77716	77965	77582	77583	Mrs Smith	182	" Yes ; which I objected to , but he would not regard . Money , money , was all that he wanted . Her father was a grazier , her grandfather had been a butcher , but that was all nothing . She was a fine woman , had had a decent education , was brought forward by some cousins , thrown by chance into Mr Elliot 's company , and fell in love with him ; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side , with respect to her birth . All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune , before he committed himself . Depend upon it , whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now , as a young man he had not the smallest value for it . His chance for the Kellynch estate was something , but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt . I have often heard him declare , that if baronetcies were saleable , anybody should have his for fifty pounds , arms and motto , name and livery included ; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject . It would not be fair ; and yet you ought to have proof , for what is all this but assertion , and you shall have proof . "
77966	77978	77980	77980	Anne	93	" Indeed , my dear Mrs Smith , I want none , "
77982	78030	77980	77980	Anne	93	" You have asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago . This is all in confirmation , rather , of what we used to hear and believe . I am more curious to know why he should be so different now . "
78031	78086	78101	78101	she	93	" But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary ; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . "
78127	78287	78115	78116	Mrs Smith	182	" This is full of papers belonging to him , to my husband ; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him . The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine . But he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when I came to examine his papers , I found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed . Here it is ; I would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot , I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy . I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it . "
78295	78304	78115	78116	Mrs Smith	182	" Charles Smith , Esq . Tunbridge Wells , "
78317	78487	78115	78116	Mrs Smith	182	" Dear Smith,--I have received yours . Your kindness almost overpowers me . I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common , but I have lived three - and - twenty years in the world , and have seen none like it . At present , believe me , I have no need of your services , being in cash again . Give me joy : I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss. They are gone back to Kellynch , and almost made me swear to visit them this summer ; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor , to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer . The baronet , nevertheless , is not unlikely to marry again ; he is quite fool enough . If he does , however , they will leave me in peace , which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion . He is worse than last year . "
78488	78546	78115	78116	Mrs Smith	182	" I wish I had any name but Elliot . I am sick of it . The name of Walter I can drop , thank God ! and I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again , meaning , for the rest of my life , to be only yours truly,--Wm . Elliot . "
78574	78624	78562	78563	Mrs Smith	182	" The language , I know , is highly disrespectful . Though I have forgot the exact terms , I have a perfect impression of the general meaning . But it shows you the man . Mark his professions to my poor husband . Can any thing be stronger ? "
78708	78734	78700	78700	she	93	" Thank you . This is full proof undoubtedly ; proof of every thing you were saying . But why be acquainted with us now ? "
78735	78742	78744	78745	Mrs Smith	182	" I can explain this too , "
78749	78754	78700	78700	she	93	" Can you really ? "
78755	78857	78700	78700	she	93	" Yes . I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago , and I will shew him as he is now . I can not produce written proof again , but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire , of what he is now wanting , and what he is now doing . He is no hypocrite now . He truly wants to marry you . His present attentions to your family are very sincere : quite from the heart . I will give you my authority : his friend Colonel Wallis . "
78858	78868	78700	78700	she	93	" Colonel Wallis ! you are acquainted with him ? "
78869	79061	78700	78700	she	93	" No . It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that ; it takes a bend or two , but nothing of consequence . The stream is as good as at first ; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away . Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his views on you , which said Colonel Wallis , I imagine to be , in himself , a sensible , careful , discerning sort of character ; but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife , to whom he tells things which he had better not , and he repeats it all to her . She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery , repeats it all to her nurse ; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you , very naturally brings it all to me . On Monday evening , my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings . When I talked of a whole history , therefore , you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed . "
79062	79126	78700	78700	she	93	" My dear Mrs Smith , your authority is deficient . This will not do . Mr Elliot 's having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father . That was all prior to my coming to Bath . I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived . "
79127	79140	78700	78700	she	93	" I know you did ; I know it all perfectly , but-- "
79141	79194	78700	78700	she	93	" Indeed , Mrs Smith , we must not expect to get real information in such a line . Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many , to be misconceived by folly in one , and ignorance in another , can hardly have much truth left . "
79195	79304	78700	78700	she	93	" Only give me a hearing . You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due , by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm . Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement . He had seen you indeed , before he came to Bath , and admired you , but without knowing it to be you . So says my historian , at least . Is this true ? Did he see you last summer or autumn , ' somewhere down in the west , ' to use her own words , without knowing it to be you ? "
79305	79327	78700	78700	she	93	" He certainly did . So far it is very true . At Lyme . I happened to be at Lyme . "
79328	79331	79333	79334	Mrs Smith	182	" Well , "
79338	79556	79333	79334	Mrs Smith	182	" grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted . He saw you then at Lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place , as Miss Anne Elliot , and from that moment , I have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there . But there was another , and an earlier , which I will now explain . If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable , stop me . My account states , that your sister 's friend , the lady now staying with you , whom I have heard you mention , came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September ( in short when they first came themselves ) , and has been staying there ever since ; that she is a clever , insinuating , handsome woman , poor and plausible , and altogether such in situation and manner , as to give a general idea , among Sir Walter 's acquaintance , of her meaning to be Lady Elliot , and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently , blind to the danger . "
79576	80046	79574	79574	she	182	" This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family , long before you returned to it ; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it , though he did not then visit in Camden Place ; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there , and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two , as he happened to do a little before Christmas , Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things , and the reports beginning to prevail . Now you are to understand , that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot 's opinions as to the value of a baronetcy . Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man . Having long had as much money as he could spend , nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence , he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to . I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased , but it is now a confirmed feeling . He can not bear the idea of not being Sir William . You may guess , therefore , that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable , and you may guess what it produced ; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible , and of fixing himself here for a time , with the view of renewing his former acquaintance , and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger , and of circumventing the lady if he found it material . This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done ; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could . He was to be introduced , and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced , and everybody was to be introduced . Mr Elliot came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re - admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ) , to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay . He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject . You can imagine what an artful man would do ; and with this guide , perhaps , may recollect what you have seen him do . "
80047	80050	80052	80052	Anne	93	" Yes , "
80054	80182	80052	80052	Anne	93	" you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known , or could imagine . There is always something offensive in the details of cunning . The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting , but I have heard nothing which really surprises me . I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot , who would have difficulty in believing it ; but I have never been satisfied . I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared . I should like to know his present opinion , as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of ; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not . "
80183	80189	80191	80192	Mrs Smith	182	" Lessening , I understand , "
80194	80417	80191	80192	Mrs Smith	182	" He thinks Mrs Clay afraid of him , aware that he sees through her , and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence . But since he must be absent some time or other , I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence . Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea , as nurse tells me , that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry , that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay . A scheme , worthy of Mrs Wallis 's understanding , by all accounts ; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it . ' Why , to be sure , ma'am , ' said she , ' it would not prevent his marrying anybody else . ' And , indeed , to own the truth , I do not think nurse , in her heart , is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter 's making a second match . She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony , you know ; and ( since self will intrude ) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot , through Mrs Wallis 's recommendation ? "
80418	80428	80430	80430	Anne	93	" I am very glad to know all this , "
80437	80498	80430	80430	Anne	93	" It will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him , but I shall know better what to do . My line of conduct will be more direct . Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous , artificial , worldly man , who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness . "
81540	81550	81516	81516	Anne	93	" She had seemed to recommend and praise him ! "
81551	81555	81557	81558	Mrs Smith	182	" My dear , "
81562	81686	81557	81558	Mrs Smith	182	" there was nothing else to be done . I considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and I could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband . My heart bled for you , as I talked of happiness ; and yet he is sensible , he is agreeable , and with such a woman as you , it was not absolutely hopeless . He was very unkind to his first wife . They were wretched together . But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect , and he had never loved her . I was willing to hope that you must fare better . "
82179	82190	82192	82192	Elizabeth	91	" I had not the smallest intention of asking him , "
82198	82214	82192	82192	Elizabeth	91	" but he gave so many hints ; so Mrs Clay says , at least . "
82215	82262	82171	82171	he	102	" Indeed , I do say it . I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation . Poor man ! I was really in pain for him ; for your hard - hearted sister , Miss Anne , seems bent on cruelty . "
82263	82266	82268	82268	Elizabeth	91	" Oh ! "
82270	82357	82268	82268	Elizabeth	91	" I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman 's hints . However , when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning , I gave way immediately , for I would never really omit an opportunity of bringing him and Sir Walter together . They appear to so much advantage in company with each other . Each behaving so pleasantly . Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect . "
82358	82362	82364	82365	Mrs Clay	105	" Quite delightful ! "
82379	82398	82364	82365	Mrs Clay	105	" Exactly like father and son ! Dear Miss Elliot , may I not say father and son ? "
82399	82439	82268	82268	Elizabeth	91	" Oh ! I lay no embargo on any body 's words . If you will have such ideas ! But , upon my word , I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men . "
82440	82446	82448	82449	Mrs Clay	105	" My dear Miss Elliot ! "
82470	82528	82268	82268	Elizabeth	91	" Well , my dear Penelope , you need not be so alarmed about him . I did invite him , you know . I sent him away with smiles . When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to - morrow , I had compassion on him . "
83190	83194	83196	83196	Elizabeth	91	" Very well , "
83198	83327	83196	83196	Elizabeth	91	" I have nothing to send but my love . Oh ! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me , and pretend I have read it through . I really can not be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out . Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications . You need not tell her so , but I thought her dress hideous the other night . I used to think she had some taste in dress , but I was ashamed of her at the concert . Something so formal and _ arrang _ in her air ! and she sits so upright ! My best love , of course . "
83328	83332	83334	83335	Sir Walter	90	" And mine , "
83337	83418	83334	83335	Sir Walter	90	" Kindest regards . And you may say , that I mean to call upon her soon . Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card . Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life , who make themselves up so little . If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen ; but last time I called , I observed the blinds were let down immediately . "
83482	83488	83512	83512	them	1973	" Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove "
84097	84106	84107	84107	Charles	95	" And a very good living it was , "
84110	84188	84189	84189	he	95	" only five - and - twenty miles from Uppercross , and in a very fine country : fine part of Dorsetshire . In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom , surrounded by three great proprietors , each more careful and jealous than the other ; and to two of the three at least , Charles Hayter might get a special recommendation . Not that he will value it as he ought , "
84192	84207	84189	84189	he	95	" Charles is too cool about sporting . That 's the worst of him . "
84208	84216	84218	84218	Anne	93	" I am extremely glad , indeed , "
84220	84289	84218	84218	Anne	93	" particularly glad that this should happen ; and that of two sisters , who both deserve equally well , and who have always been such good friends , the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other -- that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort . I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both . "
84290	84466	84189	84189	he	95	" Oh ! yes . My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer , but he has no other fault to find . Money , you know , coming down with money -- two daughters at once -- it can not be a very agreeable operation , and it streightens him as to many things . However , I do not mean to say they have not a right to it . It is very fit they should have daughters ' shares ; and I am sure he has always been a very kind , liberal father to me . Mary does not above half like Henrietta 's match . She never did , you know . But she does not do him justice , nor think enough about Winthrop . I can not make her attend to the value of the property . It is a very fair match , as times go ; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life , and I shall not leave off now . "
84467	84477	84479	84479	Anne	93	" Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove , "
84481	84552	84479	84479	Anne	93	" should be happy in their children 's marriages . They do everything to confer happiness , I am sure . What a blessing to young people to be in such hands ! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ? "
84558	84638	84553	84553	He	1992	" Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different . If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab - chick in the water ; and Benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long . "
84645	84658	84660	84660	she	93	" That can not be much to your taste , I know , "
84662	84675	84660	84660	she	93	" but I do believe him to be an excellent young man . "
84676	84812	84553	84553	He	1992	" To be sure he is . Nobody doubts it ; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself . I have a great value for Benwick ; and when one can but get him to talk , he has plenty to say . His reading has done him no harm , for he has fought as well as read . He is a brave fellow . I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before . We had a famous set - to at rat - hunting all the morning in my father 's great barns ; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since . "
85102	85242	85098	85098	her	91	" Old fashioned notions ; country hospitality ; we do not profess to give dinners ; few people in Bath do ; Lady Alicia never does ; did not even ask her own sister 's family , though they were here a month : and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove ; put her quite out of her way . I am sure she would rather not come ; she can not feel easy with us . I will ask them all for an evening ; that will be much better ; that will be a novelty and a treat . They have not seen two such drawing rooms before . They will be delighted to come to - morrow evening . It shall be a regular party , small , but most elegant . "
85903	85950	85959	85959	she	93	dependence:--"Surely , if there be constant attachment on each side , our hearts must understand each other ere long . We are not boy and girl , to be captiously irritable , misled by every moment 's inadvertence , and wantonly playing with our own happiness . "
85991	85994	85996	85996	Mary	94	" Anne , "
86003	86064	85996	85996	Mary	94	" there is Mrs Clay , I am sure , standing under the colonnade , and a gentleman with her . I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now . They seemed deep in talk . Who is it ? Come , and tell me . Good heavens ! I recollect . It is Mr Elliot himself . "
86065	86068	86070	86070	Anne	93	" No , "
86074	86106	86070	86070	Anne	93	" it can not be Mr Elliot , I assure you . He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to - morrow . "
86268	86274	86276	86276	Mary	94	" Do come , Anne , "
86278	86326	86276	86276	Mary	94	" come and look yourself . You will be too late if you do not make haste . They are parting ; they are shaking hands . He is turning away . Not know Mr Elliot , indeed ! You seem to have forgot all about Lyme . "
86412	86448	86408	86408	she	93	" Yes , it is Mr Elliot , certainly . He has changed his hour of going , I suppose , that is all , or I may be mistaken , I might not attend ; "
86500	86591	86494	86494	them	2032	" Well , mother , I have done something for you that you will like . I have been to the theatre , and secured a box for to - morrow night . A'n't I a good boy ? I know you love a play ; and there is room for us all . It holds nine . I have engaged Captain Wentworth . Anne will not be sorry to join us , I am sure . We all like a play . Have not I done well , mother ? "
86623	86703	86617	86617	Mary	94	" Good heavens , Charles ! how can you think of such a thing ? Take a box for to - morrow night ! Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to - morrow night ? and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter , and Mr Elliot , and all the principal family connexions , on purpose to be introduced to them ? How can you be so forgetful ? "
86704	86709	86711	86711	Charles	96	" Phoo ! phoo ! "
86713	86759	86711	86711	Charles	96	" what 's an evening party ? Never worth remembering . Your father might have asked us to dinner , I think , if he had wanted to see us . You may do as you like , but I shall go to the play . "
86760	86782	86600	86600	her	96	" Oh ! Charles , I declare it will be too abominable if you do , when you promised to go . "
86783	86810	86711	86711	Charles	96	" No , I did not promise . I only smirked and bowed , and said the word ' happy . ' There was no promise . "
86811	86906	86600	86600	her	96	" But you must go , Charles . It would be unpardonable to fail . We were asked on purpose to be introduced . There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves . Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately . We are quite near relations , you know ; and Mr Elliot too , whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with ! Every attention is due to Mr Elliot . Consider , my father 's heir : the future representative of the family . "
86907	86918	86920	86920	Charles	96	" Do n't talk to me about heirs and representatives , "
86922	86974	86920	86920	Charles	96	" I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun . If I would not go for the sake of your father , I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir . What is Mr Elliot to me ? "
87091	87168	87087	87088	Mrs Musgrove	96	" We had better put it off . Charles , you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday . It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father 's ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us . "
87193	87259	87260	87260	She	93	" If it depended only on my inclination , ma'am , the party at home ( excepting on Mary 's account ) would not be the smallest impediment . I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you . But , it had better not be attempted , perhaps . "
87373	87383	87385	87385	he	117	" You have not been long enough in Bath , "
87387	87397	87385	87385	he	117	" to enjoy the evening parties of the place . "
87398	87420	87473	87473	he	117	" Oh ! no . The usual character of them has nothing for me . I am no card - player . "
87421	87444	87385	87385	he	117	" You were not formerly , I know . You did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes . "
87445	87454	87456	87456	Anne	93	" I am not yet so much changed , "
87487	87504	87473	87473	he	117	" It is a period , indeed ! Eight years and a half is a period . "
87833	87849	87815	87815	she	91	" To - morrow evening , to meet a few friends : no formal party . "
87868	87874	87815	87815	she	91	" Miss Elliot at home , "
88102	88111	88113	88113	Mary	94	" Only think of Elizabeth 's including everybody ! "
88117	88140	88113	88113	Mary	94	" I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted ! You see he can not put the card out of his hand . "
88581	88745	88569	88569	She	93	" Oh ! dear ! very true . Only think , Miss Elliot , to my great surprise I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street . I was never more astonished . He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard . He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return . He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to - morrow . He was full of ' to - morrow , ' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head . "
89072	89094	89069	89070	Captain Wentworth	117	" We will write the letter we were talking of , Harville , now , if you will give me materials . "
89196	89272	89184	89184	she	93	" how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over ; what my brother Hayter had said one day , and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next , and what had occurred to my sister Hayter , and what the young people had wished , and what I said at first I never could consent to , but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well , "
89353	89364	89366	89367	Mrs Musgrove	120	" And so , ma'am , all these thing considered , "
89374	89458	89366	89367	Mrs Musgrove	120	" though we could have wished it different , yet , altogether , we did not think it fair to stand out any longer , for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it , and Henrietta was pretty near as bad ; and so we thought they had better marry at once , and make the best of it , as many others have done before them . At any rate , said I , it will be better than a long engagement . "
89459	89470	89472	89473	Mrs Croft	112	" That is precisely what I was going to observe , "
89475	89514	89472	89473	Mrs Croft	112	" I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once , and have to struggle with a few difficulties together , than be involved in a long engagement . I always think that no mutual-- "
89515	89522	89524	89525	Mrs Musgrove	120	" Oh ! dear Mrs Croft , "
89535	89603	89524	89525	Mrs Musgrove	120	" there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement . It is what I always protested against for my children . It is all very well , I used to say , for young people to be engaged , if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months , or even in twelve ; but a long engagement-- "
89604	89610	89612	89613	Mrs Croft	112	" Yes , dear ma'am , "
89615	89668	89612	89613	Mrs Croft	112	" or an uncertain engagement , an engagement which may be long . To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying , I hold to be very unsafe and unwise , and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can . "
89879	89890	89860	89860	He	117	" Come to me , I have something to say ; "
89983	89987	89989	89989	he	117	" Look here , "
90005	90013	89989	89989	he	117	" do you know who that is ? "
90014	90020	89961	89961	she	93	" Certainly : Captain Benwick . "
90021	90035	89989	89989	he	117	" Yes , and you may guess who it is for . But , "
90043	90174	89989	89989	he	117	" it was not done for her . Miss Elliot , do you remember our walking together at Lyme , and grieving for him ? I little thought then -- but no matter . This was drawn at the Cape . He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape , and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister , sat to him , and was bringing it home for her ; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another ! It was a commission to me ! But who else was there to employ ? I hope I can allow for him . I am not sorry , indeed , to make it over to another . He undertakes it ; "
90182	90190	90196	90196	he	117	" he is writing about it now . "
90204	90217	90196	90196	he	117	" Poor Fanny ! she would not have forgotten him so soon ! "
90218	90221	90223	90223	Anne	93	" No , "
90232	90239	90223	90223	Anne	93	" That I can easily believe . "
90240	90253	90196	90196	he	117	" It was not in her nature . She doted on him . "
90254	90268	90223	90223	Anne	93	" It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved . "
90279	90288	90269	90270	Captain Harville	153	" Do you claim that for your sex ? "
90298	90387	90290	90290	she	93	" Yes . We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us . It is , perhaps , our fate rather than our merit . We can not help ourselves . We live at home , quiet , confined , and our feelings prey upon us . You are forced on exertion . You have always a profession , pursuits , business of some sort or other , to take you back into the world immediately , and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions . "
90388	90460	90196	90196	he	117	" Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men ( which , however , I do not think I shall grant ) , it does not apply to Benwick . He has not been forced upon any exertion . The peace turned him on shore at the very moment , and he has been living with us , in our little family circle , ever since . "
90461	90464	90466	90466	Anne	93	" True , "
90468	90520	90466	90466	Anne	93	" very true ; I did not recollect ; but what shall we say now , Captain Harville ? If the change be not from outward circumstances , it must be from within ; it must be nature , man 's nature , which has done the business for Captain Benwick . "
90521	90608	90196	90196	he	117	" No , no , it is not man 's nature . I will not allow it to be more man 's nature than woman 's to be inconstant and forget those they do love , or have loved . I believe the reverse . I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental ; and that as our bodies are the strongest , so are our feelings ; capable of bearing most rough usage , and riding out the heaviest weather . "
90609	90617	90619	90619	Anne	93	" Your feelings may be the strongest , "
90621	90740	90619	90619	Anne	93	" but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender . Man is more robust than woman , but he is not longer lived ; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments . Nay , it would be too hard upon you , if it were otherwise . You have difficulties , and privations , and dangers enough to struggle with . You are always labouring and toiling , exposed to every risk and hardship . Your home , country , friends , all quitted . Neither time , nor health , nor life , to be called your own . It would be hard , indeed "
90748	90761	90619	90619	Anne	93	" if woman 's feelings were to be added to all this . "
90762	90771	90772	90773	Captain Harville	153	" We shall never agree upon this question , "
90858	90865	90867	90868	Captain Harville	153	" Have you finished your letter ? "
90870	90887	90840	90840	them	2075	" Not quite , a few lines more . I shall have done in five minutes . "
90888	90913	90840	90840	them	2075	" There is no hurry on my side . I am only ready whenever you are . I am in very good anchorage here , "
90920	90942	90945	90945	his	117	" well supplied , and want for nothing . No hurry for a signal at all . Well , Miss Elliot , "
90949	91065	90945	90945	his	117	" as I was saying we shall never agree , I suppose , upon this point . No man and woman , would , probably . But let me observe that all histories are against you -- all stories , prose and verse . If I had such a memory as Benwick , I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument , and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman 's inconstancy . Songs and proverbs , all talk of woman 's fickleness . But perhaps you will say , these were all written by men . "
91066	91127	90840	90840	them	2075	" Perhaps I shall . Yes , yes , if you please , no reference to examples in books . Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story . Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree ; the pen has been in their hands . I will not allow books to prove anything . "
91128	91136	90945	90945	his	117	" But how shall we prove anything ? "
91137	91243	90840	90840	them	2075	" We never shall . We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point . It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof . We each begin , probably , with a little bias towards our own sex ; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle ; many of which circumstances ( perhaps those very cases which strike us the most ) may be precisely such as can not be brought forward without betraying a confidence , or in some respect saying what should not be said . "
91244	91247	91249	91250	Captain Harville	153	" Ah ! "
91259	91473	91249	91250	Captain Harville	153	" if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children , and watches the boat that he has sent them off in , as long as it is in sight , and then turns away and says , ' God knows whether we ever meet again ! ' And then , if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again ; when , coming back after a twelvemonth 's absence , perhaps , and obliged to put into another port , he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there , pretending to deceive himself , and saying , ' They can not be here till such a day , ' but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner , and seeing them arrive at last , as if Heaven had given them wings , by many hours sooner still ! If I could explain to you all this , and all that a man can bear and do , and glories to do , for the sake of these treasures of his existence ! I speak , you know , only of such men as have hearts ! "
91480	91483	91485	91485	Anne	93	" Oh ! "
91488	91653	91485	91485	Anne	93	" I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you . God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow - creatures ! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman . No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as -- if I may be allowed the expression -- so long as you have an object . I mean while the woman you love lives , and lives for you . All the privilege I claim for my own sex ( it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it ) , is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone . "
91675	91682	91684	91685	Captain Harville	153	" You are a good soul , "
91697	91717	91688	91688	his	153	" There is no quarrelling with you . And when I think of Benwick , my tongue is tied . "
91732	91746	91748	91748	she	112	" Here , Frederick , you and I part company , I believe , "
91750	91781	91748	91748	she	112	" I am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend . To - night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party , "
91788	91829	91748	91748	she	112	" We had your sister 's card yesterday , and I understood Frederick had a card too , though I did not see it ; and you are disengaged , Frederick , are you not , as well as ourselves ? "
91851	91854	91856	91856	he	117	" Yes , "
91858	91915	91856	91856	he	117	" very true ; here we separate , but Harville and I shall soon be after you ; that is , Harville , if you are ready , I am in half a minute . I know you will not be sorry to be off . I shall be at your service in half a minute . "
91965	91973	91961	91961	She	93	" Good morning , God bless you ! "
92138	92143	92149	92149	he	153	" Miss A. E.-- , "
92250	92507	92237	92237	he	153	" I can listen no longer in silence . I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach . You pierce my soul . I am half agony , half hope . Tell me not that I am too late , that such precious feelings are gone for ever . I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it , eight years and a half ago . Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman , that his love has an earlier death . I have loved none but you . Unjust I may have been , weak and resentful I have been , but never inconstant . You alone have brought me to Bath . For you alone , I think and plan . Have you not seen this ? Can you fail to have understood my wishes ? I had not waited even these ten days , could I have read your feelings , as I think you must have penetrated mine . I can hardly write . I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me . You sink your voice , but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others . Too good , too excellent creature ! You do us justice , indeed . You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men . Believe it to be most fervent , most undeviating , in F. W. "
92508	92557	92237	92237	he	153	" I must go , uncertain of my fate ; but I shall return hither , or follow your party , as soon as possible . A word , a look , will be enough to decide whether I enter your father 's house this evening or never . "
92762	92770	92772	92773	Mrs Musgrove	120	" By all means , my dear , "
92775	92824	92772	92773	Mrs Musgrove	120	" go home directly , and take care of yourself , that you may be fit for the evening . I wish Sarah was here to doctor you , but I am no doctor myself . Charles , ring and order a chair . She must not walk . "
92968	93034	92963	92963	Anne	93	" I am afraid , ma'am , that it is not perfectly understood . Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening . I am afraid there had been some mistake ; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth , that we hope to see them both . "
93035	93061	92963	92963	Anne	93	" Oh ! my dear , it is quite understood , I give you my word . Captain Harville has no thought but of going . "
93062	93111	92963	92963	Anne	93	" Do you think so ? But I am afraid ; and I should be so very sorry . Will you promise me to mention it , when you see them again ? You will see them both this morning , I dare say . Do promise me . "
93112	93176	92963	92963	Anne	93	" To be sure I will , if you wish it . Charles , if you see Captain Harville anywhere , remember to give Miss Anne 's message . But indeed , my dear , you need not be uneasy . Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged , I 'll answer for it ; and Captain Wentworth the same , I dare say . "
93405	93426	93403	93403	Charles	95	" Captain Wentworth , which way are you going ? Only to Gay Street , or farther up the town ? "
93427	93432	93434	93435	Captain Wentworth	117	" I hardly know , "
93439	93591	93403	93403	Charles	95	" Are you going as high as Belmont ? Are you going near Camden Place ? Because , if you are , I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place , and give Anne your arm to her father 's door . She is rather done for this morning , and must not go so far without help , and I ought to be at that fellow 's in the Market Place . He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off ; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment , that I might see it ; and if I do not turn back now , I have no chance . By his description , a good deal like the second size double - barrel of mine , which you shot with one day round Winthrop . "
94456	94460	94462	94462	he	95	" I found , "
94464	94631	94462	94462	he	95	" that I was considered by Harville an engaged man ! That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment . I was startled and shocked . To a degree , I could contradict this instantly ; but , when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same -- her own family , nay , perhaps herself -- I was no longer at my own disposal . I was hers in honour if she wished it . I had been unguarded . I had not thought seriously on this subject before . I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways ; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls , at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report , were there no other ill effects . I had been grossly wrong , and must abide the consequences . "
94743	94751	94753	94753	he	2112	" I was six weeks with Edward , "
94755	94798	94753	94753	he	2112	" and saw him happy . I could have no other pleasure . I deserved none . He enquired after you very particularly ; asked even if you were personally altered , little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter . "
94925	94928	94930	94930	he	2112	" Here , "
94932	95106	94930	94930	he	2112	" ended the worst of my state ; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness ; I could exert myself ; I could do something . But to be waiting so long in inaction , and waiting only for evil , had been dreadful . Within the first five minutes I said , ' I will be at Bath on Wednesday , ' and I was . Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come ? and to arrive with some degree of hope ? You were single . It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past , as I did ; and one encouragement happened to be mine . I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others , but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man , at least , of better pretensions than myself ; and I could not help often saying , ' Was this for me ? ' "
95184	95189	95191	95191	he	2118	" To see you , "
95193	95337	95191	95191	he	2118	" in the midst of those who could not be my well - wishers ; to see your cousin close by you , conversing and smiling , and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match ! To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you ! Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent , to consider what powerful supports would be his ! Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared ? How could I look on without agony ? Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you , was not the recollection of what had been , the knowledge of her influence , the indelible , immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done -- was it not all against me ? "
95338	95344	95346	95346	Anne	93	" You should have distinguished , "
95348	95438	95346	95346	Anne	93	" You should not have suspected me now ; the case is so different , and my age is so different . If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once , remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety , not of risk . When I yielded , I thought it was to duty , but no duty could be called in aid here . In marrying a man indifferent to me , all risk would have been incurred , and all duty violated . "
95439	95448	95449	95449	he	2119	" Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus , "
95452	95571	95449	95449	he	2119	" but I could not . I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of your character . I could not bring it into play ; it was overwhelmed , buried , lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under year after year . I could think of you only as one who had yielded , who had given me up , who had been influenced by any one rather than by me . I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery . I had no reason to believe her of less authority now . The force of habit was to be added . "
95572	95578	95580	95580	Anne	93	" I should have thought , "
95582	95598	95580	95580	Anne	93	" that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this . "
95599	95658	95670	95674	any one in that house	2121	" No , no ! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give . I left you in this belief ; and yet , I was determined to see you again . My spirits rallied with the morning , and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here . "
96043	96272	96041	96041	she	93	" I have been thinking over the past , and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong , I mean with regard to myself ; and I must believe that I was right , much as I suffered from it , that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now . To me , she was in the place of a parent . Do not mistake me , however . I am not saying that she did not err in her advice . It was , perhaps , one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides ; and for myself , I certainly never should , in any circumstance of tolerable similarity , give such advice . But I mean , that I was right in submitting to her , and that if I had done otherwise , I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up , because I should have suffered in my conscience . I have now , as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature , nothing to reproach myself with ; and if I mistake not , a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman 's portion . "
96296	96412	96273	96273	He	2137	" Not yet . But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time . I trust to being in charity with her soon . But I too have been thinking over the past , and a question has suggested itself , whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady ? My own self . Tell me if , when I returned to England in the year eight , with a few thousand pounds , and was posted into the Laconia , if I had then written to you , would you have answered my letter ? Would you , in short , have renewed the engagement then ? "
96413	96417	96420	96420	her	2138	" Would I ! "
96430	96434	96435	96435	he	2139	" Good God ! "
96438	96578	96579	96579	he	2139	" you would ! It is not that I did not think of it , or desire it , as what could alone crown all my other success ; but I was proud , too proud to ask again . I did not understand you . I shut my eyes , and would not understand you , or do you justice . This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself . Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared . It is a sort of pain , too , which is new to me . I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed . I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards . Like other great men under reverses , "
96586	96609	96579	96579	he	2139	" I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune . I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve . "
