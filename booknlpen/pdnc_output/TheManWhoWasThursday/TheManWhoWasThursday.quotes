810	813	806	807	the people	212	" artists , "
1768	1774	1775	1775	he	92	" It may well be , "
1784	1850	1775	1775	he	92	" it may well be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet . You say you are a poet of law ; I say you are a contradiction in terms . I only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden . "
1927	1936	1937	1937	he	95	" An artist is identical with an anarchist , "
1940	2039	1937	1937	he	95	" You might transpose the words anywhere . An anarchist is an artist . The man who throws a bomb is an artist , because he prefers a great moment to everything . He sees how much more valuable is one burst of blazing light , one peal of perfect thunder , than the mere common bodies of a few shapeless policemen . An artist disregards all governments , abolishes all conventions . The poet delights in disorder only . If it were not so , the most poetical thing in the world would be the Underground Railway . "
2040	2045	2047	2048	Mr. Syme	93	" So it is , "
2050	2053	2055	2055	Gregory	95	" Nonsense ! "
2067	2180	2055	2055	Gregory	95	" Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired , so very sad and tired ? I will tell you . It is because they know that the train is going right . It is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach . It is because after they have passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be Victoria , and nothing but Victoria . Oh , their wild rapture ! oh , their eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden , if the next station were unaccountably Baker Street ! "
2181	2189	2193	2193	Syme	93	" It is you who are unpoetical , "
2195	2366	2193	2193	Syme	93	" If what you say of clerks is true , they can only be as prosaic as your poetry . The rare , strange thing is to hit the mark ; the gross , obvious thing is to miss it . We feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird . Is it not also epical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station ? Chaos is dull ; because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere , to Baker Street or to Bagdad . But man is a magician , and his whole magic is in this , that he does say Victoria , and lo ! it is Victoria . No , take your books of mere poetry and prose ; let me read a time table , with tears of pride . Take your Byron , who commemorates the defeats of man ; give me Bradshaw , who commemorates his victories . Give me Bradshaw , I say ! "
2367	2372	2374	2374	Gregory	95	" Must you go ? "
2377	2382	2385	2385	Syme	93	" I tell you , "
2389	2507	2385	2385	Syme	93	" that every time a train comes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers , and that man has won a battle against chaos . You say contemptuously that when one has left Sloane Square one must come to Victoria . I say that one might do a thousand things instead , and that whenever I really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape . And when I hear the guard shout out the word Victoria , ' it is not an unmeaning word . It is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest . It is to me indeed Victoria ' ; it is the victory of Adam . "
2522	2527	2528	2528	he	95	" And even then , "
2531	2593	2528	2528	he	95	" we poets always ask the question , And what is Victoria now that you have got there ? ' You think Victoria is like the New Jerusalem . We know that the New Jerusalem will only be like Victoria . Yes , the poet will be discontented even in the streets of heaven . The poet is always in revolt . "
2594	2598	2600	2600	Syme	93	" There again , "
2603	2675	2600	2600	Syme	93	" what is there poetical about being in revolt ? You might as well say that it is poetical to be sea - sick . Being sick is a revolt . Both being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate occasions ; but I 'm hanged if I can see why they are poetical . Revolt in the abstract is revolting . It 's mere vomiting . "
2696	2703	2704	2704	he	93	" It is things going right , "
2707	2762	2704	2704	he	93	" that is poetical ! Our digestions , for instance , going sacredly and silently right , that is the foundation of all poetry . Yes , the most poetical thing , more poetical than the flowers , more poetical than the stars the most poetical thing in the world is not being sick . "
2763	2766	2768	2768	Gregory	95	" Really , "
2771	2776	2768	2768	Gregory	95	" the examples you choose "
2777	2783	2785	2785	Syme	93	" I beg your pardon , "
2788	2797	2785	2785	Syme	93	" I forgot we had abolished all conventions . "
2811	2818	2819	2819	he	95	" You do n't expect me , "
2822	2830	2819	2819	he	95	" to revolutionise society on this lawn ? "
2841	2848	2849	2849	he	93	" No , I do n't , "
2852	2873	2849	2849	he	93	" but I suppose that if you were serious about your anarchism , that is exactly what you would do . "
2900	2908	2909	2909	he	95	" Do n't you think , then , "
2916	2925	2909	2909	he	95	" that I am serious about my anarchism ? "
2926	2932	2934	2934	Syme	93	" I beg your pardon ? "
2936	2945	2947	2947	Gregory	95	" Am I not serious about my anarchism ? "
2953	2958	2960	2960	Syme	93	" My dear fellow ! "
2984	2988	2989	2989	she	277	" Mr. Syme , "
2992	3017	2989	2989	she	277	" do the people who talk like you and my brother often mean what they say ? Do you mean what you say now ? "
3021	3025	3026	3026	he	95	" Do you ? "
3029	3035	3037	3038	the girl	275	" What do you mean ? "
3044	3050	3052	3052	Syme	93	" My dear Miss Gregory , "
3055	3161	3052	3052	Syme	93	" there are many kinds of sincerity and insincerity . When you say thank you ' for the salt , do you mean what you say ? No . When you say the world is round , ' do you mean what you say ? No . It is true , but you do n't mean it . Now , sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he does mean . It may be only a half - truth , quarter - truth , tenth - truth ; but then he says more than he means from sheer force of meaning it . "
3213	3222	3223	3223	she	275	" Is he really an anarchist , then ? "
3226	3235	3237	3237	Syme	93	" Only in that sense I speak of , "
3239	3250	3237	3237	Syme	93	" or if you prefer it , in that nonsense . "
3260	3273	3251	3251	She	275	" He would n't really use bombs or that sort of thing ? "
3293	3299	3300	3300	he	93	" Good Lord , no ! "
3303	3311	3300	3300	he	93	" that has to be done anonymously . "
3825	3832	3834	3834	Gregory	112	" I was waiting for you , "
3836	3845	3834	3834	Gregory	112	" Might I have a moment 's conversation ? "
3846	3852	3854	3854	Syme	93	" Certainly . About what ? "
3880	3890	3891	3891	he	93	" About _ this _ and _ this _ , "
3894	3937	3891	3891	he	93	" about order and anarchy . There is your precious order , that lean , iron lamp , ugly and barren ; and there is anarchy , rich , living , reproducing itself there is anarchy , splendid in green and gold . "
3938	3943	3945	3945	Syme	93	" All the same , "
3948	3980	3945	3945	Syme	93	" just at present you only see the tree by the light of the lamp . I wonder when you would ever see the lamp by the light of the tree . "
3988	4010	3985	3985	he	93	" But may I ask if you have been standing out here in the dark only to resume our little argument ? "
4011	4014	4017	4017	Gregory	112	" No , "
4028	4046	4017	4017	Gregory	112	" I did not stand here to resume our argument , but to end it for ever . "
4079	4083	4084	4084	he	93	" Mr. Syme , "
4087	4116	4084	4084	he	93	" this evening you succeeded in doing something rather remarkable . You did something to me that no man born of woman has ever succeeded in doing before . "
4117	4120	4066	4066	Gregory	112	" Indeed ! "
4121	4126	4128	4128	Gregory	112	" Now I remember , "
4131	4160	4128	4128	Gregory	112	" one other person succeeded in doing it . The captain of a penny steamer ( if I remember correctly ) at Southend . You have irritated me . "
4161	4167	4169	4169	Syme	93	" I am very sorry , "
4173	4194	4196	4196	Gregory	112	" I am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped out even with an apology , "
4200	4268	4196	4196	Gregory	112	" No duel could wipe it out . If I struck you dead I could not wipe it out . There is only one way by which that insult can be erased , and that way I choose . I am going , at the possible sacrifice of my life and honour , to _ prove _ to you that you were wrong in what you said . "
4269	4275	4342	4342	him	93	" In what I said ? "
4276	4288	4196	4196	Gregory	112	" You said I was not serious about being an anarchist . "
4289	4296	4298	4298	Syme	93	" There are degrees of seriousness , "
4300	4338	4298	4298	Syme	93	" I have never doubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense , that you thought what you said well worth saying , that you thought a paradox might wake men up to a neglected truth . "
4347	4354	4355	4355	he	93	" And in no other sense , "
4358	4396	4355	4355	he	93	" you think me serious ? You think me a _ fl neur _ who lets fall occasional truths . You do not think that in a deeper , a more deadly sense , I am serious . "
4409	4412	4413	4413	he	93	" Serious ! "
4416	4495	4413	4413	he	93	" Good Lord ! is this street serious ? Are these damned Chinese lanterns serious ? Is the whole caboodle serious ? One comes here and talks a pack of bosh , and perhaps some sense as well , but I should think very little of a man who did n't keep something in the background of his life that was more serious than all this talking something more serious , whether it was religion or only drink . "
4496	4500	4502	4502	Gregory	112	" Very well , "
4508	4521	4502	4502	Gregory	112	" you shall see something more serious than either drink or religion . "
4538	4557	4413	4413	he	93	" You spoke just now of having a religion . Is it really true that you have one ? "
4558	4561	4563	4563	Syme	93	" Oh , "
4569	4576	4563	4563	Syme	93	" we are all Catholics now . "
4577	4664	4413	4413	he	93	" Then may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your religion involves that you will not reveal what I am now going to tell you to any son of Adam , and especially not to the police ? Will you swear that ! If you will take upon yourself this awful abnegation if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow that you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream about , I will promise you in return "
4665	4673	4675	4675	Syme	93	" You will promise me in return ? "
4682	4692	4693	4693	Syme	93	" I will promise you a very entertaining evening . "
4700	4704	4705	4705	he	93	" Your offer , "
4708	4798	4705	4705	he	93	" is far too idiotic to be declined . You say that a poet is always an anarchist . I disagree ; but I hope at least that he is always a sportsman . Permit me , here and now , to swear as a Christian , and promise as a good comrade and a fellow - artist , that I will not report anything of this , whatever it is , to the police . And now , in the name of Colney Hatch , what is it ? "
4799	4803	4805	4805	Gregory	112	" I think , "
4811	4819	4805	4805	Gregory	112	" that we will call a cab . "
4967	4975	4977	4977	Gregory	112	" Will you take a little supper ? "
4980	5001	4977	4977	Gregory	112	" The _ p t de foie gras _ is not good here , but I can recommend the game . "
5031	5040	5022	5022	he	93	" Oh , bring me some lobster mayonnaise . "
5050	5055	5046	5047	the man	315	" Certainly , sir ! "
5064	5070	5072	5072	Gregory	112	" What will you drink ? "
5082	5123	5072	5072	Gregory	112	" I shall only have a _ cr me de menthe _ myself ; I have dined . But the champagne can really be trusted . Do let me start you with a half - bottle of Pommery at least ? "
5124	5128	5130	5132	the motionless Syme	93	" Thank you ! "
5134	5140	5130	5132	the motionless Syme	93	" You are very good . "
5190	5200	5201	5201	he	93	" Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously ! "
5208	5244	5201	5201	he	93	" I do n't often have the luck to have a dream like this . It is new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster . It is commonly the other way . "
5245	5255	5257	5257	Gregory	112	" You are not asleep , I assure you , "
5259	5334	5257	5257	Gregory	112	" You are , on the contrary , close to the most actual and rousing moment of your existence . Ah , here comes your champagne ! I admit that there may be a slight disproportion , let us say , between the inner arrangements of this excellent hotel and its simple and unpretentious exterior . But that is all our modesty . We are the most modest men that ever lived on earth . "
5335	5343	5345	5345	Syme	93	" And who are _ we ? _ "
5352	5358	5360	5360	Gregory	112	" It is quite simple , "
5362	5378	5360	5360	Gregory	112	" _ We _ are the serious anarchists , in whom you do not believe . "
5379	5382	5384	5384	Syme	93	" Oh ! "
5387	5395	5384	5384	Syme	93	" You do yourselves well in drinks . "
5396	5405	5407	5407	Gregory	112	" Yes , we are serious about everything , "
5415	5453	5413	5413	he	93	" If in a few moments this table begins to turn round a little , do n't put it down to your inroads into the champagne . I do n't wish you to do yourself an injustice . "
5454	5467	5469	5469	Syme	93	" Well , if I am not drunk , I am mad , "
5474	5492	5469	5469	Syme	93	" but I trust I can behave like a gentleman in either condition . May I smoke ? "
5493	5496	5498	5498	Gregory	112	" Certainly ! "
5506	5512	5469	5469	Syme	93	" Try one of mine . "
5602	5609	5611	5611	Gregory	112	" You must not mind it , "
5613	5621	5611	5611	Gregory	112	" it 's a kind of screw . "
5622	5626	5628	5628	Syme	93	" Quite so , "
5631	5642	5628	5628	Syme	93	" a kind of screw . How simple that is ! "
5848	5853	5839	5839	he	93	" Mr. Joseph Chamberlain . "
5915	5927	5929	5929	Gregory	112	" I must ask you to forgive me all these formalities , "
5931	5940	5929	5929	Gregory	112	" we have to be very strict here . "
5941	5948	5950	5950	Syme	93	" Oh , do n't apologise , "
5952	5962	5964	5964	he	93	" I know your passion for law and order , "
6124	6133	6135	6135	Gregory	112	" And now , my dear Mr. Syme , "
6151	6282	6135	6135	Gregory	112	" now we are quite cosy , so let us talk properly . Now no human words can give you any notion of why I brought you here . It was one of those quite arbitrary emotions , like jumping off a cliff or falling in love . Suffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellow , and , to do you justice , you are still . I would break twenty oaths of secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down a peg . That way you have of lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal of confession . Well , you said that you were quite certain I was not a serious anarchist . Does this place strike you as being serious ? "
6283	6296	6298	6298	Syme	93	" It does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety , "
6300	6381	6298	6298	Syme	93	" but may I ask you two questions ? You need not fear to give me information , because , as you remember , you very wisely extorted from me a promise not to tell the police , a promise I shall certainly keep . So it is in mere curiosity that I make my queries . First of all , what is it really all about ? What is it you object to ? You want to abolish Government ? "
6382	6387	6389	6389	Gregory	112	" To abolish God ! "
6398	6492	6389	6389	Gregory	112	" We do not only want to upset a few despotisms and police regulations ; that sort of anarchism does exist , but it is a mere branch of the Nonconformists . We dig deeper and we blow you higher . We wish to deny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue , honour and treachery , upon which mere rebels base themselves . The silly sentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights of Man ! We hate Rights as we hate Wrongs . We have abolished Right and Wrong . "
6493	6499	6501	6501	Syme	93	" And Right and Left , "
6507	6524	6501	6501	Syme	93	" I hope you will abolish them too . They are much more troublesome to me . "
6525	6533	6535	6535	Gregory	112	" You spoke of a second question , "
6537	6541	6543	6543	Syme	93	" With pleasure , "
6545	6673	6543	6543	Syme	93	" In all your present acts and surroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy . I have an aunt who lived over a shop , but this is the first time I have found people living from preference under a public - house . You have a heavy iron door . You can not pass it without submitting to the humiliation of calling yourself Mr. Chamberlain . You surround yourself with steel instruments which make the place , if I may say so , more impressive than homelike . May I ask why , after taking all this trouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earth , you then parade your whole secret by talking about anarchism to every silly woman in Saffron Park ? "
6677	6683	6684	6684	he	328	" The answer is simple , "
6687	6726	6684	6684	he	328	" I told you I was a serious anarchist , and you did not believe me . Nor do _ they _ believe me . Unless I took them into this infernal room they would not believe me . "
6742	6752	6753	6753	he	328	" The history of the thing might amuse you , "
6756	7045	6753	6753	he	328	" When first I became one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable disguises . I dressed up as a bishop . I read up all about bishops in our anarchist pamphlets , in _ Superstition the Vampire _ and _ Priests of Prey _ . I certainly understood from them that bishops are strange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind . I was misinformed . When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters in a drawing - room I cried out in a voice of thunder , Down ! down ! presumptuous human reason ! ' they found out in some way that I was not a bishop at all . I was nabbed at once . Then I made up as a millionaire ; but I defended Capital with so much intelligence that a fool could see that I was quite poor . Then I tried being a major . Now I am a humanitarian myself , but I have , I hope , enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who , like Nietzsche , admire violence the proud , mad war of Nature and all that , you know . I threw myself into the major . I drew my sword and waved it constantly . I called out Blood ! ' abstractedly , like a man calling for wine . I often said , Let the weak perish ; it is the Law . ' Well , well , it seems majors do n't do this . I was nabbed again . At last I went in despair to the President of the Central Anarchist Council , who is the greatest man in Europe . "
7046	7052	7054	7054	Syme	93	" What is his name ? "
7056	7063	7065	7065	Gregory	112	" You would not know it , "
7067	7138	7065	7065	Gregory	112	" That is his greatness . Caesar and Napoleon put all their genius into being heard of , and they _ were _ heard of . He puts all his genius into not being heard of , and he is not heard of . But you can not be for five minutes in the room with him without feeling that Caesar and Napoleon would have been children in his hands . "
7152	7342	7139	7139	He	329	" But whenever he gives advice it is always something as startling as an epigram , and yet as practical as the Bank of England . I said to him , What disguise will hide me from the world ? What can I find more respectable than bishops and majors ? ' He looked at me with his large but indecipherable face . You want a safe disguise , do you ? You want a dress which will guarantee you harmless ; a dress in which no one would ever look for a bomb ? ' I nodded . He suddenly lifted his lion 's voice . Why , then , dress up as an _ anarchist _ , you fool ! ' he roared so that the room shook . Nobody will ever expect you to do anything dangerous then . ' And he turned his broad back on me without another word . I took his advice , and have never regretted it . I preached blood and murder to those women day and night , and by God ! they would let me wheel their perambulators . "
7357	7363	7364	7364	he	330	" You took me in , "
7367	7375	7364	7364	he	330	" It is really a smart dodge . "
7382	7393	7380	7380	he	330	" What do you call this tremendous President of yours ? "
7394	7401	7403	7403	Gregory	112	" We generally call him Sunday , "
7407	7540	7403	7403	Gregory	112	" You see , there are seven members of the Central Anarchist Council , and they are named after days of the week . He is called Sunday , by some of his admirers Bloody Sunday . It is curious you should mention the matter , because the very night you have dropped in ( if I may so express it ) is the night on which our London branch , which assembles in this room , has to elect its own deputy to fill a vacancy in the Council . The gentleman who has for some time past played , with propriety and general applause , the difficult part of Thursday , has died quite suddenly . Consequently , we have called a meeting this very evening to elect a successor . "
7558	7571	7572	7572	he	331	" I feel somehow as if you were my mother , Syme , "
7576	7659	7572	7572	he	331	" I feel that I can confide anything to you , as you have promised to tell nobody . In fact , I will confide to you something that I would not say in so many words to the anarchists who will be coming to the room in about ten minutes . We shall , of course , go through a form of election ; but I do n't mind telling you that it is practically certain what the result will be . "
7668	7682	7660	7660	He	331	" It is almost a settled thing that I am to be Thursday . "
7683	7688	7690	7690	Syme	93	" My dear fellow . "
7693	7702	7690	7690	Syme	93	" I congratulate you . A great career ! "
7717	7733	7734	7734	he	331	" As a matter of fact , everything is ready for me on this table , "
7737	7748	7734	7734	he	331	" and the ceremony will probably be the shortest possible . "
7814	7826	7828	7828	Gregory	112	" I have only to get the form of election finished , "
7832	7889	7891	7891	he	331	" then I snatch up this cloak and stick , stuff these other things into my pocket , step out of a door in this cavern , which opens on the river , where there is a steam - tug already waiting for me , and then then oh , the wild joy of being Thursday ! "
7921	7926	7927	7927	he	93	" Why is it , "
7931	7951	7927	7927	he	93	" that I think you are quite a decent fellow ? Why do I positively like you , Gregory ? "
7967	7977	7952	7952	He	93	" Is it because you are such an ass ? "
7990	8062	7987	7987	he	93	" Well , damn it all ! this is the funniest situation I have ever been in in my life , and I am going to act accordingly . Gregory , I gave you a promise before I came into this place . That promise I would keep under red - hot pincers . Would you give me , for my own safety , a little promise of the same kind ? "
8063	8067	8069	8069	Gregory	112	" A promise ? "
8073	8076	8078	8078	Syme	93	" Yes , "
8082	8126	8078	8078	Syme	93	" a promise . I swore before God that I would not tell your secret to the police . Will you swear by Humanity , or whatever beastly thing you believe in , that you will not tell my secret to the anarchists ? "
8127	8131	8133	8135	the staring Gregory	112	" Your secret ? "
8137	8144	8133	8135	the staring Gregory	112	" Have you got a secret ? "
8145	8148	8150	8150	Syme	93	" Yes , "
8152	8158	8150	8150	Syme	93	" I have a secret . "
8164	8169	8150	8150	Syme	93	" Will you swear ? "
8184	8230	8150	8150	Syme	93	" You must have bewitched me , but I feel a furious curiosity about you . Yes , I will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell me . But look sharp , for they will be here in a couple of minutes . "
8277	8280	8282	8282	Syme	93	" Well , "
8285	8332	8282	8282	Syme	93	" I do n't know how to tell you the truth more shortly than by saying that your expedient of dressing up as an aimless poet is not confined to you or your President . We have known the dodge for some time at Scotland Yard . "
8345	8351	8352	8352	he	336	" What do you say ? "
8359	8362	8364	8364	Syme	93	" Yes , "
8367	8383	8364	8364	Syme	93	" I am a police detective . But I think I hear your friends coming . "
8392	8397	8352	8352	he	336	" Mr. Joseph Chamberlain . "
8506	8515	8516	8516	he	93	" Do n't be such a silly man , "
8527	8558	8516	8516	he	93	" Do n't you see it 's not necessary ? Do n't you see that we 're both in the same boat ? Yes , and jolly sea - sick . "
8577	8588	8590	8590	Syme	93	" Do n't you see we 've checkmated each other ? "
8592	8744	8590	8590	Syme	93	" I ca n't tell the police you are an anarchist . You ca n't tell the anarchists I 'm a policeman . I can only watch you , knowing what you are ; you can only watch me , knowing what I am . In short , it 's a lonely , intellectual duel , my head against yours . I 'm a policeman deprived of the help of the police . You , my poor fellow , are an anarchist deprived of the help of that law and organisation which is so essential to anarchy . The one solitary difference is in your favour . You are not surrounded by inquisitive policemen ; I am surrounded by inquisitive anarchists . I can not betray you , but I might betray myself . Come , come ! wait and see me betray myself . I shall do it so nicely . "
8765	8773	8774	8774	he	93	" I do n't believe in immortality , "
8779	8809	8774	8774	he	93	" but if , after all this , you were to break your word , God would make a hell only for you , to howl in for ever . "
8810	8818	8820	8820	Syme	93	" I shall not break my word , "
8823	8835	8820	8820	Syme	93	" nor will you break yours . Here are your friends . "
8888	8892	8893	8893	he	343	" Comrade Gregory , "
8896	8905	8893	8893	he	343	" I suppose this man is a delegate ? "
8926	8954	8922	8922	Syme	93	" I am glad to see that your gate is well enough guarded to make it hard for anyone to be here who was not a delegate . "
8976	8983	8984	8984	he	343	" What branch do you represent ? "
8988	8997	8999	8999	Syme	93	" I should hardly call it a branch , "
9003	9015	8999	8999	Syme	93	" I should call it at the very least a root . "
9016	9022	8958	8964	the little man with the black beard	345	" What do you mean ? "
9023	9028	9030	9030	Syme	93	" The fact is , "
9033	9059	9030	9030	Syme	93	" the truth is I am a Sabbatarian . I have been specially sent here to see that you show a due observance of Sunday . "
9105	9110	9112	9116	the man with the papers	351	" Well , comrade , "
9121	9135	9112	9116	the man with the papers	351	" I suppose we 'd better give you a seat in the meeting ? "
9136	9146	9148	9148	Syme	93	" If you ask my advice as a friend , "
9153	9160	9148	9148	Syme	93	" I think you 'd better . "
9346	9355	9356	9356	he	346	" I think it is time we began , "
9359	9380	9356	9356	he	346	" the steam - tug is waiting on the river already . I move that Comrade Buttons takes the chair . "
9402	9405	9406	9406	he	346	" Comrades , "
9417	9684	9406	9406	he	346	" our meeting tonight is important , though it need not be long . This branch has always had the honour of electing Thursdays for the Central European Council . We have elected many and splendid Thursdays . We all lament the sad decease of the heroic worker who occupied the post until last week . As you know , his services to the cause were considerable . He organised the great dynamite coup of Brighton which , under happier circumstances , ought to have killed everybody on the pier . As you also know , his death was as self - denying as his life , for he died through his faith in a hygienic mixture of chalk and water as a substitute for milk , which beverage he regarded as barbaric , and as involving cruelty to the cow . Cruelty , or anything approaching to cruelty , revolted him always . But it is not to acclaim his virtues that we are met , but for a harder task . It is difficult properly to praise his qualities , but it is more difficult to replace them . Upon you , comrades , it devolves this evening to choose out of the company present the man who shall be Thursday . If any comrade suggests a name I will put it to the vote . If no comrade suggests a name , I can only tell myself that that dear dynamiter , who is gone from us , has carried into the unknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his innocence . "
9729	9739	9703	9714	a large old man , with a long and venerable white beard	361	" I move that Comrade Gregory be elected Thursday , "
9746	9751	9753	9754	the chairman	363	" Does anyone second ? "
9768	9778	9780	9781	the chairman	363	" Before I put the matter to the vote , "
9783	9795	9780	9781	the chairman	363	" I will call on Comrade Gregory to make a statement . "
9976	9979	9981	9981	Gregory	112	" Comrades , "
9990	10316	9981	9981	Gregory	112	" it is not necessary for me to tell you what is my policy , for it is your policy also . Our belief has been slandered , it has been disfigured , it has been utterly confused and concealed , but it has never been altered . Those who talk about anarchism and its dangers go everywhere and anywhere to get their information , except to us , except to the fountain head . They learn about anarchists from sixpenny novels ; they learn about anarchists from tradesmen 's newspapers ; they learn about anarchists from _ Ally Sloper 's Half - Holiday _ and the _ Sporting Times _ . They never learn about anarchists from anarchists . We have no chance of denying the mountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from one end of Europe to another . The man who has always heard that we are walking plagues has never heard our reply . I know that he will not hear it tonight , though my passion were to rend the roof . For it is deep , deep under the earth that the persecuted are permitted to assemble , as the Christians assembled in the Catacombs . But if , by some incredible accident , there were here tonight a man who all his life had thus immensely misunderstood us , I would put this question to him : When those Christians met in those Catacombs , what sort of moral reputation had they in the streets above ? What tales were told of their atrocities by one educated Roman to another ? Suppose ' ( I would say to him ) , suppose that we are only repeating that still mysterious paradox of history . Suppose we seem as shocking as the Christians because we are really as harmless as the Christians . Suppose we seem as mad as the Christians because we are really as meek . "
10360	10366	10346	10351	the man with the velvet jacket	373	" I 'm not meek ! "
10367	10373	10375	10375	Gregory	112	" Comrade Witherspoon tells us , "
10377	10497	10375	10375	Gregory	112	" that he is not meek . Ah , how little he knows himself ! His words are , indeed , extravagant ; his appearance is ferocious , and even ( to an ordinary taste ) unattractive . But only the eye of a friendship as deep and delicate as mine can perceive the deep foundation of solid meekness which lies at the base of him , too deep even for himself to see . I repeat , we are the true early Christians , only that we come too late . We are simple , as they revere simple look at Comrade Witherspoon . We are modest , as they were modest look at me . We are merciful "
10498	10503	10506	10507	Mr. Witherspoon	114	" No , no ! "
10513	10520	10522	10522	Gregory	112	" I say we are merciful , "
10525	10552	10522	10522	Gregory	112	" as the early Christians were merciful . Yet this did not prevent their being accused of eating human flesh . We do not eat human flesh "
10553	10556	10558	10558	Witherspoon	114	" Shame ! "
10560	10564	10558	10558	Witherspoon	114	" Why not ? "
10565	10569	10571	10571	Gregory	112	" Comrade Witherspoon , "
10578	10609	10571	10571	Gregory	112	" is anxious to know why nobody eats him ( laughter ) . In our society , at any rate , which loves him sincerely , which is founded upon love "
10610	10615	10617	10617	Witherspoon	113	" No , no ! "
10619	10624	10617	10617	Witherspoon	113	" down with love . "
10625	10632	10634	10634	Gregory	112	" Which is founded upon love , "
10640	10707	10637	10637	his	374	" there will be no difficulty about the aims which we shall pursue as a body , or which I should pursue were I chosen as the representative of that body . Superbly careless of the slanders that represent us as assassins and enemies of human society , we shall pursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure , the permanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity . "
10741	10751	10728	10729	the chairman	363	" Does anyone oppose the election of Comrade Gregory ? "
10820	10829	10807	10807	Syme	93	" Yes , Mr. Chairman , I oppose . "
10888	10891	10892	10892	he	93	" Comrades ! "
10908	11077	10892	10892	he	93	" have we come here for this ? Do we live underground like rats in order to listen to talk like this ? This is talk we might listen to while eating buns at a Sunday School treat . Do we line these walls with weapons and bar that door with death lest anyone should come and hear Comrade Gregory saying to us , Be good , and you will be happy , ' Honesty is the best policy , ' and Virtue is its own reward ' ? There was not a word in Comrade Gregory 's address to which a curate could not have listened with pleasure ( hear , hear ) . But I am not a curate ( loud cheers ) , and I did not listen to it with pleasure ( renewed cheers ) . The man who is fitted to make a good curate is not fitted to make a resolute , forcible , and efficient Thursday ( hear , hear ) . "
11078	11179	11209	11209	he	93	" Comrade Gregory has told us , in only too apologetic a tone , that we are not the enemies of society . But I say that we are the enemies of society , and so much the worse for society . We are the enemies of society , for society is the enemy of humanity , its oldest and its most pitiless enemy ( hear , hear ) . Comrade Gregory has told us ( apologetically again ) that we are not murderers . There I agree . We are not murderers , we are executioners ( cheers ) . "
11218	11223	11209	11209	he	93	" You damnable hypocrite ! "
11242	11461	11209	11209	he	93	" Comrade Gregory accuses me of hypocrisy . He knows as well as I do that I am keeping all my engagements and doing nothing but my duty . I do not mince words . I do not pretend to . I say that Comrade Gregory is unfit to be Thursday for all his amiable qualities . He is unfit to be Thursday because of his amiable qualities . We do not want the Supreme Council of Anarchy infected with a maudlin mercy ( hear , hear ) . This is no time for ceremonial politeness , neither is it a time for ceremonial modesty . I set myself against Comrade Gregory as I would set myself against all the Governments of Europe , because the anarchist who has given himself to anarchy has forgotten modesty as much as he has forgotten pride ( cheers ) . I am not a man at all . I am a cause ( renewed cheers ) . I set myself against Comrade Gregory as impersonally and as calmly as I should choose one pistol rather than another out of that rack upon the wall ; and I say that rather than have Gregory and his milk - and - water methods on the Supreme Council , I would offer myself for election "
11559	11566	11567	11567	he	381	" Stop , you blasted madmen ! "
11581	11585	11567	11567	he	381	" Stop , you "
11614	11718	11604	11604	Syme	93	" I do not go to the Council to rebut that slander that calls us murderers ; I go to earn it ( loud and prolonged cheering ) . To the priest who says these men are the enemies of religion , to the judge who says these men are the enemies of law , to the fat parliamentarian who says these men are the enemies of order and public decency , to all these I will reply , You are false kings , but you are true prophets . I am come to destroy you , and to fulfil your prophecies . ' "
11749	11766	11731	11731	Witherspoon	113	" I move , as an amendment , that Comrade Syme be appointed to the post . "
11767	11776	11778	11778	Gregory	112	" Stop all this , I tell you ! "
11786	11793	11778	11778	Gregory	112	" Stop it , it is all "
11807	11814	11815	11815	he	113	" Does anyone second this amendment ? "
11871	11877	11878	11878	he	113	" I end all this ! "
11889	11900	11878	11878	he	113	" This man can not be elected . He is a "
11901	11904	11906	11906	Syme	116	" Yes , "
11911	11916	11906	11906	Syme	116	" what is he ? "
11938	11949	11950	11950	he	113	" He is a man quite inexperienced in our work , "
11987	11998	11964	11972	the long , lean man with the American beard	385	" I beg to second the election of Comrade Syme . "
11999	12011	12013	12014	Mr. Buttons	117	" The amendment will , as usual , be put first , "
12023	12030	11964	11972	the long , lean man with the American beard	385	" The question is that Comrade Syme "
12043	12046	12047	12047	he	384	" Comrades , "
12051	12058	12047	12047	he	384	" I am not a madman . "
12059	12064	12066	12067	Mr. Witherspoon	114	" Oh , oh ! "
12069	12076	12078	12078	Gregory	112	" I am not a madman , "
12092	12165	12078	12078	Gregory	112	" but I give you a counsel which you can call mad if you like . No , I will not call it a counsel , for I can give you no reason for it . I will call it a command . Call it a mad command , but act upon it . Strike , but hear me ! Kill me , but obey me ! Do not elect this man . "
12207	12211	12204	12204	He	116	" Comrade Gregory commands "
12225	12235	12237	12238	another anarchist	390	" Who are you ? You are not Sunday ; "
12245	12252	12237	12238	another anarchist	390	" And you are not Thursday . "
12253	12256	12258	12258	Gregory	112	" Comrades , "
12279	12333	12258	12258	Gregory	112	" it is nothing to me whether you detest me as a tyrant or detest me as a slave . If you will not take my command , accept my degradation . I kneel to you . I throw myself at your feet . I implore you . Do not elect this man . "
12334	12338	12340	12341	the chairman	363	" Comrade Gregory , "
12347	12355	12340	12341	the chairman	363	" this is really not quite dignified . "
12403	12422	12389	12390	the chairman	363	" The question is that Comrade Syme be elected to the post of Thursday on the General Council . "
12564	12570	12572	12572	Gregory	112	" You are a devil ! "
12576	12583	12585	12585	Syme	116	" And you are a gentleman , "
12589	12597	12599	12599	Gregory	112	" It was you that entrapped me , "
12607	12611	12599	12599	Gregory	112	" entrapped me into "
12612	12616	12618	12618	Syme	116	" Talk sense , "
12621	12692	12694	12694	he	116	" Into what sort of devils ' parliament have you entrapped me , if it comes to that ? You made me swear before I made you . Perhaps we are both doing what we think right . But what we think right is so damned different that there can be nothing between us in the way of concession . There is nothing possible between us but honour and death , "
12711	12718	12720	12721	Mr. Buttons	117	" The boat is quite ready , "
12726	12735	12720	12721	Mr. Buttons	117	" Be good enough to step this way . "
12843	12850	12851	12851	he	93	" You have kept your word , "
12861	12913	12851	12851	he	93	" You are a man of honour , and I thank you . You have kept it even down to a small particular . There was one special thing you promised me at the beginning of the affair , and which you have certainly given me by the end of it . "
12914	12920	12924	12924	Gregory	112	" What do you mean ? "
12926	12933	12924	12924	Gregory	112	" What did I promise you ? "
12934	12940	12942	12942	Syme	93	" A very entertaining evening , "
13710	13714	13699	13703	a policeman on the Embankment	448	" Good evening . "
13747	13754	13755	13755	he	93	" A good evening is it ? "
13759	13847	13755	13755	he	93	" You fellows would call the end of the world a good evening . Look at that bloody red sun and that bloody river ! I tell you that if that were literally human blood , spilt and shining , you would still be standing here as solid as ever , looking out for some poor harmless tramp whom you could move on . You policemen are cruel to the poor , but I could forgive you even your cruelty if it were not for your calm . "
13848	13854	13856	13857	the policeman	451	" If we are calm , "
13859	13868	13856	13857	the policeman	451	" it is the calm of organised resistance . "
13869	13872	13874	13874	Syme	93	" Eh ? "
13878	13891	13893	13894	the policeman	451	" The soldier must be calm in the thick of the battle , "
13896	13909	13893	13894	the policeman	451	" The composure of an army is the anger of a nation . "
13910	13918	13920	13920	Syme	93	" Good God , the Board Schools ! "
13922	13928	13920	13920	Syme	93	" Is this undenominational education ? "
13929	13932	13934	13935	the policeman	451	" No , "
13938	13971	13934	13935	the policeman	451	" I never had any of those advantages . The Board Schools came after my time . What education I had was very rough and old - fashioned , I am afraid . "
13972	13979	13981	13981	Syme	93	" Where did you have it ? "
13985	13991	13993	13994	the policeman	451	" Oh , at Harrow , "
14024	14032	14033	14033	he	451	" But , good Lord , man , "
14036	14045	14033	14033	he	451	" you ought n't to be a policeman ! "
14054	14058	14059	14059	he	451	" I know , "
14063	14071	14059	14059	he	451	" I know I am not worthy . "
14072	14081	14083	14083	Syme	93	" But why did you join the police ? "
14088	14100	14102	14103	the other	300	" For much the same reason that you abused the police , "
14105	14156	14102	14103	the other	300	" I found that there was a special opening in the service for those whose fears for humanity were concerned rather with the aberrations of the scientific intellect than with the normal and excusable , though excessive , outbreaks of the human will . I trust I make myself clear . "
14157	14168	14170	14170	Syme	93	" If you mean that you make your opinion clear , "
14172	14212	14170	14170	Syme	93	" I suppose you do . But as for making yourself clear , it is the last thing you do . How comes a man like you to be talking philosophy in a blue helmet on the Thames embankment ? "
14213	14228	14230	14231	the other	300	" You have evidently not heard of the latest development in our police system , "
14233	14282	14230	14231	the other	300	" I am not surprised at it . We are keeping it rather dark from the educated class , because that class contains most of our enemies . But you seem to be exactly in the right frame of mind . I think you might almost join us . "
14283	14289	14291	14291	Syme	93	" Join you in what ? "
14293	14299	14301	14302	the policeman	451	" I will tell you , "
14305	14457	14301	14302	the policeman	451	" This is the situation : The head of one of our departments , one of the most celebrated detectives in Europe , has long been of opinion that a purely intellectual conspiracy would soon threaten the very existence of civilisation . He is certain that the scientific and artistic worlds are silently bound in a crusade against the Family and the State . He has , therefore , formed a special corps of policemen , policemen who are also philosophers . It is their business to watch the beginnings of this conspiracy , not merely in a criminal but in a controversial sense . I am a democrat myself , and I am fully aware of the value of the ordinary man in matters of ordinary valour or virtue . But it would obviously be undesirable to employ the common policeman in an investigation which is also a heresy hunt . "
14468	14476	14477	14477	he	93	" What do you do , then ? "
14480	14488	14490	14493	the man in blue	460	" The work of the philosophical policeman , "
14495	14623	14490	14493	the man in blue	460	" is at once bolder and more subtle than that of the ordinary detective . The ordinary detective goes to pot - houses to arrest thieves ; we go to artistic tea - parties to detect pessimists . The ordinary detective discovers from a ledger or a diary that a crime has been committed . We discover from a book of sonnets that a crime will be committed . We have to trace the origin of those dreadful thoughts that drive men on at last to intellectual fanaticism and intellectual crime . We were only just in time to prevent the assassination at Hartlepool , and that was entirely due to the fact that our Mr. Wilks ( a smart young fellow ) thoroughly understood a triolet . "
14624	14629	14631	14631	Syme	93	" Do you mean , "
14633	14651	14631	14631	Syme	93	" that there is really as much connection between crime and the modern intellect as all that ? "
14652	14659	14661	14662	the policeman	451	" You are not sufficiently democratic , "
14664	14928	14661	14662	the policeman	451	" but you were right when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business . I tell you I am sometimes sick of my trade when I see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate . But this new movement of ours is a very different affair . We deny the snobbish English assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals . We remember the Roman Emperors . We remember the great poisoning princes of the Renaissance . We say that the dangerous criminal is the educated criminal . We say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher . Compared to him , burglars and bigamists are essentially moral men ; my heart goes out to them . They accept the essential ideal of man ; they merely seek it wrongly . Thieves respect property . They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it . But philosophers dislike property as property ; they wish to destroy the very idea of personal possession . Bigamists respect marriage , or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy . But philosophers despise marriage as marriage . Murderers respect human life ; they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives . But philosophers hate life itself , their own as much as other people 's . "
14935	14941	14942	14942	he	93	" How true that is , "
14945	15130	14942	14942	he	93	" I have felt it from my boyhood , but never could state the verbal antithesis . The common criminal is a bad man , but at least he is , as it were , a conditional good man . He says that if only a certain obstacle be removed say a wealthy uncle he is then prepared to accept the universe and to praise God . He is a reformer , but not an anarchist . He wishes to cleanse the edifice , but not to destroy it . But the evil philosopher is not trying to alter things , but to annihilate them . Yes , the modern world has retained all those parts of police work which are really oppressive and ignominious , the harrying of the poor , the spying upon the unfortunate . It has given up its more dignified work , the punishment of powerful traitors in the State and powerful heresiarchs in the Church . The moderns say we must not punish heretics . My only doubt is whether we have a right to punish anybody else . "
15131	15137	15139	15140	the policeman	451	" But this is absurd ! "
15157	15234	15139	15140	the policeman	451	" but it is intolerable ! I do n't know what you 're doing , but you 're wasting your life . You must , you shall , join our special army against anarchy . Their armies are on our frontiers . Their bolt is ready to fall . A moment more , and you may lose the glory of working with us , perhaps the glory of dying with the last heroes of the world . "
15235	15247	15249	15249	Syme	93	" It is a chance not to be missed , certainly , "
15251	15319	15249	15249	Syme	93	" but still I do not quite understand . I know as well as anybody that the modern world is full of lawless little men and mad little movements . But , beastly as they are , they generally have the one merit of disagreeing with each other . How can you talk of their leading one army or hurling one bolt . What is this anarchy ? "
15320	15326	15328	15329	the constable	463	" Do not confuse it , "
15331	15523	15328	15329	the constable	463	" with those chance dynamite outbreaks from Russia or from Ireland , which are really the outbreaks of oppressed , if mistaken , men . This is a vast philosophic movement , consisting of an outer and an inner ring . You might even call the outer ring the laity and the inner ring the priesthood . I prefer to call the outer ring the innocent section , the inner ring the supremely guilty section . The outer ring the main mass of their supporters are merely anarchists ; that is , men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness . They believe that all the evil results of human crime are the results of the system that has called it crime . They do not believe that the crime creates the punishment . They believe that the punishment has created the crime . They believe that if a man seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as blameless as the flowers of spring . They believe that if a man picked a pocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good . These I call the innocent section . "
15524	15527	15529	15529	Syme	93	" Oh ! "
15531	15609	15611	15612	the policeman	451	" Naturally , therefore , these people talk about a happy time coming ' ; the paradise of the future ' ; mankind freed from the bondage of vice and the bondage of virtue , ' and so on . And so also the men of the inner circle speak the sacred priesthood . They also speak to applauding crowds of the happiness of the future , and of mankind freed at last . But in their mouths "
15616	15697	15614	15614	his	451	" in their mouths these happy phrases have a horrible meaning . They are under no illusions ; they are too intellectual to think that man upon this earth can ever be quite free of original sin and the struggle . And they mean death . When they say that mankind shall be free at last , they mean that mankind shall commit suicide . When they talk of a paradise without right or wrong , they mean the grave . "
15698	15753	15614	15614	his	451	" They have but two objects , to destroy first humanity and then themselves . That is why they throw bombs instead of firing pistols . The innocent rank and file are disappointed because the bomb has not killed the king ; but the high - priesthood are happy because it has killed somebody . "
15754	15761	15763	15763	Syme	93	" How can I join you ? "
15771	15786	15788	15789	the policeman	451	" I know for a fact that there is a vacancy at the moment , "
15791	15845	15788	15789	the policeman	451	" as I have the honour to be somewhat in the confidence of the chief of whom I have spoken . You should really come and see him . Or rather , I should not say see him , nobody ever sees him ; but you can talk to him if you like . "
15846	15849	15851	15851	Syme	93	" Telephone ? "
15856	15859	15861	15862	the policeman	451	" No , "
15865	15892	15861	15862	the policeman	451	" he has a fancy for always sitting in a pitch - dark room . He says it makes his thoughts brighter . Do come along . "
15987	15994	16030	16034	a man of massive stature	470	" Are you the new recruit ? "
16048	16055	16057	16068	the invisible chief , who seemed to have heard all about it	472	" Are you the new recruit ? "
16070	16078	16057	16068	the invisible chief , who seemed to have heard all about it	472	" All right . You are engaged . "
16096	16103	16104	16104	he	93	" I really have no experience , "
16107	16114	16116	16117	the other	300	" No one has any experience , "
16119	16126	16116	16117	the other	300	" of the Battle of Armageddon . "
16127	16133	16104	16104	he	93	" But I am really unfit "
16134	16143	16145	16146	the unknown	474	" You are willing , that is enough , "
16148	16153	16155	16155	Syme	93	" Well , really , "
16157	16173	16155	16155	Syme	93	" I do n't know any profession of which mere willingness is the final test . "
16174	16178	16180	16181	the other	300	" I do , "
16182	16195	16180	16181	the other	300	" martyrs . I am condemning you to death . Good day . "
16343	16348	16325	16326	the police	2193	" The Last Crusade , "
17604	17613	17614	17614	he	315	" If we walk up towards Leicester Square , "
17617	17641	17614	17614	he	315	" we shall just be in time for breakfast . Sunday always insists on an early breakfast . Have you had any sleep ? "
17642	17645	17647	17647	Syme	93	" No , "
17649	17654	17656	17657	the man	315	" Nor have I , "
17663	17674	17656	17657	the man	315	" I shall try to get to bed after breakfast . "
17725	17909	17720	17721	the man	315	" Of course , the Secretary of the branch told you everything that can be told . But the one thing that can never be told is the last notion of the President , for his notions grow like a tropical forest . So in case you do n't know , I 'd better tell you that he is carrying out his notion of concealing ourselves by not concealing ourselves to the most extraordinary lengths just now . Originally , of course , we met in a cell underground , just as your branch does . Then Sunday made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant . He said that if you did n't seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out . Well , he is the only man on earth , I know ; but sometimes I really think that his huge brain is going a little mad in its old age . For now we flaunt ourselves before the public . We have our breakfast on a balcony on a balcony , if you please overlooking Leicester Square . "
17910	17918	17920	17920	Syme	93	" And what do the people say ? "
17922	17931	17933	17934	his guide	536	" It 's quite simple what they say , "
17936	17952	17720	17721	the man	315	" They say we are a lot of jolly gentlemen who pretend they are anarchists . "
17953	17963	17965	17965	Syme	93	" It seems to me a very clever idea , "
17967	17977	17980	17981	the other	300	" Clever ! God blast your impudence ! Clever ! "
17999	18017	17980	17981	the other	300	" When you 've seen Sunday for a split second you 'll leave off calling him clever . "
18640	18649	18650	18650	he	571	" The gentlemen are up there , sare , "
18653	18677	18650	18650	he	571	" They do talk and they do laugh at what they talk . They do say they will throw bombs at ze king . "
19322	19327	19329	19330	the President	2547	" Our friend Tuesday , "
19342	19476	19329	19330	the President	2547	" our friend Tuesday does n't seem to grasp the idea . He dresses up like a gentleman , but he seems to be too great a soul to behave like one . He insists on the ways of the stage conspirator . Now if a gentleman goes about London in a top hat and a frock - coat , no one need know that he is an anarchist . But if a gentleman puts on a top hat and a frock - coat , and then goes about on his hands and knees well , he may attract attention . That 's what Brother Gogol does . He goes about on his hands and knees with such inexhaustible diplomacy , that by this time he finds it quite difficult to walk upright . "
19477	19485	19487	19487	Gogol	126	" I am not good at concealment , "
19496	19505	19487	19487	Gogol	126	" I am not ashamed of the cause . "
19506	19522	19524	19525	the President	2547	" Yes you are , my boy , and so is the cause of you , "
19530	19625	19524	19525	the President	2547	" You hide as much as anybody ; but you ca n't do it , you see , you 're such an ass ! You try to combine two inconsistent methods . When a householder finds a man under his bed , he will probably pause to note the circumstance . But if he finds a man under his bed in a top hat , you will agree with me , my dear Tuesday , that he is not likely even to forget it . Now when you were found under Admiral Biffin 's bed "
19626	19634	19636	19636	Tuesday	127	" I am not good at deception , "
19641	19649	19651	19652	the President	2547	" Right , my boy , right , "
19658	19666	19651	19652	the President	2547	" you are n't good at anything . "
22231	22237	22239	22240	the Marquis	712	" I have often wondered , "
22255	22304	22239	22240	the Marquis	712	" whether it would n't be better for me to do it with a knife . Most of the best things have been brought off with a knife . And it would be a new emotion to get a knife into a French President and wriggle it round . "
22305	22310	22312	22313	the Secretary	670	" You are wrong , "
22321	22397	22398	22398	he	110	" The knife was merely the expression of the old personal quarrel with a personal tyrant . Dynamite is not only our best tool , but our best symbol . It is as perfect a symbol of us as is incense of the prayers of the Christians . It expands ; it only destroys because it broadens ; even so , thought only destroys because it broadens . A man 's brain is a bomb , "
22415	22449	22398	22398	he	110	" My brain feels like a bomb , night and day . It must expand ! It must expand ! A man 's brain must expand , if it breaks up the universe . "
22450	22462	22464	22465	the Marquis	712	" I do n't want the universe broken up just yet , "
22467	22489	22464	22465	the Marquis	712	" I want to do a lot of beastly things before I die . I thought of one yesterday in bed . "
22490	22503	22505	22506	Dr. Bull	135	" No , if the only end of the thing is nothing , "
22514	22521	22505	22506	Dr. Bull	135	" it hardly seems worth doing . "
22534	22542	22543	22543	he	714	" Every man knows in his heart , "
22546	22553	22543	22543	he	714	" that nothing is worth doing . "
22565	22622	22562	22563	the Secretary	670	" We are wandering , however , from the point . The only question is how Wednesday is to strike the blow . I take it we should all agree with the original notion of a bomb . As to the actual arrangements , I should suggest that tomorrow morning he should go first of all to "
22650	22656	22657	22657	he	110	" Before we discuss that , "
22666	22683	22657	22657	he	110	" let us go into a private room . I have something very particular to say . "
23050	23061	23099	23105	the people of the barrel - organ	746	" Pa ens ont tort et Chr tiens ont droit . "
23311	23316	23317	23317	he	126	" Zso ! Zso ! "
23333	23364	23317	23317	he	126	" You zay you nod ide . You zay you show himselves . It is all nuzzinks . Ven you vant talk importance you run yourselves in a dark box ! "
23380	23392	23393	23393	he	2547	" You ca n't get hold of it yet , Gogol , "
23400	23449	23393	23393	he	2547	" When once they have heard us talking nonsense on that balcony they will not care where we go afterwards . If we had come here first , we should have had the whole staff at the keyhole . You do n't seem to know anything about mankind . "
23450	23456	23458	23459	the Pole	760	" I die for zem , "
23464	23490	23458	23459	the Pole	760	" and I slay zare oppressors . I care not for these games of gonzealment . I would zmite ze tyrant in ze open square . "
23491	23498	23500	23501	the President	2547	" I see , I see , "
23517	23577	23500	23501	the President	2547	" You die for mankind first , and then you get up and smite their oppressors . So that 's all right . And now may I ask you to control your beautiful sentiments , and sit down with the other gentlemen at this table . For the first time this morning something intelligent is going to be said . "
23656	23659	23661	23662	the President	2547	" Comrades , "
23667	23765	23661	23662	the President	2547	" we have spun out this farce long enough . I have called you down here to tell you something so simple and shocking that even the waiters upstairs ( long inured to our levities ) might hear some new seriousness in my voice . Comrades , we were discussing plans and naming places . I propose , before saying anything else , that those plans and places should not be voted by this meeting , but should be left wholly in the control of some one reliable member . I suggest Comrade Saturday , Dr. Bull . "
23801	23836	23840	23840	his	110	" Not one word more about the plans and places must be said at this meeting . Not one tiny detail more about what we mean to do must be mentioned in this company . "
23923	23997	23919	23919	Sunday	110	" You will probably understand that there is only one possible motive for forbidding free speech at this festival of freedom . Strangers overhearing us matters nothing . They assume that we are joking . But what would matter , even unto death , is this , that there should be one actually among us who is not of us , who knows our grave purpose , but does not share it , who "
24007	24013	24014	24014	he	670	" It ca n't be ! "
24019	24023	24014	24014	he	670	" There ca n't "
24042	24045	24046	24046	he	2547	" Yes , "
24050	24076	24046	24046	he	2547	" there is a spy in this room . There is a traitor at this table . I will waste no more words . His name "
24091	24097	24099	24100	the President	2547	" His name is Gogol , "
24102	24117	24099	24100	the President	2547	" He is that hairy humbug over there who pretends to be a Pole . "
24193	24197	24199	24199	Sunday	110	" Sit down ! "
24241	24247	24249	24250	the President	2547	" Well , my man , "
24262	24284	24249	24250	the President	2547	" will you oblige me by putting your hand in your upper waistcoat pocket and showing me what you have there ? "
24393	24397	24399	24400	the President	2547	" Pathetic Slav , "
24402	24433	24399	24400	the President	2547	" tragic child of Poland , are you prepared in the presence of that card to deny that you are in this company shall we say _ de trop ? _ "
24434	24438	24440	24442	the late Gogol	126	" Right oh ! "
24483	24493	24495	24495	Sunday	110	" I gather that you fully understand your position , "
24497	24501	24503	24504	the Pole	760	" You bet , "
24506	24536	24503	24504	the Pole	760	" I see it 's a fair cop . All I say is , I do n't believe any Pole could have imitated my accent like I did his . "
24537	24543	24545	24545	Sunday	110	" I concede the point , "
24547	24576	24545	24545	Sunday	110	" I believe your own accent to be inimitable , though I shall practise it in my bath . Do you mind leaving your beard with your card ? "
24577	24582	24584	24584	Gogol	126	" Not a bit , "
24614	24619	24620	24620	he	126	" It was hot , "
24623	24633	24635	24635	Sunday	110	" I will do you the justice to say , "
24645	24734	24635	24635	Sunday	110	" that you seem to have kept pretty cool under it . Now listen to me . I like you . The consequence is that it would annoy me for just about two and a half minutes if I heard that you had died in torments . Well , if you ever tell the police or any human soul about us , I shall have that two and a half minutes of discomfort . On your discomfort I will not dwell . Good day . Mind the step . "
24803	24808	24810	24811	the President	2547	" Time is flying , "
24836	24855	24810	24811	the President	2547	" I must go off at once ; I have to take the chair at a Humanitarian meeting . "
24865	24872	24873	24873	he	670	" Would it not be better , "
24879	24897	24873	24873	he	670	" to discuss further the details of our project , now that the spy has left us ? "
24898	24905	24907	24908	the President	2547	" No , I think not , "
24917	24939	24907	24908	the President	2547	" Leave it as it is . Let Saturday settle it . I must be off . Breakfast here next Sunday . "
24969	24982	24983	24983	he	670	" I must protest , President , that the thing is irregular , "
24986	25021	24983	24983	he	670	" It is a fundamental rule of our society that all plans shall be debated in full council . Of course , I fully appreciate your forethought when in the actual presence of a traitor "
25022	25025	25027	25028	the President	2547	" Secretary , "
25031	25059	25027	25028	the President	2547	" if you 'd take your head home and boil it for a turnip it might be useful . I ca n't say . But it might . "
25071	25077	25078	25078	he	670	" I really fail to understand "
25084	25093	25095	25096	the President	2547	" That 's it , that 's it , "
25104	25124	25125	25125	he	2547	" That 's where you fail right enough . You fail to understand . Why , you dancing donkey , "
25130	25156	25125	25125	he	2547	" you did n't want to be overheard by a spy , did n't you ? How do you know you are n't overheard now ? "
26123	26132	26133	26133	he	93	" Can that old corpse be following me ? "
26142	26212	26133	26133	he	93	" I stopped too long up in that room , so that even such leaden feet could catch me up . One comfort is , with a little brisk walking I can put a man like that as far away as Timbuctoo . Or am I too fanciful ? Was he really following me ? Surely Sunday would not be such a fool as to send a lame man ? "
27532	27542	27543	27543	He	133	" the crooked man who went a crooked mile . "
27708	27715	27688	27688	He	93	" Catch me if you can , "
28161	28167	28149	28151	the old anarchist	928	" Are you a policeman ? "
28205	28209	28210	28210	he	93	" A policeman ? "
28216	28229	28210	28210	he	93	" Whatever made you think of a policeman in connection with me ? "
28230	28237	28239	28240	the Professor	773	" The process was simple enough , "
28243	28257	28239	28240	the Professor	773	" I thought you looked like a policeman . I think so now . "
28258	28273	28275	28275	Syme	93	" Did I take a policeman 's hat by mistake out of the restaurant ? "
28280	28319	28275	28275	Syme	93	" Have I by any chance got a number stuck on to me somewhere ? Have my boots got that watchful look ? Why must I be a policeman ? Do , do let me be a postman . "
28343	28435	28494	28496	The old man	855	" But perhaps I misunderstood the delicacies of your German philosophy . Perhaps policeman is a relative term . In an evolutionary sense , sir , the ape fades so gradually into the policeman , that I myself can never detect the shade . The monkey is only the policeman that may be . Perhaps a maiden lady on Clapham Common is only the policeman that might have been . I do n't mind being the policeman that might have been . I do n't mind being anything in German thought . "
28436	28444	28446	28448	the old man	855	" Are you in the police service ? "
28459	28465	28446	28448	the old man	855	" Are you a detective ? "
28479	28485	28486	28486	he	93	" Your suggestion is ridiculous , "
28489	28493	28486	28486	he	93	" Why on earth "
28511	28525	28526	28526	he	855	" Did you hear me ask a plain question , you pattering spy ? "
28535	28548	28526	28526	he	855	" Are you , or are you not , a police detective ? "
28549	28552	28554	28554	Syme	93	" No ! "
28566	28571	28573	28575	the old man	855	" You swear it , "
28592	28671	28573	28575	the old man	855	" You swear it ! You swear it ! If you swear falsely , will you be damned ? Will you be sure that the devil dances at your funeral ? Will you see that the nightmare sits on your grave ? Will there really be no mistake ? You are an anarchist , you are a dynamiter ! Above all , you are not in any sense a detective ? You are not in the British police ? "
28696	28705	28707	28707	Syme	93	" I am not in the British police , "
28728	28734	28735	28735	he	133	" That 's a pity , "
28738	28743	28735	28735	he	133	" because I am . "
28759	28765	28766	28766	he	133	" Because you are what ? "
28770	28775	28766	28766	he	133	" You are what ? "
28776	28782	28784	28785	the Professor	773	" I am a policeman , "
28798	28863	28868	28868	he	773	" But as you think policeman only a relative term , of course I have nothing to do with you . I am in the British police force ; but as you tell me you are not in the British police force , I can only say that I met you in a dynamiters ' club . I suppose I ought to arrest you . "
29215	29223	29225	29230	one wondering labourer from the docks	947	" What yer laughing at , guv'nor ? "
29232	29236	29238	29238	Syme	93	" At myself , "
29252	29257	29259	29260	the Professor	773	" Pull yourself together , "
29262	29279	29259	29260	the Professor	773	" or you 'll get hysterical . Have some more beer . I 'll join you . "
29280	29288	29290	29290	Syme	93	" You have n't drunk your milk , "
29292	29296	29298	29299	the other	300	" My milk ! "
29309	29345	29346	29346	he	93	" my milk ! Do you think I 'd look at the beastly stuff when I 'm out of sight of the bloody anarchists ? We 're all Christians in this room , though perhaps , "
29356	29377	29379	29379	he	93	" not strict ones . Finish my milk ? Great blazes ! yes , I 'll finish it right enough ! "
29409	29414	29415	29415	he	93	" I understand now , "
29418	29431	29415	29415	he	93	" of course , you 're not an old man at all . "
29432	29442	29444	29446	Professor de Worms	133	" I ca n't take my face off here , "
29448	29483	29444	29446	Professor de Worms	133	" It 's rather an elaborate make - up . As to whether I 'm an old man , that 's not for me to say . I was thirty - eight last birthday . "
29484	29491	29493	29493	Syme	93	" Yes , but I mean , "
29496	29505	29493	29493	Syme	93	" there 's nothing the matter with you . "
29506	29509	29511	29512	the other	300	" Yes , "
29515	29522	29511	29512	the other	300	" I am subject to colds . "
29589	29594	29595	29595	he	955	" Did you know , "
29598	29608	29595	29595	he	955	" that that man Gogol was one of us ? "
29609	29620	29622	29622	Syme	93	" I ? No , I did n't know it , "
29627	29633	29622	29622	Syme	93	" But did n't you ? "
29634	29643	29645	29651	the man who called himself de Worms	956	" I knew no more than the dead , "
29653	29670	29645	29651	the man who called himself de Worms	956	" I thought the President was talking about me , and I rattled in my boots . "
29671	29681	29683	29683	Syme	93	" And I thought he was talking about me , "
29691	29703	29683	29683	Syme	93	" I had my hand on my revolver all the time . "
29704	29709	29711	29712	the Professor	773	" So had I , "
29715	29721	29711	29712	the Professor	773	" so had Gogol evidently . "
29730	29740	29741	29741	he	93	" Why , there were three of us there ! "
29744	29764	29741	29741	he	93	" Three out of seven is a fighting number . If we had only known that we were three ! "
29780	29785	29786	29786	he	773	" We were three , "
29789	29803	29786	29786	he	773	" If we had been three hundred we could still have done nothing . "
29804	29814	29816	29816	Syme	93	" Not if we were three hundred against four ? "
29822	29825	29827	29828	the Professor	773	" No , "
29832	29842	29827	29828	the Professor	773	" not if we were three hundred against Sunday . "
29967	29970	29971	29971	he	93	" Professor , "
29974	29986	29971	29971	he	93	" it is intolerable . Are you afraid of this man ? "
30013	30019	30020	30020	he	773	" Yes , I am , "
30024	30029	30020	30020	he	773	" So are you . "
30058	30061	30062	30062	he	93	" Yes , "
30069	30127	30062	30062	he	93	" you are right . I am afraid of him . Therefore I swear by God that I will seek out this man whom I fear until I find him , and strike him on the mouth . If heaven were his throne and the earth his footstool , I swear that I would pull him down . "
30128	30131	30133	30135	the staring Professor	965	" How ? "
30137	30140	30133	30135	the staring Professor	965	" Why ? "
30141	30149	30151	30151	Syme	93	" Because I am afraid of him , "
30153	30169	30151	30151	Syme	93	" and no man should leave in the universe anything of which he is afraid . "
30205	30328	30190	30190	Syme	93	" Who would condescend to strike down the mere things that he does not fear ? Who would debase himself to be merely brave , like any common prizefighter ? Who would stoop to be fearless like a tree ? Fight the thing that you fear . You remember the old tale of the English clergyman who gave the last rites to the brigand of Sicily , and how on his death - bed the great robber said , I can give you no money , but I can give you advice for a lifetime : your thumb on the blade , and strike upwards . ' So I say to you , strike upwards , if you strike at the stars . "
30344	30351	30352	30352	he	300	" Sunday is a fixed star , "
30355	30364	30366	30366	Syme	93	" You shall see him a falling star , "
30387	30393	30394	30394	he	93	" Have you any idea , "
30404	30411	30394	30394	he	93	" exactly where you are going ? "
30412	30415	30417	30417	Syme	93	" Yes , "
30420	30433	30417	30417	Syme	93	" I am going to prevent this bomb being thrown in Paris . "
30434	30441	30443	30444	the other	300	" Have you any conception how ? "
30446	30449	30451	30451	Syme	93	" No , "
30456	30463	30465	30470	the soi - disant de Worms	969	" You remember , of course , "
30482	30555	30465	30470	the soi - disant de Worms	969	" that when we broke up rather hurriedly the whole arrangements for the atrocity were left in the private hands of the Marquis and Dr. Bull . The Marquis is by this time probably crossing the Channel . But where he will go and what he will do it is doubtful whether even the President knows ; certainly we do n't know . The only man who does know is Dr. Bull . "
30556	30560	30562	30562	Syme	93	" Confound it ! "
30564	30574	30562	30562	Syme	93	" And we do n't know where he is . "
30575	30578	30580	30581	the other	300	" Yes , "
30591	30599	30580	30581	the other	300	" I know where he is myself . "
30600	30606	30608	30608	Syme	93	" Will you tell me ? "
30613	30620	30622	30623	the Professor	773	" I will take you there , "
30647	30653	30654	30654	he	93	" What do you mean ? "
30658	30670	30654	30654	he	93	" Will you join me ? Will you take the risk ? "
30671	30675	30677	30678	the Professor	773	" Young man , "
30681	30746	30677	30678	the Professor	773	" I am amused to observe that you think I am a coward . As to that I will say only one word , and that shall be entirely in the manner of your own philosophical rhetoric . You think that it is possible to pull down the President . I know that it is impossible , and I am going to try it , "
30884	30890	30891	30891	Syme	93	" Where are you going ? "
30894	30898	30900	30901	the Professor	773	" Just now , "
30903	30929	30900	30901	the Professor	773	" I am going just round the corner to see whether Dr. Bull has gone to bed . He is hygienic , and retires early . "
30930	30934	30936	30936	Syme	93	" Dr. Bull ! "
30938	30946	30936	30936	Syme	93	" Does he live round the corner ? "
30947	30950	30952	30953	his friend	477	" No , "
30955	30988	30952	30953	his friend	477	" As a matter of fact he lives some way off , on the other side of the river , but we can tell from here whether he has gone to bed . "
31159	31165	31166	31166	he	773	" We are too late , "
31169	31178	31166	31166	he	773	" the hygienic Doctor has gone to bed . "
31179	31185	31187	31187	Syme	93	" What do you mean ? "
31189	31198	31187	31187	Syme	93	" Does he live over there , then ? "
31199	31202	31204	31205	de Worms	133	" Yes , "
31207	31233	31204	31205	de Worms	133	" behind that particular window which you ca n't see . Come along and get some dinner . We must call on him tomorrow morning . "
31318	31333	31335	31336	the Professor	773	" You can find good English inns left by accident everywhere , like fossils , "
31338	31350	31335	31336	the Professor	773	" I once found a decent place in the West End . "
31351	31355	31357	31357	Syme	93	" I suppose , "
31361	31374	31357	31357	Syme	93	" that this is the corresponding decent place in the East End ? "
31375	31379	31381	31382	the Professor	773	" It is , "
31590	31601	31603	31603	Syme	93	" That 's a good get - up of yours , "
31611	31633	31603	31603	Syme	93	" a lot better than old Gogol 's . Even at the start I thought he was a bit too hairy . "
31634	31641	31643	31644	the Professor	773	" A difference of artistic theory , "
31647	31700	31643	31644	the Professor	773	" Gogol was an idealist . He made up as the abstract or platonic ideal of an anarchist . But I am a realist . I am a portrait painter . But , indeed , to say that I am a portrait painter is an inadequate expression . I am a portrait . "
31701	31708	31710	31710	Syme	93	" I do n't understand you , "
31712	31718	31720	31721	the Professor	773	" I am a portrait , "
31723	31744	31720	31721	the Professor	773	" I am a portrait of the celebrated Professor de Worms , who is , I believe , in Naples . "
31745	31755	31757	31757	Syme	93	" You mean you are made up like him , "
31759	31774	31757	31757	Syme	93	" But does n't he know that you are taking his nose in vain ? "
31775	31782	31784	31785	his friend	477	" He knows it right enough , "
31788	31797	31720	31721	the Professor	773	" Then why does n't he denounce you ? "
31798	31804	31806	31807	the Professor	773	" I have denounced him , "
31809	31814	31816	31816	Syme	93	" Do explain yourself , "
31818	31831	31833	31836	the eminent foreign philosopher	1017	" With pleasure , if you do n't mind hearing my story , "
31838	32299	31833	31836	the eminent foreign philosopher	1017	" I am by profession an actor , and my name is Wilks . When I was on the stage I mixed with all sorts of Bohemian and blackguard company . Sometimes I touched the edge of the turf , sometimes the riff - raff of the arts , and occasionally the political refugee . In some den of exiled dreamers I was introduced to the great German Nihilist philosopher , Professor de Worms . I did not gather much about him beyond his appearance , which was very disgusting , and which I studied carefully . I understood that he had proved that the destructive principle in the universe was God ; hence he insisted on the need for a furious and incessant energy , rending all things in pieces . Energy , he said , was the All . He was lame , shortsighted , and partially paralytic . When I met him I was in a frivolous mood , and I disliked him so much that I resolved to imitate him . If I had been a draughtsman I would have drawn a caricature . I was only an actor , I could only act a caricature . I made myself up into what was meant for a wild exaggeration of the old Professor 's dirty old self . When I went into the room full of his supporters I expected to be received with a roar of laughter , or ( if they were too far gone ) with a roar of indignation at the insult . I can not describe the surprise I felt when my entrance was received with a respectful silence , followed ( when I had first opened my lips ) with a murmur of admiration . The curse of the perfect artist had fallen upon me . I had been too subtle , I had been too true . They thought I really was the great Nihilist Professor . I was a healthy - minded young man at the time , and I confess that it was a blow . Before I could fully recover , however , two or three of these admirers ran up to me radiating indignation , and told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next room . I inquired its nature . It seemed that an impertinent fellow had dressed himself up as a preposterous parody of myself . I had drunk more champagne than was good for me , and in a flash of folly I decided to see the situation through . Consequently it was to meet the glare of the company and my own lifted eyebrows and freezing eyes that the real Professor came into the room . "
32300	32734	32784	32785	the impersonator	1018	" I need hardly say there was a collision . The pessimists all round me looked anxiously from one Professor to the other Professor to see which was really the more feeble . But I won . An old man in poor health , like my rival , could not be expected to be so impressively feeble as a young actor in the prime of life . You see , he really had paralysis , and working within this definite limitation , he could n't be so jolly paralytic as I was . Then he tried to blast my claims intellectually . I countered that by a very simple dodge . Whenever he said something that nobody but he could understand , I replied with something which I could not even understand myself . I do n't fancy , ' he said , that you could have worked out the principle that evolution is only negation , since there inheres in it the introduction of lacuna , which are an essential of differentiation . ' I replied quite scornfully , You read all that up in Pinckwerts ; the notion that involution functioned eugenically was exposed long ago by Glumpe . ' It is unnecessary for me to say that there never were such people as Pinckwerts and Glumpe . But the people all round ( rather to my surprise ) seemed to remember them quite well , and the Professor , finding that the learned and mysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy slightly deficient in scruples , fell back upon a more popular form of wit . I see , ' he sneered , you prevail like the false pig in sop . ' And you fail , ' I answered , smiling , like the hedgehog in Montaigne . ' Need I say that there is no hedgehog in Montaigne ? Your claptrap comes off , ' he said ; so would your beard . ' I had no intelligent answer to this , which was quite true and rather witty . But I laughed heartily , answered , Like the Pantheist 's boots , ' at random , and turned on my heel with all the honours of victory . The real Professor was thrown out , but not with violence , though one man tried very patiently to pull off his nose . He is now , I believe , received everywhere in Europe as a delightful impostor . His apparent earnestness and anger , you see , make him all the more entertaining . "
32735	32738	32740	32740	Syme	93	" Well , "
32742	32772	32740	32740	Syme	93	" I can understand your putting on his dirty old beard for a night 's practical joke , but I do n't understand your never taking it off again . "
32773	32782	32784	32785	the impersonator	1018	" That is the rest of the story , "
32787	33087	32784	32785	the impersonator	1018	" When I myself left the company , followed by reverent applause , I went limping down the dark street , hoping that I should soon be far enough away to be able to walk like a human being . To my astonishment , as I was turning the corner , I felt a touch on the shoulder , and turning , found myself under the shadow of an enormous policeman . He told me I was wanted . I struck a sort of paralytic attitude , and cried in a high German accent , Yes , I am wanted by the oppressed of the world . You are arresting me on the charge of being the great anarchist , Professor de Worms . ' The policeman impassively consulted a paper in his hand , No , sir , ' he said civilly , at least , not exactly , sir . I am arresting you on the charge of not being the celebrated anarchist , Professor de Worms . ' This charge , if it was criminal at all , was certainly the lighter of the two , and I went along with the man , doubtful , but not greatly dismayed . I was shown into a number of rooms , and eventually into the presence of a police officer , who explained that a serious campaign had been opened against the centres of anarchy , and that this , my successful masquerade , might be of considerable value to the public safety . He offered me a good salary and this little blue card . Though our conversation was short , he struck me as a man of very massive common sense and humour ; but I can not tell you much about him personally , because "
33096	33100	33101	33101	he	93	" I know , "
33104	33115	33101	33101	he	93	" because you talked to him in a dark room . "
33132	33139	33141	33142	the Professor	773	" Burgundy is a jolly thing , "
33152	33162	33164	33164	Syme	93	" You do n't look as if it were , "
33166	33176	33164	33164	Syme	93	" you drink it as if it were medicine . "
33177	33184	33186	33187	the Professor	773	" You must excuse my manner , "
33190	33321	33186	33187	the Professor	773	" my position is rather a curious one . Inside I am really bursting with boyish merriment ; but I acted the paralytic Professor so well , that now I ca n't leave off . So that when I am among friends , and have no need at all to disguise myself , I still ca n't help speaking slow and wrinkling my forehead just as if it were my forehead . I can be quite happy , you understand , but only in a paralytic sort of way . The most buoyant exclamations leap up in my heart , but they come out of my mouth quite different . You should hear me say , Buck up , old cock ! ' It would bring tears to your eyes . "
33322	33326	33328	33328	Syme	93	" It does , "
33330	33349	33328	33328	Syme	93	" but I can not help thinking that apart from all that you are really a bit worried . "
33361	33369	33370	33370	he	773	" You are a very clever fellow , "
33373	33403	33370	33370	he	773	" it is a pleasure to work with you . Yes , I have rather a heavy cloud in my head . There is a great problem to face , "
33422	33429	33416	33416	he	773	" Can you play the piano ? "
33430	33433	33435	33435	Syme	93	" Yes , "
33440	33450	33435	33435	Syme	93	" I 'm supposed to have a good touch . "
33462	33471	33460	33460	he	773	" I trust the great cloud is lifted . "
33488	33503	33460	33460	he	773	" It would have done just as well if you could work a typewriter . "
33504	33508	33510	33510	Syme	93	" Thank you , "
33512	33517	33510	33510	Syme	93	" you flatter me . "
33518	33523	33525	33526	the other	300	" Listen to me , "
33528	33731	33525	33526	the other	300	" and remember whom we have to see tomorrow . You and I are going tomorrow to attempt something which is very much more dangerous than trying to steal the Crown Jewels out of the Tower . We are trying to steal a secret from a very sharp , very strong , and very wicked man . I believe there is no man , except the President , of course , who is so seriously startling and formidable as that little grinning fellow in goggles . He has not perhaps the white - hot enthusiasm unto death , the mad martyrdom for anarchy , which marks the Secretary . But then that very fanaticism in the Secretary has a human pathos , and is almost a redeeming trait . But the little Doctor has a brutal sanity that is more shocking than the Secretary 's disease . Do n't you notice his detestable virility and vitality . He bounces like an india - rubber ball . Depend on it , Sunday was not asleep ( I wonder if he ever sleeps ? ) when he locked up all the plans of this outrage in the round , black head of Dr. Bull . "
33732	33737	33739	33739	Syme	93	" And you think , "
33741	33757	33739	33739	Syme	93	" that this unique monster will be soothed if I play the piano to him ? "
33758	33765	33767	33768	his mentor	1026	" Do n't be an ass , "
33770	33834	33836	33836	he	93	" I mentioned the piano because it gives one quick and independent fingers . Syme , if we are to go through this interview and come out sane or alive , we must have some code of signals between us that this brute will not see . I have made a rough alphabetical cypher corresponding to the five fingers like this , see , "
33845	33859	33839	33839	his	93	" B A D , bad , a word we may frequently require . "
33965	33974	33976	33976	Syme	93	" We must have several word - signs , "
33978	34003	33976	33976	Syme	93	" words that we are likely to want , fine shades of meaning . My favourite word is coeval ' . What 's yours ? "
34004	34011	34013	34014	the Professor	773	" Do stop playing the goat , "
34017	34027	34013	34014	the Professor	773	" You do n't know how serious this is . "
34028	34033	34035	34035	Syme	93	" Lush ' too , "
34042	34058	34035	34035	Syme	93	" we must have lush ' word applied to grass , do n't you know ? "
34059	34064	34066	34067	the Professor	773	" Do you imagine , "
34070	34083	34066	34067	the Professor	773	" that we are going to talk to Dr. Bull about grass ? "
34084	34097	34099	34099	Syme	93	" There are several ways in which the subject could be approached , "
34102	34150	34099	34099	Syme	93	" and the word introduced without appearing forced . We might say , Dr. Bull , as a revolutionist , you remember that a tyrant once advised us to eat grass ; and indeed many of us , looking on the fresh lush grass of summer ... ' "
34151	34156	34158	34159	the other	300	" Do you understand , "
34161	34168	34158	34159	the other	300	" that this is a tragedy ? "
34169	34172	34174	34174	Syme	93	" Perfectly , "
34176	34234	34174	34174	Syme	93	" always be comic in a tragedy . What the deuce else can you do ? I wish this language of yours had a wider scope . I suppose we could not extend it from the fingers to the toes ? That would involve pulling off our boots and socks during the conversation , which however unobtrusively performed "
34235	34238	34240	34241	his friend	477	" Syme , "
34247	34252	34240	34241	his friend	477	" go to bed ! "
34384	34387	34389	34389	Syme	93	" Well , "
34401	34420	34395	34395	he	93	" I dreamt of that alphabet of yours . Did it take you long to make it up ? "
34448	34488	34445	34445	his	93	" I say , did it take you long to invent all this ? I 'm considered good at these things , and it was a good hour 's grind . Did you learn it all on the spot ? "
34510	34518	34558	34558	he	773	" How long did it take you ? "
34525	34534	34537	34537	Syme	93	" Confound you , ca n't you answer ? "
34770	34785	34755	34755	Syme	93	" I will only talk like this . We must get used to it . "
34796	34807	34786	34786	He	93	" All right . Let 's get out to breakfast . "
35481	35493	35495	35495	he	773	" I 'm sorry to disturb you so early , comrade , "
35508	35522	35524	35524	he	773	" You have no doubt made all the arrangements for the Paris affair ? "
35530	35547	35524	35524	he	773	" We have information which renders intolerable anything in the nature of a moment 's delay . "
35572	35680	35562	35563	The Professor	773	" Please do not think me excessively abrupt ; but I advise you to alter those plans , or if it is too late for that , to follow your agent with all the support you can get for him . Comrade Syme and I have had an experience which it would take more time to recount than we can afford , if we are to act on it . I will , however , relate the occurrence in detail , even at the risk of losing time , if you really feel that it is essential to the understanding of the problem we have to discuss . "
35918	35923	35925	35926	the Professor	773	" As I say , "
35936	35981	35925	35926	the Professor	773	" the incident that has occurred to us and has led us to ask for information about the Marquis , is one which you may think it better to have narrated ; but as it came in the way of Comrade Syme rather than me "
36022	36035	36017	36017	He	116	" You must go on . This devil has sucked me dry ! "
36056	36066	36067	36067	he	116	" Yes , the thing really happened to me , "
36071	36147	36067	36067	he	116	" I had the good fortune to fall into conversation with a detective who took me , thanks to my hat , for a respectable person . Wishing to clinch my reputation for respectability , I took him and made him very drunk at the Savoy . Under this influence he became friendly , and told me in so many words that within a day or two they hope to arrest the Marquis in France . "
36148	36159	36192	36192	he	773	" So unless you or I can get on his track "
36201	36235	36192	36192	he	773	" Syme immediately brought this information to me , and we came here together to see what use you would be inclined to make of it . It seems to me unquestionably urgent that "
36303	36309	36296	36296	His	116	" I have an intuition . "
36324	36330	36310	36311	The Professor	773	" Then sit on it . "
36334	36340	36331	36331	Syme	116	" It is quite extraordinary . "
36345	36349	36341	36342	The other	300	" Extraordinary rot ! "
36353	36359	36350	36350	Syme	116	" I am a poet . "
36364	36371	36360	36361	The other	300	" You are a dead man . "
36420	36444	36414	36414	he	773	" You scarcely realise how poetic my intuition is . It has that sudden quality we sometimes feel in the coming of spring . "
36460	36465	36451	36452	his friend	477	" Go to hell ! "
36479	36486	36488	36488	Syme	116	" Perhaps I should rather say , "
36493	36514	36488	36488	Syme	116	" that it resembles that sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the heart of lush woods . "
36521	36526	36528	36528	Syme	116	" Or yet again , "
36530	36546	36528	36528	Syme	116	" it is positive , as is the passionate red hair of a beautiful woman . "
36581	36585	36565	36565	He	116	" Dr. Bull ! "
36613	36617	36619	36619	Syme	116	" Dr. Bull , "
36629	36650	36619	36619	Syme	116	" would you do me a small favour ? Would you be so kind as to take off your spectacles ? "
36910	36918	36920	36920	Syme	116	" I knew I was a poet , "
36927	36981	36920	36920	Syme	116	" I knew my intuition was as infallible as the Pope . It was the spectacles that did it ! It was all the spectacles . Given those beastly black eyes , and all the rest of him his health and his jolly looks , made him a live devil among dead ones . "
36982	36991	36993	36994	the Professor	773	" It certainly does make a queer difference , "
36997	37006	36993	36994	the Professor	773	" But as regards the project of Dr. Bull "
37007	37012	37014	37014	Syme	116	" Project be damned ! "
37019	37055	37014	37014	Syme	116	" Look at him ! Look at his face , look at his collar , look at his blessed boots ! You do n't suppose , do you , that that thing 's an anarchist ? "
37056	37059	37061	37062	the other	300	" Syme ! "
37068	37074	37076	37076	Syme	116	" Why , by God , "
37078	37102	37104	37104	he	116	" I 'll take the risk of that myself ! Dr. Bull , I am a police officer . There 's my card , "
37163	37175	37176	37176	he	116	" I 'm awfully glad you chaps have come so early , "
37186	37206	37176	37176	he	116	" for we can all start for France together . Yes , I 'm in the force right enough , "
37278	37284	37285	37285	he	116	" But Lord God Almighty , "
37289	37311	37285	37285	he	116	" if this is all right , there were more damned detectives than there were damned dynamiters at the damned Council ! "
37312	37319	37321	37321	Bull	135	" We might have fought easily , "
37323	37330	37321	37321	Bull	135	" we were four against three . "
37346	37349	37351	37352	the voice	1120	" No , "
37354	37373	37351	37352	the voice	1120	" we were not four against three we were not so lucky . We were four against One . "
37437	37446	37447	37447	he	1123	" It is jolly to get some pals , "
37450	37496	37447	37447	he	1123	" I 've been half dead with the jumps , being quite alone . I nearly flung my arms round Gogol and embraced him , which would have been imprudent . I hope you wo n't despise me for having been in a blue funk . "
37497	37506	37508	37508	Syme	116	" All the blue devils in blue hell , "
37510	37528	37508	37508	Syme	116	" contributed to my blue funk ! But the worst devil was you and your infernal goggles . "
37535	37542	37543	37543	he	1123	" Was n't it a rag ? "
37546	37918	37543	37543	he	1123	" Such a simple idea not my own . I have n't got the brains . You see , I wanted to go into the detective service , especially the anti - dynamite business . But for that purpose they wanted someone to dress up as a dynamiter ; and they all swore by blazes that I could never look like a dynamiter . They said my very walk was respectable , and that seen from behind I looked like the British Constitution . They said I looked too healthy and too optimistic , and too reliable and benevolent ; they called me all sorts of names at Scotland Yard . They said that if I had been a criminal , I might have made my fortune by looking so like an honest man ; but as I had the misfortune to be an honest man , there was not even the remotest chance of my assisting them by ever looking like a criminal . But at last I was brought before some old josser who was high up in the force , and who seemed to have no end of a head on his shoulders . And there the others all talked hopelessly . One asked whether a bushy beard would hide my nice smile ; another said that if they blacked my face I might look like a negro anarchist ; but this old chap chipped in with a most extraordinary remark . A pair of smoked spectacles will do it , ' he said positively . Look at him now ; he looks like an angelic office boy . Put him on a pair of smoked spectacles , and children will scream at the sight of him . ' And so it was , by George ! When once my eyes were covered , all the rest , smile and big shoulders and short hair , made me look a perfect little devil . As I say , it was simple enough when it was done , like miracles ; but that was n't the really miraculous part of it . There was one really staggering thing about the business , and my head still turns at it . "
37919	37924	37926	37926	Syme	116	" What was that ? "
37928	37934	37936	37939	the man in spectacles	1129	" I 'll tell you , "
37941	37976	37936	37939	the man in spectacles	1129	" This big pot in the police who sized me up so that he knew how the goggles would go with my hair and socks by God , he never saw me at all ! "
37985	37990	37991	37991	he	1129	" How was that ? "
37994	38002	37991	37991	he	1129	" I thought you talked to him . "
38003	38008	38010	38010	Bull	135	" So I did , "
38013	38036	38010	38010	Bull	135	" but we talked in a pitch - dark room like a coalcellar . There , you would never have guessed that . "
38037	38045	38047	38047	Syme	116	" I could not have conceived it , "
38050	38058	38060	38061	the Professor	773	" It is indeed a new idea , "
38131	38137	38138	38138	he	773	" I had already arranged , "
38141	38275	38138	38138	he	773	" to go to France for my lunch ; but I am delighted to have someone to lunch with me . You see , I had to send that beast , the Marquis , over with his bomb , because the President had his eye on me , though God knows how . I 'll tell you the story some day . It was perfectly choking . Whenever I tried to slip out of it I saw the President somewhere , smiling out of the bow - window of a club , or taking off his hat to me from the top of an omnibus . I tell you , you can say what you like , that fellow sold himself to the devil ; he can be in six places at once . "
38276	38287	38289	38290	the Professor	773	" So you sent the Marquis off , I understand , "
38292	38307	38289	38290	the Professor	773	" Was it long ago ? Shall we be in time to catch him ? "
38308	38311	38313	38315	the new guide	1140	" Yes , "
38317	38334	38313	38315	the new guide	1140	" I 've timed it all . He 'll still be at Calais when we arrive . "
38335	38345	38347	38348	the Professor	773	" But when we do catch him at Calais , "
38350	38358	38347	38348	the Professor	773	" what are we going to do ? "
38381	38394	38313	38315	the new guide	1140	" Theoretically , I suppose , we ought to call the police . "
38395	38399	38401	38401	Syme	116	" Not I , "
38403	38466	38401	38401	Syme	116	" Theoretically I ought to drown myself first . I promised a poor fellow , who was a real modern pessimist , on my word of honour not to tell the police . I 'm no hand at casuistry , but I ca n't break my word to a modern pessimist . It 's like breaking one 's word to a child . "
38467	38475	38477	38478	the Professor	773	" I 'm in the same boat , "
38480	38545	38477	38478	the Professor	773	" I tried to tell the police and I could n't , because of some silly oath I took . You see , when I was an actor I was a sort of all - round beast . Perjury or treason is the only crime I have n't committed . If I did that I should n't know the difference between right and wrong . "
38546	38554	38556	38557	Dr. Bull	135	" I 've been through all that , "
38559	38678	38556	38557	Dr. Bull	135	" and I 've made up my mind . I gave my promise to the Secretary you know him , man who smiles upside down . My friends , that man is the most utterly unhappy man that was ever human . It may be his digestion , or his conscience , or his nerves , or his philosophy of the universe , but he 's damned , he 's in hell ! Well , I ca n't turn on a man like that , and hunt him down . It 's like whipping a leper . I may be mad , but that 's how I feel ; and there 's jolly well the end of it . "
38679	38688	38690	38690	Syme	116	" I do n't think you 're mad , "
38692	38703	38690	38690	Syme	116	" I knew you would decide like that when first you "
38704	38707	38709	38710	Dr. Bull	135	" Eh ? "
38712	38721	38556	38557	Dr. Bull	135	" When first you took off your spectacles . "
38761	38764	38766	38766	Syme	116	" Well , "
38768	38795	38766	38766	Syme	116	" it seems that we have all the same kind of morality or immorality , so we had better face the fact that comes of it . "
38796	38799	38801	38802	the Professor	773	" Yes , "
38804	38828	38801	38802	the Professor	773	" you 're quite right ; and we must hurry up , for I can see the Grey Nose standing out from France . "
38829	38837	38839	38839	Syme	116	" The fact that comes of it , "
38842	38918	38839	38839	Syme	116	" is this , that we three are alone on this planet . Gogol has gone , God knows where ; perhaps the President has smashed him like a fly . On the Council we are three men against three , like the Romans who held the bridge . But we are worse off than that , first because they can appeal to their organization and we can not appeal to ours , and second because "
38919	38928	38930	38931	the Professor	773	" Because one of those other three men , "
38933	38939	38930	38931	the Professor	773	" is not a man . "
38954	39166	38952	38952	he	116	" My idea is this . We must do something to keep the Marquis in Calais till tomorrow midday . I have turned over twenty schemes in my head . We can not denounce him as a dynamiter ; that is agreed . We can not get him detained on some trivial charge , for we should have to appear ; he knows us , and he would smell a rat . We can not pretend to keep him on anarchist business ; he might swallow much in that way , but not the notion of stopping in Calais while the Czar went safely through Paris . We might try to kidnap him , and lock him up ourselves ; but he is a well - known man here . He has a whole bodyguard of friends ; he is very strong and brave , and the event is doubtful . The only thing I can see to do is actually to take advantage of the very things that are in the Marquis 's favour . I am going to profit by the fact that he is a highly respected nobleman . I am going to profit by the fact that he has many friends and moves in the best society . "
39167	39176	39178	39179	the Professor	773	" What the devil are you talking about ? "
39181	39192	39194	39194	Syme	116	" The Symes are first mentioned in the fourteenth century , "
39196	39220	39194	39194	Syme	116	" but there is a tradition that one of them rode behind Bruce at Bannockburn . Since 1350 the tree is quite clear . "
39221	39229	39231	39233	the little Doctor	2791	" He 's gone off his head , "
39237	39241	39243	39243	Syme	116	" Our bearings , "
39246	39266	39243	39243	Syme	116	" are argent a chevron gules charged with three cross crosslets of the field . ' The motto varies . "
39276	39282	39283	39283	he	773	" We are just inshore , "
39286	39297	39283	39283	he	773	" Are you seasick or joking in the wrong place ? "
39298	39306	39308	39308	Syme	116	" My remarks are almost painfully practical , "
39315	39383	39308	39308	Syme	116	" The house of St. Eustache also is very ancient . The Marquis can not deny that he is a gentleman . He can not deny that I am a gentleman . And in order to put the matter of my social position quite beyond a doubt , I propose at the earliest opportunity to knock his hat off . But here we are in the harbour . "
39677	39751	39641	39643	the deadly Marquis	1158	" I shall approach . Before taking off his hat , I shall take off my own . I shall say , The Marquis de Saint Eustache , I believe . ' He will say , The celebrated Mr. Syme , I presume . ' He will say in the most exquisite French , How are you ? ' I shall reply in the most exquisite Cockney , Oh , just the Syme ' "
39752	39758	39760	39763	the man in spectacles	1129	" Oh , shut it , "
39765	39786	39760	39763	the man in spectacles	1129	" Pull yourself together , and chuck away that bit of paper . What are you really going to do ? "
39787	39795	39797	39797	Syme	93	" But it was a lovely catechism , "
39800	39838	39797	39797	Syme	93	" Do let me read it you . It has only forty - three questions and answers , and some of the Marquis 's answers are wonderfully witty . I like to be just to my enemy . "
39839	39849	39851	39852	Dr. Bull	135	" But what 's the good of it all ? "
39856	39869	39871	39871	Syme	93	" It leads up to my challenge , do n't you see , "
39875	39889	39871	39871	Syme	93	" When the Marquis has given the thirty - ninth reply , which runs "
39890	39900	39902	39903	the Professor	773	" Has it by any chance occurred to you , "
39910	39946	39902	39903	the Professor	773	" that the Marquis may not say all the forty - three things you have put down for him ? In that case , I understand , your own epigrams may appear somewhat more forced . "
39956	39964	39965	39965	he	93	" Why , how true that is , "
39968	39992	39965	39965	he	93	" and I never thought of it . Sir , you have an intellect beyond the common . You will make a name . "
39993	40004	40006	40007	the Doctor	1073	" Oh , you 're as drunk as an owl ! "
40009	40014	40016	40016	Syme	93	" It only remains , "
40020	40114	40116	40116	he	93	" to adopt some other method of breaking the ice ( if I may so express it ) between myself and the man I wish to kill . And since the course of a dialogue can not be predicted by one of its parties alone ( as you have pointed out with such recondite acumen ) , the only thing to be done , I suppose , is for the one party , as far as possible , to do all the dialogue by himself . And so I will , by George ! "
40382	40391	40393	40394	the Professor	773	" Are you going to address the meeting ? "
40415	40419	40420	40420	he	712	" I am , "
40432	40457	40420	40420	he	712	" that meeting . That meeting displeases me . I am going to pull that meeting 's great ugly , mahogany - coloured nose . "
40486	40495	40496	40496	he	712	" You are Mr. Syme , I think , "
40502	40512	40513	40513	he	712	" And you are the Marquis de Saint Eustache , "
40517	40525	40513	40513	he	712	" Permit me to pull your nose . "
40557	40564	40566	40566	Syme	93	" This man has insulted me ! "
40573	40577	40579	40584	the gentleman with the red rosette	1188	" Insulted you ? "
40586	40589	40579	40584	the gentleman with the red rosette	1188	" when ? "
40590	40596	40598	40598	Syme	93	" Oh , just now , "
40601	40607	40598	40598	Syme	93	" He insulted my mother . "
40608	40613	40615	40616	the gentleman	1189	" Insulted your mother ! "
40619	40624	40626	40626	Syme	93	" Well , anyhow , "
40632	40636	40626	40626	Syme	93	" my aunt . "
40637	40650	40652	40654	the second gentleman	1190	" But how can the Marquis have insulted your aunt just now ? "
40660	40670	40652	40654	the second gentleman	1190	" He has been sitting here all the time . "
40671	40680	40682	40682	Syme	93	" Ah , it was what he said ! "
40685	40692	40694	40695	the Marquis	712	" I said nothing at all , "
40697	40714	40694	40695	the Marquis	712	" except something about the band . I only said that I liked Wagner played well . "
40715	40724	40726	40726	Syme	93	" It was an allusion to my family , "
40729	40750	40726	40726	Syme	93	" My aunt played Wagner badly . It was a painful subject . We are always being insulted about it . "
40751	40757	40759	40766	the gentleman who was _ d cor _	1192	" This seems most extraordinary , "
40774	40781	40783	40783	Syme	93	" Oh , I assure you , "
40786	40804	40783	40783	Syme	93	" the whole of your conversation was simply packed with sinister allusions to my aunt 's weaknesses . "
40805	40810	40812	40814	the second gentleman	1190	" This is nonsense ! "
40816	40840	40812	40814	the second gentleman	1190	" I for one have said nothing for half an hour except that I liked the singing of that girl with black hair . "
40841	40849	40851	40851	Syme	93	" Well , there you are again ! "
40854	40861	40851	40851	Syme	93	" My aunt 's was red . "
40862	40868	40870	40871	the other	300	" It seems to me , "
40873	40886	40870	40871	the other	300	" that you are simply seeking a pretext to insult the Marquis . "
40887	40891	40893	40893	Syme	93	" By George ! "
40902	40910	40893	40893	Syme	93	" what a clever chap you are ! "
40923	40930	40931	40931	he	712	" Seeking a quarrel with me ! "
40934	40977	40931	40931	he	712	" Seeking a fight with me ! By God ! there was never a man who had to seek long . These gentlemen will perhaps act for me . There are still four hours of daylight . Let us fight this evening . "
40986	40989	40990	40990	he	93	" Marquis , "
40993	41022	40990	40990	he	93	" your action is worthy of your fame and blood . Permit me to consult for a moment with the gentlemen in whose hands I shall place myself . "
41087	41093	41094	41094	he	712	" I have done it , "
41098	41299	41308	41308	he	1201	" I have fixed a fight on the beast . But look here , and listen carefully . There is no time for talk . You are my seconds , and everything must come from you . Now you must insist , and insist absolutely , on the duel coming off after seven tomorrow , so as to give me the chance of preventing him from catching the 7.45 for Paris . If he misses that he misses his crime . He ca n't refuse to meet you on such a small point of time and place . But this is what he will do . He will choose a field somewhere near a wayside station , where he can pick up the train . He is a very good swordsman , and he will trust to killing me in time to catch it . But I can fence well too , and I think I can keep him in play , at any rate , until the train is lost . Then perhaps he may kill me to console his feelings . You understand ? Very well then , let me introduce you to some charming friends of mine , "
41908	41926	41928	41929	the Professor	773	" To a man of the well - known skill and valour of Monsieur de St. Eustache , "
41932	41979	41928	41929	the Professor	773	" it must be a matter of indifference which method is adopted , and our principal has strong reasons for demanding the longer encounter , reasons the delicacy of which prevent me from being explicit , but for the just and honourable nature of which I can "
41980	41985	41988	41989	the Marquis	712	" _ Peste ! _ "
41998	42006	41988	41989	the Marquis	712	" let us stop talking and begin , "
42199	42202	42194	42195	The Colonel	1237	" Engage ! "
43350	43354	43355	43355	he	93	" After all , "
43360	43389	43355	43355	he	93	" I am more than a devil ; I am a man . I can do the one thing which Satan himself can not do I can die , "
43558	43561	43563	43564	the Marquis	712	" Stop ! "
43574	43581	43563	43564	the Marquis	712	" I want to say something . "
43582	43588	43590	43591	Colonel Ducroix	155	" What is the matter ? "
43595	43602	43590	43591	Colonel Ducroix	155	" Has there been foul play ? "
43603	43611	43613	43614	Dr. Bull	135	" There has been foul play somewhere , "
43622	43641	43613	43614	Dr. Bull	135	" Our principal has wounded the Marquis four times at least , and he is none the worse . "
43656	43662	43663	43663	he	712	" Please let me speak , "
43666	43675	43676	43676	he	712	" It is rather important . Mr. Syme , "
43684	43732	43676	43676	he	712	" we are fighting today , if I remember right , because you expressed a wish ( which I thought irrational ) to pull my nose . Would you oblige me by pulling my nose now as quickly as possible ? I have to catch a train . "
43733	43742	43744	43745	Dr. Bull	135	" I protest that this is most irregular , "
43748	43757	43759	43760	Colonel Ducroix	155	" It is certainly somewhat opposed to precedent , "
43768	43819	43759	43760	Colonel Ducroix	155	" There is , I think , one case on record ( Captain Bellegarde and the Baron Zumpt ) in which the weapons were changed in the middle of the encounter at the request of one of the combatants . But one can hardly call one 's nose a weapon . "
43820	43831	43833	43834	the Marquis	712	" Will you or will you not pull my nose ? "
43838	43885	43887	43887	he	712	" Come , come , Mr. Syme ! You wanted to do it , do it ! You can have no conception of how important it is to me . Do n't be so selfish ! Pull my nose at once , when I ask you ! "
44032	44043	44044	44044	he	712	" If anyone has any use for my left eyebrow , "
44047	44076	44044	44044	he	712	" he can have it . Colonel Ducroix , do accept my left eyebrow ! It 's the kind of thing that might come in useful any day , "
44114	44120	44121	44121	he	712	" If I had known , "
44124	44137	44121	44121	he	712	" that I was acting for a poltroon who pads himself to fight "
44138	44147	44149	44150	the Marquis	712	" Oh , I know , I know ! "
44165	44192	44149	44150	the Marquis	712	" You are making a mistake ; but it ca n't be explained just now . I tell you the train has come into the station ! "
44193	44196	44198	44199	Dr. Bull	135	" Yes , "
44202	44229	44198	44199	Dr. Bull	135	" and the train shall go out of the station . It shall go out without you . We know well enough for what devil 's work "
44269	44276	44277	44277	he	1311	" Will you drive me mad ? "
44280	44283	44277	44277	he	1311	" The train "
44284	44293	44295	44295	Syme	93	" You shall not go by the train , "
44323	44347	44348	44348	he	1311	" You great fat , blasted , blear - eyed , blundering , thundering , brainless , Godforsaken , doddering , damned fool ! "
44354	44367	44348	44348	he	1311	" You great silly , pink - faced , towheaded turnip ! You "
44368	44377	44379	44379	Syme	93	" You shall not go by this train , "
44381	44388	44390	44391	the other	300	" And why the infernal blazes , "
44393	44403	44390	44391	the other	300	" should I want to go by the train ? "
44404	44409	44411	44412	the Professor	773	" We know all , "
44415	44426	44411	44412	the Professor	773	" You are going to Paris to throw a bomb ! "
44427	44436	44438	44439	the other	300	" Going to Jericho to throw a Jabberwock ! "
44450	44493	44390	44391	the other	300	" Have you all got softening of the brain , that you do n't realise what I am ? Did you really think I wanted to catch that train ? Twenty Paris trains might go by for me . Damn Paris trains ! "
44494	44502	44504	44505	the Professor	773	" Then what did you care about ? "
44507	44543	44390	44391	the other	300	" What did I care about ? I did n't care about catching the train ; I cared about whether the train caught me , and now , by God ! it has caught me . "
44544	44551	44553	44553	Syme	93	" I regret to inform you , "
44557	44635	44553	44553	Syme	93	" that your remarks convey no impression to my mind . Perhaps if you were to remove the remains of your original forehead and some portion of what was once your chin , your meaning would become clearer . Mental lucidity fulfils itself in many ways . What do you mean by saying that the train has caught you ? It may be my literary fancy , but somehow I feel that it ought to mean something . "
44636	44641	44643	44644	the other	300	" It means everything , "
44646	44664	44643	44644	the other	300	" and the end of everything . Sunday has us now in the hollow of his hand . "
44665	44668	44670	44671	the Professor	773	" Us ! "
44677	44686	44670	44671	the Professor	773	" What do you mean by us ' ? "
44687	44694	44696	44697	the Marquis	712	" The police , of course ! "
44739	44745	44746	44746	he	712	" I am Inspector Ratcliffe , "
44759	44797	44799	44799	he	712	" My name is pretty well known to the police , and I can see well enough that you belong to them . But if there is any doubt about my position , I have a card , "
44817	44826	44827	44827	he	712	" Oh , do n't show it us , "
44831	44845	44827	44827	he	712	" we 've got enough of them to equip a paper - chase . "
44910	44913	44914	44914	he	712	" Gentlemen , "
44917	45080	44914	44914	he	712	" we all owe you a serious apology ; but I assure you that you have not been made the victims of such a low joke as you imagine , or indeed of anything undignified in a man of honour . You have not wasted your time ; you have helped to save the world . We are not buffoons , but very desperate men at war with a vast conspiracy . A secret society of anarchists is hunting us like hares ; not such unfortunate madmen as may here or there throw a bomb through starvation or German philosophy , but a rich and powerful and fanatical church , a church of eastern pessimism , which holds it holy to destroy mankind like vermin . How hard they hunt us you can gather from the fact that we are driven to such disguises as those for which I apologise , and to such pranks as this one by which you suffer . "
45101	45206	45088	45094	a short man with a black moustache	1326	" Of course , I accept the apology ; but you will in your turn forgive me if I decline to follow you further into your difficulties , and permit myself to say good morning ! The sight of an acquaintance and distinguished fellow - townsman coming to pieces in the open air is unusual , and , upon the whole , sufficient for one day . Colonel Ducroix , I would in no way influence your actions , but if you feel with me that our present society is a little abnormal , I am now going to walk back to the town . "
45223	45275	45207	45208	Colonel Ducroix	155	" No , by George ! I wo n't . If these gentlemen are really in a mess with a lot of low wreckers like that , I 'll see them through it . I have fought for France , and it is hard if I ca n't fight for civilization . "
45293	45301	45303	45304	Inspector Ratcliffe	160	" Do n't make too much noise , "
45306	45312	45303	45304	Inspector Ratcliffe	160	" Sunday may hear you . "
45313	45316	45318	45318	Bull	135	" Sunday ! "
45325	45328	45330	45330	Ratcliffe	160	" Yes , "
45332	45339	45330	45330	Ratcliffe	160	" he may be with them . "
45340	45344	45346	45346	Syme	93	" With whom ? "
45348	45357	45359	45360	the other	300	" With the people out of that train , "
45362	45370	45372	45372	Syme	93	" What you say seems utterly wild , "
45374	45387	45388	45388	he	93	" Why , as a matter of fact But , my God , "
45405	45446	45388	45388	he	93	" by God ! if this is true the whole bally lot of us on the Anarchist Council were against anarchy ! Every born man was a detective except the President and his personal secretary . What can it mean ? "
45447	45450	45452	45454	the new policeman	1329	" Mean ! "
45459	45559	45561	45561	he	1329	" It means that we are struck dead ! Do n't you know Sunday ? Do n't you know that his jokes are always so big and simple that one has never thought of them ? Can you think of anything more like Sunday than this , that he should put all his powerful enemies on the Supreme Council , and then take care that it was not supreme ? I tell you he has bought every trust , he has captured every cable , he has control of every railway line especially of _ that _ railway line ! "
45572	45696	45561	45561	he	1329	" The whole movement was controlled by him ; half the world was ready to rise for him . But there were just five people , perhaps , who would have resisted him ... and the old devil put them on the Supreme Council , to waste their time in watching each other . Idiots that we are , he planned the whole of our idiocies ! Sunday knew that the Professor would chase Syme through London , and that Syme would fight me in France . And he was combining great masses of capital , and seizing great lines of telegraphy , while we five idiots were running after each other like a lot of confounded babies playing blind man 's buff . "
45697	45700	45702	45702	Syme	93	" Well ? "
45709	45712	45714	45715	the other	300	" Well , "
45720	45805	45714	45715	the other	300	" he has found us playing blind man 's buff today in a field of great rustic beauty and extreme solitude . He has probably captured the world ; it only remains to him to capture this field and all the fools in it . And since you really want to know what was my objection to the arrival of that train , I will tell you . My objection was that Sunday or his Secretary has just this moment got out of it . "
45855	45868	45870	45872	the new policeman	1329	" It was a habit of the late Marquis de St. Eustache , "
45879	45949	45870	45872	the new policeman	1329	" always to carry a pair of opera glasses . Either the President or the Secretary is coming after us with that mob . They have caught us in a nice quiet place where we are under no temptations to break our oaths by calling the police . Dr. Bull , I have a suspicion that you will see better through these than through your own highly decorative spectacles . "
45974	45985	45987	45988	the Professor	773	" It can not be as bad as you say , "
45993	46011	45987	45988	the Professor	773	" There are a good number of them certainly , but they may easily be ordinary tourists . "
46012	46017	46019	46019	Bull	135	" Do ordinary tourists , "
46028	46039	46019	46019	Bull	135	" wear black masks half - way down the face ? "
46167	46177	46178	46178	he	93	" The President is not with them , anyhow , "
46186	46197	46199	46201	the bewildered Colonel	1344	" But surely they are right away on the horizon , "
46216	46228	46199	46201	the bewildered Colonel	1344	" Could you possibly know your President among all those people ? "
46229	46241	46243	46243	Syme	161	" Could I know a white elephant among all those people ! "
46247	46278	46243	46243	Syme	161	" As you very truly say , they are on the horizon ; but if he were walking with them ... by God ! I believe this ground would shake . "
46293	46333	46288	46288	Ratcliffe	160	" Of course the President is n't with them . I wish to Gemini he were . Much more likely the President is riding in triumph through Paris , or sitting on the ruins of St. Paul 's Cathedral . "
46334	46339	46341	46341	Syme	161	" This is absurd ! "
46343	46371	46372	46372	he	1345	" Something may have happened in our absence ; but he can not have carried the world with a rush like that . It is quite true , "
46388	46416	46372	46372	he	1345	" it is certainly true that there seems to be a crowd coming this way ; but they are not all the army that you make out . "
46417	46422	46424	46426	the new detective	1348	" Oh , they , "
46429	46505	46507	46507	he	1348	" no they are not a very valuable force . But let me tell you frankly that they are precisely calculated to our value we are not much , my boy , in Sunday 's universe . He has got hold of all the cables and telegraphs himself . But to kill the Supreme Council he regards as a trivial matter , like a post card ; it may be left to his private secretary , "
46523	46555	46514	46514	he	1348	" There is a great deal to be said for death ; but if anyone has any preference for the other alternative , I strongly advise him to walk after me . "
47184	47189	47190	47190	he	93	" May I ask , "
47193	47203	47190	47190	he	93	" where on earth we are all going to ? "
47231	47245	47246	47246	he	93	" We must get down through the town of Lancy to the sea , "
47249	47265	47246	47246	he	93	" I think that part of the country is least likely to be with them . "
47266	47275	47277	47277	Syme	93	" What can you mean by all this ? "
47279	47316	47277	47277	Syme	93	" They ca n't be running the real world in that way . Surely not many working men are anarchists , and surely if they were , mere mobs could not beat modern armies and police . "
47317	47321	47323	47325	his new friend	1387	" Mere mobs ! "
47332	47462	47323	47325	his new friend	1387	" So you talk about mobs and the working classes as if they were the question . You 've got that eternal idiotic idea that if anarchy came it would come from the poor . Why should it ? The poor have been rebels , but they have never been anarchists ; they have more interest than anyone else in there being some decent government . The poor man really has a stake in the country . The rich man has n't ; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht . The poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly ; the rich have always objected to being governed at all . Aristocrats were always anarchists , as you can see from the barons ' wars . "
47463	47475	47477	47477	Syme	93	" As a lecture on English history for the little ones , "
47479	47495	47477	47477	Syme	93	" this is all very nice ; but I have not yet grasped its application . "
47496	47501	47503	47504	his informant	1388	" Its application is , "
47506	47559	47503	47504	his informant	1388	" that most of old Sunday 's right - hand men are South African and American millionaires . That is why he has got hold of all the communications ; and that is why the last four champions of the anti - anarchist police force are running through a wood like rabbits . "
47560	47566	47568	47568	Syme	93	" Millionaires I can understand , "
47571	47632	47568	47568	Syme	93	" they are nearly all mad . But getting hold of a few wicked old gentlemen with hobbies is one thing ; getting hold of great Christian nations is another . I would bet the nose off my face ( forgive the allusion ) that Sunday would stand perfectly helpless before the task of converting any ordinary healthy person anywhere . "
47633	47636	47638	47639	the other	300	" Well , "
47641	47652	47638	47639	the other	300	" it rather depends what sort of person you mean . "
47653	47659	47661	47661	Syme	93	" Well , for instance , "
47663	47671	47673	47673	he	93	" he could never convert that person , "
47852	47858	47861	47861	Ratcliffe	160	" Mr. Syme is saying , "
47867	47881	47861	47861	Ratcliffe	160	" that this man , at least , will never be an anarchist . "
47882	47890	47892	47893	Colonel Ducroix	155	" Mr. Syme is right enough there , "
47897	47928	47892	47893	Colonel Ducroix	155	" if only for the reason that he has plenty of property to defend . But I forgot that in your country you are not used to peasants being wealthy . "
47929	47934	47936	47937	Dr. Bull	135	" He looks poor , "
47940	47944	47946	47947	the Colonel	1237	" Quite so , "
47949	47957	47946	47947	the Colonel	1237	" that is why he is rich . "
47958	47964	47967	47968	Dr. Bull	135	" I have an idea , "
47971	48001	47967	47968	Dr. Bull	135	" how much would he take to give us a lift in his cart ? Those dogs are all on foot , and we could soon leave them behind . "
48002	48009	48011	48011	Syme	93	" Oh , give him anything ! "
48014	48023	48011	48011	Syme	93	" I have piles of money on me . "
48024	48030	48032	48033	the Colonel	1237	" That will never do , "
48035	48050	48032	48033	the Colonel	1237	" he will never have any respect for you unless you drive a bargain . "
48051	48058	48060	48060	Bull	135	" Oh , if he haggles ! "
48063	48073	48075	48076	the other	300	" He haggles because he is a free man , "
48078	48099	48075	48076	the other	300	" You do not understand ; he would not see the meaning of generosity . He is not being tipped . "
48557	48560	48562	48563	the policeman	451	" Yes , "
48565	48637	48562	48563	the policeman	451	" that 's discipline . That 's Sunday . He is perhaps five hundred miles off , but the fear of him is on all of them , like the finger of God . Yes , they are walking regularly ; and you bet your boots that they are talking regularly , yes , and thinking regularly . But the one important thing for us is that they are disappearing regularly . "
48837	48842	48843	48844	The peasant	1439	" Le Soleil d'Or . "
49049	49057	49058	49058	he	93	" May I ask you , Colonel , "
49065	49072	49058	49058	he	93	" why we have come here ? "
49082	49089	49090	49090	he	155	" For two reasons , sir , "
49093	49129	49090	49090	he	155	" and I will give first , not the most important , but the most utilitarian . We came here because this is the only place within twenty miles in which we can get horses . "
49130	49133	49135	49135	Syme	93	" Horses ! "
49141	49144	49146	49147	the other	300	" Yes , "
49149	49181	49146	49147	the other	300	" if you people are really to distance your enemies it is horses or nothing for you , unless of course you have bicycles and motor - cars in your pocket . "
49182	49193	49195	49195	Syme	93	" And where do you advise us to make for ? "
49198	49202	49204	49205	the Colonel	1237	" Beyond question , "
49207	49266	49204	49205	the Colonel	1237	" you had better make all haste to the police station beyond the town . My friend , whom I seconded under somewhat deceptive circumstances , seems to me to exaggerate very much the possibilities of a general rising ; but even he would hardly maintain , I suppose , that you were not safe with the gendarmes . "
49275	49284	49272	49272	he	93	" And your other reason for coming here ? "
49285	49293	49295	49295	Ducroix	155	" My other reason for coming here , "
49298	49321	49295	49295	Ducroix	155	" is that it is just as well to see a good man or two when one is possibly near to death . "
49343	49348	49341	49341	he	93	" You are right , "
49355	49363	49341	49341	he	93	" Has anyone seen about the horses ? "
49364	49367	49369	49369	Ducroix	155	" Yes , "
49371	49432	49369	49369	Ducroix	155	" you may be quite certain that I gave orders the moment I came in . Those enemies of yours gave no impression of hurry , but they were really moving wonderfully fast , like a well - trained army . I had no idea that the anarchists had so much discipline . You have not a moment to waste . "
49834	49846	49847	49847	he	1237	" Four out of the five rich men in this town , "
49850	49900	49847	49847	he	1237	" are common swindlers . I suppose the proportion is pretty equal all over the world . The fifth is a friend of mine , and a very fine fellow ; and what is even more important from our point of view , he owns a motor - car . "
49901	49906	49908	49909	the Professor	773	" I am afraid , "
49934	49946	49908	49909	the Professor	773	" I am afraid we have hardly time for afternoon calls . "
49947	49958	49960	49961	the Colonel	1237	" Doctor Renard 's house is only three minutes off , "
49963	49967	49969	49970	Dr. Bull	135	" Our danger , "
49972	49979	49969	49970	Dr. Bull	135	" is not two minutes off . "
49980	49983	49985	49985	Syme	93	" Yes , "
49987	50005	49985	49985	Syme	93	" if we ride on fast we must leave them behind , for they are on foot . "
50006	50014	50016	50017	the Colonel	1237	" He has a motor - car , "
50019	50027	50029	50029	Bull	135	" But we may not get it , "
50031	50041	49985	49985	Syme	93	" Yes , he is quite on your side . "
50042	50049	49985	49985	Syme	93	" But he might be out . "
50050	50055	50057	50057	Syme	93	" Hold your tongue , "
50060	50066	50057	50057	Syme	93	" What is that noise ? "
50146	50152	50153	50153	he	1237	" They have done us , "
50161	50167	50153	50153	he	1237	" Prepare to receive cavalry ! "
50168	50177	50179	50179	Syme	93	" Where can they have got the horses ? "
50206	50235	50200	50200	he	1237	" I was speaking with strict accuracy when I said that the ' Soleil d'Or ' was the only place where one can get horses within twenty miles . "
50236	50239	50241	50241	Syme	93	" No ! "
50244	50261	50241	50241	Syme	93	" I do n't believe he 'd do it . Not with all that white hair . "
50262	50269	50271	50272	the Colonel	1237	" He may have been forced , "
50275	50305	50271	50272	the Colonel	1237	" They must be at least a hundred strong , for which reason we are all going to see my friend Renard , who has a motor - car . "
50498	50501	50502	50502	he	163	" Anarchy , "
50509	50514	50502	50502	he	163	" it is childishness ! "
50515	50521	50524	50525	the Colonel	1237	" _ Et a _ , "
50535	50545	50524	50525	the Colonel	1237	" and that is childishness , is n't it ? "
50725	50736	50738	50739	the Colonel	1237	" I am sorry to cut short a cultured discussion , "
50741	50757	50738	50739	the Colonel	1237	" but can you lend me your motor - car now , in two minutes ? "
50758	50769	50771	50772	Dr. Renard	163	" I have a suspicion that you are all mad , "
50777	50798	50771	50772	Dr. Renard	163	" but God forbid that madness should in any way interrupt friendship . Let us go round to the garage . "
50963	50970	50972	50973	Dr. Bull	135	" It is now or never , "
50975	50980	50972	50973	Dr. Bull	135	" I hear horses . "
50981	50984	50986	50987	the Professor	773	" No , "
50989	50993	50986	50987	the Professor	773	" a horse . "
51104	51113	51091	51091	He	93	" I am afraid it 's no go . "
51312	51324	51326	51327	the Professor	773	" I ca n't understand why it has grown so dark , "
51335	51345	51347	51348	Dr. Bull	135	" Going to be a storm , I think , "
51350	51374	51347	51348	Dr. Bull	135	" I say , it 's a pity we have n't got a light on this car , if only to see by . "
51375	51379	51381	51382	the Colonel	1237	" We have , "
51449	51458	51460	51461	the Professor	773	" Where on earth did you get that ? "
51463	51473	51475	51476	the Colonel	1237	" I got it where I got the car , "
51480	51641	51475	51476	the Colonel	1237	" from my best friend . While our friend here was fighting with the steering wheel , I ran up the front steps of the house and spoke to Renard , who was standing in his own porch , you will remember . ' I suppose , ' I said , ' there 's no time to get a lamp . ' He looked up , blinking amiably at the beautiful arched ceiling of his own front hall . From this was suspended , by chains of exquisite ironwork , this lantern , one of the hundred treasures of his treasure house . By sheer force he tore the lamp out of his own ceiling , shattering the painted panels , and bringing down two blue vases with his violence . Then he handed me the iron lantern , and I put it in the car . Was I not right when I said that Dr. Renard was worth knowing ? "
51642	51646	51648	51648	Syme	93	" You were , "
51769	51778	51782	51782	his	160	" These lights make one feel more cheerful . "
51786	51800	51801	51801	he	160	" There is only one set of lights that make me more cheerful , "
51804	51832	51801	51801	he	160	" and they are those lights of the police station which I can see beyond the town . Please God we may be there in ten minutes . "
51848	51857	51858	51858	he	160	" Oh , this is all raving nonsense ! "
51861	51900	51858	51858	he	160	" If you really think that ordinary people in ordinary houses are anarchists , you must be madder than an anarchist yourself . If we turned and fought these fellows , the whole town would fight for us . "
51901	51904	51906	51907	the other	300	" No , "
51913	51926	51906	51907	the other	300	" the whole town would fight for them . We shall see . "
51940	51946	51947	51947	he	773	" What is that noise ? "
51950	51961	51963	51964	the Colonel	1237	" Oh , the horses behind us , I suppose , "
51966	51976	51963	51964	the Colonel	1237	" I thought we had got clear of them . "
51977	51985	51987	51988	the Professor	773	" The horses behind us ! No , "
51990	52003	51987	51988	the Professor	773	" it is not horses , and it is not behind us . "
52070	52078	52079	52079	he	773	" I tell you they were his , "
52086	52096	52079	52079	he	773	" and they were full of men in masks ! "
52097	52100	52102	52103	the Colonel	1237	" Absurd ! "
52106	52116	52102	52103	the Colonel	1237	" Dr. Renard would never give them his cars . "
52117	52124	52126	52126	Ratcliffe	160	" He may have been forced , "
52129	52138	52126	52126	Ratcliffe	160	" The whole town is on their side . "
52139	52145	52147	52148	the Colonel	1237	" You still believe that , "
52151	52159	52161	52162	the other	300	" You will all believe it soon , "
52185	52207	52180	52181	the Colonel	1237	" No , I ca n't believe it . The thing is nonsense . The plain people of a peaceable French town "
52255	52259	52261	52262	the Colonel	1237	" My God ! "
52264	52271	52261	52262	the Colonel	1237	" someone has shot at us . "
52272	52279	52281	52283	the gloomy Ratcliffe	160	" It need not interrupt conversation , "
52285	52310	52281	52283	the gloomy Ratcliffe	160	" Pray resume your remarks , Colonel . You were talking , I think , about the plain people of a peaceable French town . "
52329	52334	52335	52335	he	1237	" It is extraordinary , "
52338	52342	52335	52335	he	1237	" most extraordinary . "
52343	52348	52350	52350	Syme	93	" A fastidious person , "
52352	52382	52350	52350	Syme	93	" might even call it unpleasant . However , I suppose those lights out in the field beyond this street are the Gendarmerie . We shall soon get there . "
52383	52386	52388	52389	Inspector Ratcliffe	160	" No , "
52391	52398	52388	52389	Inspector Ratcliffe	160	" we shall never get there . "
52425	52431	52433	52433	Bull	135	" What do you mean ? "
52436	52446	52448	52449	the pessimist	1606	" I mean that we shall never get there , "
52452	52497	52448	52449	the pessimist	1606	" They have two rows of armed men across the road already ; I can see them from here . The town is in arms , as I said it was . I can only wallow in the exquisite comfort of my own exactitude . "
52676	52700	52658	52658	Syme	93	" It is quite true . There is a crowd or an army or some such thing across the end of that street . "
52701	52708	52710	52710	Bull	135	" Well , if there is , "
52713	52769	52710	52710	Bull	135	" it must be something else a sham fight or the mayor 's birthday or something . I can not and will not believe that plain , jolly people in a place like this walk about with dynamite in their pockets . Get on a bit , Syme , and let us look at them . "
52796	52803	52804	52804	he	135	" Why , you silly mugs ! "
52807	52837	52804	52804	he	135	" what did I tell you . That crowd 's as law - abiding as a cow , and if it were n't , it 's on our side . "
52838	52844	52846	52847	the professor	773	" How do you know ? "
52851	52856	52858	52858	Bull	135	" You blind bat , "
52860	52870	52858	52858	Bull	135	" do n't you see who is leading them ? "
52889	52896	52884	52884	his	1237	" Why , it 's Renard ! "
52963	52971	52973	52974	the Colonel	1237	" What a fool I 've been ! "
52976	52991	52973	52974	the Colonel	1237	" Of course , the dear old boy has turned out to help us . "
53027	53034	53012	53012	He	135	" Dr. Renard ! Dr. Renard ! "
53176	53179	53181	53183	the cigarette smoker	1630	" Well , "
53186	53193	53181	53183	the cigarette smoker	1630	" what do you think now ? "
53194	53198	53200	53201	Dr. Bull	135	" I think , "
53205	53353	53200	53201	Dr. Bull	135	" that I am lying in bed at No . 217 Peabody Buildings , and that I shall soon wake up with a jump ; or , if that 's not it , I think that I am sitting in a small cushioned cell in Hanwell , and that the doctor ca n't make much of my case . But if you want to know what I do n't think , I 'll tell you . I do n't think what you think . I do n't think , and I never shall think , that the mass of ordinary men are a pack of dirty modern thinkers . No , sir , I 'm a democrat , and I still do n't believe that Sunday could convert one average navvy or counter - jumper . No , I may be mad , but humanity is n't . "
53373	53381	53382	53382	he	93	" You are a very fine fellow , "
53385	53461	53382	53382	he	93	" You can believe in a sanity which is not merely your sanity . And you 're right enough about humanity , about peasants and people like that jolly old innkeeper . But you 're not right about Renard . I suspected him from the first . He 's rationalistic , and , what 's worse , he 's rich . When duty and religion are really destroyed , it will be by the rich . "
53462	53469	53471	53475	the man with a cigarette	1631	" They are really destroyed now , "
53486	53493	53471	53475	the man with a cigarette	1631	" The devils are coming on ! "
53555	53558	53559	53559	he	1237	" Gentlemen , "
53562	53602	53559	53559	he	1237	" the thing is incredible . It must be a practical joke . If you knew Renard as I do it 's like calling Queen Victoria a dynamiter . If you had got the man 's character into your head "
53603	53607	53609	53609	Syme	93	" Dr. Bull , "
53612	53622	53609	53609	Syme	93	" has at least got it into his hat . "
53623	53632	53634	53635	the Colonel	1237	" I tell you it ca n't be ! "
53639	53652	53654	53654	he	1237	" Renard shall explain it . He shall explain it to me , "
53658	53667	53669	53670	the smoker	1639	" Do n't be in such a hurry , "
53672	53684	53669	53670	the smoker	1639	" He will very soon explain it to all of us . "
53732	53738	53740	53740	Syme	93	" It is no good , "
53742	53791	53740	53740	Syme	93	" He will never get anything out of that old heathen . I vote we drive bang through the thick of them , bang as the bullets went through Bull 's hat . We may all be killed , but we must kill a tidy number of them . "
53792	53800	53802	53803	Dr. Bull	135	" I wo n't ' ave it , "
53815	53831	53802	53803	Dr. Bull	135	" The poor chaps may be making a mistake . Give the Colonel a chance . "
53832	53840	53842	53843	the Professor	773	" Shall we go back , then ? "
53845	53848	53850	53850	Ratcliffe	160	" No , "
53856	53880	53850	53850	Ratcliffe	160	" the street behind us is held too . In fact , I seem to see there another friend of yours , Syme . "
53978	53985	53987	53988	the Professor	773	" What the devil is up ? "
53994	54001	54003	54003	Syme	93	" The morning star has fallen ! "
54070	54076	54078	54079	the Professor	773	" The world is insane ! "
54089	54092	54094	54095	Dr. Bull	135	" No , "
54100	54104	54094	54095	Dr. Bull	135	" it is I. "
54105	54113	54115	54116	the Professor	773	" What are we going to do ? "
54118	54123	54125	54125	Syme	93	" At this moment , "
54132	54144	54125	54125	Syme	93	" I think we are going to smash into a lamppost . "
54211	54218	54220	54221	the Professor	773	" Well , we smashed something , "
54228	54234	54220	54221	the Professor	773	" That 's some comfort . "
54235	54242	54244	54244	Syme	93	" You 're becoming an anarchist , "
54255	54259	54261	54261	Ratcliffe	160	" Everyone is , "
54372	54379	54381	54381	Syme	93	" We have one more chance , "
54391	54463	54381	54381	Syme	93	" Whatever all this pandemonium means , I suppose the police station will help us . We ca n't get there , for they hold the way . But there 's a pier or breakwater runs out into the sea just here , which we could defend longer than anything else , like Horatius and his bridge . We must defend it till the Gendarmerie turn out . Keep after me . "
54753	54757	54759	54759	Syme	93	" The peasant ! "
54761	54771	54759	54759	Syme	93	" They have not risen since the Middle Ages . "
54772	54781	54783	54784	the Professor	773	" Even if the police do come now , "
54787	54796	54783	54784	the Professor	773	" they can do nothing with this mob . "
54797	54800	54802	54802	Bull	135	" Nonsense ! "
54805	54819	54802	54802	Bull	135	" there must be some people left in the town who are human . "
54820	54823	54825	54827	the hopeless Inspector	1692	" No , "
54829	54845	54825	54827	the hopeless Inspector	1692	" the human being will soon be extinct . We are the last of mankind . "
54846	54851	54853	54854	the Professor	773	" It may be , "
54865	54878	54858	54858	he	773	" What is all that at the end of the ' Dunciad ' ?
54937	54937	54922	54923	great Anarch	168	"
54938	54941	54943	54943	Bull	135	" Stop ! "
54946	54952	54943	54943	Bull	135	" the gendarmes are out . "
54984	54991	54993	54993	Bull	135	" They are charging the mob ! "
54999	55002	55004	55004	Syme	93	" No , "
55006	55014	55004	55004	Syme	93	" they are formed along the parade . "
55015	55022	55024	55024	Bull	135	" They have unslung their carbines , "
55029	55032	55034	55034	Ratcliffe	160	" Yes , "
55036	55046	55034	55034	Ratcliffe	160	" and they are going to fire on us . "
55073	55080	55082	55083	the Professor	773	" The gendarmes have joined them ! "
55090	55098	55100	55100	Bull	135	" I am in the padded cell , "
55127	55147	55111	55111	Ratcliffe	160	" What does it matter who is mad or who is sane ? We shall all be dead soon . "
55154	55162	55148	55148	Syme	93	" You are quite hopeless , then ? "
55176	55229	55173	55173	he	160	" No ; oddly enough I am not quite hopeless . There is one insane little hope that I can not get out of my mind . The power of this whole planet is against us , yet I can not help wondering whether this one silly little hope is hopeless yet . "
55230	55239	55241	55241	Syme	93	" In what or whom is your hope ? "
55245	55253	55255	55256	the other	300	" In a man I never saw , "
55264	55271	55273	55273	Syme	93	" I know what you mean , "
55279	55296	55273	55273	Syme	93	" the man in the dark room . But Sunday must have killed him by now . "
55297	55300	55302	55304	the other steadily	1703	" Perhaps , "
55306	55324	55302	55304	the other steadily	1703	" but if so , he was the only man whom Sunday found it hard to kill . "
55325	55332	55334	55335	the Professor	773	" I heard what you said , "
55342	55356	55334	55335	the Professor	773	" I also am holding hard on to the thing I never saw . "
55385	55398	55302	55304	the other steadily	1703	" Where is the Colonel ? I thought he was with us ! "
55399	55405	55407	55407	Bull	135	" The Colonel ! Yes , "
55409	55417	55407	55407	Bull	135	" where on earth is the Colonel ? "
55418	55426	55428	55429	the Professor	773	" He went to speak to Renard , "
55431	55442	55444	55444	Syme	93	" We can not leave him among all those beasts , "
55446	55453	55444	55444	Syme	93	" Let us die like gentlemen if "
55454	55461	55463	55463	Ratcliffe	160	" Do not pity the Colonel , "
55470	55478	55463	55463	Ratcliffe	160	" He is extremely comfortable . He is "
55479	55486	55488	55488	Syme	93	" No ! no ! no ! "
55495	55507	55488	55488	Syme	93	" not the Colonel too ! I will never believe it ! "
55508	55515	55517	55518	the other	300	" Will you believe your eyes ? "
55652	55660	55662	55663	the Professor	773	" Yes , he is gone too , "
55672	55704	55662	55663	the Professor	773	" Everything 's gone . I 'm gone ! I ca n't trust my own bodily machinery . I feel as if my own hand might fly up and strike me . "
55705	55712	55714	55714	Syme	93	" When my hand flies up , "
55716	55723	55725	55725	he	93	" it will strike somebody else , "
55802	55807	55808	55808	he	93	" Judas before Herod ! "
55867	55874	55876	55876	Syme	93	" Do you see this lantern ? "
55882	56022	55876	55876	Syme	93	" Do you see the cross carved on it , and the flame inside ? You did not make it . You did not light it . Better men than you , men who could believe and obey , twisted the entrails of iron and preserved the legend of fire . There is not a street you walk on , there is not a thread you wear , that was not made as this lantern was , by denying your philosophy of dirt and rats . You can make nothing . You can only destroy . You will destroy mankind ; you will destroy the world . Let that suffice you . Yet this one old Christian lantern you shall not destroy . It shall go where your empire of apes will never have the wit to find it . "
56064	56067	56069	56069	Syme	93	" Swords ! "
56081	56096	56069	56069	Syme	93	" Let us charge these dogs , for our time has come to die . "
56208	56214	56215	56215	he	670	" There is some mistake , "
56218	56240	56215	56215	he	670	" Mr. Syme , I hardly think you understand your position . I arrest you in the name of the law . "
56241	56246	56248	56248	Syme	93	" Of the law ? "
56255	56258	56260	56261	the Secretary	670	" Certainly ! "
56263	56272	56274	56274	he	670	" I am a detective from Scotland Yard , "
56284	56293	56295	56296	the Professor	773	" And what do you suppose we are ? "
56304	56307	56309	56310	the Secretary	670	" You , "
56313	56337	56309	56310	the Secretary	670	" are , as I know for a fact , members of the Supreme Anarchist Council . Disguised as one of you , I "
56347	56356	56357	56357	he	135	" There never was any Supreme Anarchist Council , "
56360	56403	56404	56404	he	135	" We were all a lot of silly policemen looking at each other . And all these nice people who have been peppering us with shot thought we were the dynamiters . I knew I could n't be wrong about the mob , "
56423	56453	56404	56404	he	135	" Vulgar people are never mad . I 'm vulgar myself , and I know . I am now going on shore to stand a drink to everybody here . "
56666	56686	56687	56687	he	160	" I ca n't make head or tail of old Sunday 's little game any more than you can , "
56690	56713	56687	56687	he	160	" But whatever else Sunday is , he is n't a blameless citizen . Damn it ! do you remember his face ? "
56714	56719	56721	56721	Syme	93	" I grant you , "
56723	56734	56721	56721	Syme	93	" that I have never been able to forget it . "
56735	56738	56740	56741	the Secretary	670	" Well , "
56743	56766	56767	56767	he	670	" I suppose we can find out soon , for tomorrow we have our next general meeting . You will excuse me , "
56776	56786	56767	56767	he	670	" for being well acquainted with my secretarial duties . "
56787	56794	56796	56797	the Professor	773	" I suppose you are right , "
56800	56829	56796	56797	the Professor	773	" I suppose we might find it out from him ; but I confess that I should feel a bit afraid of asking Sunday who he really is . "
56830	56833	56835	56836	the Secretary	670	" Why , "
56838	56844	56835	56836	the Secretary	670	" for fear of bombs ? "
56845	56848	56850	56851	the Professor	773	" No , "
56853	56861	56850	56851	the Professor	773	" for fear he might tell me . "
56862	56869	56871	56872	Dr. Bull	135	" Let us have some drinks , "
57068	57077	57079	57080	Dr. Bull	135	" I tell you I 've seen him ! "
57086	57089	57091	57091	Syme	93	" Whom ? "
57094	57099	57091	57091	Syme	93	" Not the President ? "
57100	57107	57109	57110	Dr. Bull	135	" Not so bad as that , "
57116	57129	57109	57110	Dr. Bull	135	" not so bad as that . I 've got him here . "
57130	57135	57137	57137	Syme	93	" Got whom here ? "
57140	57144	57146	57147	the other	300	" Hairy man , "
57150	57164	57166	57166	he	135	" man that used to be hairy man Gogol . Here he is , "
57208	57216	57217	57217	he	135	" Why do you worry with me ? "
57220	57229	57217	57217	he	135	" You have expelled me as a spy . "
57230	57236	57238	57238	Syme	93	" We are all spies ! "
57240	57246	57248	57249	Dr. Bull	135	" We 're all spies ! "
57251	57258	57248	57249	Dr. Bull	135	" Come and have a drink . "
57276	57282	57284	57285	Dr. Bull	135	" This is more cheerful , "
57287	57301	57284	57285	Dr. Bull	135	" we are six men going to ask one man what he means . "
57302	57313	57315	57315	Syme	93	" I think it is a bit queerer than that , "
57317	57333	57315	57315	Syme	93	" I think it is six men going to ask one man what they mean . "
57474	57481	57483	57483	Syme	93	" My reason is quite simple , "
57485	57497	57483	57483	Syme	93	" I attack him rashly because I am afraid of him . "
57530	57533	57534	57534	he	1783	" Delightful ! "
57537	57557	57534	57534	he	1783	" So pleased to see you all . What an exquisite day it is . Is the Czar dead ? "
57575	57580	57581	57581	he	1785	" No , sir , "
57584	57601	57534	57534	he	1783	" there has been no massacre . I bring you news of no such disgusting spectacles . "
57602	57606	57608	57609	the President	2547	" Disgusting spectacles ? "
57618	57626	57608	57609	the President	2547	" You mean Dr. Bull 's spectacles ? "
57645	57669	57608	57609	the President	2547	" Of course , we all have our opinions and even our eyes , but really to call them disgusting before the man himself "
57683	57689	57690	57690	he	135	" My spectacles are blackguardly , "
57693	57704	57690	57690	he	135	" but I 'm not . Look at my face . "
57705	57720	57722	57723	the President	2547	" I dare say it 's the sort of face that grows on one , "
57725	57761	57722	57723	the President	2547	" in fact , it grows on you ; and who am I to quarrel with the wild fruits upon the Tree of Life ? I dare say it will grow on me some day . "
57762	57770	57772	57773	the Secretary	670	" We have no time for tomfoolery , "
57779	57843	57772	57773	the Secretary	670	" We have come to know what all this means . Who are you ? What are you ? Why did you get us all here ? Do you know who and what we are ? Are you a half - witted man playing the conspirator , or are you a clever man playing the fool ? Answer me , I tell you . "
57844	57847	57849	57849	Sunday	110	" Candidates , "
57851	57949	57849	57849	Sunday	110	" are only required to answer eight out of the seventeen questions on the paper . As far as I can make out , you want me to tell you what I am , and what you are , and what this table is , and what this Council is , and what this world is for all I know . Well , I will go so far as to rend the veil of one mystery . If you want to know what you are , you are a set of highly well - intentioned young jackasses . "
57950	57954	57956	57956	Syme	93	" And you , "
57961	57966	57956	57956	Syme	93	" what are you ? "
57967	57974	57976	57977	the President	2547	" I ? What am I ? "
58000	58177	57980	57980	he	2547	" You want to know what I am , do you ? Bull , you are a man of science . Grub in the roots of those trees and find out the truth about them . Syme , you are a poet . Stare at those morning clouds . But I tell you this , that you will have found out the truth of the last tree and the top - most cloud before the truth about me . You will understand the sea , and I shall be still a riddle ; you shall know what the stars are , and not know what I am . Since the beginning of the world all men have hunted me like a wolf kings and sages , and poets and lawgivers , all the churches , and all the philosophies . But I have never been caught yet , and the skies will fall in the time I turn to bay . I have given them a good run for their money , and I will now . "
58233	58263	58208	58208	he	1794	" There 's one thing I 'll tell you though about who I am . I am the man in the dark room , who made you all policemen . "
58456	58460	58447	58447	he	93	" Stop thief ! "
58788	58797	58824	58824	Syme	93	" What about Martin Tupper _ now ? _ "
58798	58806	58808	58808	Bull	135	" What does the old maniac mean ? "
58815	58823	58808	58808	Bull	135	" What does yours say , Syme ? "
58840	58891	58824	58824	Syme	93	" No one would regret anything in the nature of an interference by the Archdeacon more than I. I trust it will not come to that . But , for the last time , where are your goloshes ? The thing is too bad , especially after what uncle said . "
59025	59029	59031	59031	Syme	93	" After him ! "
59033	59050	59031	59031	Syme	93	" He ca n't go astray now . There 's no mistaking a fire - engine . "
59132	59150	59125	59125	he	1846	" Fly at once . The truth about your trouser - stretchers is known . A FRIEND . "
59310	59317	59318	59318	he	93	" What place can this be ? "
59321	59342	59318	59318	he	93	" Can it be the old devil 's house ? I 've heard he has a house in North London . "
59343	59348	59350	59351	the Secretary	670	" All the better , "
59361	59369	59350	59351	the Secretary	670	" we shall find him at home . "
59370	59379	59381	59381	Syme	93	" No , but it is n't that , "
59387	59406	59381	59381	Syme	93	" I hear the most horrible noises , like devils laughing and sneezing and blowing their devilish noses ! "
59407	59415	59417	59418	the Secretary	670	" His dogs barking , of course , "
59420	59430	59432	59432	Syme	93	" Why not say his black - beetles barking ! "
59435	59452	59432	59432	Syme	93	" snails barking ! geraniums barking ! Did you ever hear a dog bark like that ? "
59496	59507	59509	59509	Gogol	126	" The dogs of Sunday would be no ordinary dogs , "
59530	59537	59538	59538	he	93	" Well , listen to that , "
59541	59550	59538	59538	he	93	" is that a dog anybody 's dog ? "
59586	59596	59598	59599	the Secretary	670	" Well , his house ought to be hell ! "
59601	59613	59615	59615	he	670	" and if it is hell , I 'm going in ! "
59662	59668	59669	59669	he	135	" Why , you asses , "
59672	59678	59669	59669	he	135	" it 's the Zoo ! "
59709	59716	59718	59719	the keeper	1866	" Has it come this way ? "
59721	59725	59727	59727	Syme	93	" Has what ? "
59729	59733	59735	59736	the keeper	1866	" The elephant ! "
59738	59748	59735	59736	the keeper	1866	" An elephant has gone mad and run away ! "
59749	59759	59761	59763	the other stranger	1868	" He has run away with an old gentleman , "
59766	59775	59761	59763	the other stranger	1868	" a poor old gentleman with white hair ! "
59776	59783	59785	59785	Syme	93	" What sort of old gentleman ? "
59791	59804	59806	59807	the keeper	1866	" A very large and fat old gentleman in light grey clothes , "
59810	59813	59815	59815	Syme	93	" Well , "
59817	59902	59815	59815	Syme	93	" if he 's that particular kind of old gentleman , if you 're quite sure that he 's a large and fat old gentleman in grey clothes , you may take my word for it that the elephant has not run away with him . He has run away with the elephant . The elephant is not made by God that could run away with him if he did not consent to the elopement . And , by thunder , there he is ! "
60003	60007	60009	60010	the populace	1875	" Stop him ! "
60012	60021	60009	60010	the populace	1875	" He 'll be out of the gate ! "
60022	60027	60029	60030	the keeper	1866	" Stop a landslide ! "
60032	60040	60029	60030	the keeper	1866	" He is out of the gate ! "
60086	60090	60092	60092	Bull	135	" Great Lord ! "
60094	60123	60092	60092	Bull	135	" I never knew an elephant could go so fast . Well , it must be hansom - cabs again if we are to keep him in sight . "
60477	60490	60491	60496	The man once known as Gogol	1888	" The word , I fancy , should be ' pink ' . "
60749	60756	60758	60758	Syme	93	" Where has he gone to ? "
60765	60774	60776	60777	an official	1900	" Gentleman rushed into the Exhibition , sir ! "
60791	60809	60784	60784	he	1900	" Funny gentleman , sir . Asked me to hold his horse , and gave me this . "
60823	60833	60810	60810	He	1900	" To the Secretary of the Central Anarchist Council . "
60849	60879	60810	60810	He	1900	" When the herring runs a mile , Let the Secretary smile ; When the herring tries to _ fly _ , Let the Secretary die . Rustic Proverb . "
60880	60886	60888	60889	the Secretary	670	" Why the eternal crikey , "
60891	60912	60888	60889	the Secretary	670	" did you let the man in ? Do people commonly come to your Exhibition riding on mad elephants ? Do "
60913	60916	60918	60918	Syme	93	" Look ! "
60921	60926	60918	60918	Syme	93	" Look over there ! "
60927	60932	60934	60935	the Secretary	670	" Look at what ? "
60938	60945	60947	60947	Syme	93	" Look at the captive balloon ! "
60955	60967	60969	60970	the Secretary	670	" Why the blazes should I look at a captive balloon ? "
60972	60982	60969	60970	the Secretary	670	" What is there queer about a captive balloon ? "
60983	60986	60988	60988	Syme	93	" Nothing , "
60990	60998	60988	60988	Syme	93	" except that it is n't captive ! "
61054	61059	61061	61062	the Secretary	670	" Ten thousand devils ! "
61064	61071	61073	61073	he	670	" He 's got into it ! "
61117	61123	61125	61126	the Professor	773	" God bless my soul ! "
61144	61164	61132	61132	he	773	" God bless my soul ! I seemed to fancy that something fell on the top of my hat ! "
61202	61215	61224	61224	Syme	93	" Your beauty has not left me indifferent . From LITTLE SNOWDROP . "
61230	61250	61224	61224	Syme	93	" I 'm not beaten yet . The blasted thing must come down somewhere . Let 's follow it ! "
61470	61474	61475	61475	he	93	" After all , "
61478	61484	61475	61475	he	93	" it is very beautiful ! "
61485	61493	61495	61496	the Professor	773	" It is singularly and strangely beautiful ! "
61498	61509	61495	61496	the Professor	773	" I wish the beastly gas - bag would burst ! "
61510	61513	61515	61516	Dr. Bull	135	" No , "
61518	61532	61515	61516	Dr. Bull	135	" I hope it wo n't . It might hurt the old boy . "
61533	61537	61539	61541	the vindictive Professor	1924	" Hurt him ! "
61543	61566	61539	61541	the vindictive Professor	1924	" hurt him ! Not as much as I 'd hurt him if I could get up with him . Little Snowdrop ! "
61567	61577	61579	61580	Dr. Bull	135	" I do n't want him hurt , somehow , "
61582	61585	61587	61588	the Secretary	670	" What ! "
61591	61615	61587	61588	the Secretary	670	" Do you believe all that tale about his being our man in the dark room ? Sunday would say he was anybody . "
61616	61628	61630	61631	Dr. Bull	135	" I do n't know whether I believe it or not , "
61633	61654	61630	61631	Dr. Bull	135	" But it is n't that that I mean . I ca n't wish old Sunday 's balloon to burst because "
61655	61658	61660	61660	Syme	93	" Well , "
61663	61666	61660	61660	Syme	93	" because ? "
61667	61680	61682	61683	Dr. Bull	135	" Well , because he 's so jolly like a balloon himself , "
61686	61790	61682	61683	Dr. Bull	135	" I do n't understand a word of all that idea of his being the same man who gave us all our blue cards . It seems to make everything nonsense . But I do n't care who knows it , I always had a sympathy for old Sunday himself , wicked as he was . Just as if he was a great bouncing baby . How can I explain what my queer sympathy was ? It did n't prevent my fighting him like hell ! Shall I make it clear if I say that I liked him because he was so fat ? "
61791	61796	61798	61799	the Secretary	670	" You will not , "
61801	61808	61810	61810	Bull	135	" I 've got it now , "
61812	61890	61810	61810	Bull	135	" it was because he was so fat and so light . Just like a balloon . We always think of fat people as heavy , but he could have danced against a sylph . I see now what I mean . Moderate strength is shown in violence , supreme strength is shown in levity . It was like the old speculations what would happen if an elephant could leap up in the sky like a grasshopper ? "
61891	61895	61897	61897	Syme	93	" Our elephant , "
61902	61912	61897	61897	Syme	93	" has leapt into the sky like a grasshopper . "
61913	61917	61919	61919	Bull	135	" And somehow , "
61921	62058	61919	61919	Bull	135	" that 's why I ca n't help liking old Sunday . No , it 's not an admiration of force , or any silly thing like that . There is a kind of gaiety in the thing , as if he were bursting with some good news . Have n't you sometimes felt it on a spring day ? You know Nature plays tricks , but somehow that day proves they are good - natured tricks . I never read the Bible myself , but that part they laugh at is literal truth , ' Why leap ye , ye high hills ? ' The hills do leap at least , they try to .... Why do I like Sunday ? ... how can I tell you ? ... because he 's such a Bounder . "
62076	62432	62067	62068	the Secretary	670	" You do not know Sunday at all . Perhaps it is because you are better than I , and do not know hell . I was a fierce fellow , and a trifle morbid from the first . The man who sits in darkness , and who chose us all , chose me because I had all the crazy look of a conspirator because my smile went crooked , and my eyes were gloomy , even when I smiled . But there must have been something in me that answered to the nerves in all these anarchic men . For when I first saw Sunday he expressed to me , not your airy vitality , but something both gross and sad in the Nature of Things . I found him smoking in a twilight room , a room with brown blind down , infinitely more depressing than the genial darkness in which our master lives . He sat there on a bench , a huge heap of a man , dark and out of shape . He listened to all my words without speaking or even stirring . I poured out my most passionate appeals , and asked my most eloquent questions . Then , after a long silence , the Thing began to shake , and I thought it was shaken by some secret malady . It shook like a loathsome and living jelly . It reminded me of everything I had ever read about the base bodies that are the origin of life the deep sea lumps and protoplasm . It seemed like the final form of matter , the most shapeless and the most shameful . I could only tell myself , from its shudderings , that it was something at least that such a monster could be miserable . And then it broke upon me that the bestial mountain was shaking with a lonely laughter , and the laughter was at me . Do you ask me to forgive him that ? It is no small thing to be laughed at by something at once lower and stronger than oneself . "
62433	62441	62448	62449	Inspector Ratcliffe	160	" Surely you fellows are exaggerating wildly , "
62451	62719	62448	62449	Inspector Ratcliffe	160	" President Sunday is a terrible fellow for one 's intellect , but he is not such a Barnum 's freak physically as you make out . He received me in an ordinary office , in a grey check coat , in broad daylight . He talked to me in an ordinary way . But I 'll tell you what is a trifle creepy about Sunday . His room is neat , his clothes are neat , everything seems in order ; but he 's absent - minded . Sometimes his great bright eyes go quite blind . For hours he forgets that you are there . Now absent - mindedness is just a bit too awful in a bad man . We think of a wicked man as vigilant . We ca n't think of a wicked man who is honestly and sincerely dreamy , because we dare n't think of a wicked man alone with himself . An absentminded man means a good - natured man . It means a man who , if he happens to see you , will apologise . But how will you bear an absentminded man who , if he happens to see you , will kill you ? That is what tries the nerves , abstraction combined with cruelty . Men have felt it sometimes when they went through wild forests , and felt that the animals there were at once innocent and pitiless . They might ignore or slay . How would you like to pass ten mortal hours in a parlour with an absent - minded tiger ? "
62720	62731	62733	62733	Syme	93	" And what do you think of Sunday , Gogol ? "
62735	62745	62747	62747	Gogol	126	" I do n't think of Sunday on principle , "
62750	62762	62747	62747	Gogol	126	" any more than I stare at the sun at noonday . "
62763	62773	62775	62775	Syme	93	" Well , that is a point of view , "
62778	62786	62775	62775	Syme	93	" What do you say , Professor ? "
62806	62812	62814	62814	Syme	93	" Wake up , Professor ! "
62817	62826	62814	62814	Syme	93	" Tell us what you think of Sunday . "
62835	62840	62841	62841	he	773	" I think something , "
62844	62890	62841	62841	he	773	" that I can not say clearly . Or , rather , I think something that I can not even think clearly . But it is something like this . My early life , as you know , was a bit too large and loose . "
62891	62982	62814	62814	Syme	93	" Well , when I saw Sunday 's face I thought it was too large everybody does , but I also thought it was too loose . The face was so big , that one could n't focus it or make it a face at all . The eye was so far away from the nose , that it was n't an eye . The mouth was so much by itself , that one had to think of it by itself . The whole thing is too hard to explain . "
62998	63233	62983	62983	He	773	" But put it this way . Walking up a road at night , I have seen a lamp and a lighted window and a cloud make together a most complete and unmistakable face . If anyone in heaven has that face I shall know him again . Yet when I walked a little farther I found that there was no face , that the window was ten yards away , the lamp ten hundred yards , the cloud beyond the world . Well , Sunday 's face escaped me ; it ran away to right and left , as such chance pictures run away . And so his face has made me , somehow , doubt whether there are any faces . I do n't know whether your face , Bull , is a face or a combination in perspective . Perhaps one black disc of your beastly glasses is quite close and another fifty miles away . Oh , the doubts of a materialist are not worth a dump . Sunday has taught me the last and the worst doubts , the doubts of a spiritualist . I am a Buddhist , I suppose ; and Buddhism is not a creed , it is a doubt . My poor dear Bull , I do not believe that you really have a face . I have not faith enough to believe in matter . "
63262	63270	63271	63271	he	93	" Have you noticed an odd thing , "
63274	63390	63271	63271	he	93	" about all your descriptions ? Each man of you finds Sunday quite different , yet each man of you can only find one thing to compare him to the universe itself . Bull finds him like the earth in spring , Gogol like the sun at noonday . The Secretary is reminded of the shapeless protoplasm , and the Inspector of the carelessness of virgin forests . The Professor says he is like a changing landscape . This is queer , but it is queerer still that I also have had my odd notion about the President , and I also find that I think of Sunday as I think of the whole world . "
63391	63400	63402	63402	Bull	135	" Get on a little faster , Syme , "
63404	63410	63402	63402	Bull	135	" never mind the balloon . "
63411	63418	63420	63420	Syme	93	" When I first saw Sunday , "
63423	63508	63420	63420	Syme	93	" I only saw his back ; and when I saw his back , I knew he was the worst man in the world . His neck and shoulders were brutal , like those of some apish god . His head had a stoop that was hardly human , like the stoop of an ox . In fact , I had at once the revolting fancy that this was not a man at all , but a beast dressed up in men 's clothes . "
63509	63513	63515	63516	Dr. Bull	135	" Get on , "
63518	63606	63402	63402	Bull	135	" And then the queer thing happened . I had seen his back from the street , as he sat in the balcony . Then I entered the hotel , and coming round the other side of him , saw his face in the sunlight . His face frightened me , as it did everyone ; but not because it was brutal , not because it was evil . On the contrary , it frightened me because it was so beautiful , because it was so good . "
63607	63610	63612	63613	the Secretary	670	" Syme , "
63615	63620	63612	63613	the Secretary	670	" are you ill ? "
63621	63704	63402	63402	Bull	135	" It was like the face of some ancient archangel , judging justly after heroic wars . There was laughter in the eyes , and in the mouth honour and sorrow . There was the same white hair , the same great , grey - clad shoulders that I had seen from behind . But when I saw him from behind I was certain he was an animal , and when I saw him in front I knew he was a god . "
63705	63708	63710	63711	the Professor	773	" Pan , "
63714	63722	63710	63711	the Professor	773	" was a god and an animal . "
63723	63731	63734	63734	Syme	93	" Then , and again and always , "
63742	63857	63734	63734	Syme	93	" that has been for me the mystery of Sunday , and it is also the mystery of the world . When I see the horrible back , I am sure the noble face is but a mask . When I see the face but for an instant , I know the back is only a jest . Bad is so bad , that we can not but think good an accident ; good is so good , that we feel certain that evil could be explained . But the whole came to a kind of crest yesterday when I raced Sunday for the cab , and was just behind him all the way . "
63858	63866	63868	63868	Ratcliffe	160	" Had you time for thinking then ? "
63870	63873	63875	63875	Syme	93	" Time , "
63877	63936	63875	63875	Syme	93	" for one outrageous thought . I was suddenly possessed with the idea that the blind , blank back of his head really was his face an awful , eyeless face staring at me ! And I fancied that the figure running in front of me was really a figure running backwards , and dancing as he ran . "
63937	63940	63942	63943	Dr. Bull	135	" Horrible ! "
63948	63955	63957	63957	Syme	93	" Horrible is not the word , "
63959	64012	63957	63957	Syme	93	" It was exactly the worst instant of my life . And yet ten minutes afterwards , when he put his head out of the cab and made a grimace like a gargoyle , I knew that he was only like a father playing hide - and - seek with his children . "
64013	64020	64022	64023	the Secretary	670	" It is a long game , "
64032	64037	64039	64039	Syme	93	" Listen to me , "
64044	64127	64039	64039	Syme	93	" Shall I tell you the secret of the whole world ? It is that we have only known the back of the world . We see everything from behind , and it looks brutal . That is not a tree , but the back of a tree . That is not a cloud , but the back of a cloud . Can not you see that everything is stooping and hiding a face ? If we could only get round in front "
64128	64131	64134	64134	Bull	135	" Look ! "
64137	64144	64134	64134	Bull	135	" the balloon is coming down ! "
64216	64221	64222	64222	he	126	" He is dead ! "
64225	64240	64222	64222	he	126	" And now I know he was my friend my friend in the dark ! "
64241	64244	64246	64247	the Secretary	670	" Dead ! "
64249	64287	64246	64247	the Secretary	670	" You will not find him dead easily . If he has been tipped out of the car , we shall find him rolling as a colt rolls in a field , kicking his legs for fun . "
64288	64293	64295	64296	the Professor	773	" Clashing his hoofs , "
64298	64308	64295	64296	the Professor	773	" The colts do , and so did Pan . "
64309	64313	64315	64316	Dr. Bull	135	" Pan again ! "
64319	64328	64315	64316	Dr. Bull	135	" You seem to think Pan is everything . "
64329	64334	64336	64337	the Professor	773	" So he is , "
64339	64347	64336	64337	the Professor	773	" in Greek . He means everything . "
64348	64353	64355	64356	the Secretary	670	" Do n't forget , "
64361	64368	64355	64356	the Secretary	670	" that he also means Panic . "
64379	64385	64386	64386	he	93	" It fell over there , "
64390	64396	64386	64386	he	93	" Let us follow it ! "
64404	64426	64451	64451	him	93	" Oh , if he has cheated us all by getting killed ! It would be like one of his larks . "
64595	64598	64599	64599	he	1945	" Gentlemen , "
64602	64617	64599	64599	he	1945	" my master has a carriage waiting for you in the road just by . "
64618	64624	64626	64626	Syme	93	" Who is your master ? "
64632	64641	64643	64644	the man	315	" I was told you knew his name , "
64657	64663	64654	64655	the Secretary	670	" Where is this carriage ? "
64664	64674	64676	64677	the stranger	1950	" It has been waiting only a few moments , "
64679	64688	64676	64677	the stranger	1950	" My master has only just come home . "
64776	64782	64783	64783	Syme	93	" Show us the place , "
64973	64980	64982	64982	Bull	135	" What can it all mean ? "
64989	64998	64982	64982	Bull	135	" Is this another joke of Sunday 's ? "
64999	65005	65007	65007	Syme	93	" I do n't know , "
65020	65044	65009	65009	he	93	" but if it is , it 's one of the jokes you talk about . It 's a good - natured one . "
65495	65505	65487	65489	This impressive person	2001	" Refreshments are provided for you in your room . "
65664	65674	65648	65659	a man in blue , who had been appointed as his valet	2007	" I have put out your clothes , sir . "
65675	65678	65680	65680	Syme	93	" Clothes ! "
65683	65691	65693	65693	he	93	" I have no clothes except these , "
65720	65728	65730	65731	the attendant	2010	" My master asks me to say , "
65733	65790	65730	65731	the attendant	2010	" that there is a fancy dress ball tonight , and that he desires you to put on the costume that I have laid out . Meanwhile , sir , there is a bottle of Burgundy and some cold pheasant , which he hopes you will not refuse , as it is some hours before supper . "
65791	65799	65801	65801	Syme	93	" Cold pheasant is a good thing , "
65804	65853	65801	65801	Syme	93	" and Burgundy is a spanking good thing . But really I do not want either of them so much as I want to know what the devil all this means , and what sort of costume you have got laid out for me . Where is it ? "
65902	65913	65915	65916	the valet	2012	" You 're to be dressed as Thursday , sir , "
65920	65925	65927	65927	Syme	93	" Dressed as Thursday ! "
65931	65940	65927	65927	Syme	93	" It does n't sound a warm costume . "
65941	65948	65950	65952	the other eagerly	2013	" Oh , yes , sir , "
65954	65971	65950	65952	the other eagerly	2013	" the Thursday costume is quite warm , sir . It fastens up to the chin . "
65972	65981	65983	65983	Syme	93	" Well , I do n't understand anything , "
65987	66054	65983	65983	Syme	93	" I have been used so long to uncomfortable adventures that comfortable adventures knock me out . Still , I may be allowed to ask why I should be particularly like Thursday in a green frock spotted all over with the sun and moon . Those orbs , I think , shine on other days . I once saw the moon on Tuesday , I remember . "
66055	66061	66063	66064	the valet	2012	" Beg pardon , sir , "
66066	66073	66063	66064	the valet	2012	" Bible also provided for you , "
66131	66139	66141	66141	Syme	93	" This is getting wilder and wilder , "
66151	66174	66141	66141	Syme	93	" Who are these people who provide cold pheasant and Burgundy , and green clothes and Bibles ? Do they provide everything ? "
66175	66182	66184	66185	the attendant	2010	" Yes , sir , everything , "
66188	66198	66184	66185	the attendant	2010	" Shall I help you on with your costume ? "
66199	66208	66210	66210	Syme	93	" Oh , hitch the bally thing on ! "
67273	67288	67257	67258	The Secretary	670	" We do not know yet that he is not dead in a field . "
67729	67737	67738	67738	he	110	" We will eat and drink later , "
67741	67899	67738	67738	he	110	" Let us remain together a little , we who have loved each other so sadly , and have fought so long . I seem to remember only centuries of heroic war , in which you were always heroes epic on epic , iliad on iliad , and you always brothers in arms . Whether it was but recently ( for time is nothing ) , or at the beginning of the world , I sent you out to war . I sat in the darkness , where there is not any created thing , and to you I was only a voice commanding valour and an unnatural virtue . You heard the voice in the dark , and you never heard it again . The sun in heaven denied it , the earth and sky denied it , all human wisdom denied it . And when I met you in the daylight I denied it myself . "
67919	67985	67997	68001	the black - browed Secretary	2088	" But you were men . You did not forget your secret honour , though the whole cosmos turned an engine of torture to tear it out of you . I knew how near you were to hell . I know how you , Thursday , crossed swords with King Satan , and how you , Wednesday , named me in the hour without hope . "
68018	68025	67997	68001	the black - browed Secretary	2088	" Who and what are you ? "
68026	68032	68034	68035	the other	300	" I am the Sabbath , "
68039	68047	68034	68035	the other	300	" I am the peace of God . "
68063	68070	68071	68071	he	2088	" I know what you mean , "
68074	68200	68071	68071	he	2088	" and it is exactly that that I can not forgive you . I know you are contentment , optimism , what do they call the thing , an ultimate reconciliation . Well , I am not reconciled . If you were the man in the dark room , why were you also Sunday , an offense to the sunlight ? If you were from the first our father and our friend , why were you also our greatest enemy ? We wept , we fled in terror ; the iron entered into our souls and you are the peace of God ! Oh , I can forgive God His anger , though it destroyed nations ; but I can not forgive Him His peace . "
68224	68227	68229	68229	Syme	93	" No , "
68231	68300	68229	68229	Syme	93	" I do not feel fierce like that . I am grateful to you , not only for wine and hospitality here , but for many a fine scamper and free fight . But I should like to know . My soul and heart are as happy and quiet here as this old garden , but my reason is still crying out . I should like to know . "
68310	68329	68398	68399	a child	495	" It seems so _ silly _ that you should have been on both sides and fought yourself . "
68332	68351	68330	68330	Bull	135	" I understand nothing , but I am happy . In fact , I am going to sleep . "
68352	68358	68360	68361	the Professor	773	" I am not happy , "
68369	68387	68360	68361	the Professor	773	" because I do not understand . You let me stray a little too near to hell . "
68400	68412	68390	68390	Gogol	126	" I wish I knew why I was hurt so much . "
68440	68467	68438	68438	he	2093	" I have heard your complaints in order . And here , I think , comes another to complain , and we will hear him also . "
68628	68631	68633	68633	Syme	93	" Gregory ! "
68642	68651	68633	68633	Syme	93	" Why , this is the real anarchist ! "
68652	68655	68657	68657	Gregory	112	" Yes , "
68666	68673	68657	68657	Gregory	112	" I am the real anarchist . "
68674	68683	68685	68685	Bull	135	" ' Now there was a day , ' "
68695	68718	68685	68685	Bull	135	" ' when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them . ' "
68719	68724	68726	68726	Gregory	112	" You are right , "
68733	68748	68726	68726	Gregory	112	" I am a destroyer . I would destroy the world if I could . "
68771	68778	68779	68779	he	93	" Oh , most unhappy man , "
68782	68796	68779	68779	he	93	" try to be happy ! You have red hair like your sister . "
68797	68812	68814	68814	Gregory	112	" My red hair , like red flames , shall burn up the world , "
68816	68846	68814	68814	Gregory	112	" I thought I hated everything more than common men can hate anything ; but I find that I do not hate everything so much as I hate you ! "
68847	68853	68855	68855	Syme	93	" I never hated you , "
68870	68873	68874	68874	he	93	" You ! "
68877	69098	68874	68874	he	93	" You never hated because you never lived . I know what you are all of you , from first to last you are the people in power ! You are the police the great fat , smiling men in blue and buttons ! You are the Law , and you have never been broken . But is there a free soul alive that does not long to break you , only because you have never been broken ? We in revolt talk all kind of nonsense doubtless about this crime or that crime of the Government . It is all folly ! The only crime of the Government is that it governs . The unpardonable sin of the supreme power is that it is supreme . I do not curse you for being cruel . I do not curse you ( though I might ) for being kind . I curse you for being safe ! You sit in your chairs of stone , and have never come down from them . You are the seven angels of heaven , and you have had no troubles . Oh , I could forgive you everything , you that rule all mankind , if I could feel for once that you had suffered for one hour a real agony such as I "
69111	69116	69117	69117	he	93	" I see everything , "
69120	69294	69117	69117	he	93	" everything that there is . Why does each thing on the earth war against each other thing ? Why does each small thing in the world have to fight against the world itself ? Why does a fly have to fight the whole universe ? Why does a dandelion have to fight the whole universe ? For the same reason that I had to be alone in the dreadful Council of the Days . So that each thing that obeys law may have the glory and isolation of the anarchist . So that each man fighting for order may be as brave and good a man as the dynamiter . So that the real lie of Satan may be flung back in the face of this blasphemer , so that by tears and torture we may earn the right to say to this man , ' You lie ! ' No agonies can be too great to buy the right to say to this accuser , ' We also have suffered . ' "
69295	69386	69448	69448	Memnon	125	" It is not true that we have never been broken . We have been broken upon the wheel . It is not true that we have never descended from these thrones . We have descended into hell . We were complaining of unforgettable miseries even at the very moment when this man entered insolently to accuse us of happiness . I repel the slander ; we have not been happy . I can answer for every one of the great guards of Law whom he has accused . At least "
69409	69413	69414	69414	he	2104	" Have you , "
69421	69427	69414	69414	he	2104	" have you ever suffered ? "
69502	69514	69485	69485	he	2104	" Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ? "
