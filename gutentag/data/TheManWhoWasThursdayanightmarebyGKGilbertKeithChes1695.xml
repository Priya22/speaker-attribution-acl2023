   <p n="1">It is very difficult to classify THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY . It is possible to say that it is a gripping adventure story of murderous criminals and brilliant policemen ; but it was to be expected that the author of the Father Brown stories should tell a detective story like no-one else . On this level , therefore , THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY succeeds superbly ; if nothing else , it is a magnificent tour-de-force of suspense-writing .</p>
   <p n="2">However , the reader will soon discover that it is much more than that . Carried along on the boisterous rush of the narrative by Chesterton 's wonderful high-spirited style , he will soon see that he is being carried into much deeper waters than he had planned on ; and the totally unforeseeable denouement will prove for the modern reader , as it has for thousands of others since 1908 when the book was first published , an inevitable and moving experience , as the investigators finally discover who Sunday is .</p>
   <p>THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY</p>
   <p>A NIGHTMARE</p>
   <p n="3">To Edmund Clerihew Bentley</p>
   <p n="4">A cloud was on the mind of men , and wailing went the weather , Yea , a sick cloud upon the soul when we were boys together . Science announced nonentity and art admired decay ; The world was old and ended : but you and I were gay ; Round us in antic order their crippled vices came — Lust that had lost its laughter , fear that had lost its shame . Like the white lock of Whistler , that lit our aimless gloom , Men showed their own white feather as proudly as a plume . Life was a fly that faded , and death a drone that stung ; The world was very old indeed when you and I were young . They twisted even decent sin to shapes not to be named : Men were ashamed of honour ; but we were not ashamed . Weak if we were and foolish , not thus we failed , not thus ; When that black Baal blocked the heavens he had no hymns from us Children we were — our forts of sand were even as weak as eve , High as they went we piled them up to break that bitter sea . Fools as we were in motley , all jangling and absurd , When all church bells were silent our cap and beds were heard .</p>
   <p n="5">Not all unhelped we held the fort , our tiny flags unfurled ; Some giants laboured in that cloud to lift it from the world . I find again the book we found , I feel the hour that flings Far out of fish-shaped Paumanok some cry of cleaner things ; And the Green Carnation withered , as in forest fires that pass , Roared in the wind of all the world ten million leaves of grass ; Or sane and sweet and sudden as a bird sings in the rain — Truth out of Tusitala spoke and pleasure out of pain . Yea , cool and clear and sudden as a bird sings in the grey , Dunedin to Samoa spoke , and darkness unto day . But we were young ; we lived to see God break their bitter charms . God and the good Republic come riding back in arms : We have seen the City of Mansoul , even as it rocked , relieved — Blessed are they who did not see , but being blind , believed .</p>
   <p n="6">This is a tale of those old fears , even of those emptied hells , And none but you shall understand the true thing that it tells — Of what colossal gods of shame could cow men and yet crash , Of what huge devils hid the stars , yet fell at a pistol flash . The doubts that were so plain to chase , so dreadful to withstand — Oh , who shall understand but you ; yea , who shall understand ? The doubts that drove us through the night as we two talked amain , And day had broken on the streets e'er it broke upon the brain . Between us , by the peace of God , such truth can now be told ; Yea , there is strength in striking root and good in growing old . We have found common things at last and marriage and a creed , And I may safely write it now , and you may safely read .</p>
   <p>G. K. C .</p>
   <div type="chapter" n="1">
    <p n="7">THE suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London , as red and ragged as a cloud of sunset . It was built of a bright brick throughout ; its sky-line was fantastic , and even its ground plan was wild . It had been the outburst of a speculative builder , faintly tinged with art , who called its architecture sometimes Elizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne , apparently under the impression that the two sovereigns were identical . It was described with some justice as an artistic colony , though it never in any definable way produced any art . But although its pretensions to be an intellectual centre were a little vague , its pretensions to be a pleasant place were quite indisputable . The stranger who looked for the first time at the quaint red houses could only think how very oddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them . Nor when he met the people was he disappointed in this respect . The place was not only pleasant , but perfect , if once he could regard it not as a deception but rather as a dream . Even if the people were not “ artists , ” the whole was nevertheless artistic . That young man with the long , auburn hair and the impudent face — that young man was not really a poet ; but surely he was a poem . That old gentleman with the wild , white beard and the wild , white hat — that venerable humbug was not really a philosopher ; but at least he was the cause of philosophy in others . That scientific gentleman with the bald , egg-like head and the bare , bird-like neck had no real right to the airs of science that he assumed . He had not discovered anything new in biology ; but what biological creature could he have discovered more singular than himself ? Thus , and thus only , the whole place had properly to be regarded ; it had to be considered not so much as a workshop for artists , but as a frail but finished work of art . A man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had stepped into a written comedy .</p>
    <p n="8">More especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about nightfall , when the extravagant roofs were dark against the afterglow and the whole insane village seemed as separate as a drifting cloud . This again was more strongly true of the many nights of local festivity , when the little gardens were often illuminated , and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish trees like some fierce and monstrous fruit . And this was strongest of all on one particular evening , still vaguely remembered in the locality , of which the auburn-haired poet was the hero . It was not by any means the only evening of which he was the hero . On many nights those passing by his little back garden might hear his high , didactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly to women . The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the paradoxes of the place . Most of the women were of the kind vaguely called emancipated , and professed some protest against male supremacy . Yet these new women would always pay to a man the extravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to him , that of listening while he is talking . And Mr. Lucian<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, the red-haired poet , was really ( in some sense ) a man worth listening to , even if one only laughed at the end of it . He put the old cant of the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain impudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure . He was helped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance , which he worked , as the phrase goes , for all it was worth . His dark red hair parted in the middle was literally like a woman 's , and curved into the slow curls of a virgin in a pre-Raphaelite picture . From within this almost saintly oval , however , his face projected suddenly broad and brutal , the chin carried forward with a look of cockney contempt . This combination at once tickled and terrified the nerves of a neurotic population . He seemed like a walking blasphemy , a blend of the angel and the ape .</p>
    <p n="9">This particular evening , if it is remembered for nothing else , will be remembered in that place for its strange sunset . It looked like the end of the world . All the heaven seemed covered with a quite vivid and palpable plumage ; you could only say that the sky was full of feathers , and of feathers that almost brushed the face . Across the great part of the dome they were grey , with the strangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale green ; but towards the west the whole grew past description , transparent and passionate , and the last red-hot plumes of it covered up the sun like something too good to be seen . The whole was so close about the earth , as to express nothing but a violent secrecy . The very empyrean seemed to be a secret . It expressed that splendid smallness which is the soul of local patriotism . The very sky seemed small .</p>
    <p n="10">I say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the evening if only by that oppressive sky . There are others who may remember it because it marked the first appearance in the place of the second poet of Saffron Park . For a long time the red-haired revolutionary had reigned without a rival ; it was upon the night of the sunset that his solitude suddenly ended . The new poet , who introduced himself by the name of<persName corresp="#Gabriel_Syme">Gabriel Syme</persName>was a very mild-looking mortal , with a fair , pointed beard and faint , yellow hair . But an impression grew that he was less meek than he looked . He signalised his entrance by differing with the established poet ,<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, upon the whole nature of poetry . He said that he (<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>) was poet of law , a poet of order ; nay , he said he was a poet of respectability . So all the Saffron Parkers looked at him as if he had that moment fallen out of that impossible sky .</p>
    <p n="11">In fact , Mr. Lucian<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, the anarchic poet , connected the two events .</p>
    <p n="12"><said who="#Gregory">“ It may well be , ”</said>he said , in his sudden lyrical manner ,<said who="#Gregory">“ it may well be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet . You say you are a poet of law ; I say you are a contradiction in terms . I only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden . ”</said></p>
    <p n="13">The man with the meek blue eyes and the pale , pointed beard endured these thunders with a certain submissive solemnity . The third party of the group ,<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>'s sister Rosamond , who had her brother 's braids of red hair , but a kindlier face underneath them , laughed with such mixture of admiration and disapproval as she gave commonly to the family oracle .</p>
    <p n="14"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>resumed in high oratorical good humour .</p>
    <p n="15"><said who="#Gregory">“ An artist is identical with an anarchist , ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Gregory">“ You might transpose the words anywhere . An anarchist is an artist . The man who throws a bomb is an artist , because he prefers a great moment to everything . He sees how much more valuable is one burst of blazing light , one peal of perfect thunder , than the mere common bodies of a few shapeless policemen . An artist disregards all governments , abolishes all conventions . The poet delights in disorder only . If it were not so , the most poetical thing in the world would be the Underground Railway . ”</said></p>
    <p n="16"><said who="#Mr._Syme">“ So it is , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Syme">Mr. Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="17"><said who="#Mr._Syme">“ Nonsense ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, who was very rational when anyone else attempted paradox .<said who="#Mr._Syme">“ Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired , so very sad and tired ? I will tell you . It is because they know that the train is going right . It is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach . It is because after they have passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be<persName>Victoria</persName>, and nothing but<persName>Victoria</persName>. Oh , their wild rapture ! oh , their eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden , if the next station were unaccountably Baker Street ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="18"><said who="#Syme">“ It is you who are unpoetical , ”</said>replied the poet<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ If what you say of clerks is true , they can only be as prosaic as your poetry . The rare , strange thing is to hit the mark ; the gross , obvious thing is to miss it . We feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird . Is it not also epical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station ? Chaos is dull ; because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere , to Baker Street or to Bagdad . But man is a magician , and his whole magic is in this , that he does say<persName>Victoria</persName>, and lo ! it is<persName>Victoria</persName>. No , take your books of mere poetry and prose ; let me read a time table , with tears of pride . Take your Byron , who commemorates the defeats of man ; give me Bradshaw , who commemorates his victories . Give me Bradshaw , I say ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="19"><said who="#Gregory">“ Must you go ? ”</said>inquired<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>sarcastically .</p>
    <p n="20"><said who="#Syme">“ I tell you , ”</said>went on<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with passion ,<said who="#Syme">“ that every time a train comes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers , and that man has won a battle against chaos . You say contemptuously that when one has left Sloane Square one must come to<persName>Victoria</persName>. I say that one might do a thousand things instead , and that whenever I really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape . And when I hear the guard shout out the word ‘<persName>Victoria</persName>, ’ it is not an unmeaning word . It is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest . It is to me indeed ‘<persName>Victoria</persName>’ ; it is the victory of Adam . ”</said></p>
    <p n="21"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>wagged his heavy , red head with a slow and sad smile .</p>
    <p n="22"><said who="#Gregory">“ And even then , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Gregory">“ we poets always ask the question , ‘ And what is<persName>Victoria</persName>now that you have got there ? ’ You think<persName>Victoria</persName>is like the New Jerusalem . We know that the New Jerusalem will only be like<persName>Victoria</persName>. Yes , the poet will be discontented even in the streets of heaven . The poet is always in revolt . ”</said></p>
    <p n="23"><said who="#Syme">“ There again , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>irritably ,<said who="#Syme">“ what is there poetical about being in revolt ? You might as well say that it is poetical to be sea-sick . Being sick is a revolt . Both being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate occasions ; but I 'm hanged if I can see why they are poetical . Revolt in the abstract is — revolting . It 's mere vomiting . ”</said></p>
    <p n="24">The girl winced for a flash at the unpleasant word , but<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was too hot to heed her .</p>
    <p n="25"><said who="#Gregory">“ It is things going right , ”</said>he cried ,<said who="#Gregory">“ that is poetical ! Our digestions , for instance , going sacredly and silently right , that is the foundation of all poetry . Yes , the most poetical thing , more poetical than the flowers , more poetical than the stars — the most poetical thing in the world is not being sick . ”</said></p>
    <p n="26"><said who="#Gregory">“ Really , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>superciliously ,<said who="#Gregory">“ the examples you choose — ”</said></p>
    <p n="27"><said who="#Syme">“ I beg your pardon , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>grimly ,<said who="#Syme">“ I forgot we had abolished all conventions . ”</said></p>
    <p n="28">For the first time a red patch appeared on<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>'s forehead .</p>
    <p n="29"><said who="#Gregory">“ You do n't expect me , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Gregory">“ to revolutionise society on this lawn ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="30"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>looked straight into his eyes and smiled sweetly .</p>
    <p n="31"><said who="#Gregory">“ No , I do n't , ”</said>he said ;<said who="#Gregory">“ but I suppose that if you were serious about your anarchism , that is exactly what you would do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="32"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>'s big bull 's eyes blinked suddenly like those of an angry lion , and one could almost fancy that his red mane rose .</p>
    <p n="33"><said who="#Gregory">“ Do n't you think , then , ”</said>he said in a dangerous voice ,<said who="#Gregory">“ that I am serious about my anarchism ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="34"><said who="#Syme">“ I beg your pardon ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="35"><said who="#Syme">“ Am I not serious about my anarchism ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, with knotted fists .</p>
    <p n="36"><said who="#Syme">“ My dear fellow ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, and strolled away .</p>
    <p n="37">With surprise , but with a curious pleasure , he found Rosamond<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>still in his company .</p>
    <p n="38"><said who="#Syme">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Syme">Mr. Syme</persName>, ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Syme">“ do the people who talk like you and my brother often mean what they say ? Do you mean what you say now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="39"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>smiled .</p>
    <p n="40"><said who="#Syme">“ Do you ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="41"><said who="#Gregory">“ What do you mean ? ”</said>asked the girl , with grave eyes .</p>
    <p n="42"><said who="#Syme">“ My dear Miss<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>gently ,<said who="#Syme">“ there are many kinds of sincerity and insincerity . When you say ‘ thank you ’ for the salt , do you mean what you say ? No . When you say ‘ the world is round , ’ do you mean what you say ? No . It is true , but you do n't mean it . Now , sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he does mean . It may be only a half-truth , quarter-truth , tenth-truth ; but then he says more than he means — from sheer force of meaning it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="43">She was looking at him from under level brows ; her face was grave and open , and there had fallen upon it the shadow of that unreasoning responsibility which is at the bottom of the most frivolous woman , the maternal watch which is as old as the world .</p>
    <p n="44"><said who="#Syme">“ Is he really an anarchist , then ? ”</said>she asked .</p>
    <p n="45"><said who="#Syme">“ Only in that sense I speak of , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>;<said who="#Syme">“ or if you prefer it , in that nonsense . ”</said></p>
    <p n="46">She drew her broad brows together and said abruptly —</p>
    <p n="47"><said who="#Syme">“ He would n't really use — bombs or that sort of thing ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="48"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>broke into a great laugh , that seemed too large for his slight and somewhat dandified figure .</p>
    <p n="49"><said who="#Syme">“ Good Lord , no ! ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Syme">“ that has to be done anonymously . ”</said></p>
    <p n="50">And at that the corners of her own mouth broke into a smile , and she thought with a simultaneous pleasure of<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>'s absurdity and of his safety .</p>
    <p n="51"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>strolled with her to a seat in the corner of the garden , and continued to pour out his opinions . For he was a sincere man , and in spite of his superficial airs and graces , at root a humble one . And it is always the humble man who talks too much ; the proud man watches himself too closely . He defended respectability with violence and exaggeration . He grew passionate in his praise of tidiness and propriety . All the time there was a smell of lilac all round him . Once he heard very faintly in some distant street a barrel-organ begin to play , and it seemed to him that his heroic words were moving to a tiny tune from under or beyond the world .</p>
    <p n="52">He stared and talked at the girl 's red hair and amused face for what seemed to be a few minutes ; and then , feeling that the groups in such a place should mix , rose to his feet . To his astonishment , he discovered the whole garden empty . Everyone had gone long ago , and he went himself with a rather hurried apology . He left with a sense of champagne in his head , which he could not afterwards explain . In the wild events which were to follow this girl had no part at all ; he never saw her again until all his tale was over . And yet , in some indescribable way , she kept recurring like a motive in music through all his mad adventures afterwards , and the glory of her strange hair ran like a red thread through those dark and ill-drawn tapestries of the night . For what followed was so improbable , that it might well have been a dream .</p>
    <p n="53">When<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>went out into the starlit street , he found it for the moment empty . Then he realised ( in some odd way ) that the silence was rather a living silence than a dead one . Directly outside the door stood a street lamp , whose gleam gilded the leaves of the tree that bent out over the fence behind him . About a foot from the lamp-post stood a figure almost as rigid and motionless as the lamp-post itself . The tall hat and long frock coat were black ; the face , in an abrupt shadow , was almost as dark . Only a fringe of fiery hair against the light , and also something aggressive in the attitude , proclaimed that it was the poet<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>. He had something of the look of a masked bravo waiting sword in hand for his foe .</p>
    <p n="54">He made a sort of doubtful salute , which<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>somewhat more formally returned .</p>
    <p n="55"><said who="#Gregory">“ I was waiting for you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>.<said who="#Gregory">“ Might I have a moment 's conversation ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="56"><said who="#Syme">“ Certainly . About what ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>in a sort of weak wonder .</p>
    <p n="57"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>struck out with his stick at the lamp-post , and then at the tree .<said who="#Gregory">“ About this and this , ”</said>he cried ;<said who="#Gregory">“ about order and anarchy . There is your precious order , that lean , iron lamp , ugly and barren ; and there is anarchy , rich , living , reproducing itself — there is anarchy , splendid in green and gold . ”</said></p>
    <p n="58"><said who="#Syme">“ All the same , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>patiently ,<said who="#Syme">“ just at present you only see the tree by the light of the lamp . I wonder when you would ever see the lamp by the light of the tree . ”</said>Then after a pause he said ,<said who="#Syme">“ But may I ask if you have been standing out here in the dark only to resume our little argument ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="59"><said who="#Gregory">“ No , ”</said>cried out<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, in a voice that rang down the street ,<said who="#Gregory">“ I did not stand here to resume our argument , but to end it for ever . ”</said></p>
    <p n="60">The silence fell again , and<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, though he understood nothing , listened instinctively for something serious .<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>began in a smooth voice and with a rather bewildering smile .</p>
    <p n="61"><said who="#Gregory">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Syme">Mr. Syme</persName>, ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Gregory">“ this evening you succeeded in doing something rather remarkable . You did something to me that no man born of woman has ever succeeded in doing before . ”</said></p>
    <p n="62"><said who="#Mr._Syme">“ Indeed ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="63"><said who="#Gregory">“ Now I remember , ”</said>resumed<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>reflectively ,<said who="#Gregory">“ one other person succeeded in doing it . The captain of a penny steamer ( if I remember correctly ) at Southend . You have irritated me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="64"><said who="#Syme">“ I am very sorry , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with gravity .</p>
    <p n="65"><said who="#Gregory">“ I am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped out even with an apology , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>very calmly .<said who="#Gregory">“ No duel could wipe it out . If I struck you dead I could not wipe it out . There is only one way by which that insult can be erased , and that way I choose . I am going , at the possible sacrifice of my life and honour , to prove to you that you were wrong in what you said . ”</said></p>
    <p n="66"><said who="#Syme">“ In what I said ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="67"><said who="#Gregory">“ You said I was not serious about being an anarchist . ”</said></p>
    <p n="68"><said who="#Syme">“ There are degrees of seriousness , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ I have never doubted that you were perfectly sincere in this sense , that you thought what you said well worth saying , that you thought a paradox might wake men up to a neglected truth . ”</said></p>
    <p n="69"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>stared at him steadily and painfully .</p>
    <p n="70"><said who="#Gregory">“ And in no other sense , ”</said>he asked ,<said who="#Gregory">“ you think me serious ? You think me a flaneur who lets fall occasional truths . You do not think that in a deeper , a more deadly sense , I am serious . ”</said></p>
    <p n="71"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>struck his stick violently on the stones of the road .</p>
    <p n="72"><said who="#Syme">“ Serious ! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Syme">“ Good Lord ! is this street serious ? Are these damned Chinese lanterns serious ? Is the whole caboodle serious ? One comes here and talks a pack of bosh , and perhaps some sense as well , but I should think very little of a man who did n't keep something in the background of his life that was more serious than all this talking — something more serious , whether it was religion or only drink . ”</said></p>
    <p n="73"><said who="#Gregory">“ Very well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, his face darkening ,<said who="#Gregory">“ you shall see something more serious than either drink or religion . ”</said></p>
    <p n="74"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>stood waiting with his usual air of mildness until<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>again opened his lips .</p>
    <p n="75"><said who="#Gregory">“ You spoke just now of having a religion . Is it really true that you have one ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="76"><said who="#Syme">“ Oh , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with a beaming smile ,<said who="#Syme">“ we are all Catholics now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="77"><said who="#Gregory">“ Then may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your religion involves that you will not reveal what I am now going to tell you to any son of Adam , and especially not to the police ? Will you swear that ! If you will take upon yourself this awful abnegation if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow that you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream about , I will promise you in return — ”</said></p>
    <p n="78"><said who="#Syme">“ You will promise me in return ? ”</said>inquired<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, as the other paused .</p>
    <p n="79"><said who="#Syme">“ I will promise you a very entertaining evening . ”</said><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>suddenly took off his hat .</p>
    <p n="80"><said who="#Gregory">“ Your offer , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Gregory">“ is far too idiotic to be declined . You say that a poet is always an anarchist . I disagree ; but I hope at least that he is always a sportsman . Permit me , here and now , to swear as a Christian , and promise as a good comrade and a fellow-artist , that I will not report anything of this , whatever it is , to the police . And now , in the name of Colney Hatch , what is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="81"><said who="#Gregory">“ I think , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, with placid irrelevancy ,<said who="#Gregory">“ that we will call a cab . ”</said></p>
    <p n="82">He gave two long whistles , and a hansom came rattling down the road . The two got into it in silence .<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>gave through the trap the address of an obscure public-house on the Chiswick bank of the river . The cab whisked itself away again , and in it these two fantastics quitted their fantastic town .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="2">
    <p n="83">THE cab pulled up before a particularly dreary and greasy beershop , into which<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>rapidly conducted his companion . They seated themselves in a close and dim sort of bar-parlour , at a stained wooden table with one wooden leg . The room was so small and dark , that very little could be seen of the attendant who was summoned , beyond a vague and dark impression of something bulky and bearded .</p>
    <p n="84"><said who="#Gregory">“ Will you take a little supper ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>politely .<said who="#Gregory">“ The pate de foie gras is not good here , but I can recommend the game . ”</said></p>
    <p n="85"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>received the remark with stolidity , imagining it to be a joke . Accepting the vein of humour , he said , with a well-bred indifference —</p>
    <p n="86"><said who="#Syme">“ Oh , bring me some lobster mayonnaise . ”</said></p>
    <p n="87">To his indescribable astonishment , the man only said “ Certainly , sir ! ” and went away apparently to get it .</p>
    <p n="88"><said who="#Gregory">“ What will you drink ? ”</said>resumed<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, with the same careless yet apologetic air .<said who="#Gregory">“ I shall only have a crepe de menthe myself ; I have dined . But the champagne can really be trusted . Do let me start you with a half-bottle of Pommery at least ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="89"><said who="#Syme">“ Thank you ! ”</said>said the motionless<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ You are very good . ”</said></p>
    <p n="90">His further attempts at conversation , somewhat disorganised in themselves , were cut short finally as by a thunderbolt by the actual appearance of the lobster .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>tasted it , and found it particularly good . Then he suddenly began to eat with great rapidity and appetite .</p>
    <p n="91"><said who="#Syme">“ Excuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously ! ”</said>he said to<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, smiling .<said who="#Syme">“ I do n't often have the luck to have a dream like this . It is new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster . It is commonly the other way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="92"><said who="#Gregory">“ You are not asleep , I assure you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>.<said who="#Gregory">“ You are , on the contrary , close to the most actual and rousing moment of your existence . Ah , here comes your champagne ! I admit that there may be a slight disproportion , let us say , between the inner arrangements of this excellent hotel and its simple and unpretentious exterior . But that is all our modesty . We are the most modest men that ever lived on earth . ”</said></p>
    <p n="93"><said who="#Syme">“ And who are we ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, emptying his champagne glass .</p>
    <p n="94"><said who="#Gregory">“ It is quite simple , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>.<said who="#Gregory">“ We are the serious anarchists , in whom you do not believe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="95"><said who="#Syme">“ Oh ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>shortly .<said who="#Syme">“ You do yourselves well in drinks . ”</said></p>
    <p n="96"><said who="#Gregory">“ Yes , we are serious about everything , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>.</p>
    <p n="97">Then after a pause he added —</p>
    <p n="98"><said who="#Gregory">“ If in a few moments this table begins to turn round a little , do n't put it down to your inroads into the champagne . I do n't wish you to do yourself an injustice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="99"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , if I am not drunk , I am mad , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with perfect calm ;<said who="#Syme">“ but I trust I can behave like a gentleman in either condition . May I smoke ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="100"><said who="#Gregory">“ Certainly ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, producing a cigar-case .<said who="#Gregory">“ Try one of mine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="101"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>took the cigar , clipped the end off with a cigar-cutter out of his waistcoat pocket , put it in his mouth , lit it slowly , and let out a long cloud of smoke . It is not a little to his credit that he performed these rites with so much composure , for almost before he had begun them the table at which he sat had begun to revolve , first slowly , and then rapidly , as if at an insane seance .</p>
    <p n="102"><said who="#Gregory">“ You must not mind it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>;<said who="#Gregory">“ it 's a kind of screw . ”</said></p>
    <p n="103"><said who="#Syme">“ Quite so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>placidly ,<said who="#Syme">“ a kind of screw . How simple that is ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="104">The next moment the smoke of his cigar , which had been wavering across the room in snaky twists , went straight up as if from a factory chimney , and the two , with their chairs and table , shot down through the floor as if the earth had swallowed them . They went rattling down a kind of roaring chimney as rapidly as a lift cut loose , and they came with an abrupt bump to the bottom . But when<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>threw open a pair of doors and let in a red subterranean light ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was still smoking with one leg thrown over the other , and had not turned a yellow hair .</p>
    <p n="105"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>led him down a low , vaulted passage , at the end of which was the red light . It was an enormous crimson lantern , nearly as big as a fireplace , fixed over a small but heavy iron door . In the door there was a sort of hatchway or grating , and on this<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>struck five times . A heavy voice with a foreign accent asked him who he was . To this he gave the more or less unexpected reply ,<said who="#Gregory">“ Mr. Joseph Chamberlain . ”</said>The heavy hinges began to move ; it was obviously some kind of password .</p>
    <p n="106">Inside the doorway the passage gleamed as if it were lined with a network of steel . On a second glance ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>saw that the glittering pattern was really made up of ranks and ranks of rifles and revolvers , closely packed or interlocked .</p>
    <p n="107"><said who="#Gregory">“ I must ask you to forgive me all these formalities , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>;<said who="#Gregory">“ we have to be very strict here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="108"><said who="#Syme">“ Oh , do n't apologise , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ I know your passion for law and order , ”</said>and he stepped into the passage lined with the steel weapons . With his long , fair hair and rather foppish frock-coat , he looked a singularly frail and fanciful figure as he walked down that shining avenue of death .</p>
    <p n="109">They passed through several such passages , and came out at last into a queer steel chamber with curved walls , almost spherical in shape , but presenting , with its tiers of benches , something of the appearance of a scientific lecture-theatre . There were no rifles or pistols in this apartment , but round the walls of it were hung more dubious and dreadful shapes , things that looked like the bulbs of iron plants , or the eggs of iron birds . They were bombs , and the very room itself seemed like the inside of a bomb .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>knocked his cigar ash off against the wall , and went in .</p>
    <p n="110"><said who="#Gregory">“ And now , my dear<persName corresp="#Mr._Syme">Mr. Syme</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, throwing himself in an expansive manner on the bench under the largest bomb ,<said who="#Gregory">“ now we are quite cosy , so let us talk properly . Now no human words can give you any notion of why I brought you here . It was one of those quite arbitrary emotions , like jumping off a cliff or falling in love . Suffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly irritating fellow , and , to do you justice , you are still . I would break twenty oaths of secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down a peg . That way you have of lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal of confession . Well , you said that you were quite certain I was not a serious anarchist . Does this place strike you as being serious ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="111"><said who="#Syme">“ It does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety , ”</said>assented<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>;<said who="#Syme">“ but may I ask you two questions ? You need not fear to give me information , because , as you remember , you very wisely extorted from me a promise not to tell the police , a promise I shall certainly keep . So it is in mere curiosity that I make my queries . First of all , what is it really all about ? What is it you object to ? You want to abolish Government ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="112"><said who="#Gregory">“ To abolish God ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, opening the eyes of a fanatic .<said who="#Gregory">“ We do not only want to upset a few despotisms and police regulations ; that sort of anarchism does exist , but it is a mere branch of the Nonconformists . We dig deeper and we blow you higher . We wish to deny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and virtue , honour and treachery , upon which mere rebels base themselves . The silly sentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights of Man ! We hate Rights as we hate Wrongs . We have abolished Right and Wrong . ”</said></p>
    <p n="113"><said who="#Syme">“ And Right and Left , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with a simple eagerness ,<said who="#Syme">“ I hope you will abolish them too . They are much more troublesome to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="114"><said who="#Gregory">“ You spoke of a second question , ”</said>snapped<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>.</p>
    <p n="115"><said who="#Syme">“ With pleasure , ”</said>resumed<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ In all your present acts and surroundings there is a scientific attempt at secrecy . I have an aunt who lived over a shop , but this is the first time I have found people living from preference under a public-house . You have a heavy iron door . You cannot pass it without submitting to the humiliation of calling yourself Mr. Chamberlain . You surround yourself with steel instruments which make the place , if I may say so , more impressive than homelike . May I ask why , after taking all this trouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earth , you then parade your whole secret by talking about anarchism to every silly woman in Saffron Park ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="116"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>smiled .</p>
    <p n="117"><said who="#Gregory">“ The answer is simple , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Gregory">“ I told you I was a serious anarchist , and you did not believe me . Nor do they believe me . Unless I took them into this infernal room they would not believe me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="118"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>smoked thoughtfully , and looked at him with interest .<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>went on .</p>
    <p n="119"><said who="#Gregory">“ The history of the thing might amuse you , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Gregory">“ When first I became one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable disguises . I dressed up as a bishop . I read up all about bishops in our anarchist pamphlets , in Superstition the Vampire and Priests of Prey . I certainly understood from them that bishops are strange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind . I was misinformed . When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters in a drawing-room I cried out in a voice of thunder , ‘ Down ! down ! presumptuous human reason ! ’ they found out in some way that I was not a bishop at all . I was nabbed at once . Then I made up as a millionaire ; but I defended Capital with so much intelligence that a fool could see that I was quite poor . Then I tried being a major . Now I am a humanitarian myself , but I have , I hope , enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who , like Nietzsche , admire violence — the proud , mad war of<persName>Nature</persName>and all that , you know . I threw myself into the major . I drew my sword and waved it constantly . I called out ‘ Blood ! ’ abstractedly , like a man calling for wine . I often said , ‘ Let the weak perish ; it is the Law . ’ Well , well , it seems majors do n't do this . I was nabbed again . At last I went in despair to<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>of the Central Anarchist Council , who is the greatest man in Europe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="120"><said who="#Syme">“ What is his name ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="121"><said who="#Gregory">“ You would not know it , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>.<said who="#Gregory">“ That is his greatness . Caesar and Napoleon put all their genius into being heard of , and they were heard of . He puts all his genius into not being heard of , and he is not heard of . But you cannot be for five minutes in the room with him without feeling that Caesar and Napoleon would have been children in his hands . ”</said></p>
    <p n="122">He was silent and even pale for a moment , and then resumed —</p>
    <p n="123"><said who="#Gregory">“ But whenever he gives advice it is always something as startling as an epigram , and yet as practical as the Bank of England . I said to him , ‘ What disguise will hide me from the world ? What can I find more respectable than bishops and majors ? ’ He looked at me with his large but indecipherable face . ‘ You want a safe disguise , do you ? You want a dress which will guarantee you harmless ; a dress in which no one would ever look for a bomb ? ’ I nodded . He suddenly lifted his lion 's voice . ‘ Why , then , dress up as an anarchist , you fool ! ’ he roared so that the room shook . ‘ Nobody will ever expect you to do anything dangerous then . ’ And he turned his broad back on me without another word . I took his advice , and have never regretted it . I preached blood and murder to those women day and night , and — by God !— they would let me wheel their perambulators . ”</said></p>
    <p n="124"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>sat watching him with some respect in his large , blue eyes .</p>
    <p n="125"><said who="#Gregory">“ You took me in , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Gregory">“ It is really a smart dodge . ”</said></p>
    <p n="126">Then after a pause he added —</p>
    <p n="127"><said who="#Syme">“ What do you call this tremendous President of yours ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="128"><said who="#Gregory">“ We generally call him Sunday , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>with simplicity .<said who="#Gregory">“ You see , there are seven members of the Central Anarchist Council , and they are named after days of the week . He is called Sunday , by some of his admirers Bloody Sunday . It is curious you should mention the matter , because the very night you have dropped in ( if I may so express it ) is the night on which our London branch , which assembles in this room , has to elect its own deputy to fill a vacancy in the Council . The gentleman who has for some time past played , with propriety and general applause , the difficult part of Thursday , has died quite suddenly . Consequently , we have called a meeting this very evening to elect a successor . ”</said></p>
    <p n="129">He got to his feet and strolled across the room with a sort of smiling embarrassment .</p>
    <p n="130"><said who="#Gregory">“ I feel somehow as if you were my mother ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, ”</said>he continued casually .<said who="#Gregory">“ I feel that I can confide anything to you , as you have promised to tell nobody . In fact , I will confide to you something that I would not say in so many words to the anarchists who will be coming to the room in about ten minutes . We shall , of course , go through a form of election ; but I do n't mind telling you that it is practically certain what the result will be . ”</said>He looked down for a moment modestly .<said who="#Gregory">“ It is almost a settled thing that I am to be Thursday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="131"><said who="#Syme">“ My dear fellow . ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>heartily ,<said who="#Syme">“ I congratulate you . A great career ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="132"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>smiled in deprecation , and walked across the room , talking rapidly .</p>
    <p n="133"><said who="#Gregory">“ As a matter of fact , everything is ready for me on this table , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Gregory">“ and the ceremony will probably be the shortest possible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="134"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>also strolled across to the table , and found lying across it a walking-stick , which turned out on examination to be a sword-stick , a large Colt 's revolver , a sandwich case , and a formidable flask of brandy . Over the chair , beside the table , was thrown a heavy-looking cape or cloak .</p>
    <p n="135"><said who="#Gregory">“ I have only to get the form of election finished , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>with animation ,<said who="#Gregory">“ then I snatch up this cloak and stick , stuff these other things into my pocket , step out of a door in this cavern , which opens on the river , where there is a steam-tug already waiting for me , and then — then — oh , the wild joy of being Thursday ! ”</said>And he clasped his hands .</p>
    <p n="136"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor , got to his feet with an unusual air of hesitation .</p>
    <p n="137"><said who="#Gregory">“ Why is it , ”</said>he asked vaguely ,<said who="#Syme">“ that I think you are quite a decent fellow ? Why do I positively like you ,<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>? ”</said>He paused a moment , and then added with a sort of fresh curiosity ,<said who="#Syme">“ Is it because you are such an ass ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="138">There was a thoughtful silence again , and then he cried out —</p>
    <p n="139"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , damn it all ! this is the funniest situation I have ever been in in my life , and I am going to act accordingly .<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, I gave you a promise before I came into this place . That promise I would keep under red-hot pincers . Would you give me , for my own safety , a little promise of the same kind ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="140"><said who="#Gregory">“ A promise ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, wondering .</p>
    <p n="141"><said who="#Syme">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>very seriously ,<said who="#Syme">“ a promise . I swore before God that I would not tell your secret to the police . Will you swear by Humanity , or whatever beastly thing you believe in , that you will not tell my secret to the anarchists ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="142"><said who="#Gregory">“ Your secret ? ”</said>asked the staring<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>.<said who="#Gregory">“ Have you got a secret ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="143"><said who="#Syme">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ I have a secret . ”</said>Then after a pause ,<said who="#Syme">“ Will you swear ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="144"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>glared at him gravely for a few moments , and then said abruptly —</p>
    <p n="145"><said who="#Gregory">“ You must have bewitched me , but I feel a furious curiosity about you . Yes , I will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell me . But look sharp , for they will be here in a couple of minutes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="146"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>rose slowly to his feet and thrust his long , white hands into his long , grey trousers ’ pockets . Almost as he did so there came five knocks on the outer grating , proclaiming the arrival of the first of the conspirators .</p>
    <p n="147"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>slowly ,<said who="#Syme">“ I do n't know how to tell you the truth more shortly than by saying that your expedient of dressing up as an aimless poet is not confined to you or your President . We have known the dodge for some time at Scotland Yard . ”</said></p>
    <p n="148"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>tried to spring up straight , but he swayed thrice .</p>
    <p n="149"><said who="#Gregory">“ What do you say ? ”</said>he asked in an inhuman voice .</p>
    <p n="150"><said who="#Syme">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>simply ,<said who="#Syme">“ I am a police detective . But I think I hear your friends coming . ”</said></p>
    <p n="151">From the doorway there came a murmur of “ Mr. Joseph Chamberlain . ” It was repeated twice and thrice , and then thirty times , and the crowd of Joseph Chamberlains ( a solemn thought ) could be heard trampling down the corridor .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="3">
    <p n="152">BEFORE one of the fresh faces could appear at the doorway ,<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>'s stunned surprise had fallen from him . He was beside the table with a bound , and a noise in his throat like a wild beast . He caught up the Colt 's revolver and took aim at<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>did not flinch , but he put up a pale and polite hand .</p>
    <p n="153"><said who="#Gregory">“ Do n't be such a silly man , ”</said>he said , with the effeminate dignity of a curate .<said who="#Gregory">“ Do n't you see it 's not necessary ? Do n't you see that we 're both in the same boat ? Yes , and jolly sea-sick . ”</said></p>
    <p n="154"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>could not speak , but he could not fire either , and he looked his question .</p>
    <p n="155"><said who="#Syme">“ Do n't you see we 've checkmated each other ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ I can n't tell the police you are an anarchist . You can n't tell the anarchists I 'm a policeman . I can only watch you , knowing what you are ; you can only watch me , knowing what I am . In short , it 's a lonely , intellectual duel , my head against yours . I 'm a policeman deprived of the help of the police . You , my poor fellow , are an anarchist deprived of the help of that law and organisation which is so essential to anarchy . The one solitary difference is in your favour . You are not surrounded by inquisitive policemen ; I am surrounded by inquisitive anarchists . I cannot betray you , but I might betray myself . Come , come ! wait and see me betray myself . I shall do it so nicely . ”</said></p>
    <p n="156"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>put the pistol slowly down , still staring at<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>as if he were a sea-monster .</p>
    <p n="157"><said who="#Gregory">“ I do n't believe in immortality , ”</said>he said at last ,<said who="#Gregory">“ but if , after all this , you were to break your word , God would make a hell only for you , to howl in for ever . ”</said></p>
    <p n="158"><said who="#Syme">“ I shall not break my word , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>sternly ,<said who="#Syme">“ nor will you break yours . Here are your friends . ”</said></p>
    <p n="159">The mass of the anarchists entered the room heavily , with a slouching and somewhat weary gait ; but one little man , with a black beard and glasses — a man somewhat of the type of Mr. Tim Healy — detached himself , and bustled forward with some papers in his hand .</p>
    <p n="160"><said who="#Gregory">“<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>, ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Gregory">“ I suppose this man is a delegate ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="161"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, taken by surprise , looked down and muttered the name of<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>; but<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>replied almost pertly —</p>
    <p n="162"><said who="#Syme">“ I am glad to see that your gate is well enough guarded to make it hard for anyone to be here who was not a delegate . ”</said></p>
    <p n="163">The brow of the little man with the black beard was , however , still contracted with something like suspicion .</p>
    <p n="164"><said who="#Syme">“ What branch do you represent ? ”</said>he asked sharply .</p>
    <p n="165"><said who="#Syme">“ I should hardly call it a branch , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, laughing ;<said who="#Syme">“ I should call it at the very least a root . ”</said></p>
    <p n="166"><said who="#Gregory">“ What do you mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="167"><said who="#Syme">“ The fact is , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>serenely ,<said who="#Syme">“ the truth is I am a Sabbatarian . I have been specially sent here to see that you show a due observance of Sunday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="168">The little man dropped one of his papers , and a flicker of fear went over all the faces of the group . Evidently the awful President , whose name was Sunday , did sometimes send down such irregular ambassadors to such branch meetings .</p>
    <p n="169"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , comrade , ”</said>said the man with the papers after a pause ,<said who="#Syme">“ I suppose we 'd better give you a seat in the meeting ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="170"><said who="#Syme">“ If you ask my advice as a friend , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with severe benevolence ,<said who="#Syme">“ I think you 'd better . ”</said></p>
    <p n="171">When<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>heard the dangerous dialogue end , with a sudden safety for his rival , he rose abruptly and paced the floor in painful thought . He was , indeed , in an agony of diplomacy . It was clear that<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s inspired impudence was likely to bring him out of all merely accidental dilemmas . Little was to be hoped from them . He could not himself betray<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, partly from honour , but partly also because , if he betrayed him and for some reason failed to destroy him , the<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>who escaped would be a<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>freed from all obligation of secrecy , a<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>who would simply walk to the nearest police station . After all , it was only one night 's discussion , and only one detective who would know of it . He would let out as little as possible of their plans that night , and then let<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>go , and chance it .</p>
    <p n="172">He strode across to the group of anarchists , which was already distributing itself along the benches .</p>
    <p n="173"><said who="#Gregory">“ I think it is time we began , ”</said>he said ;<said who="#Gregory">“ the steam-tug is waiting on the river already . I move that Comrade Buttons takes the chair . ”</said></p>
    <p n="174">This being approved by a show of hands , the little man with the papers slipped into the presidential seat .</p>
    <p n="175"><said who="#Gregory">“ Comrades , ”</said>he began , as sharp as a pistol-shot ,<said who="#Gregory">“ our meeting tonight is important , though it need not be long . This branch has always had the honour of electing Thursdays for the Central European Council . We have elected many and splendid Thursdays . We all lament the sad decease of the heroic worker who occupied the post until last week . As you know , his services to the cause were considerable . He organised the great dynamite coup of Brighton which , under happier circumstances , ought to have killed everybody on the pier . As you also know , his death was as self-denying as his life , for he died through his faith in a hygienic mixture of chalk and water as a substitute for milk , which beverage he regarded as barbaric , and as involving cruelty to the cow . Cruelty , or anything approaching to cruelty , revolted him always . But it is not to acclaim his virtues that we are met , but for a harder task . It is difficult properly to praise his qualities , but it is more difficult to replace them . Upon you , comrades , it devolves this evening to choose out of the company present the man who shall be Thursday . If any comrade suggests a name I will put it to the vote . If no comrade suggests a name , I can only tell myself that that dear dynamiter , who is gone from us , has carried into the unknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his innocence . ”</said></p>
    <p n="176">There was a stir of almost inaudible applause , such as is sometimes heard in church . Then a large old man , with a long and venerable white beard , perhaps the only real working-man present , rose lumberingly and said —</p>
    <p n="177"><said who="#Syme">“ I move that<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>be elected Thursday , ”</said>and sat lumberingly down again .</p>
    <p n="178"><said who="#Gregory">“ Does anyone second ? ”</said>asked the chairman .</p>
    <p n="179">A little man with a velvet coat and pointed beard seconded .</p>
    <p n="180"><said who="#Syme">“ Before I put the matter to the vote , ”</said>said the chairman ,<said who="#Syme">“ I will call on<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>to make a statement . ”</said></p>
    <p n="181"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>rose amid a great rumble of applause . His face was deadly pale , so that by contrast his queer red hair looked almost scarlet . But he was smiling and altogether at ease . He had made up his mind , and he saw his best policy quite plain in front of him like a white road . His best chance was to make a softened and ambiguous speech , such as would leave on the detective 's mind the impression that the anarchist brotherhood was a very mild affair after all . He believed in his own literary power , his capacity for suggesting fine shades and picking perfect words . He thought that with care he could succeed , in spite of all the people around him , in conveying an impression of the institution , subtly and delicately false .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had once thought that anarchists , under all their bravado , were only playing the fool . Could he not now , in the hour of peril , make<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>think so again ?</p>
    <p n="182"><said who="#Gregory">“ Comrades , ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, in a low but penetrating voice ,<said who="#Gregory">“ it is not necessary for me to tell you what is my policy , for it is your policy also . Our belief has been slandered , it has been disfigured , it has been utterly confused and concealed , but it has never been altered . Those who talk about anarchism and its dangers go everywhere and anywhere to get their information , except to us , except to the fountain head . They learn about anarchists from sixpenny novels ; they learn about anarchists from tradesmen 's newspapers ; they learn about anarchists from Ally Sloper 's Half-Holiday and the Sporting Times . They never learn about anarchists from anarchists . We have no chance of denying the mountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from one end of Europe to another . The man who has always heard that we are walking plagues has never heard our reply . I know that he will not hear it tonight , though my passion were to rend the roof . For it is deep , deep under the earth that the persecuted are permitted to assemble , as the Christians assembled in the Catacombs . But if , by some incredible accident , there were here tonight a man who all his life had thus immensely misunderstood us , I would put this question to him : ‘ When those Christians met in those Catacombs , what sort of moral reputation had they in the streets above ? What tales were told of their atrocities by one educated Roman to another ? Suppose ’ ( I would say to him ) , ‘ suppose that we are only repeating that still mysterious paradox of history . Suppose we seem as shocking as the Christians because we are really as harmless as the Christians . Suppose we seem as mad as the Christians because we are really as meek . " ’</said></p>
    <p n="183">The applause that had greeted the opening sentences had been gradually growing fainter , and at the last word it stopped suddenly . In the abrupt silence , the man with the velvet jacket said , in a high , squeaky voice —</p>
    <p n="184"><said who="#Gregory">“ I 'm not meek ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="185"><said who="#Gregory">“ Comrade<persName corresp="#Witherspoon">Witherspoon</persName>tells us , ”</said>resumed<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>,<said who="#Gregory">“ that he is not meek . Ah , how little he knows himself ! His words are , indeed , extravagant ; his appearance is ferocious , and even ( to an ordinary taste ) unattractive . But only the eye of a friendship as deep and delicate as mine can perceive the deep foundation of solid meekness which lies at the base of him , too deep even for himself to see . I repeat , we are the true early Christians , only that we come too late . We are simple , as they revere simple — look at Comrade<persName corresp="#Witherspoon">Witherspoon</persName>. We are modest , as they were modest — look at me . We are merciful — ”</said></p>
    <p n="186"><said who="#Witherspoon">“ No , no ! ”</said>called out Mr.<persName corresp="#Witherspoon">Witherspoon</persName>with the velvet jacket .</p>
    <p n="187"><said who="#Gregory">“ I say we are merciful , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>furiously ,<said who="#Gregory">“ as the early Christians were merciful . Yet this did not prevent their being accused of eating human flesh . We do not eat human flesh — ”</said></p>
    <p n="188"><said who="#Witherspoon">“ Shame ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Witherspoon">Witherspoon</persName>.<said who="#Witherspoon">“ Why not ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="189"><said who="#Gregory">“ Comrade<persName corresp="#Witherspoon">Witherspoon</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, with a feverish gaiety ,<said who="#Gregory">“ is anxious to know why nobody eats him ( laughter ) . In our society , at any rate , which loves him sincerely , which is founded upon love — ”</said></p>
    <p n="190"><said who="#Witherspoon">“ No , no ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Witherspoon">Witherspoon</persName>,<said who="#Witherspoon">“ down with love . ”</said></p>
    <p n="191"><said who="#Gregory">“ Which is founded upon love , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, grinding his teeth ,<said who="#Gregory">“ there will be no difficulty about the aims which we shall pursue as a body , or which I should pursue were I chosen as the representative of that body . Superbly careless of the slanders that represent us as assassins and enemies of human society , we shall pursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure , the permanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity . ”</said></p>
    <p n="192"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>resumed his seat and passed his hand across his forehead . The silence was sudden and awkward , but the chairman rose like an automaton , and said in a colourless voice —</p>
    <p n="193"><said who="#Gregory">“ Does anyone oppose the election of<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="194">The assembly seemed vague and sub-consciously disappointed , and Comrade<persName corresp="#Witherspoon">Witherspoon</persName>moved restlessly on his seat and muttered in his thick beard . By the sheer rush of routine , however , the motion would have been put and carried . But as the chairman was opening his mouth to put it ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>sprang to his feet and said in a small and quiet voice —</p>
    <p n="195"><said who="#Syme">“ Yes , Mr. Chairman , I oppose . ”</said></p>
    <p n="196">The most effective fact in oratory is an unexpected change in the voice . Mr.<persName corresp="#Gabriel_Syme">Gabriel Syme</persName>evidently understood oratory . Having said these first formal words in a moderated tone and with a brief simplicity , he made his next word ring and volley in the vault as if one of the guns had gone off .</p>
    <p n="197"><said who="#Gabriel_Syme">“ Comrades ! ”</said>he cried , in a voice that made every man jump out of his boots ,<said who="#Gabriel_Syme">“ have we come here for this ? Do we live underground like rats in order to listen to talk like this ? This is talk we might listen to while eating buns at a Sunday School treat . Do we line these walls with weapons and bar that door with death lest anyone should come and hear<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>saying to us , ‘ Be good , and you will be happy , ’ ‘ Honesty is the best policy , ’ and ‘ Virtue is its own reward ’ ? There was not a word in<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>'s address to which a curate could not have listened with pleasure ( hear , hear ) . But I am not a curate ( loud cheers ) , and I did not listen to it with pleasure ( renewed cheers ) . The man who is fitted to make a good curate is not fitted to make a resolute , forcible , and efficient Thursday ( hear , hear ) . ”</said></p>
    <p n="198"><said who="#Syme">“<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>has told us , in only too apologetic a tone , that we are not the enemies of society . But I say that we are the enemies of society , and so much the worse for society . We are the enemies of society , for society is the enemy of humanity , its oldest and its most pitiless enemy ( hear , hear ) .<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>has told us ( apologetically again ) that we are not murderers . There I agree . We are not murderers , we are executioners ( cheers ) . ”</said></p>
    <p n="199">Ever since<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had risen<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>had sat staring at him , his face idiotic with astonishment . Now in the pause his lips of clay parted , and he said , with an automatic and lifeless distinctness —</p>
    <p n="200"><said who="#Gregory">“ You damnable hypocrite ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="201"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>looked straight into those frightful eyes with his own pale blue ones , and said with dignity —</p>
    <p n="202"><said who="#Syme">“<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>accuses me of hypocrisy . He knows as well as I do that I am keeping all my engagements and doing nothing but my duty . I do not mince words . I do not pretend to . I say that<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>is unfit to be Thursday for all his amiable qualities . He is unfit to be Thursday because of his amiable qualities . We do not want the Supreme Council of Anarchy infected with a maudlin mercy ( hear , hear ) . This is no time for ceremonial politeness , neither is it a time for ceremonial modesty . I set myself against<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>as I would set myself against all the Governments of Europe , because the anarchist who has given himself to anarchy has forgotten modesty as much as he has forgotten pride ( cheers ) . I am not a man at all . I am a cause ( renewed cheers ) . I set myself against<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>as impersonally and as calmly as I should choose one pistol rather than another out of that rack upon the wall ; and I say that rather than have<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>and his milk-and-water methods on the Supreme Council , I would offer myself for election — ”</said></p>
    <p n="203">His sentence was drowned in a deafening cataract of applause . The faces , that had grown fiercer and fiercer with approval as his tirade grew more and more uncompromising , were now distorted with grins of anticipation or cloven with delighted cries . At the moment when he announced himself as ready to stand for the post of Thursday , a roar of excitement and assent broke forth , and became uncontrollable , and at the same moment<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>sprang to his feet , with foam upon his mouth , and shouted against the shouting .</p>
    <p n="204"><said who="#Gregory">“ Stop , you blasted madmen ! ”</said>he cried , at the top of a voice that tore his throat .<said who="#Gregory">“ Stop , you — ”</said></p>
    <p n="205">But louder than<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>'s shouting and louder than the roar of the room came the voice of<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, still speaking in a peal of pitiless thunder —</p>
    <p n="206"><said who="#Syme">“ I do not go to the Council to rebut that slander that calls us murderers ; I go to earn it ( loud and prolonged cheering ) . To the priest who says these men are the enemies of religion , to the judge who says these men are the enemies of law , to the fat parliamentarian who says these men are the enemies of order and public decency , to all these I will reply , ‘ You are false kings , but you are true prophets . I am come to destroy you , and to fulfil your prophecies . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="207">The heavy clamour gradually died away , but before it had ceased<persName corresp="#Witherspoon">Witherspoon</persName>had jumped to his feet , his hair and beard all on end , and had said —</p>
    <p n="208"><said who="#Witherspoon">“ I move , as an amendment , that<persName>Comrade Syme</persName>be appointed to the post . ”</said></p>
    <p n="209"><said who="#Gregory">“ Stop all this , I tell you ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, with frantic face and hands .<said who="#Gregory">“ Stop it , it is all — ”</said></p>
    <p n="210">The voice of the chairman clove his speech with a cold accent .</p>
    <p n="211"><said who="#Gregory">“ Does anyone second this amendment ? ”</said>he said . A tall , tired man , with melancholy eyes and an American chin beard , was observed on the back bench to be slowly rising to his feet .<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>had been screaming for some time past ; now there was a change in his accent , more shocking than any scream .<said who="#Gregory">“ I end all this ! ”</said>he said , in a voice as heavy as stone .</p>
    <p n="212"><said who="#Witherspoon">“ This man cannot be elected . He is a — ”</said></p>
    <p n="213"><said who="#Syme">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, quite motionless ,<said who="#Syme">“ what is he ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>'s mouth worked twice without sound ; then slowly the blood began to crawl back into his dead face .<said who="#Syme">“ He is a man quite inexperienced in our work , ”</said>he said , and sat down abruptly .</p>
    <p n="214">Before he had done so , the long , lean man with the American beard was again upon his feet , and was repeating in a high American monotone —</p>
    <p n="215"><said who="#Gregory">“ I beg to second the election of<persName>Comrade Syme</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="216"><said who="#Syme">“ The amendment will , as usual , be put first , ”</said>said Mr. Buttons , the chairman , with mechanical rapidity .</p>
    <p n="217"><said who="#Gregory">“ The question is that<persName>Comrade Syme</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="218"><persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>had again sprung to his feet , panting and passionate .</p>
    <p n="219"><said who="#Gregory">“ Comrades , ”</said>he cried out ,<said who="#Gregory">“ I am not a madman . ”</said></p>
    <p n="220"><said who="#Witherspoon">“ Oh , oh ! ”</said>said Mr.<persName corresp="#Witherspoon">Witherspoon</persName>.</p>
    <p n="221"><said who="#Gregory">“ I am not a madman , ”</said>reiterated<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, with a frightful sincerity which for a moment staggered the room ,<said who="#Gregory">“ but I give you a counsel which you can call mad if you like . No , I will not call it a counsel , for I can give you no reason for it . I will call it a command . Call it a mad command , but act upon it . Strike , but hear me ! Kill me , but obey me ! Do not elect this man . ”</said>Truth is so terrible , even in fetters , that for a moment<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s slender and insane victory swayed like a reed . But you could not have guessed it from<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s bleak blue eyes . He merely began —</p>
    <p n="222"><said who="#Syme">“<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>commands — ”</said></p>
    <p n="223">Then the spell was snapped , and one anarchist called out to<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>—</p>
    <p n="224"><said who="#Syme">“ Who are you ? You are not Sunday ; ”</said>and another anarchist added in a heavier voice ,<said who="#Syme">“ And you are not Thursday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="225"><said who="#Gregory">“ Comrades , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, in a voice like that of a martyr who in an ecstacy of pain has passed beyond pain ,<said who="#Gregory">“ it is nothing to me whether you detest me as a tyrant or detest me as a slave . If you will not take my command , accept my degradation . I kneel to you . I throw myself at your feet . I implore you . Do not elect this man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="226"><said who="#Syme">“<persName>Comrade Gregory</persName>, ”</said>said the chairman after a painful pause ,<said who="#Syme">“ this is really not quite dignified . ”</said></p>
    <p n="227">For the first time in the proceedings there was for a few seconds a real silence . Then<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>fell back in his seat , a pale wreck of a man , and the chairman repeated , like a piece of clock-work suddenly started again —</p>
    <p n="228"><said who="#Gregory">“ The question is that<persName>Comrade Syme</persName>be elected to the post of Thursday on the General Council . ”</said></p>
    <p n="229">The roar rose like the sea , the hands rose like a forest , and three minutes afterwards Mr.<persName corresp="#Gabriel_Syme">Gabriel Syme</persName>, of the Secret Police Service , was elected to the post of Thursday on the General Council of the Anarchists of Europe .</p>
    <p n="230">Everyone in the room seemed to feel the tug waiting on the river , the sword-stick and the revolver , waiting on the table . The instant the election was ended and irrevocable , and<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had received the paper proving his election , they all sprang to their feet , and the fiery groups moved and mixed in the room .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>found himself , somehow or other , face to face with<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, who still regarded him with a stare of stunned hatred . They were silent for many minutes .</p>
    <p n="231"><said who="#Gregory">“ You are a devil ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>at last .</p>
    <p n="232"><said who="#Syme">“ And you are a gentleman , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with gravity .</p>
    <p n="233"><said who="#Gregory">“ It was you that entrapped me , ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, shaking from head to foot ,<said who="#Gregory">“ entrapped me into — ”</said></p>
    <p n="234"><said who="#Syme">“ Talk sense , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>shortly .<said who="#Syme">“ Into what sort of devils ’ parliament have you entrapped me , if it comes to that ? You made me swear before I made you . Perhaps we are both doing what we think right . But what we think right is so damned different that there can be nothing between us in the way of concession . There is nothing possible between us but honour and death , ”</said>and he pulled the great cloak about his shoulders and picked up the flask from the table .</p>
    <p n="235"><said who="#Gregory">“ The boat is quite ready , ”</said>said Mr. Buttons , bustling up .<said who="#Gregory">“ Be good enough to step this way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="236">With a gesture that revealed the shop-walker , he led<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>down a short , iron-bound passage , the still agonised<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>following feverishly at their heels . At the end of the passage was a door , which Buttons opened sharply , showing a sudden blue and silver picture of the moonlit river , that looked like a scene in a theatre . Close to the opening lay a dark , dwarfish steam-launch , like a baby dragon with one red eye .</p>
    <p n="237">Almost in the act of stepping on board ,<persName corresp="#Gabriel_Syme">Gabriel Syme</persName>turned to the gaping<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>.</p>
    <p n="238"><said who="#Gregory">“ You have kept your word , ”</said>he said gently , with his face in shadow .<said who="#Gregory">“ You are a man of honour , and I thank you . You have kept it even down to a small particular . There was one special thing you promised me at the beginning of the affair , and which you have certainly given me by the end of it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="239"><said who="#Gregory">“ What do you mean ? ”</said>cried the chaotic<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>.<said who="#Gregory">“ What did I promise you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="240"><said who="#Syme">“ A very entertaining evening , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, and he made a military salute with the sword-stick as the steamboat slid away .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="4">
    <p n="241">GABRIEL SYME was not merely a detective who pretended to be a poet ; he was really a poet who had become a detective . Nor was his hatred of anarchy hypocritical . He was one of those who are driven early in life into too conservative an attitude by the bewildering folly of most revolutionists . He had not attained it by any tame tradition . His respectability was spontaneous and sudden , a rebellion against rebellion . He came of a family of cranks , in which all the oldest people had all the newest notions . One of his uncles always walked about without a hat , and another had made an unsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else . His father cultivated art and self-realisation ; his mother went in for simplicity and hygiene . Hence the child , during his tenderer years , was wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of absinth and cocoa , of both of which he had a healthy dislike . The more his mother preached a more than Puritan abstinence the more did his father expand into a more than pagan latitude ; and by the time the former had come to enforcing vegetarianism , the latter had pretty well reached the point of defending cannibalism .</p>
    <p n="242">Being surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from infancy , Gabriel had to revolt into something , so he revolted into the only thing left — sanity . But there was just enough in him of the blood of these fanatics to make even his protest for common sense a little too fierce to be sensible . His hatred of modern lawlessness had been crowned also by an accident . It happened that he was walking in a side street at the instant of a dynamite outrage . He had been blind and deaf for a moment , and then seen , the smoke clearing , the broken windows and the bleeding faces . After that he went about as usual — quiet , courteous , rather gentle ; but there was a spot on his mind that was not sane . He did not regard anarchists , as most of us do , as a handful of morbid men , combining ignorance with intellectualism . He regarded them as a huge and pitiless peril , like a Chinese invasion .</p>
    <p n="243">He poured perpetually into newspapers and their waste-paper baskets a torrent of tales , verses and violent articles , warning men of this deluge of barbaric denial . But he seemed to be getting no nearer his enemy , and , what was worse , no nearer a living . As he paced the Thames embankment , bitterly biting a cheap cigar and brooding on the advance of Anarchy , there was no anarchist with a bomb in his pocket so savage or so solitary as he . Indeed , he always felt that Government stood alone and desperate , with its back to the wall . He was too quixotic to have cared for it otherwise .</p>
    <p n="244">He walked on the Embankment once under a dark red sunset . The red river reflected the red sky , and they both reflected his anger . The sky , indeed , was so swarthy , and the light on the river relatively so lurid , that the water almost seemed of fiercer flame than the sunset it mirrored . It looked like a stream of literal fire winding under the vast caverns of a subterranean country .</p>
    <p n="245"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was shabby in those days . He wore an old-fashioned black chimney-pot hat ; he was wrapped in a yet more old-fashioned cloak , black and ragged ; and the combination gave him the look of the early villains in Dickens and Bulwer Lytton . Also his yellow beard and hair were more unkempt and leonine than when they appeared long afterwards , cut and pointed , on the lawns of Saffron Park . A long , lean , black cigar , bought in Soho for twopence , stood out from between his tightened teeth , and altogether he looked a very satisfactory specimen of the anarchists upon whom he had vowed a holy war . Perhaps this was why a policeman on the Embankment spoke to him , and said “ Good evening . ”</p>
    <p n="246"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, at a crisis of his morbid fears for humanity , seemed stung by the mere stolidity of the automatic official , a mere bulk of blue in the twilight .</p>
    <p n="247"><said who="#Syme">“ A good evening is it ? ”</said>he said sharply .<said who="#Syme">“ You fellows would call the end of the world a good evening . Look at that bloody red sun and that bloody river ! I tell you that if that were literally human blood , spilt and shining , you would still be standing here as solid as ever , looking out for some poor harmless tramp whom you could move on . You policemen are cruel to the poor , but I could forgive you even your cruelty if it were not for your calm . ”</said></p>
    <p n="248"><said who="#Syme">“ If we are calm , ”</said>replied the policeman ,<said who="#Syme">“ it is the calm of organised resistance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="249"><said who="#Syme">“ Eh ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, staring .</p>
    <p n="250"><said who="#Syme">“ The soldier must be calm in the thick of the battle , ”</said>pursued the policeman .<said who="#Syme">“ The composure of an army is the anger of a nation . ”</said></p>
    <p n="251"><said who="#Syme">“ Good God , the Board Schools ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ Is this undenominational education ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="252"><said who="#the_policeman">“ No , ”</said>said the policeman sadly ,<said who="#the_policeman">“ I never had any of those advantages . The Board Schools came after my time . What education I had was very rough and old-fashioned , I am afraid . ”</said></p>
    <p n="253"><said who="#Syme">“ Where did you have it ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, wondering .</p>
    <p n="254"><said who="#the_policeman">“ Oh , at Harrow , ”</said>said the policeman</p>
    <p n="255">The class sympathies which , false as they are , are the truest things in so many men , broke out of<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>before he could control them .</p>
    <p n="256"><said who="#Syme">“ But , good Lord , man , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Syme">“ you ought n't to be a policeman ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="257">The policeman sighed and shook his head .</p>
    <p n="258"><said who="#Syme">“ I know , ”</said>he said solemnly ,<said who="#Syme">“ I know I am not worthy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="259"><said who="#Syme">“ But why did you join the police ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with rude curiosity .</p>
    <p n="260"><said who="#Syme">“ For much the same reason that you abused the police , ”</said>replied the other .<said who="#Syme">“ I found that there was a special opening in the service for those whose fears for humanity were concerned rather with the aberrations of the scientific intellect than with the normal and excusable , though excessive , outbreaks of the human will . I trust I make myself clear . ”</said></p>
    <p n="261"><said who="#Syme">“ If you mean that you make your opinion clear , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ I suppose you do . But as for making yourself clear , it is the last thing you do . How comes a man like you to be talking philosophy in a blue helmet on the Thames embankment ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="262"><said who="#Syme">“ You have evidently not heard of the latest development in our police system , ”</said>replied the other .<said who="#Syme">“ I am not surprised at it . We are keeping it rather dark from the educated class , because that class contains most of our enemies . But you seem to be exactly in the right frame of mind . I think you might almost join us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="263"><said who="#Syme">“ Join you in what ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="264"><said who="#the_policeman">“ I will tell you , ”</said>said the policeman slowly .<said who="#the_policeman">“ This is the situation : The head of one of our departments , one of the most celebrated detectives in Europe , has long been of opinion that a purely intellectual conspiracy would soon threaten the very existence of civilisation . He is certain that the scientific and artistic worlds are silently bound in a crusade against the Family and the State . He has , therefore , formed a special corps of policemen , policemen who are also philosophers . It is their business to watch the beginnings of this conspiracy , not merely in a criminal but in a controversial sense . I am a democrat myself , and I am fully aware of the value of the ordinary man in matters of ordinary valour or virtue . But it would obviously be undesirable to employ the common policeman in an investigation which is also a heresy hunt . ”</said></p>
    <p n="265"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s eyes were bright with a sympathetic curiosity .</p>
    <p n="266"><said who="#Syme">“ What do you do , then ? ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="267"><said who="#Syme">“ The work of the philosophical policeman , ”</said>replied the man in blue ,<said who="#Syme">“ is at once bolder and more subtle than that of the ordinary detective . The ordinary detective goes to pot-houses to arrest thieves ; we go to artistic tea-parties to detect pessimists . The ordinary detective discovers from a ledger or a diary that a crime has been committed . We discover from a book of sonnets that a crime will be committed . We have to trace the origin of those dreadful thoughts that drive men on at last to intellectual fanaticism and intellectual crime . We were only just in time to prevent the assassination at Hartle pool , and that was entirely due to the fact that our Mr. Wilks ( a smart young fellow ) thoroughly understood a triolet . ”</said></p>
    <p n="268"><said who="#Syme">“ Do you mean , ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ that there is really as much connection between crime and the modern intellect as all that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="269"><said who="#Syme">“ You are not sufficiently democratic , ”</said>answered the policeman ,<said who="#Syme">“ but you were right when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business . I tell you I am sometimes sick of my trade when I see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the desperate . But this new movement of ours is a very different affair . We deny the snobbish English assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous criminals . We remember the Roman Emperors . We remember the great poisoning princes of the Renaissance . We say that the dangerous criminal is the educated criminal . We say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher . Compared to him , burglars and bigamists are essentially moral men ; my heart goes out to them . They accept the essential ideal of man ; they merely seek it wrongly . Thieves respect property . They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it . But philosophers dislike property as property ; they wish to destroy the very idea of personal possession . Bigamists respect marriage , or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy . But philosophers despise marriage as marriage . Murderers respect human life ; they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives . But philosophers hate life itself , their own as much as other people 's . ”</said></p>
    <p n="270"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>struck his hands together .</p>
    <p n="271"><said who="#Syme">“ How true that is , ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Syme">“ I have felt it from my boyhood , but never could state the verbal antithesis . The common criminal is a bad man , but at least he is , as it were , a conditional good man . He says that if only a certain obstacle be removed — say a wealthy uncle — he is then prepared to accept the universe and to praise God . He is a reformer , but not an anarchist . He wishes to cleanse the edifice , but not to destroy it . But the evil philosopher is not trying to alter things , but to annihilate them . Yes , the modern world has retained all those parts of police work which are really oppressive and ignominious , the harrying of the poor , the spying upon the unfortunate . It has given up its more dignified work , the punishment of powerful traitors in the State and powerful heresiarchs in the Church . The moderns say we must not punish heretics . My only doubt is whether we have a right to punish anybody else . ”</said></p>
    <p n="272"><said who="#Syme">“ But this is absurd ! ”</said>cried the policeman , clasping his hands with an excitement uncommon in persons of his figure and costume ,<said who="#Syme">“ but it is intolerable ! I do n't know what you 're doing , but you 're wasting your life . You must , you shall , join our special army against anarchy . Their armies are on our frontiers . Their bolt is ready to fall . A moment more , and you may lose the glory of working with us , perhaps the glory of dying with the last heroes of the world . ”</said></p>
    <p n="273"><said who="#Syme">“ It is a chance not to be missed , certainly , ”</said>assented<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ but still I do not quite understand . I know as well as anybody that the modern world is full of lawless little men and mad little movements . But , beastly as they are , they generally have the one merit of disagreeing with each other . How can you talk of their leading one army or hurling one bolt . What is this anarchy ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="274"><said who="#Syme">“ Do not confuse it , ”</said>replied the constable ,<said who="#Syme">“ with those chance dynamite outbreaks from Russia or from Ireland , which are really the outbreaks of oppressed , if mistaken , men . This is a vast philosophic movement , consisting of an outer and an inner ring . You might even call the outer ring the laity and the inner ring the priesthood . I prefer to call the outer ring the innocent section , the inner ring the supremely guilty section . The outer ring — the main mass of their supporters — are merely anarchists ; that is , men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness . They believe that all the evil results of human crime are the results of the system that has called it crime . They do not believe that the crime creates the punishment . They believe that the punishment has created the crime . They believe that if a man seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as blameless as the flowers of spring . They believe that if a man picked a pocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good . These I call the innocent section . ”</said></p>
    <p n="275"><said who="#Syme">“ Oh ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="276"><said who="#Syme">“ Naturally , therefore , these people talk about ‘ a happy time coming ’ ; ‘ the paradise of the future ’ ; ‘ mankind freed from the bondage of vice and the bondage of virtue , ’ and so on . And so also the men of the inner circle speak — the sacred priesthood . They also speak to applauding crowds of the happiness of the future , and of mankind freed at last . But in their mouths ”</said>— and the policeman lowered his voice —<said who="#Syme">“ in their mouths these happy phrases have a horrible meaning . They are under no illusions ; they are too intellectual to think that man upon this earth can ever be quite free of original sin and the struggle . And they mean death . When they say that mankind shall be free at last , they mean that mankind shall commit suicide . When they talk of a paradise without right or wrong , they mean the grave .</said></p>
    <p n="277"><said who="#Syme">“ They have but two objects , to destroy first humanity and then themselves . That is why they throw bombs instead of firing pistols . The innocent rank and file are disappointed because the bomb has not killed the king ; but the high-priesthood are happy because it has killed somebody . ”</said></p>
    <p n="278"><said who="#Syme">“ How can I join you ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, with a sort of passion .</p>
    <p n="279"><said who="#Syme">“ I know for a fact that there is a vacancy at the moment , ”</said>said the policeman ,<said who="#Syme">“ as I have the honour to be somewhat in the confidence of the chief of whom I have spoken . You should really come and see him . Or rather , I should not say see him , nobody ever sees him ; but you can talk to him if you like . ”</said></p>
    <p n="280"><said who="#Syme">“ Telephone ? ”</said>inquired<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, with interest .</p>
    <p n="281"><said who="#the_policeman">“ No , ”</said>said the policeman placidly ,<said who="#the_policeman">“ he has a fancy for always sitting in a pitch-dark room . He says it makes his thoughts brighter . Do come along . ”</said></p>
    <p n="282">Somewhat dazed and considerably excited ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>allowed himself to be led to a side-door in the long row of buildings of Scotland Yard . Almost before he knew what he was doing , he had been passed through the hands of about four intermediate officials , and was suddenly shown into a room , the abrupt blackness of which startled him like a blaze of light . It was not the ordinary darkness , in which forms can be faintly traced ; it was like going suddenly stone-blind .</p>
    <p n="283"><said who="#Syme">“ Are you the new recruit ? ”</said>asked a heavy voice .</p>
    <p n="284">And in some strange way , though there was not the shadow of a shape in the gloom ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>knew two things : first , that it came from a man of massive stature ; and second , that the man had his back to him .</p>
    <p n="285"><said who="#Syme">“ Are you the new recruit ? ”</said>said the invisible chief , who seemed to have heard all about it .<said who="#Syme">“ All right . You are engaged . ”</said></p>
    <p n="286"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, quite swept off his feet , made a feeble fight against this irrevocable phrase .</p>
    <p n="287"><said who="#Syme">“ I really have no experience , ”</said>he began .</p>
    <p n="288"><said who="#Syme">“ No one has any experience , ”</said>said the other ,<said who="#Syme">“ of the Battle of Armageddon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="289"><said who="#Syme">“ But I am really unfit — ”</said></p>
    <p n="290"><said who="#the_unknown">“ You are willing , that is enough , ”</said>said the unknown .</p>
    <p n="291"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , really , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ I do n't know any profession of which mere willingness is the final test . ”</said></p>
    <p n="292"><said who="#Syme">“ I do , ”</said>said the other —<said who="#Syme">“ martyrs . I am condemning you to death . Good day . ”</said></p>
    <p n="293">Thus it was that when<persName corresp="#Gabriel_Syme">Gabriel Syme</persName>came out again into the crimson light of evening , in his shabby black hat and shabby , lawless cloak , he came out a member of the New Detective Corps for the frustration of the great conspiracy . Acting under the advice of his friend the policeman ( who was professionally inclined to neatness ) , he trimmed his hair and beard , bought a good hat , clad himself in an exquisite summer suit of light blue-grey , with a pale yellow flower in the button-hole , and , in short , became that elegant and rather insupportable person whom<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>had first encountered in the little garden of Saffron Park . Before he finally left the police premises his friend provided him with a small blue card , on which was written , “ The Last Crusade , ” and a number , the sign of his official authority . He put this carefully in his upper waistcoat pocket , lit a cigarette , and went forth to track and fight the enemy in all the drawing-rooms of London . Where his adventure ultimately led him we have already seen . At about half-past one on a February night he found himself steaming in a small tug up the silent Thames , armed with swordstick and revolver , the duly elected Thursday of the Central Council of Anarchists .</p>
    <p n="294">When<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>stepped out on to the steam-tug he had a singular sensation of stepping out into something entirely new ; not merely into the landscape of a new land , but even into the landscape of a new planet . This was mainly due to the insane yet solid decision of that evening , though partly also to an entire change in the weather and the sky since he entered the little tavern some two hours before . Every trace of the passionate plumage of the cloudy sunset had been swept away , and a naked moon stood in a naked sky . The moon was so strong and full that ( by a paradox often to be noticed ) it seemed like a weaker sun . It gave , not the sense of bright moonshine , but rather of a dead daylight .</p>
    <p n="295">Over the whole landscape lay a luminous and unnatural discoloration , as of that disastrous twilight which Milton spoke of as shed by the sun in eclipse ; so that<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>fell easily into his first thought , that he was actually on some other and emptier planet , which circled round some sadder star . But the more he felt this glittering desolation in the moonlit land , the more his own chivalric folly glowed in the night like a great fire . Even the common things he carried with him — the food and the brandy and the loaded pistol — took on exactly that concrete and material poetry which a child feels when he takes a gun upon a journey or a bun with him to bed . The sword-stick and the brandy-flask , though in themselves only the tools of morbid conspirators , became the expressions of his own more healthy romance . The sword-stick became almost the sword of chivalry , and the brandy the wine of the stirrup-cup . For even the most dehumanised modern fantasies depend on some older and simpler figure ; the adventures may be mad , but the adventurer must be sane . The dragon without St. George would not even be grotesque . So this inhuman landscape was only imaginative by the presence of a man really human . To<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s exaggerative mind the bright , bleak houses and terraces by the Thames looked as empty as the mountains of the moon . But even the moon is only poetical because there is a man in the moon .</p>
    <p n="296">The tug was worked by two men , and with much toil went comparatively slowly . The clear moon that had lit up Chiswick had gone down by the time that they passed Battersea , and when they came under the enormous bulk of Westminster day had already begun to break . It broke like the splitting of great bars of lead , showing bars of silver ; and these had brightened like white fire when the tug , changing its onward course , turned inward to a large landing stage rather beyond Charing Cross .</p>
    <p n="297">The great stones of the Embankment seemed equally dark and gigantic as<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>looked up at them . They were big and black against the huge white dawn . They made him feel that he was landing on the colossal steps of some Egyptian palace ; and , indeed , the thing suited his mood , for he was , in his own mind , mounting to attack the solid thrones of horrible and heathen kings . He leapt out of the boat on to one slimy step , and stood , a dark and slender figure , amid the enormous masonry . The two men in the tug put her off again and turned up stream . They had never spoken a word .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="5">
    <p n="298">AT first the large stone stair seemed to<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>as deserted as a pyramid ; but before he reached the top he had realised that there was a man leaning over the parapet of the Embankment and looking out across the river . As a figure he was quite conventional , clad in a silk hat and frock-coat of the more formal type of fashion ; he had a red flower in his buttonhole . As<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>drew nearer to him step by step , he did not even move a hair ; and<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>could come close enough to notice even in the dim , pale morning light that his face was long , pale and intellectual , and ended in a small triangular tuft of dark beard at the very point of the chin , all else being clean-shaven . This scrap of hair almost seemed a mere oversight ; the rest of the face was of the type that is best shaven — clear-cut , ascetic , and in its way noble .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>drew closer and closer , noting all this , and still the figure did not stir .</p>
    <p n="299">At first an instinct had told<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>that this was the man whom he was meant to meet . Then , seeing that the man made no sign , he had concluded that he was not . And now again he had come back to a certainty that the man had something to do with his mad adventure . For the man remained more still than would have been natural if a stranger had come so close . He was as motionless as a wax-work , and got on the nerves somewhat in the same way .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>looked again and again at the pale , dignified and delicate face , and the face still looked blankly across the river . Then he took out of his pocket the note from Buttons proving his election , and put it before that sad and beautiful face . Then the man smiled , and his smile was a shock , for it was all on one side , going up in the right cheek and down in the left .</p>
    <p n="300">There was nothing , rationally speaking , to scare anyone about this . Many people have this nervous trick of a crooked smile , and in many it is even attractive . But in all<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s circumstances , with the dark dawn and the deadly errand and the loneliness on the great dripping stones , there was something unnerving in it .</p>
    <p n="301">There was the silent river and the silent man , a man of even classic face . And there was the last nightmare touch that his smile suddenly went wrong .</p>
    <p n="302">The spasm of smile was instantaneous , and the man 's face dropped at once into its harmonious melancholy . He spoke without further explanation or inquiry , like a man speaking to an old colleague .</p>
    <p n="303"><said who="#Syme">“ If we walk up towards Leicester Square , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Syme">“ we shall just be in time for breakfast . Sunday always insists on an early breakfast . Have you had any sleep ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="304"><said who="#Syme">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="305"><said who="#Syme">“ Nor have I , ”</said>answered the man in an ordinary tone .<said who="#Syme">“ I shall try to get to bed after breakfast . ”</said></p>
    <p n="306">He spoke with casual civility , but in an utterly dead voice that contradicted the fanaticism of his face . It seemed almost as if all friendly words were to him lifeless conveniences , and that his only life was hate . After a pause the man spoke again .</p>
    <p n="307"><said who="#Syme">“ Of course ,<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>of the branch told you everything that can be told . But the one thing that can never be told is the last notion of<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>, for his notions grow like a tropical forest . So in case you do n't know , I 'd better tell you that he is carrying out his notion of concealing ourselves by not concealing ourselves to the most extraordinary lengths just now . Originally , of course , we met in a cell underground , just as your branch does . Then Sunday made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant . He said that if you did n't seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out . Well , he is the only man on earth , I know ; but sometimes I really think that his huge brain is going a little mad in its old age . For now we flaunt ourselves before the public . We have our breakfast on a balcony — on a balcony , if you please — overlooking Leicester Square . ”</said></p>
    <p n="308"><said who="#Syme">“ And what do the people say ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="309"><said who="#Syme">“ It 's quite simple what they say , ”</said>answered his guide .</p>
    <p n="310"><said who="#Syme">“ They say we are a lot of jolly gentlemen who pretend they are anarchists . ”</said></p>
    <p n="311"><said who="#Syme">“ It seems to me a very clever idea , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="312"><said who="#Syme">“ Clever ! God blast your impudence ! Clever ! ”</said>cried out the other in a sudden , shrill voice which was as startling and discordant as his crooked smile .<said who="#Syme">“ When you 've seen Sunday for a split second you 'll leave off calling him clever . ”</said></p>
    <p n="313">With this they emerged out of a narrow street , and saw the early sunlight filling Leicester Square . It will never be known , I suppose , why this square itself should look so alien and in some ways so continental . It will never be known whether it was the foreign look that attracted the foreigners or the foreigners who gave it the foreign look . But on this particular morning the effect seemed singularly bright and clear . Between the open square and the sunlit leaves and the statue and the Saracenic outlines of the Alhambra , it looked the replica of some French or even Spanish public place . And this effect increased in<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>the sensation , which in many shapes he had had through the whole adventure , the eerie sensation of having strayed into a new world . As a fact , he had bought bad cigars round Leicester Square ever since he was a boy . But as he turned that corner , and saw the trees and the Moorish cupolas , he could have sworn that he was turning into an unknown Place de something or other in some foreign town .</p>
    <p n="314">At one corner of the square there projected a kind of angle of a prosperous but quiet hotel , the bulk of which belonged to a street behind . In the wall there was one large French window , probably the window of a large coffee-room ; and outside this window , almost literally overhanging the square , was a formidably buttressed balcony , big enough to contain a dining-table . In fact , it did contain a dining-table , or more strictly a breakfast-table ; and round the breakfast-table , glowing in the sunlight and evident to the street , were a group of noisy and talkative men , all dressed in the insolence of fashion , with white waistcoats and expensive button-holes . Some of their jokes could almost be heard across the square . Then the grave Secretary gave his unnatural smile , and<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>knew that this boisterous breakfast party was the secret conclave of the European Dynamiters .</p>
    <p n="315">Then , as<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>continued to stare at them , he saw something that he had not seen before . He had not seen it literally because it was too large to see . At the nearest end of the balcony , blocking up a great part of the perspective , was the back of a great mountain of a man . When<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had seen him , his first thought was that the weight of him must break down the balcony of stone . His vastness did not lie only in the fact that he was abnormally tall and quite incredibly fat . This man was planned enormously in his original proportions , like a statue carved deliberately as colossal . His head , crowned with white hair , as seen from behind looked bigger than a head ought to be . The ears that stood out from it looked larger than human ears . He was enlarged terribly to scale ; and this sense of size was so staggering , that when<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>saw him all the other figures seemed quite suddenly to dwindle and become dwarfish . They were still sitting there as before with their flowers and frock-coats , but now it looked as if the big man was entertaining five children to tea .</p>
    <p n="316">As<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>and the guide approached the side door of the hotel , a waiter came out smiling with every tooth in his head .</p>
    <p n="317"><said who="#Syme">“ The gentlemen are up there , sare , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Syme">“ They do talk and they do laugh at what they talk . They do say they will throw bombs at ze king . ”</said></p>
    <p n="318">And the waiter hurried away with a napkin over his arm , much pleased with the singular frivolity of the gentlemen upstairs .</p>
    <p n="319">The two men mounted the stairs in silence .</p>
    <p n="320"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had never thought of asking whether the monstrous man who almost filled and broke the balcony was the great President of whom the others stood in awe . He knew it was so , with an unaccountable but instantaneous certainty .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, indeed , was one of those men who are open to all the more nameless psychological influences in a degree a little dangerous to mental health . Utterly devoid of fear in physical dangers , he was a great deal too sensitive to the smell of spiritual evil . Twice already that night little unmeaning things had peeped out at him almost pruriently , and given him a sense of drawing nearer and nearer to the head-quarters of hell . And this sense became overpowering as he drew nearer to the great President .</p>
    <p n="321">The form it took was a childish and yet hateful fancy . As he walked across the inner room towards the balcony , the large face of Sunday grew larger and larger ; and<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was gripped with a fear that when he was quite close the face would be too big to be possible , and that he would scream aloud . He remembered that as a child he would not look at the mask of Memnon in the British Museum , because it was a face , and so large .</p>
    <p n="322">By an effort , braver than that of leaping over a cliff , he went to an empty seat at the breakfast-table and sat down . The men greeted him with good-humoured raillery as if they had always known him . He sobered himself a little by looking at their conventional coats and solid , shining coffee-pot ; then he looked again at Sunday . His face was very large , but it was still possible to humanity .</p>
    <p n="323">In the presence of<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>the whole company looked sufficiently commonplace ; nothing about them caught the eye at first , except that by<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>'s caprice they had been dressed up with a festive respectability , which gave the meal the look of a wedding breakfast . One man indeed stood out at even a superficial glance . He at least was the common or garden Dynamiter . He wore , indeed , the high white collar and satin tie that were the uniform of the occasion ; but out of this collar there sprang a head quite unmanageable and quite unmistakable , a bewildering bush of brown hair and beard that almost obscured the eyes like those of a Skye terrier . But the eyes did look out of the tangle , and they were the sad eyes of some Russian serf . The effect of this figure was not terrible like that of<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>, but it had every diablerie that can come from the utterly grotesque . If out of that stiff tie and collar there had come abruptly the head of a cat or a dog , it could not have been a more idiotic contrast .</p>
    <p n="324">The man 's name , it seemed , was<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>; he was a Pole , and in this circle of days he was called Tuesday . His soul and speech were incurably tragic ; he could not force himself to play the prosperous and frivolous part demanded of him by President Sunday . And , indeed , when<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>came in<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>, with that daring disregard of public suspicion which was his policy , was actually chaffing<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>upon his inability to assume conventional graces .</p>
    <p n="325"><said who="#the_President">“ Our friend Tuesday , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>in a deep voice at once of quietude and volume ,<said who="#the_President">“ our friend Tuesday does n't seem to grasp the idea . He dresses up like a gentleman , but he seems to be too great a soul to behave like one . He insists on the ways of the stage conspirator . Now if a gentleman goes about London in a top hat and a frock-coat , no one need know that he is an anarchist . But if a gentleman puts on a top hat and a frock-coat , and then goes about on his hands and knees — well , he may attract attention . That 's what Brother<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>does . He goes about on his hands and knees with such inexhaustible diplomacy , that by this time he finds it quite difficult to walk upright . ”</said></p>
    <p n="326"><said who="#Gogol">“ I am not good at goncealment , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>sulkily , with a thick foreign accent ;<said who="#Gogol">“ I am not ashamed of the cause . ”</said></p>
    <p n="327"><said who="#the_President">“ Yes you are , my boy , and so is the cause of you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>good-naturedly .<said who="#the_President">“ You hide as much as anybody ; but you can n't do it , you see , you 're such an ass ! You try to combine two inconsistent methods . When a householder finds a man under his bed , he will probably pause to note the circumstance . But if he finds a man under his bed in a top hat , you will agree with me , my dear Tuesday , that he is not likely even to forget it . Now when you were found under Admiral Biffin 's bed — ”</said></p>
    <p n="328"><said who="#Gogol">“ I am not good at deception , ”</said>said Tuesday gloomily , flushing .</p>
    <p n="329"><said who="#the_President">“ Right , my boy , right , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>with a ponderous heartiness ,<said who="#the_President">“ you are n't good at anything . ”</said></p>
    <p n="330">While this stream of conversation continued ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was looking more steadily at the men around him . As he did so , he gradually felt all his sense of something spiritually queer return .</p>
    <p n="331">He had thought at first that they were all of common stature and costume , with the evident exception of the hairy<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>. But as he looked at the others , he began to see in each of them exactly what he had seen in the man by the river , a demoniac detail somewhere . That lop-sided laugh , which would suddenly disfigure the fine face of his original guide , was typical of all these types . Each man had something about him , perceived perhaps at the tenth or twentieth glance , which was not normal , and which seemed hardly human . The only metaphor he could think of was this , that they all looked as men of fashion and presence would look , with the additional twist given in a false and curved mirror .</p>
    <p n="332">Only the individual examples will express this half-concealed eccentricity .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s original cicerone bore the title of Monday ; he was<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>of the Council , and his twisted smile was regarded with more terror than anything , except<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>'s horrible , happy laughter . But now that<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had more space and light to observe him , there were other touches . His fine face was so emaciated , that<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>thought it must be wasted with some disease ; yet somehow the very distress of his dark eyes denied this . It was no physical ill that troubled him . His eyes were alive with intellectual torture , as if pure thought was pain .</p>
    <p n="333">He was typical of each of the tribe ; each man was subtly and differently wrong . Next to him sat Tuesday , the tousle-headed<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>, a man more obviously mad . Next was Wednesday , a certain Marquis de St. Eustache , a sufficiently characteristic figure . The first few glances found nothing unusual about him , except that he was the only man at table who wore the fashionable clothes as if they were really his own . He had a black French beard cut square and a black English frock-coat cut even squarer . But<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, sensitive to such things , felt somehow that the man carried a rich atmosphere with him , a rich atmosphere that suffocated . It reminded one irrationally of drowsy odours and of dying lamps in the darker poems of Byron and Poe . With this went a sense of his being clad , not in lighter colours , but in softer materials ; his black seemed richer and warmer than the black shades about him , as if it were compounded of profound colour . His black coat looked as if it were only black by being too dense a purple . His black beard looked as if it were only black by being too deep a blue . And in the gloom and thickness of the beard his dark red mouth showed sensual and scornful . Whatever he was he was not a Frenchman ; he might be a Jew ; he might be something deeper yet in the dark heart of the East . In the bright coloured Persian tiles and pictures showing tyrants hunting , you may see just those almond eyes , those blue-black beards , those cruel , crimson lips .</p>
    <p n="334">Then came<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, and next a very old man ,<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>, who still kept the chair of Friday , though every day it was expected that his death would leave it empty . Save for his intellect , he was in the last dissolution of senile decay . His face was as grey as his long grey beard , his forehead was lifted and fixed finally in a furrow of mild despair . In no other case , not even that of<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>, did the bridegroom brilliancy of the morning dress express a more painful contrast . For the red flower in his button-hole showed up against a face that was literally discoloured like lead ; the whole hideous effect was as if some drunken dandies had put their clothes upon a corpse . When he rose or sat down , which was with long labour and peril , something worse was expressed than mere weakness , something indefinably connected with the horror of the whole scene . It did not express decrepitude merely , but corruption . Another hateful fancy crossed<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s quivering mind . He could not help thinking that whenever the man moved a leg or arm might fall off .</p>
    <p n="335">Right at the end sat the man called Saturday , the simplest and the most baffling of all . He was a short , square man with a dark , square face clean-shaven , a medical practitioner going by the name of<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>. He had that combination of savoir-faire with a sort of well-groomed coarseness which is not uncommon in young doctors . He carried his fine clothes with confidence rather than ease , and he mostly wore a set smile . There was nothing whatever odd about him , except that he wore a pair of dark , almost opaque spectacles . It may have been merely a crescendo of nervous fancy that had gone before , but those black discs were dreadful to<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>; they reminded him of half-remembered ugly tales , of some story about pennies being put on the eyes of the dead .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s eye always caught the black glasses and the blind grin . Had the dying<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>worn them , or even the pale Secretary , they would have been appropriate . But on the younger and grosser man they seemed only an enigma . They took away the key of the face . You could not tell what his smile or his gravity meant . Partly from this , and partly because he had a vulgar virility wanting in most of the others it seemed to<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>that he might be the wickedest of all those wicked men .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>even had the thought that his eyes might be covered up because they were too frightful to see .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="6">
    <p n="336">SUCH were the six men who had sworn to destroy the world . Again and again<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>strove to pull together his common sense in their presence . Sometimes he saw for an instant that these notions were subjective , that he was only looking at ordinary men , one of whom was old , another nervous , another short-sighted . The sense of an unnatural symbolism always settled back on him again . Each figure seemed to be , somehow , on the borderland of things , just as their theory was on the borderland of thought . He knew that each one of these men stood at the extreme end , so to speak , of some wild road of reasoning . He could only fancy , as in some old-world fable , that if a man went westward to the end of the world he would find something — say a tree — that was more or less than a tree , a tree possessed by a spirit ; and that if he went east to the end of the world he would find something else that was not wholly itself — a tower , perhaps , of which the very shape was wicked . So these figures seemed to stand up , violent and unaccountable , against an ultimate horizon , visions from the verge . The ends of the earth were closing in .</p>
    <p n="337">Talk had been going on steadily as he took in the scene ; and not the least of the contrasts of that bewildering breakfast-table was the contrast between the easy and unobtrusive tone of talk and its terrible purport . They were deep in the discussion of an actual and immediate plot . The waiter downstairs had spoken quite correctly when he said that they were talking about bombs and kings . Only three days afterwards the Czar was to meet<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>of the French Republic in Paris , and over their bacon and eggs upon their sunny balcony these beaming gentlemen had decided how both should die . Even the instrument was chosen ; the black-bearded Marquis , it appeared , was to carry the bomb .</p>
    <p n="338">Ordinarily speaking , the proximity of this positive and objective crime would have sobered<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, and cured him of all his merely mystical tremors . He would have thought of nothing but the need of saving at least two human bodies from being ripped in pieces with iron and roaring gas . But the truth was that by this time he had begun to feel a third kind of fear , more piercing and practical than either his moral revulsion or his social responsibility . Very simply , he had no fear to spare for the French President or the Czar ; he had begun to fear for himself . Most of the talkers took little heed of him , debating now with their faces closer together , and almost uniformly grave , save when for an instant the smile of<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>ran aslant across his face as the jagged lightning runs aslant across the sky . But there was one persistent thing which first troubled<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>and at last terrified him .<persName corresp="#the_President">The President</persName>was always looking at him , steadily , and with a great and baffling interest . The enormous man was quite quiet , but his blue eyes stood out of his head . And they were always fixed on<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="339"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>felt moved to spring up and leap over the balcony . When<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>'s eyes were on him he felt as if he were made of glass . He had hardly the shred of a doubt that in some silent and extraordinary way Sunday had found out that he was a spy . He looked over the edge of the balcony , and saw a policeman , standing abstractedly just beneath , staring at the bright railings and the sunlit trees .</p>
    <p n="340">Then there fell upon him the great temptation that was to torment him for many days . In the presence of these powerful and repulsive men , who were the princes of anarchy , he had almost forgotten the frail and fanciful figure of the poet<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, the mere aesthete of anarchism . He even thought of him now with an old kindness , as if they had played together when children . But he remembered that he was still tied to<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>by a great promise . He had promised never to do the very thing that he now felt himself almost in the act of doing . He had promised not to jump over that balcony and speak to that policeman . He took his cold hand off the cold stone balustrade . His soul swayed in a vertigo of moral indecision . He had only to snap the thread of a rash vow made to a villainous society , and all his life could be as open and sunny as the square beneath him . He had , on the other hand , only to keep his antiquated honour , and be delivered inch by inch into the power of this great enemy of mankind , whose very intellect was a torture-chamber . Whenever he looked down into the square he saw the comfortable policeman , a pillar of common sense and common order . Whenever he looked back at the breakfast-table he saw<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>still quietly studying him with big , unbearable eyes .</p>
    <p n="341">In all the torrent of his thought there were two thoughts that never crossed his mind . First , it never occurred to him to doubt that<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>and his Council could crush him if he continued to stand alone . The place might be public , the project might seem impossible . But Sunday was not the man who would carry himself thus easily without having , somehow or somewhere , set open his iron trap . Either by anonymous poison or sudden street accident , by hypnotism or by fire from hell , Sunday could certainly strike him . If he defied the man he was probably dead , either struck stiff there in his chair or long afterwards as by an innocent ailment . If he called in the police promptly , arrested everyone , told all , and set against them the whole energy of England , he would probably escape ; certainly not otherwise . They were a balconyful of gentlemen overlooking a bright and busy square ; but he felt no more safe with them than if they had been a boatful of armed pirates overlooking an empty sea .</p>
    <p n="342">There was a second thought that never came to him . It never occurred to him to be spiritually won over to the enemy . Many moderns , inured to a weak worship of intellect and force , might have wavered in their allegiance under this oppression of a great personality . They might have called Sunday the super-man . If any such creature be conceivable , he looked , indeed , somewhat like it , with his earth-shaking abstraction , as of a stone statue walking . He might have been called something above man , with his large plans , which were too obvious to be detected , with his large face , which was too frank to be understood . But this was a kind of modern meanness to which<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>could not sink even in his extreme morbidity . Like any man , he was coward enough to fear great force ; but he was not quite coward enough to admire it .</p>
    <p n="343">The men were eating as they talked , and even in this they were typical .<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>and the Marquis ate casually and conventionally of the best things on the table — cold pheasant or Strasbourg pie . But<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>was a vegetarian , and he spoke earnestly of the projected murder over half a raw tomato and three quarters of a glass of tepid water . The old<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>had such slops as suggested a sickening second childhood . And even in this President Sunday preserved his curious predominance of mere mass . For he ate like twenty men ; he ate incredibly , with a frightful freshness of appetite , so that it was like watching a sausage factory . Yet continually , when he had swallowed a dozen crumpets or drunk a quart of coffee , he would be found with his great head on one side staring at<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="344"><said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ I have often wondered , ”</said>said the Marquis , taking a great bite out of a slice of bread and jam ,<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ whether it would n't be better for me to do it with a knife . Most of the best things have been brought off with a knife . And it would be a new emotion to get a knife into a French President and wriggle it round . ”</said></p>
    <p n="345"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ You are wrong , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>, drawing his black brows together .<said who="#the_Secretary">“ The knife was merely the expression of the old personal quarrel with a personal tyrant . Dynamite is not only our best tool , but our best symbol . It is as perfect a symbol of us as is incense of the prayers of the Christians . It expands ; it only destroys because it broadens ; even so , thought only destroys because it broadens . A man 's brain is a bomb , ”</said>he cried out , loosening suddenly his strange passion and striking his own skull with violence .<said who="#the_Secretary">“ My brain feels like a bomb , night and day . It must expand ! It must expand ! A man 's brain must expand , if it breaks up the universe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="346"><said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ I do n't want the universe broken up just yet , ”</said>drawled the Marquis .<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ I want to do a lot of beastly things before I die . I thought of one yesterday in bed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="347"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ No , if the only end of the thing is nothing , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>with his sphinx-like smile ,<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ it hardly seems worth doing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="348">The old<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>was staring at the ceiling with dull eyes .</p>
    <p n="349"><said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ Every man knows in his heart , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ that nothing is worth doing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="350">There was a singular silence , and then<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>said —</p>
    <p n="351"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ We are wandering , however , from the point . The only question is how Wednesday is to strike the blow . I take it we should all agree with the original notion of a bomb . As to the actual arrangements , I should suggest that tomorrow morning he should go first of all to — ”</said></p>
    <p n="352">The speech was broken off short under a vast shadow . President Sunday had risen to his feet , seeming to fill the sky above them .</p>
    <p n="353"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Before we discuss that , ”</said>he said in a small , quiet voice ,<said who="#the_Secretary">“ let us go into a private room . I have something very particular to say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="354"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>stood up before any of the others . The instant of choice had come at last , the pistol was at his head . On the pavement before he could hear the policeman idly stir and stamp , for the morning , though bright , was cold .</p>
    <p n="355">A barrel-organ in the street suddenly sprang with a jerk into a jovial tune .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>stood up taut , as if it had been a bugle before the battle . He found himself filled with a supernatural courage that came from nowhere . That jingling music seemed full of the vivacity , the vulgarity , and the irrational valour of the poor , who in all those unclean streets were all clinging to the decencies and the charities of Christendom . His youthful prank of being a policeman had faded from his mind ; he did not think of himself as the representative of the corps of gentlemen turned into fancy constables , or of the old eccentric who lived in the dark room . But he did feel himself as the ambassador of all these common and kindly people in the street , who every day marched into battle to the music of the barrel-organ . And this high pride in being human had lifted him unaccountably to an infinite height above the monstrous men around him . For an instant , at least , he looked down upon all their sprawling eccentricities from the starry pinnacle of the commonplace . He felt towards them all that unconscious and elementary superiority that a brave man feels over powerful beasts or a wise man over powerful errors . He knew that he had neither the intellectual nor the physical strength of President Sunday ; but in that moment he minded it no more than the fact that he had not the muscles of a tiger or a horn on his nose like a rhinoceros . All was swallowed up in an ultimate certainty that<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>was wrong and that the barrel-organ was right . There clanged in his mind that unanswerable and terrible truism in the song of Roland —</p>
    <p n="356"><said who="#the_President">“ Pagens ont tort et Chretiens ont droit . ”</said></p>
    <p n="357">which in the old nasal French has the clang and groan of great iron . This liberation of his spirit from the load of his weakness went with a quite clear decision to embrace death . If the people of the barrel-organ could keep their old-world obligations , so could he . This very pride in keeping his word was that he was keeping it to miscreants . It was his last triumph over these lunatics to go down into their dark room and die for something that they could not even understand . The barrel-organ seemed to give the marching tune with the energy and the mingled noises of a whole orchestra ; and he could hear deep and rolling , under all the trumpets of the pride of life , the drums of the pride of death .</p>
    <p n="358">The conspirators were already filing through the open window and into the rooms behind .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>went last , outwardly calm , but with all his brain and body throbbing with romantic rhythm .<persName corresp="#the_President">The President</persName>led them down an irregular side stair , such as might be used by servants , and into a dim , cold , empty room , with a table and benches , like an abandoned boardroom . When they were all in , he closed and locked the door .</p>
    <p n="359">The first to speak was<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>, the irreconcilable , who seemed bursting with inarticulate grievance .</p>
    <p n="360"><said who="#Gogol">“ Zso ! Zso ! ”</said>he cried , with an obscure excitement , his heavy Polish accent becoming almost impenetrable .<said who="#Gogol">“ You zay you nod ‘ ide . You zay you show himselves . It is all nuzzinks . Ven you vant talk importance you run yourselves in a dark box ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="361"><persName corresp="#the_President">The President</persName>seemed to take the foreigner 's incoherent satire with entire good humour .</p>
    <p n="362"><said who="#the_President">“ You can n't get hold of it yet ,<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>, ”</said>he said in a fatherly way .<said who="#the_President">“ When once they have heard us talking nonsense on that balcony they will not care where we go afterwards . If we had come here first , we should have had the whole staff at the keyhole . You do n't seem to know anything about mankind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="363"><said who="#Gogol">“ I die for zem , ”</said>cried the Pole in thick excitement ,<said who="#Gogol">“ and I slay zare oppressors . I care not for these games of gonzealment . I would zmite ze tyrant in ze open square . ”</said></p>
    <p n="364"><said who="#the_President">“ I see , I see , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>, nodding kindly as he seated himself at the top of a long table .<said who="#the_President">“ You die for mankind first , and then you get up and smite their oppressors . So that 's all right . And now may I ask you to control your beautiful sentiments , and sit down with the other gentlemen at this table . For the first time this morning something intelligent is going to be said . ”</said></p>
    <p n="365"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, with the perturbed promptitude he had shown since the original summons , sat down first .<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>sat down last , grumbling in his brown beard about gombromise . No one except<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>seemed to have any notion of the blow that was about to fall . As for him , he had merely the feeling of a man mounting the scaffold with the intention , at any rate , of making a good speech .</p>
    <p n="366"><said who="#the_President">“ Comrades , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>, suddenly rising ,<said who="#the_President">“ we have spun out this farce long enough . I have called you down here to tell you something so simple and shocking that even the waiters upstairs ( long inured to our levities ) might hear some new seriousness in my voice . Comrades , we were discussing plans and naming places . I propose , before saying anything else , that those plans and places should not be voted by this meeting , but should be left wholly in the control of some one reliable member . I suggest Comrade Saturday ,<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="367">They all stared at him ; then they all started in their seats , for the next words , though not loud , had a living and sensational emphasis . Sunday struck the table .</p>
    <p n="368"><said who="#the_President">“ Not one word more about the plans and places must be said at this meeting . Not one tiny detail more about what we mean to do must be mentioned in this company . ”</said></p>
    <p n="369">Sunday had spent his life in astonishing his followers ; but it seemed as if he had never really astonished them until now . They all moved feverishly in their seats , except<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>. He sat stiff in his , with his hand in his pocket , and on the handle of his loaded revolver . When the attack on him came he would sell his life dear . He would find out at least if<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>was mortal .</p>
    <p n="370">Sunday went on smoothly —</p>
    <p n="371"><said who="#the_President">“ You will probably understand that there is only one possible motive for forbidding free speech at this festival of freedom . Strangers overhearing us matters nothing . They assume that we are joking . But what would matter , even unto death , is this , that there should be one actually among us who is not of us , who knows our grave purpose , but does not share it , who — ”</said></p>
    <p n="372"><persName corresp="#the_Secretary">The Secretary</persName>screamed out suddenly like a woman .</p>
    <p n="373"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ It can n't be ! ”</said>he cried , leaping .<said who="#the_Secretary">“ There can n't — ”</said></p>
    <p n="374"><persName corresp="#the_President">The President</persName>flapped his large flat hand on the table like the fin of some huge fish .</p>
    <p n="375"><said who="#the_President">“ Yes , ”</said>he said slowly ,<said who="#the_President">“ there is a spy in this room . There is a traitor at this table . I will waste no more words . His name — ”</said></p>
    <p n="376"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>half rose from his seat , his finger firm on the trigger .</p>
    <p n="377"><said who="#the_President">“ His name is<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>.<said who="#the_President">“ He is that hairy humbug over there who pretends to be a Pole . ”</said></p>
    <p n="378"><persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>sprang to his feet , a pistol in each hand . With the same flash three men sprang at his throat . Even<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>made an effort to rise . But<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>saw little of the scene , for he was blinded with a beneficent darkness ; he had sunk down into his seat shuddering , in a palsy of passionate relief .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="7">
    <p n="379"><said>“ SIT down ! ”</said>said Sunday in a voice that he used once or twice in his life , a voice that made men drop drawn swords .</p>
    <p n="380">The three who had risen fell away from<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>, and that equivocal person himself resumed his seat .</p>
    <p n="381"><said who="#the_President">“ Well , my man , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>briskly , addressing him as one addresses a total stranger ,<said who="#the_President">“ will you oblige me by putting your hand in your upper waistcoat pocket and showing me what you have there ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="382">The alleged Pole was a little pale under his tangle of dark hair , but he put two fingers into the pocket with apparent coolness and pulled out a blue strip of card . When<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>saw it lying on the table , he woke up again to the world outside him . For although the card lay at the other extreme of the table , and he could read nothing of the inscription on it , it bore a startling resemblance to the blue card in his own pocket , the card which had been given to him when he joined the anti-anarchist constabulary .</p>
    <p n="383"><said who="#the_President">“ Pathetic Slav , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>,<said who="#the_President">“ tragic child of Poland , are you prepared in the presence of that card to deny that you are in this company — shall we say de trop ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="384"><said who="#Gogol">“ Right oh ! ”</said>said the late<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>. It made everyone jump to hear a clear , commercial and somewhat cockney voice coming out of that forest of foreign hair . It was irrational , as if a Chinaman had suddenly spoken with a Scotch accent .</p>
    <p n="385"><said who="#the_President">“ I gather that you fully understand your position , ”</said>said Sunday .</p>
    <p n="386"><said who="#the_Pole">“ You bet , ”</said>answered the Pole .<said who="#the_Pole">“ I see it 's a fair cop . All I say is , I do n't believe any Pole could have imitated my accent like I did his . ”</said></p>
    <p n="387"><said who="#Gogol">“ I concede the point , ”</said>said Sunday .<said who="#Gogol">“ I believe your own accent to be inimitable , though I shall practise it in my bath . Do you mind leaving your beard with your card ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="388"><said who="#Gogol">“ Not a bit , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>; and with one finger he ripped off the whole of his shaggy head-covering , emerging with thin red hair and a pale , pert face .<said who="#Gogol">“ It was hot , ”</said>he added .</p>
    <p n="389"><said who="#the_President">“ I will do you the justice to say , ”</said>said Sunday , not without a sort of brutal admiration ,<said who="#the_President">“ that you seem to have kept pretty cool under it . Now listen to me . I like you . The consequence is that it would annoy me for just about two and a half minutes if I heard that you had died in torments . Well , if you ever tell the police or any human soul about us , I shall have that two and a half minutes of discomfort . On your discomfort I will not dwell . Good day . Mind the step . ”</said></p>
    <p n="390">The red-haired detective who had masqueraded as<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>rose to his feet without a word , and walked out of the room with an air of perfect nonchalance . Yet the astonished<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was able to realise that this ease was suddenly assumed ; for there was a slight stumble outside the door , which showed that the departing detective had not minded the step .</p>
    <p n="391"><said who="#the_President">“ Time is flying , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>in his gayest manner , after glancing at his watch , which like everything about him seemed bigger than it ought to be .<said who="#the_President">“ I must go off at once ; I have to take the chair at a Humanitarian meeting . ”</said></p>
    <p n="392"><persName corresp="#the_Secretary">The Secretary</persName>turned to him with working eyebrows .</p>
    <p n="393"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Would it not be better , ”</said>he said a little sharply ,<said who="#the_Secretary">“ to discuss further the details of our project , now that the spy has left us ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="394"><said who="#the_President">“ No , I think not , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>with a yawn like an unobtrusive earthquake .<said who="#the_President">“ Leave it as it is . Let Saturday settle it . I must be off . Breakfast here next Sunday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="395">But the late loud scenes had whipped up the almost naked nerves of<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>. He was one of those men who are conscientious even in crime .</p>
    <p n="396"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ I must protest , President , that the thing is irregular , ”</said>he said .<said who="#the_Secretary">“ It is a fundamental rule of our society that all plans shall be debated in full council . Of course , I fully appreciate your forethought when in the actual presence of a traitor — ”</said></p>
    <p n="397"><said who="#the_President">“ Secretary , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>seriously ,<said who="#the_President">“ if you 'd take your head home and boil it for a turnip it might be useful . I can n't say . But it might . ”</said></p>
    <p n="398"><persName corresp="#the_Secretary">The Secretary</persName>reared back in a kind of equine anger .</p>
    <p n="399"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ I really fail to understand — ”</said>he began in high offense .</p>
    <p n="400"><said who="#the_President">“ That 's it , that 's it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>, nodding a great many times .<said who="#the_President">“ That 's where you fail right enough . You fail to understand . Why , you dancing donkey , ”</said>he roared , rising ,<said who="#the_President">“ you did n't want to be overheard by a spy , did n't you ? How do you know you are n't overheard now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="401">And with these words he shouldered his way out of the room , shaking with incomprehensible scorn .</p>
    <p n="402">Four of the men left behind gaped after him without any apparent glimmering of his meaning .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>alone had even a glimmering , and such as it was it froze him to the bone . If the last words of<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>meant anything , they meant that he had not after all passed unsuspected . They meant that while Sunday could not denounce him like<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>, he still could not trust him like the others .</p>
    <p n="403">The other four got to their feet grumbling more or less , and betook themselves elsewhere to find lunch , for it was already well past midday .<persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>went last , very slowly and painfully .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>sat long after the rest had gone , revolving his strange position . He had escaped a thunderbolt , but he was still under a cloud . At last he rose and made his way out of the hotel into Leicester Square . The bright , cold day had grown increasingly colder , and when he came out into the street he was surprised by a few flakes of snow . While he still carried the sword-stick and the rest of<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>'s portable luggage , he had thrown the cloak down and left it somewhere , perhaps on the steam-tug , perhaps on the balcony . Hoping , therefore , that the snow-shower might be slight , he stepped back out of the street for a moment and stood up under the doorway of a small and greasy hair-dresser 's shop , the front window of which was empty , except for a sickly wax lady in evening dress .</p>
    <p n="404">Snow , however , began to thicken and fall fast ; and<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, having found one glance at the wax lady quite sufficient to depress his spirits , stared out instead into the white and empty street . He was considerably astonished to see , standing quite still outside the shop and staring into the window , a man . His top hat was loaded with snow like the hat of Father Christmas , the white drift was rising round his boots and ankles ; but it seemed as if nothing could tear him away from the contemplation of the colourless wax doll in dirty evening dress . That any human being should stand in such weather looking into such a shop was a matter of sufficient wonder to<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>; but his idle wonder turned suddenly into a personal shock ; for he realised that the man standing there was the paralytic old<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>. It scarcely seemed the place for a person of his years and infirmities .</p>
    <p n="405"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was ready to believe anything about the perversions of this dehumanized brotherhood ; but even he could not believe that<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>had fallen in love with that particular wax lady . He could only suppose that the man 's malady ( whatever it was ) involved some momentary fits of rigidity or trance . He was not inclined , however , to feel in this case any very compassionate concern . On the contrary , he rather congratulated himself that<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>'s stroke and his elaborate and limping walk would make it easy to escape from him and leave him miles behind . For<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>thirsted first and last to get clear of the whole poisonous atmosphere , if only for an hour . Then he could collect his thoughts , formulate his policy , and decide finally whether he should or should not keep faith with<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>.</p>
    <p n="406">He strolled away through the dancing snow , turned up two or three streets , down through two or three others , and entered a small Soho restaurant for lunch . He partook reflectively of four small and quaint courses , drank half a bottle of red wine , and ended up over black coffee and a black cigar , still thinking . He had taken his seat in the upper room of the restaurant , which was full of the chink of knives and the chatter of foreigners . He remembered that in old days he had imagined that all these harmless and kindly aliens were anarchists . He shuddered , remembering the real thing . But even the shudder had the delightful shame of escape . The wine , the common food , the familiar place , the faces of natural and talkative men , made him almost feel as if the Council of the Seven Days had been a bad dream ; and although he knew it was nevertheless an objective reality , it was at least a distant one . Tall houses and populous streets lay between him and his last sight of the shameful seven ; he was free in free London , and drinking wine among the free . With a somewhat easier action , he took his hat and stick and strolled down the stair into the shop below .</p>
    <p n="407">When he entered that lower room he stood stricken and rooted to the spot . At a small table , close up to the blank window and the white street of snow , sat the old anarchist<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>over a glass of milk , with his lifted livid face and pendent eyelids . For an instant<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>stood as rigid as the stick he leant upon . Then with a gesture as of blind hurry , he brushed past<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, dashing open the door and slamming it behind him , and stood outside in the snow .</p>
    <p n="408"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Can that old corpse be following me ? ”</said>he asked himself , biting his yellow moustache .<said who="#the_Professor">“ I stopped too long up in that room , so that even such leaden feet could catch me up . One comfort is , with a little brisk walking I can put a man like that as far away as Timbuctoo . Or am I too fanciful ? Was he really following me ? Surely Sunday would not be such a fool as to send a lame man ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="409">He set off at a smart pace , twisting and whirling his stick , in the direction of Covent Garden . As he crossed the great market the snow increased , growing blinding and bewildering as the afternoon began to darken . The snow-flakes tormented him like a swarm of silver bees . Getting into his eyes and beard , they added their unremitting futility to his already irritated nerves ; and by the time that he had come at a swinging pace to the beginning of Fleet Street , he lost patience , and finding a Sunday teashop , turned into it to take shelter . He ordered another cup of black coffee as an excuse . Scarcely had he done so , when<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>hobbled heavily into the shop , sat down with difficulty and ordered a glass of milk .</p>
    <p n="410"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s walking-stick had fallen from his hand with a great clang , which confessed the concealed steel . But<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>did not look round .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, who was commonly a cool character , was literally gaping as a rustic gapes at a conjuring trick . He had seen no cab following ; he had heard no wheels outside the shop ; to all mortal appearances the man had come on foot . But the old man could only walk like a snail , and<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had walked like the wind . He started up and snatched his stick , half crazy with the contradiction in mere arithmetic , and swung out of the swinging doors , leaving his coffee untasted . An omnibus going to the Bank went rattling by with an unusual rapidity . He had a violent run of a hundred yards to reach it ; but he managed to spring , swaying upon the splash-board and , pausing for an instant to pant , he climbed on to the top . When he had been seated for about half a minute , he heard behind him a sort of heavy and asthmatic breathing .</p>
    <p n="411">Turning sharply , he saw rising gradually higher and higher up the omnibus steps a top hat soiled and dripping with snow , and under the shadow of its brim the short-sighted face and shaky shoulders of<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>. He let himself into a seat with characteristic care , and wrapped himself up to the chin in the mackintosh rug .</p>
    <p n="412">Every movement of the old man 's tottering figure and vague hands , every uncertain gesture and panic-stricken pause , seemed to put it beyond question that he was helpless , that he was in the last imbecility of the body . He moved by inches , he let himself down with little gasps of caution . And yet , unless the philosophical entities called time and space have no vestige even of a practical existence , it appeared quite unquestionable that he had run after the omnibus .</p>
    <p n="413"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>sprang erect upon the rocking car , and after staring wildly at the wintry sky , that grew gloomier every moment , he ran down the steps . He had repressed an elemental impulse to leap over the side .</p>
    <p n="414">Too bewildered to look back or to reason , he rushed into one of the little courts at the side of Fleet Street as a rabbit rushes into a hole . He had a vague idea , if this incomprehensible old Jack-in-the-box was really pursuing him , that in that labyrinth of little streets he could soon throw him off the scent . He dived in and out of those crooked lanes , which were more like cracks than thoroughfares ; and by the time that he had completed about twenty alternate angles and described an unthinkable polygon , he paused to listen for any sound of pursuit . There was none ; there could not in any case have been much , for the little streets were thick with the soundless snow . Somewhere behind Red Lion Court , however , he noticed a place where some energetic citizen had cleared away the snow for a space of about twenty yards , leaving the wet , glistening cobble-stones . He thought little of this as he passed it , only plunging into yet another arm of the maze . But when a few hundred yards farther on he stood still again to listen , his heart stood still also , for he heard from that space of rugged stones the clinking crutch and labouring feet of the infernal cripple .</p>
    <p n="415">The sky above was loaded with the clouds of snow , leaving London in a darkness and oppression premature for that hour of the evening . On each side of<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>the walls of the alley were blind and featureless ; there was no little window or any kind of eve . He felt a new impulse to break out of this hive of houses , and to get once more into the open and lamp-lit street . Yet he rambled and dodged for a long time before he struck the main thoroughfare . When he did so , he struck it much farther up than he had fancied . He came out into what seemed the vast and void of Ludgate Circus , and saw St. Paul 's Cathedral sitting in the sky .</p>
    <p n="416">At first he was startled to find these great roads so empty , as if a pestilence had swept through the city . Then he told himself that some degree of emptiness was natural ; first because the snow-storm was even dangerously deep , and secondly because it was Sunday . And at the very word Sunday he bit his lip ; the word was henceforth for hire like some indecent pun . Under the white fog of snow high up in the heaven the whole atmosphere of the city was turned to a very queer kind of green twilight , as of men under the sea . The sealed and sullen sunset behind the dark dome of St. Paul 's had in it smoky and sinister colours — colours of sickly green , dead red or decaying bronze , that were just bright enough to emphasise the solid whiteness of the snow . But right up against these dreary colours rose the black bulk of the cathedral ; and upon the top of the cathedral was a random splash and great stain of snow , still clinging as to an Alpine peak . It had fallen accidentally , but just so fallen as to half drape the dome from its very topmost point , and to pick out in perfect silver the great orb and the cross . When<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>saw it he suddenly straightened himself , and made with his sword-stick an involuntary salute .</p>
    <p n="417">He knew that that evil figure , his shadow , was creeping quickly or slowly behind him , and he did not care .</p>
    <p n="418">It seemed a symbol of human faith and valour that while the skies were darkening that high place of the earth was bright . The devils might have captured heaven , but they had not yet captured the cross . He had a new impulse to tear out the secret of this dancing , jumping and pursuing paralytic ; and at the entrance of the court as it opened upon the Circus he turned , stick in hand , to face his pursuer .</p>
    <p n="419"><persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>came slowly round the corner of the irregular alley behind him , his unnatural form outlined against a lonely gas-lamp , irresistibly recalling that very imaginative figure in the nursery rhymes ,<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ the crooked man who went a crooked mile . ”</said>He really looked as if he had been twisted out of shape by the tortuous streets he had been threading . He came nearer and nearer , the lamplight shining on his lifted spectacles , his lifted , patient face .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>waited for him as St. George waited for the dragon , as a man waits for a final explanation or for death . And the old<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>came right up to him and passed him like a total stranger , without even a blink of his mournful eyelids .</p>
    <p n="420">There was something in this silent and unexpected innocence that left<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>in a final fury . The man 's colourless face and manner seemed to assert that the whole following had been an accident .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was galvanised with an energy that was something between bitterness and a burst of boyish derision . He made a wild gesture as if to knock the old man 's hat off , called out something like “ Catch me if you can , ” and went racing away across the white , open Circus . Concealment was impossible now ; and looking back over his shoulder , he could see the black figure of the old gentleman coming after him with long , swinging strides like a man winning a mile race . But the head upon that bounding body was still pale , grave and professional , like the head of a lecturer upon the body of a harlequin .</p>
    <p n="421">This outrageous chase sped across Ludgate Circus , up Ludgate Hill , round St. Paul 's Cathedral , along Cheapside ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>remembering all the nightmares he had ever known . Then<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>broke away towards the river , and ended almost down by the docks . He saw the yellow panes of a low , lighted public-house , flung himself into it and ordered beer . It was a foul tavern , sprinkled with foreign sailors , a place where opium might be smoked or knives drawn .</p>
    <p n="422">A moment later<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>entered the place , sat down carefully , and asked for a glass of milk .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="8">
    <p n="423">WHEN<persName corresp="#Gabriel_Syme">Gabriel Syme</persName>found himself finally established in a chair , and opposite to him , fixed and final also , the lifted eyebrows and leaden eyelids of<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, his fears fully returned . This incomprehensible man from the fierce council , after all , had certainly pursued him . If the man had one character as a paralytic and another character as a pursuer , the antithesis might make him more interesting , but scarcely more soothing . It would be a very small comfort that he could not find<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>out , if by some serious accident<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>should find him out . He emptied a whole pewter pot of ale before the professor had touched his milk .</p>
    <p n="424">One possibility , however , kept him hopeful and yet helpless . It was just possible that this escapade signified something other than even a slight suspicion of him . Perhaps it was some regular form or sign . Perhaps the foolish scamper was some sort of friendly signal that he ought to have understood . Perhaps it was a ritual . Perhaps the new Thursday was always chased along Cheapside , as the new Lord Mayor is always escorted along it . He was just selecting a tentative inquiry , when the old<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>opposite suddenly and simply cut him short . Before<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>could ask the first diplomatic question , the old anarchist had asked suddenly , without any sort of preparation —</p>
    <p n="425"><said who="#Syme">“ Are you a policeman ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="426">Whatever else<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had expected , he had never expected anything so brutal and actual as this . Even his great presence of mind could only manage a reply with an air of rather blundering jocularity .</p>
    <p n="427"><said who="#Syme">“ A policeman ? ”</said>he said , laughing vaguely .<said who="#Syme">“ Whatever made you think of a policeman in connection with me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="428"><said who="#the_Professor">“ The process was simple enough , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>patiently .<said who="#the_Professor">“ I thought you looked like a policeman . I think so now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="429"><said who="#Syme">“ Did I take a policeman 's hat by mistake out of the restaurant ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, smiling wildly .<said who="#Syme">“ Have I by any chance got a number stuck on to me somewhere ? Have my boots got that watchful look ? Why must I be a policeman ? Do , do let me be a postman . ”</said></p>
    <p n="430">The old<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>shook his head with a gravity that gave no hope , but<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>ran on with a feverish irony .</p>
    <p n="431"><said who="#Syme">“ But perhaps I misunderstood the delicacies of your German philosophy . Perhaps policeman is a relative term . In an evolutionary sense , sir , the ape fades so gradually into the policeman , that I myself can never detect the shade . The monkey is only the policeman that may be . Perhaps a maiden lady on Clapham Common is only the policeman that might have been . I do n't mind being the policeman that might have been . I do n't mind being anything in German thought . ”</said></p>
    <p n="432"><said who="#Syme">“ Are you in the police service ? ”</said>said the old man , ignoring all<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s improvised and desperate raillery .<said who="#Syme">“ Are you a detective ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="433"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s heart turned to stone , but his face never changed .</p>
    <p n="434"><said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ Your suggestion is ridiculous , ”</said>he began .<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ Why on earth — ”</said></p>
    <p n="435">The old man struck his palsied hand passionately on the rickety table , nearly breaking it .</p>
    <p n="436"><said who="#Syme">“ Did you hear me ask a plain question , you pattering spy ? ”</said>he shrieked in a high , crazy voice .<said who="#Syme">“ Are you , or are you not , a police detective ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="437"><said who="#Syme">“ No ! ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, like a man standing on the hangman 's drop .</p>
    <p n="438"><said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ You swear it , ”</said>said the old man , leaning across to him , his dead face becoming as it were loathsomely alive .<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ You swear it ! You swear it ! If you swear falsely , will you be damned ? Will you be sure that the devil dances at your funeral ? Will you see that the nightmare sits on your grave ? Will there really be no mistake ? You are an anarchist , you are a dynamiter ! Above all , you are not in any sense a detective ? You are not in the British police ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="439">He leant his angular elbow far across the table , and put up his large loose hand like a flap to his ear .</p>
    <p n="440"><said who="#Syme">“ I am not in the British police , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with insane calm .</p>
    <p n="441"><persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>fell back in his chair with a curious air of kindly collapse .</p>
    <p n="442"><said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ That 's a pity , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ because I am . ”</said></p>
    <p n="443"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>sprang up straight , sending back the bench behind him with a crash .</p>
    <p n="444"><said who="#Syme">“ Because you are what ? ”</said>he said thickly .<said who="#Syme">“ You are what ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="445"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I am a policeman , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>with his first broad smile . and beaming through his spectacles .<said who="#Syme">“ But as you think policeman only a relative term , of course I have nothing to do with you . I am in the British police force ; but as you tell me you are not in the British police force , I can only say that I met you in a dynamiters ’ club . I suppose I ought to arrest you . ”</said>And with these words he laid on the table before<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>an exact facsimile of the blue card which<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had in his own waistcoat pocket , the symbol of his power from the police .</p>
    <p n="446"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had for a flash the sensation that the cosmos had turned exactly upside down , that all trees were growing downwards and that all stars were under his feet . Then came slowly the opposite conviction . For the last twenty-four hours the cosmos had really been upside down , but now the capsized universe had come right side up again . This devil from whom he had been fleeing all day was only an elder brother of his own house , who on the other side of the table lay back and laughed at him . He did not for the moment ask any questions of detail ; he only knew the happy and silly fact that this shadow , which had pursued him with an intolerable oppression of peril , was only the shadow of a friend trying to catch him up . He knew simultaneously that he was a fool and a free man . For with any recovery from morbidity there must go a certain healthy humiliation . There comes a certain point in such conditions when only three things are possible : first a perpetuation of Satanic pride , secondly tears , and third laughter .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s egotism held hard to the first course for a few seconds , and then suddenly adopted the third . Taking his own blue police ticket from his own waist coat pocket , he tossed it on to the table ; then he flung his head back until his spike of yellow beard almost pointed at the ceiling , and shouted with a barbaric laughter .</p>
    <p n="447">Even in that close den , perpetually filled with the din of knives , plates , cans , clamorous voices , sudden struggles and stampedes , there was something Homeric in<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s mirth which made many half-drunken men look round .</p>
    <p n="448"><said who="#Syme">“ What yer laughing at , guv'nor ? ”</said>asked one wondering labourer from the docks .</p>
    <p n="449"><said who="#Syme">“ At myself , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, and went off again into the agony of his ecstatic reaction .</p>
    <p n="450"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Pull yourself together , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>,<said who="#the_Professor">“ or you 'll get hysterical . Have some more beer . I 'll join you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="451"><said who="#Syme">“ You have n't drunk your milk , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="452"><said who="#the_Professor">“ My milk ! ”</said>said the other , in tones of withering and unfathomable contempt , “ my milk ! Do you think I 'd look at the beastly stuff when I 'm out of sight of the bloody anarchists ? We 're all Christians in this room , though perhaps , ” he added , glancing around at the reeling crowd ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ not strict ones . Finish my milk ? Great blazes ! yes , I 'll finish it right enough ! ”</said>and he knocked the tumbler off the table , making a crash of glass and a splash of silver fluid .</p>
    <p n="453"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was staring at him with a happy curiosity .</p>
    <p n="454"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I understand now , ”</said>he cried ;<said who="#the_Professor">“ of course , you 're not an old man at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="455"><said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ I can n't take my face off here , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>.<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ It 's rather an elaborate make-up . As to whether I 'm an old man , that 's not for me to say . I was thirty-eight last birthday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="456"><said who="#Syme">“ Yes , but I mean , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>impatiently ,<said who="#Syme">“ there 's nothing the matter with you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="457"><said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ Yes , ”</said>answered the other dispassionately .<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ I am subject to colds . ”</said></p>
    <p n="458"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s laughter at all this had about it a wild weakness of relief . He laughed at the idea of the paralytic<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>being really a young actor dressed up as if for the foot-lights . But he felt that he would have laughed as loudly if a pepperpot had fallen over .</p>
    <p n="459">The false<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>drank and wiped his false beard .</p>
    <p n="460"><said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ Did you know , ”</said>he asked ,<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ that that man<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>was one of us ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="461"><said who="#Syme">“ I ? No , I did n't know it , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>in some surprise .<said who="#Syme">“ But did n't you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="462"><said who="#Worms">“ I knew no more than the dead , ”</said>replied the man who called himself de<persName corresp="#Worms">Worms</persName>.<said who="#Worms">“ I thought<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>was talking about me , and I rattled in my boots . ”</said></p>
    <p n="463"><said who="#Syme">“ And I thought he was talking about me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, with his rather reckless laughter .<said who="#Syme">“ I had my hand on my revolver all the time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="464"><said who="#the_Professor">“ So had I , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>grimly ;<said who="#the_Professor">“ so had<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>evidently . ”</said></p>
    <p n="465"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>struck the table with an exclamation .</p>
    <p n="466"><said who="#Syme">“ Why , there were three of us there ! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Syme">“ Three out of seven is a fighting number . If we had only known that we were three ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="467">The face of<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>darkened , and he did not look up .</p>
    <p n="468"><said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ We were three , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ If we had been three hundred we could still have done nothing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="469"><said who="#Syme">“ Not if we were three hundred against four ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, jeering rather boisterously .</p>
    <p n="470"><said who="#the_Professor">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>with sobriety ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ not if we were three hundred against Sunday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="471">And the mere name struck<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>cold and serious ; his laughter had died in his heart before it could die on his lips . The face of the unforgettable President sprang into his mind as startling as a coloured photograph , and he remarked this difference between Sunday and all his satellites , that their faces , however fierce or sinister , became gradually blurred by memory like other human faces , whereas Sunday 's seemed almost to grow more actual during absence , as if a man 's painted portrait should slowly come alive .</p>
    <p n="472">They were both silent for a measure of moments , and then<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s speech came with a rush , like the sudden foaming of champagne .</p>
    <p n="473"><said who="#the_Professor">“<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>, ”</said>he cried ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ it is intolerable . Are you afraid of this man ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="474"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>lifted his heavy lids , and gazed at<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with large , wide-open , blue eyes of an almost ethereal honesty .</p>
    <p n="475"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Yes , I am , ”</said>he said mildly .<said who="#the_Professor">“ So are you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="476"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was dumb for an instant . Then he rose to his feet erect , like an insulted man , and thrust the chair away from him .</p>
    <p n="477"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Yes , ”</said>he said in a voice indescribable ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ you are right . I am afraid of him . Therefore I swear by God that I will seek out this man whom I fear until I find him , and strike him on the mouth . If heaven were his throne and the earth his footstool , I swear that I would pull him down . ”</said></p>
    <p n="478"><said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ How ? ”</said>asked the staring<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>.<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ Why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="479"><said who="#Syme">“ Because I am afraid of him , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>;<said who="#Syme">“ and no man should leave in the universe anything of which he is afraid . ”</said></p>
    <p n="480">De<persName corresp="#Worms">Worms</persName>blinked at him with a sort of blind wonder . He made an effort to speak , but<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>went on in a low voice , but with an undercurrent of inhuman exaltation —</p>
    <p n="481"><said who="#Syme">“ Who would condescend to strike down the mere things that he does not fear ? Who would debase himself to be merely brave , like any common prizefighter ? Who would stoop to be fearless — like a tree ? Fight the thing that you fear . You remember the old tale of the English clergyman who gave the last rites to the brigand of Sicily , and how on his death-bed the great robber said , ‘ I can give you no money , but I can give you advice for a lifetime : your thumb on the blade , and strike upwards . ’ So I say to you , strike upwards , if you strike at the stars . ”</said></p>
    <p n="482">The other looked at the ceiling , one of the tricks of his pose .</p>
    <p n="483"><said who="#Worms">“ Sunday is a fixed star , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="484"><said who="#Syme">“ You shall see him a falling star , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, and put on his hat .</p>
    <p n="485">The decision of his gesture drew<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>vaguely to his feet .</p>
    <p n="486"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Have you any idea , ”</said>he asked , with a sort of benevolent bewilderment ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ exactly where you are going ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="487"><said who="#Syme">“ Yes , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>shortly ,<said who="#Syme">“ I am going to prevent this bomb being thrown in Paris . ”</said></p>
    <p n="488"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Have you any conception how ? ”</said>inquired the other .</p>
    <p n="489"><said who="#Syme">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with equal decision .</p>
    <p n="490"><said who="#Worms">“ You remember , of course , ”</said>resumed the soi-disant de<persName corresp="#Worms">Worms</persName>, pulling his beard and looking out of the window ,<said who="#Worms">“ that when we broke up rather hurriedly the whole arrangements for the atrocity were left in the private hands of the Marquis and<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>. The Marquis is by this time probably crossing the Channel . But where he will go and what he will do it is doubtful whether even<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>knows ; certainly we do n't know . The only man who does know is<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="491"><said who="#Syme">“ Confound it ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ And we do n't know where he is . ”</said></p>
    <p n="492"><said who="#Worms">“ Yes , ”</said>said the other in his curious , absent-minded way ,<said who="#Worms">“ I know where he is myself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="493"><said who="#Syme">“ Will you tell me ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with eager eyes .</p>
    <p n="494"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I will take you there , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, and took down his own hat from a peg .</p>
    <p n="495"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>stood looking at him with a sort of rigid excitement .</p>
    <p n="496"><said who="#Syme">“ What do you mean ? ”</said>he asked sharply .<said who="#Syme">“ Will you join me ? Will you take the risk ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="497"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Young man , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>pleasantly , “ I am amused to observe that you think I am a coward . As to that I will say only one word , and that shall be entirely in the manner of your own philosophical rhetoric . You think that it is possible to pull down<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>. I know that it is impossible , and I am going to try it , ” and opening the tavern door , which let in a blast of bitter air , they went out together into the dark streets by the docks .</p>
    <p n="498">Most of the snow was melted or trampled to mud , but here and there a clot of it still showed grey rather than white in the gloom . The small streets were sloppy and full of pools , which reflected the flaming lamps irregularly , and by accident , like fragments of some other and fallen world .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>felt almost dazed as he stepped through this growing confusion of lights and shadows ; but his companion walked on with a certain briskness , towards where , at the end of the street , an inch or two of the lamplit river looked like a bar of flame .</p>
    <p n="499"><said who="#Syme">“ Where are you going ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>inquired .</p>
    <p n="500"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Just now , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>,<said who="#the_Professor">“ I am going just round the corner to see whether<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>has gone to bed . He is hygienic , and retires early . ”</said></p>
    <p n="501"><said who="#Syme">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ Does he live round the corner ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="502"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ No , ”</said>answered his friend .<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ As a matter of fact he lives some way off , on the other side of the river , but we can tell from here whether he has gone to bed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="503">Turning the corner as he spoke , and facing the dim river , flecked with flame , he pointed with his stick to the other bank . On the Surrey side at this point there ran out into the Thames , seeming almost to overhang it , a bulk and cluster of those tall tenements , dotted with lighted windows , and rising like factory chimneys to an almost insane height . Their special poise and position made one block of buildings especially look like a Tower of Babel with a hundred eyes .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had never seen any of the sky-scraping buildings in America , so he could only think of the buildings in a dream .</p>
    <p n="504">Even as he stared , the highest light in this innumerably lighted turret abruptly went out , as if this black Argus had winked at him with one of his innumerable eyes .</p>
    <p n="505"><persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>swung round on his heel , and struck his stick against his boot .</p>
    <p n="506"><said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ We are too late , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ the hygienic Doctor has gone to bed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="507"><said who="#Syme">“ What do you mean ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ Does he live over there , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="508"><said who="#Worms">“ Yes , ”</said>said de<persName corresp="#Worms">Worms</persName>,<said who="#Worms">“ behind that particular window which you can n't see . Come along and get some dinner . We must call on him tomorrow morning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="509">Without further parley , he led the way through several by-ways until they came out into the flare and clamour of the East India Dock Road .<persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>, who seemed to know his way about the neighbourhood , proceeded to a place where the line of lighted shops fell back into a sort of abrupt twilight and quiet , in which an old white inn , all out of repair , stood back some twenty feet from the road .</p>
    <p n="510"><said who="#the_Professor">“ You can find good English inns left by accident everywhere , like fossils , ”</said>explained<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.<said who="#the_Professor">“ I once found a decent place in the West End . ”</said></p>
    <p n="511"><said who="#Syme">“ I suppose , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, smiling ,<said who="#Syme">“ that this is the corresponding decent place in the East End ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="512"><said who="#the_Professor">“ It is , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>reverently , and went in .</p>
    <p n="513">In that place they dined and slept , both very thoroughly . The beans and bacon , which these unaccountable people cooked well , the astonishing emergence of Burgundy from their cellars , crowned<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s sense of a new comradeship and comfort . Through all this ordeal his root horror had been isolation , and there are no words to express the abyss between isolation and having one ally . It may be conceded to the mathematicians that four is twice two . But two is not twice one ; two is two thousand times one . That is why , in spite of a hundred disadvantages , the world will always return to monogamy .</p>
    <p n="514"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was able to pour out for the first time the whole of his outrageous tale , from the time when<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>had taken him to the little tavern by the river . He did it idly and amply , in a luxuriant monologue , as a man speaks with very old friends . On his side , also , the man who had impersonated<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>was not less communicative . His own story was almost as silly as<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s .</p>
    <p n="515"><said who="#Syme">“ That 's a good get-up of yours , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, draining a glass of Macon ;<said who="#Syme">“ a lot better than old<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>'s . Even at the start I thought he was a bit too hairy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="516"><said who="#the_Professor">“ A difference of artistic theory , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>pensively .<said who="#the_Professor">“<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>was an idealist . He made up as the abstract or platonic ideal of an anarchist . But I am a realist . I am a portrait painter . But , indeed , to say that I am a portrait painter is an inadequate expression . I am a portrait . ”</said></p>
    <p n="517"><said who="#Syme">“ I do n't understand you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="518"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I am a portrait , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.<said who="#the_Professor">“ I am a portrait of the celebrated<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>, who is , I believe , in Naples . ”</said></p>
    <p n="519"><said who="#Syme">“ You mean you are made up like him , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ But does n't he know that you are taking his nose in vain ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="520"><said who="#the_Professor">“ He knows it right enough , ”</said>replied his friend cheerfully .</p>
    <p n="521"><said who="#Syme">“ Then why does n't he denounce you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="522"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I have denounced him , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.</p>
    <p n="523"><said who="#Syme">“ Do explain yourself , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="524"><said who="#the_Professor">“ With pleasure , if you do n't mind hearing my story , ”</said>replied the eminent foreign philosopher .<said who="#the_Professor">“ I am by profession an actor , and my name is Wilks . When I was on the stage I mixed with all sorts of Bohemian and blackguard company . Sometimes I touched the edge of the turf , sometimes the riff-raff of the arts , and occasionally the political refugee . In some den of exiled dreamers I was introduced to the great German Nihilist philosopher ,<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>. I did not gather much about him beyond his appearance , which was very disgusting , and which I studied carefully . I understood that he had proved that the destructive principle in the universe was God ; hence he insisted on the need for a furious and incessant energy , rending all things in pieces . Energy , he said , was the All . He was lame , shortsighted , and partially paralytic . When I met him I was in a frivolous mood , and I disliked him so much that I resolved to imitate him . If I had been a draughtsman I would have drawn a caricature . I was only an actor , I could only act a caricature . I made myself up into what was meant for a wild exaggeration of the old<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>'s dirty old self . When I went into the room full of his supporters I expected to be received with a roar of laughter , or ( if they were too far gone ) with a roar of indignation at the insult . I cannot describe the surprise I felt when my entrance was received with a respectful silence , followed ( when I had first opened my lips ) with a murmur of admiration . The curse of the perfect artist had fallen upon me . I had been too subtle , I had been too true . They thought I really was the great Nihilist<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>. I was a healthy-minded young man at the time , and I confess that it was a blow . Before I could fully recover , however , two or three of these admirers ran up to me radiating indignation , and told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next room . I inquired its nature . It seemed that an impertinent fellow had dressed himself up as a preposterous parody of myself . I had drunk more champagne than was good for me , and in a flash of folly I decided to see the situation through . Consequently it was to meet the glare of the company and my own lifted eyebrows and freezing eyes that the real<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>came into the room .</said></p>
    <p n="525"><said who="#Syme">“ I need hardly say there was a collision . The pessimists all round me looked anxiously from one<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>to the other<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>to see which was really the more feeble . But I won . An old man in poor health , like my rival , could not be expected to be so impressively feeble as a young actor in the prime of life . You see , he really had paralysis , and working within this definite limitation , he could n't be so jolly paralytic as I was . Then he tried to blast my claims intellectually . I countered that by a very simple dodge . Whenever he said something that nobody but he could understand , I replied with something which I could not even understand myself . ‘ I do n't fancy , ’ he said , ‘ that you could have worked out the principle that evolution is only negation , since there inheres in it the introduction of lacuna , which are an essential of differentiation . ’ I replied quite scornfully , ‘ You read all that up in Pinckwerts ; the notion that involution functioned eugenically was exposed long ago by Glumpe . ’ It is unnecessary for me to say that there never were such people as Pinckwerts and Glumpe . But the people all round ( rather to my surprise ) seemed to remember them quite well , and<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, finding that the learned and mysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy slightly deficient in scruples , fell back upon a more popular form of wit . ‘ I see , ’ he sneered , ‘ you prevail like the false pig in Aesop . ’ ‘ And you fail , ’ I answered , smiling , ‘ like the hedgehog in Montaigne . ’ Need I say that there is no hedgehog in Montaigne ? ‘ Your claptrap comes off , ’ he said ; ‘ so would your beard . ’ I had no intelligent answer to this , which was quite true and rather witty . But I laughed heartily , answered , ‘ Like the Pantheist 's boots , ’ at random , and turned on my heel with all the honours of victory . The real<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>was thrown out , but not with violence , though one man tried very patiently to pull off his nose . He is now , I believe , received everywhere in Europe as a delightful impostor . His apparent earnestness and anger , you see , make him all the more entertaining . ”</said></p>
    <p n="526"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ I can understand your putting on his dirty old beard for a night 's practical joke , but I do n't understand your never taking it off again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="527"><said who="#the_impersonator">“ That is the rest of the story , ”</said>said the impersonator .<said who="#the_impersonator">“ When I myself left the company , followed by reverent applause , I went limping down the dark street , hoping that I should soon be far enough away to be able to walk like a human being . To my astonishment , as I was turning the corner , I felt a touch on the shoulder , and turning , found myself under the shadow of an enormous policeman . He told me I was wanted . I struck a sort of paralytic attitude , and cried in a high German accent , ‘ Yes , I am wanted — by the oppressed of the world . You are arresting me on the charge of being the great anarchist ,<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>. ’ The policeman impassively consulted a paper in his hand , ‘ No , sir , ’ he said civilly , ‘ at least , not exactly , sir . I am arresting you on the charge of not being the celebrated anarchist ,<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>. ’ This charge , if it was criminal at all , was certainly the lighter of the two , and I went along with the man , doubtful , but not greatly dismayed . I was shown into a number of rooms , and eventually into the presence of a police officer , who explained that a serious campaign had been opened against the centres of anarchy , and that this , my successful masquerade , might be of considerable value to the public safety . He offered me a good salary and this little blue card . Though our conversation was short , he struck me as a man of very massive common sense and humour ; but I cannot tell you much about him personally , because — ”</said></p>
    <p n="528"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>laid down his knife and fork .</p>
    <p n="529"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I know , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ because you talked to him in a dark room . ”</said></p>
    <p n="530"><persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor de Worms</persName>nodded and drained his glass .</p>

    <p n="531"><said who="#the_Professor">“ BURGUNDY is a jolly thing , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>sadly , as he set his glass down .</p>
    <p n="532"><said who="#Syme">“ You do n't look as if it were , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>;<said who="#Syme">“ you drink it as if it were medicine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="533"><said who="#the_Professor">“ You must excuse my manner , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>dismally ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ my position is rather a curious one . Inside I am really bursting with boyish merriment ; but I acted the paralytic<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>so well , that now I can n't leave off . So that when I am among friends , and have no need at all to disguise myself , I still can n't help speaking slow and wrinkling my forehead — just as if it were my forehead . I can be quite happy , you understand , but only in a paralytic sort of way . The most buoyant exclamations leap up in my heart , but they come out of my mouth quite different . You should hear me say , ‘ Buck up , old cock ! ’ It would bring tears to your eyes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="534"><said who="#Syme">“ It does , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>;<said who="#Syme">“ but I cannot help thinking that apart from all that you are really a bit worried . ”</said></p>
    <p n="535"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>started a little and looked at him steadily .</p>
    <p n="536"><said who="#the_Professor">“ You are a very clever fellow , ”</said>he said , “ it is a pleasure to work with you . Yes , I have rather a heavy cloud in my head . There is a great problem to face , ” and he sank his bald brow in his two hands .</p>
    <p n="537">Then he said in a low voice —</p>
    <p n="538"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Can you play the piano ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="539"><said who="#Syme">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>in simple wonder ,<said who="#Syme">“ I 'm supposed to have a good touch . ”</said></p>
    <p n="540">Then , as the other did not speak , he added —</p>
    <p n="541"><said who="#Syme">“ I trust the great cloud is lifted . ”</said></p>
    <p n="542">After a long silence ,<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>said out of the cavernous shadow of his hands —</p>
    <p n="543"><said who="#the_Professor">“ It would have done just as well if you could work a typewriter . ”</said></p>
    <p n="544"><said who="#Syme">“ Thank you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ you flatter me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="545"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Listen to me , ”</said>said the other ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ and remember whom we have to see tomorrow . You and I are going tomorrow to attempt something which is very much more dangerous than trying to steal the Crown Jewels out of the Tower . We are trying to steal a secret from a very sharp , very strong , and very wicked man . I believe there is no man , except<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>, of course , who is so seriously startling and formidable as that little grinning fellow in goggles . He has not perhaps the white-hot enthusiasm unto death , the mad martyrdom for anarchy , which marks<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>. But then that very fanaticism in<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>has a human pathos , and is almost a redeeming trait . But the little Doctor has a brutal sanity that is more shocking than<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>'s disease . Do n't you notice his detestable virility and vitality . He bounces like an india-rubber ball . Depend on it , Sunday was not asleep ( I wonder if he ever sleeps ? ) when he locked up all the plans of this outrage in the round , black head of<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="546"><said who="#Syme">“ And you think , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ that this unique monster will be soothed if I play the piano to him ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="547"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Do n't be an ass , ”</said>said his mentor .<said who="#the_Professor">“ I mentioned the piano because it gives one quick and independent fingers .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, if we are to go through this interview and come out sane or alive , we must have some code of signals between us that this brute will not see . I have made a rough alphabetical cypher corresponding to the five fingers — like this , see , ”</said>and he rippled with his fingers on the wooden table —<said who="#the_Professor">“ B A D , bad , a word we may frequently require . ”</said></p>
    <p n="548"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>poured himself out another glass of wine , and began to study the scheme . He was abnormally quick with his brains at puzzles , and with his hands at conjuring , and it did not take him long to learn how he might convey simple messages by what would seem to be idle taps upon a table or knee . But wine and companionship had always the effect of inspiring him to a farcical ingenuity , and<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>soon found himself struggling with the too vast energy of the new language , as it passed through the heated brain of<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="549"><said who="#Syme">“ We must have several word-signs , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>seriously —<said who="#Syme">“ words that we are likely to want , fine shades of meaning . My favourite word is ‘ coeval ’ . What 's yours ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="550"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Do stop playing the goat , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>plaintively .<said who="#the_Professor">“ You do n't know how serious this is . ”</said></p>
    <p n="551"><said who="#Syme">“ ‘ Lush ’ too , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, shaking his head sagaciously ,<said who="#Syme">“ we must have ‘ lush ’ — word applied to grass , do n't you know ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="552"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Do you imagine , ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>furiously ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ that we are going to talk to<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>about grass ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="553"><said who="#Syme">“ There are several ways in which the subject could be approached , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>reflectively ,<said who="#Syme">“ and the word introduced without appearing forced . We might say , ‘<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, as a revolutionist , you remember that a tyrant once advised us to eat grass ; and indeed many of us , looking on the fresh lush grass of summer ... ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="554"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Do you understand , ”</said>said the other ,<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ that this is a tragedy ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="555"><said who="#Syme">“ Perfectly , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>;<said who="#Syme">“ always be comic in a tragedy . What the deuce else can you do ? I wish this language of yours had a wider scope . I suppose we could not extend it from the fingers to the toes ? That would involve pulling off our boots and socks during the conversation , which however unobtrusively performed — ”</said></p>
    <p n="556"><said who="#the_Professor">“<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, ”</said>said his friend with a stern simplicity ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ go to bed ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="557"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, however , sat up in bed for a considerable time mastering the new code . He was awakened next morning while the east was still sealed with darkness , and found his grey-bearded ally standing like a ghost beside his bed .</p>
    <p n="558"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>sat up in bed blinking ; then slowly collected his thoughts , threw off the bed-clothes , and stood up . It seemed to him in some curious way that all the safety and sociability of the night before fell with the bedclothes off him , and he stood up in an air of cold danger . He still felt an entire trust and loyalty towards his companion ; but it was the trust between two men going to the scaffold .</p>
    <p n="559"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with a forced cheerfulness as he pulled on his trousers ,<said who="#Syme">“ I dreamt of that alphabet of yours . Did it take you long to make it up ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="560"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>made no answer , but gazed in front of him with eyes the colour of a wintry sea ; so<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>repeated his question .</p>
    <p n="561"><said who="#Syme">“ I say , did it take you long to invent all this ? I 'm considered good at these things , and it was a good hour 's grind . Did you learn it all on the spot ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="562"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>was silent ; his eyes were wide open , and he wore a fixed but very small smile .</p>
    <p n="563"><said who="#the_Professor">“ How long did it take you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="564"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>did not move .</p>
    <p n="565"><said who="#Syme">“ Confound you , can n't you answer ? ”</said>called out<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, in a sudden anger that had something like fear underneath . Whether or no<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>could answer , he did not .</p>
    <p n="566"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>stood staring back at the stiff face like parchment and the blank , blue eyes . His first thought was that<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>had gone mad , but his second thought was more frightful . After all , what did he know about this queer creature whom he had heedlessly accepted as a friend ? What did he know , except that the man had been at the anarchist breakfast and had told him a ridiculous tale ? How improbable it was that there should be another friend there beside<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>! Was this man 's silence a sensational way of declaring war ? Was this adamantine stare after all only the awful sneer of some threefold traitor , who had turned for the last time ? He stood and strained his ears in this heartless silence . He almost fancied he could hear dynamiters come to capture him shifting softly in the corridor outside .</p>
    <p n="567">Then his eye strayed downwards , and he burst out laughing . Though<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>himself stood there as voiceless as a statue , his five dumb fingers were dancing alive upon the dead table .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>watched the twinkling movements of the talking hand , and read clearly the message —</p>
    <p n="568"><said who="#Syme">“ I will only talk like this . We must get used to it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="569">He rapped out the answer with the impatience of relief —</p>
    <p n="570"><said who="#Syme">“ All right . Let 's get out to breakfast . ”</said></p>
    <p n="571">They took their hats and sticks in silence ; but as<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>took his sword-stick , he held it hard .</p>
    <p n="572">They paused for a few minutes only to stuff down coffee and coarse thick sandwiches at a coffee stall , and then made their way across the river , which under the grey and growing light looked as desolate as Acheron . They reached the bottom of the huge block of buildings which they had seen from across the river , and began in silence to mount the naked and numberless stone steps , only pausing now and then to make short remarks on the rail of the banisters . At about every other flight they passed a window ; each window showed them a pale and tragic dawn lifting itself laboriously over London . From each the innumerable roofs of slate looked like the leaden surges of a grey , troubled sea after rain .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was increasingly conscious that his new adventure had somehow a quality of cold sanity worse than the wild adventures of the past . Last night , for instance , the tall tenements had seemed to him like a tower in a dream . As he now went up the weary and perpetual steps , he was daunted and bewildered by their almost infinite series . But it was not the hot horror of a dream or of anything that might be exaggeration or delusion . Their infinity was more like the empty infinity of arithmetic , something unthinkable , yet necessary to thought . Or it was like the stunning statements of astronomy about the distance of the fixed stars . He was ascending the house of reason , a thing more hideous than unreason itself .</p>
    <p n="573">By the time they reached<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>'s landing , a last window showed them a harsh , white dawn edged with banks of a kind of coarse red , more like red clay than red cloud . And when they entered<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>'s bare garret it was full of light .</p>
    <p n="574"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had been haunted by a half historic memory in connection with these empty rooms and that austere daybreak . The moment he saw the garret and<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>sitting writing at a table , he remembered what the memory was — the French Revolution . There should have been the black outline of a guillotine against that heavy red and white of the morning .<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>was in his white shirt and black breeches only ; his cropped , dark head might well have just come out of its wig ; he might have been Marat or a more slipshod Robespierre .</p>
    <p n="575">Yet when he was seen properly , the French fancy fell away . The Jacobins were idealists ; there was about this man a murderous materialism . His position gave him a somewhat new appearance . The strong , white light of morning coming from one side creating sharp shadows , made him seem both more pale and more angular than he had looked at the breakfast on the balcony . Thus the two black glasses that encased his eyes might really have been black cavities in his skull , making him look like a death'shYpppHeNhead . And , indeed , if ever Death himself sat writing at a wooden table , it might have been he .</p>
    <p n="576">He looked up and smiled brightly enough as the men came in , and rose with the resilient rapidity of which<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>had spoken . He set chairs for both of them , and going to a peg behind the door , proceeded to put on a coat and waistcoat of rough , dark tweed ; he buttoned it up neatly , and came back to sit down at his table .</p>
    <p n="577">The quiet good humour of his manner left his two opponents helpless . It was with some momentary difficulty that<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>broke silence and began , “ I 'm sorry to disturb you so early , comrade , ” said he , with a careful resumption of the slow de<persName corresp="#Worms">Worms</persName>manner .<said who="#Worms">“ You have no doubt made all the arrangements for the Paris affair ? ”</said>Then he added with infinite slowness ,<said who="#Worms">“ We have information which renders intolerable anything in the nature of a moment 's delay . ”</said></p>
    <p n="578"><persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>smiled again , but continued to gaze on them without speaking .<persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>resumed , a pause before each weary word —</p>
    <p n="579"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Please do not think me excessively abrupt ; but I advise you to alter those plans , or if it is too late for that , to follow your agent with all the support you can get for him .<persName>Comrade Syme</persName>and I have had an experience which it would take more time to recount than we can afford , if we are to act on it . I will , however , relate the occurrence in detail , even at the risk of losing time , if you really feel that it is essential to the understanding of the problem we have to discuss . ”</said></p>
    <p n="580">He was spinning out his sentences , making them intolerably long and lingering , in the hope of maddening the practical little Doctor into an explosion of impatience which might show his hand . But the little Doctor continued only to stare and smile , and the monologue was uphill work .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>began to feel a new sickness and despair . The Doctor 's smile and silence were not at all like the cataleptic stare and horrible silence which he had confronted in<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>half an hour before . About<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>'s makeup and all his antics there was always something merely grotesque , like a gollywog .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>remembered those wild woes of yesterday as one remembers being afraid of Bogy in childhood . But here was daylight ; here was a healthy , square-shouldered man in tweeds , not odd save for the accident of his ugly spectacles , not glaring or grinning at all , but smiling steadily and not saying a word . The whole had a sense of unbearable reality . Under the increasing sunlight the colours of the Doctor 's complexion , the pattern of his tweeds , grew and expanded outrageously , as such things grow too important in a realistic novel . But his smile was quite slight , the pose of his head polite ; the only uncanny thing was his silence .</p>
    <p n="581"><said who="#the_Professor">“ As I say , ”</said>resumed<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, like a man toiling through heavy sand ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ the incident that has occurred to us and has led us to ask for information about the Marquis , is one which you may think it better to have narrated ; but as it came in the way of<persName>Comrade Syme</persName>rather than me — ”</said></p>
    <p n="582">His words he seemed to be dragging out like words in an anthem ; but<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, who was watching , saw his long fingers rattle quickly on the edge of the crazy table . He read the message ,<said who="#Syme">“ You must go on . This devil has sucked me dry ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="583"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>plunged into the breach with that bravado of improvisation which always came to him when he was alarmed .</p>
    <p n="584"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Yes , the thing really happened to me , ”</said>he said hastily .<said who="#the_Professor">“ I had the good fortune to fall into conversation with a detective who took me , thanks to my hat , for a respectable person . Wishing to clinch my reputation for respectability , I took him and made him very drunk at the Savoy . Under this influence he became friendly , and told me in so many words that within a day or two they hope to arrest the Marquis in France .</said></p>
    <p n="585"><said who="#Syme">“ So unless you or I can get on his track — ”</said></p>
    <p n="586">The Doctor was still smiling in the most friendly way , and his protected eyes were still impenetrable .<persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>signalled to<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>that he would resume his explanation , and he began again with the same elaborate calm .</p>
    <p n="587"><said who="#the_Professor">“<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>immediately brought this information to me , and we came here together to see what use you would be inclined to make of it . It seems to me unquestionably urgent that — ”</said></p>
    <p n="588">All this time<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had been staring at the Doctor almost as steadily as the Doctor stared at<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, but quite without the smile . The nerves of both comrades-in-arms were near snapping under that strain of motionless amiability , when<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>suddenly leant forward and idly tapped the edge of the table . His message to his ally ran ,<said who="#Syme">“ I have an intuition . ”</said></p>
    <p n="589"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>, with scarcely a pause in his monologue , signalled back ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ Then sit on it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="590"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>telegraphed ,<said who="#Syme">“ It is quite extraordinary . ”</said></p>
    <p n="591">The other answered ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ Extraordinary rot ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="592"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>said ,<said who="#Syme">“ I am a poet . ”</said></p>
    <p n="593">The other retorted ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ You are a dead man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="594"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had gone quite red up to his yellow hair , and his eyes were burning feverishly . As he said he had an intuition , and it had risen to a sort of lightheaded certainty . Resuming his symbolic taps , he signalled to his friend ,<said who="#Syme">“ You scarcely realise how poetic my intuition is . It has that sudden quality we sometimes feel in the coming of spring . ”</said></p>
    <p n="595">He then studied the answer on his friend 's fingers . The answer was ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ Go to hell ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="596"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>then resumed his merely verbal monologue addressed to the Doctor .</p>
    <p n="597"><said who="#Syme">“ Perhaps I should rather say , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>on his fingers ,<said who="#Syme">“ that it resembles that sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the heart of lush woods . ”</said></p>
    <p n="598">His companion disdained to reply .</p>
    <p n="599"><said who="#Syme">“ Or yet again , ”</said>tapped<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ it is positive , as is the passionate red hair of a beautiful woman . ”</said></p>
    <p n="600"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>was continuing his speech , but in the middle of it<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>decided to act . He leant across the table , and said in a voice that could not be neglected —</p>
    <p n="601"><said who="#Syme">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="602">The Doctor 's sleek and smiling head did not move , but they could have sworn that under his dark glasses his eyes darted towards<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="603"><said who="#Syme">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, in a voice peculiarly precise and courteous ,<said who="#Syme">“ would you do me a small favour ? Would you be so kind as to take off your spectacles ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="604"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>swung round on his seat , and stared at<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with a sort of frozen fury of astonishment .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, like a man who has thrown his life and fortune on the table , leaned forward with a fiery face . The Doctor did not move .</p>
    <p n="605">For a few seconds there was a silence in which one could hear a pin drop , split once by the single hoot of a distant steamer on the Thames . Then<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>rose slowly , still smiling , and took off his spectacles .</p>
    <p n="606"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>sprang to his feet , stepping backwards a little , like a chemical lecturer from a successful explosion . His eyes were like stars , and for an instant he could only point without speaking .</p>
    <p n="607"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>had also started to his feet , forgetful of his supposed paralysis . He leant on the back of the chair and stared doubtfully at<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, as if the Doctor had been turned into a toad before his eyes . And indeed it was almost as great a transformation scene .</p>
    <p n="608">The two detectives saw sitting in the chair before them a very boyish-looking young man , with very frank and happy hazel eyes , an open expression , cockney clothes like those of a city clerk , and an unquestionable breath about him of being very good and rather commonplace . The smile was still there , but it might have been the first smile of a baby .</p>
    <p n="609"><said who="#Syme">“ I knew I was a poet , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>in a sort of ecstasy .<said who="#Syme">“ I knew my intuition was as infallible as the Pope . It was the spectacles that did it ! It was all the spectacles . Given those beastly black eyes , and all the rest of him his health and his jolly looks , made him a live devil among dead ones . ”</said></p>
    <p n="610"><said who="#the_Professor">“ It certainly does make a queer difference , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>shakily .<said who="#the_Professor">“ But as regards the project of<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="611"><said who="#Syme">“ Project be damned ! ”</said>roared<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, beside himself .<said who="#Syme">“ Look at him ! Look at his face , look at his collar , look at his blessed boots ! You do n't suppose , do you , that that thing 's an anarchist ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="612"><said who="#the_Professor">“<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>! ”</said>cried the other in an apprehensive agony .</p>
    <p n="613"><said who="#Syme">“ Why , by God , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, “ I 'll take the risk of that myself !<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, I am a police officer . There 's my card , ” and he flung down the blue card upon the table .</p>
    <p n="614"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>still feared that all was lost ; but he was loyal . He pulled out his own official card and put it beside his friend 's . Then the third man burst out laughing , and for the first time that morning they heard his voice .</p>
    <p n="615"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I 'm awfully glad you chaps have come so early , ”</said>he said , with a sort of schoolboy flippancy , “ for we can all start for France together . Yes , I 'm in the force right enough , ” and he flicked a blue card towards them lightly as a matter of form .</p>
    <p n="616">Clapping a brisk bowler on his head and resuming his goblin glasses , the Doctor moved so quickly towards the door , that the others instinctively followed him .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>seemed a little distrait , and as he passed under the doorway he suddenly struck his stick on the stone passage so that it rang .</p>
    <p n="617"><said who="#the_Professor">“ But Lord God Almighty , ”</said>he cried out ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ if this is all right , there were more damned detectives than there were damned dynamiters at the damned Council ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="618"><said who="#Bull">“ We might have fought easily , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>;<said who="#Bull">“ we were four against three . ”</said></p>
    <p n="619"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>was descending the stairs , but his voice came up from below .</p>
    <p n="620"><said who="#the_Professor">“ No , ”</said>said the voice ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ we were not four against three — we were not so lucky . We were four against One . ”</said></p>
    <p n="621">The others went down the stairs in silence .</p>
    <p n="622">The young man called<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>, with an innocent courtesy characteristic of him , insisted on going last until they reached the street ; but there his own robust rapidity asserted itself unconsciously , and he walked quickly on ahead towards a railway inquiry office , talking to the others over his shoulder .</p>
    <p n="623"><said who="#Bull">“ It is jolly to get some pals , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Bull">“ I 've been half dead with the jumps , being quite alone . I nearly flung my arms round<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>and embraced him , which would have been imprudent . I hope you wo n't despise me for having been in a blue funk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="624"><said who="#Syme">“ All the blue devils in blue hell , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ contributed to my blue funk ! But the worst devil was you and your infernal goggles . ”</said></p>
    <p n="625">The young man laughed delightedly .</p>
    <p n="626"><said who="#Syme">“ Was n't it a rag ? ”</said>he said .<said who="#Syme">“ Such a simple idea — not my own . I have n't got the brains . You see , I wanted to go into the detective service , especially the anti-dynamite business . But for that purpose they wanted someone to dress up as a dynamiter ; and they all swore by blazes that I could never look like a dynamiter . They said my very walk was respectable , and that seen from behind I looked like the British Constitution . They said I looked too healthy and too optimistic , and too reliable and benevolent ; they called me all sorts of names at Scotland Yard . They said that if I had been a criminal , I might have made my fortune by looking so like an honest man ; but as I had the misfortune to be an honest man , there was not even the remotest chance of my assisting them by ever looking like a criminal . But at last I was brought before some old josser who was high up in the force , and who seemed to have no end of a head on his shoulders . And there the others all talked hopelessly . One asked whether a bushy beard would hide my nice smile ; another said that if they blacked my face I might look like a negro anarchist ; but this old chap chipped in with a most extraordinary remark . ‘ A pair of smoked spectacles will do it , ’ he said positively . ‘ Look at him now ; he looks like an angelic office boy . Put him on a pair of smoked spectacles , and children will scream at the sight of him . ’ And so it was , by George ! When once my eyes were covered , all the rest , smile and big shoulders and short hair , made me look a perfect little devil . As I say , it was simple enough when it was done , like miracles ; but that was n't the really miraculous part of it . There was one really staggering thing about the business , and my head still turns at it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="627"><said who="#Syme">“ What was that ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="628"><said who="#Bull">“ I 'll tell you , ”</said>answered the man in spectacles .<said who="#Bull">“ This big pot in the police who sized me up so that he knew how the goggles would go with my hair and socks — by God , he never saw me at all ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="629"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s eyes suddenly flashed on him .</p>
    <p n="630"><said who="#Syme">“ How was that ? ”</said>he asked .<said who="#Syme">“ I thought you talked to him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="631"><said who="#Bull">“ So I did , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>brightly ;<said who="#Bull">“ but we talked in a pitch-dark room like a coalcellar . There , you would never have guessed that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="632"><said who="#Syme">“ I could not have conceived it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>gravely .</p>
    <p n="633"><said who="#the_Professor">“ It is indeed a new idea , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.</p>
    <p n="634">Their new ally was in practical matters a whirlwind . At the inquiry office he asked with businesslike brevity about the trains for Dover . Having got his information , he bundled the company into a cab , and put them and himself inside a railway carriage before they had properly realised the breathless process . They were already on the Calais boat before conversation flowed freely .</p>
    <p n="635"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I had already arranged , ”</said>he explained ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ to go to France for my lunch ; but I am delighted to have someone to lunch with me . You see , I had to send that beast , the Marquis , over with his bomb , because<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>had his eye on me , though God knows how . I 'll tell you the story some day . It was perfectly choking . Whenever I tried to slip out of it I saw<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>somewhere , smiling out of the bow-window of a club , or taking off his hat to me from the top of an omnibus . I tell you , you can say what you like , that fellow sold himself to the devil ; he can be in six places at once . ”</said></p>
    <p n="636"><said who="#the_Professor">“ So you sent the Marquis off , I understand , ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.<said who="#the_Professor">“ Was it long ago ? Shall we be in time to catch him ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="637"><said who="#Syme">“ Yes , ”</said>answered the new guide ,<said who="#Syme">“ I 've timed it all . He 'll still be at Calais when we arrive . ”</said></p>
    <p n="638"><said who="#the_Professor">“ But when we do catch him at Calais , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>,<said who="#the_Professor">“ what are we going to do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="639">At this question the countenance of<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>fell for the first time . He reflected a little , and then said —</p>
    <p n="640"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Theoretically , I suppose , we ought to call the police . ”</said></p>
    <p n="641"><said who="#Syme">“ Not I , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ Theoretically I ought to drown myself first . I promised a poor fellow , who was a real modern pessimist , on my word of honour not to tell the police . I 'm no hand at casuistry , but I can n't break my word to a modern pessimist . It 's like breaking one 's word to a child . ”</said></p>
    <p n="642"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I 'm in the same boat , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.<said who="#the_Professor">“ I tried to tell the police and I could n't , because of some silly oath I took . You see , when I was an actor I was a sort of all-round beast . Perjury or treason is the only crime I have n't committed . If I did that I should n't know the difference between right and wrong . ”</said></p>
    <p n="643"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ I 've been through all that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>,<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ and I 've made up my mind . I gave my promise to<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>— you know him , man who smiles upside down . My friends , that man is the most utterly unhappy man that was ever human . It may be his digestion , or his conscience , or his nerves , or his philosophy of the universe , but he 's damned , he 's in hell ! Well , I can n't turn on a man like that , and hunt him down . It 's like whipping a leper . I may be mad , but that 's how I feel ; and there 's jolly well the end of it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="644"><said who="#Syme">“ I do n't think you 're mad , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ I knew you would decide like that when first you — ”</said></p>
    <p n="645"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Eh ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>.</p>
    <p n="646"><said who="#Syme">“ When first you took off your spectacles . ”</said></p>
    <p n="647"><persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>smiled a little , and strolled across the deck to look at the sunlit sea . Then he strolled back again , kicking his heels carelessly , and a companionable silence fell between the three men .</p>
    <p n="648"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ it seems that we have all the same kind of morality or immorality , so we had better face the fact that comes of it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="649"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Yes , ”</said>assented<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>,<said who="#the_Professor">“ you 're quite right ; and we must hurry up , for I can see the Grey Nose standing out from France . ”</said></p>
    <p n="650"><said who="#Syme">“ The fact that comes of it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>seriously ,<said who="#Syme">“ is this , that we three are alone on this planet .<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>has gone , God knows where ; perhaps<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>has smashed him like a fly . On the Council we are three men against three , like the Romans who held the bridge . But we are worse off than that , first because they can appeal to their organization and we cannot appeal to ours , and second because — ”</said></p>
    <p n="651"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Because one of those other three men , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>,<said who="#the_Professor">“ is not a man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="652"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>nodded and was silent for a second or two , then he said —</p>
    <p n="653"><said who="#Syme">“ My idea is this . We must do something to keep the Marquis in Calais till tomorrow midday . I have turned over twenty schemes in my head . We cannot denounce him as a dynamiter ; that is agreed . We cannot get him detained on some trivial charge , for we should have to appear ; he knows us , and he would smell a rat . We cannot pretend to keep him on anarchist business ; he might swallow much in that way , but not the notion of stopping in Calais while the Czar went safely through Paris . We might try to kidnap him , and lock him up ourselves ; but he is a well-known man here . He has a whole bodyguard of friends ; he is very strong and brave , and the event is doubtful . The only thing I can see to do is actually to take advantage of the very things that are in the Marquis 's favour . I am going to profit by the fact that he is a highly respected nobleman . I am going to profit by the fact that he has many friends and moves in the best society . ”</said></p>
    <p n="654"><said who="#the_Professor">“ What the devil are you talking about ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.</p>
    <p n="655"><said who="#Syme">“ The Symes are first mentioned in the fourteenth century , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>;<said who="#Syme">“ but there is a tradition that one of them rode behind Bruce at Bannockburn . Since 1350 the tree is quite clear . ”</said></p>
    <p n="656"><said who="#the_Professor">“ He 's gone off his head , ”</said>said the little Doctor , staring .</p>
    <p n="657"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Our bearings , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>calmly ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ are ‘ argent a chevron gules charged with three cross crosslets of the field . ’ The motto varies . ”</said></p>
    <p n="658"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>seized<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>roughly by the waistcoat .</p>
    <p n="659"><said who="#the_Professor">“ We are just inshore , ”</said>he said .<said who="#the_Professor">“ Are you seasick or joking in the wrong place ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="660"><said who="#Syme">“ My remarks are almost painfully practical , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, in an unhurried manner .<said who="#Syme">“ The house of St. Eustache also is very ancient . The Marquis cannot deny that he is a gentleman . He cannot deny that I am a gentleman . And in order to put the matter of my social position quite beyond a doubt , I propose at the earliest opportunity to knock his hat off . But here we are in the harbour . ”</said></p>
    <p n="661">They went on shore under the strong sun in a sort of daze .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, who had now taken the lead as<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>had taken it in London , led them along a kind of marine parade until he came to some cafes , embowered in a bulk of greenery and overlooking the sea . As he went before them his step was slightly swaggering , and he swung his stick like a sword . He was making apparently for the extreme end of the line of cafes , but he stopped abruptly . With a sharp gesture he motioned them to silence , but he pointed with one gloved finger to a cafe table under a bank of flowering foliage at which sat the Marquis de St. Eustache , his teeth shining in his thick , black beard , and his bold , brown face shadowed by a light yellow straw hat and outlined against the violet sea .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="10">
    <p n="662">SYME sat down at a cafe table with his companions , his blue eyes sparkling like the bright sea below , and ordered a bottle of Saumur with a pleased impatience . He was for some reason in a condition of curious hilarity . His spirits were already unnaturally high ; they rose as the Saumur sank , and in half an hour his talk was a torrent of nonsense . He professed to be making out a plan of the conversation which was going to ensue between himself and the deadly Marquis . He jotted it down wildly with a pencil . It was arranged like a printed catechism , with questions and answers , and was delivered with an extraordinary rapidity of utterance .</p>
    <p n="663"><said>“ I shall approach . Before taking off his hat , I shall take off my own . I shall say , ‘ The Marquis de Saint Eustache , I believe . ’ He will say , ‘ The celebrated<persName corresp="#Mr._Syme">Mr. Syme</persName>, I presume . ’ He will say in the most exquisite French , ‘ How are you ? ’ I shall reply in the most exquisite Cockney , ‘ Oh , just the<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>— ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="664"><said>“ Oh , shut it , ”</said>said the man in spectacles .<said>“ Pull yourself together , and chuck away that bit of paper . What are you really going to do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="665"><said who="#Syme">“ But it was a lovely catechism , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>pathetically .<said who="#Syme">“ Do let me read it you . It has only forty-three questions and answers , and some of the Marquis 's answers are wonderfully witty . I like to be just to my enemy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="666"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ But what 's the good of it all ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>in exasperation .</p>
    <p n="667"><said who="#Syme">“ It leads up to my challenge , do n't you see , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, beaming .<said who="#Syme">“ When the Marquis has given the thirty-ninth reply , which runs — ”</said></p>
    <p n="668"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Has it by any chance occurred to you , ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, with a ponderous simplicity ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ that the Marquis may not say all the forty-three things you have put down for him ? In that case , I understand , your own epigrams may appear somewhat more forced . ”</said></p>
    <p n="669"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>struck the table with a radiant face .</p>
    <p n="670"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Why , how true that is , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ and I never thought of it . Sir , you have an intellect beyond the common . You will make a name . ”</said></p>
    <p n="671"><said who="#Syme">“ Oh , you 're as drunk as an owl ! ”</said>said the Doctor .</p>
    <p n="672"><said who="#Syme">“ It only remains , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>quite unperturbed ,<said who="#Syme">“ to adopt some other method of breaking the ice ( if I may so express it ) between myself and the man I wish to kill . And since the course of a dialogue cannot be predicted by one of its parties alone ( as you have pointed out with such recondite acumen ) , the only thing to be done , I suppose , is for the one party , as far as possible , to do all the dialogue by himself . And so I will , by George ! ”</said>And he stood up suddenly , his yellow hair blowing in the slight sea breeze .</p>
    <p n="673">A band was playing in a cafe chantant hidden somewhere among the trees , and a woman had just stopped singing . On<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s heated head the bray of the brass band seemed like the jar and jingle of that barrel-organ in Leicester Square , to the tune of which he had once stood up to die . He looked across to the little table where the Marquis sat . The man had two companions now , solemn Frenchmen in frock-coats and silk hats , one of them with the red rosette of the Legion of Honour , evidently people of a solid social position . Besides these black , cylindrical costumes , the Marquis , in his loose straw hat and light spring clothes , looked Bohemian and even barbaric ; but he looked the Marquis . Indeed , one might say that he looked the king , with his animal elegance , his scornful eyes , and his proud head lifted against the purple sea . But he was no Christian king , at any rate ; he was , rather , some swarthy despot , half Greek , half Asiatic , who in the days when slavery seemed natural looked down on the Mediterranean , on his galley and his groaning slaves . Just so ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>thought , would the brown-gold face of such a tyrant have shown against the dark green olives and the burning blue .</p>
    <p n="674"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Are you going to address the meeting ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>peevishly , seeing that<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>still stood up without moving .</p>
    <p n="675"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>drained his last glass of sparkling wine .</p>
    <p n="676"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I am , ”</said>he said , pointing across to the Marquis and his companions ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ that meeting . That meeting displeases me . I am going to pull that meeting 's great ugly , mahogany-coloured nose . ”</said></p>
    <p n="677">He stepped across swiftly , if not quite steadily . The Marquis , seeing him , arched his black Assyrian eyebrows in surprise , but smiled politely .</p>
    <p n="678"><said who="#the_Professor">“ You are<persName corresp="#Mr._Syme">Mr. Syme</persName>, I think , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="679"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>bowed .</p>
    <p n="680"><said who="#the_Professor">“ And you are the Marquis de Saint Eustache , ”</said>he said gracefully .<said who="#the_Professor">“ Permit me to pull your nose . ”</said></p>
    <p n="681">He leant over to do so , but the Marquis started backwards , upsetting his chair , and the two men in top hats held<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>back by the shoulders .</p>
    <p n="682"><said who="#Syme">“ This man has insulted me ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, with gestures of explanation .</p>
    <p n="683"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Insulted you ? ”</said>cried the gentleman with the red rosette ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ when ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="684"><said who="#Syme">“ Oh , just now , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>recklessly .<said who="#Syme">“ He insulted my mother . ”</said></p>
    <p n="685"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Insulted your mother ! ”</said>exclaimed the gentleman incredulously .</p>
    <p n="686"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , anyhow , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, conceding a point ,<said who="#Syme">“ my aunt . ”</said></p>
    <p n="687"><said who="#the_Professor">“ But how can the Marquis have insulted your aunt just now ? ”</said>said the second gentleman with some legitimate wonder .<said who="#the_Professor">“ He has been sitting here all the time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="688"><said who="#Syme">“ Ah , it was what he said ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>darkly .</p>
    <p n="689"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I said nothing at all , ”</said>said the Marquis ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ except something about the band . I only said that I liked Wagner played well . ”</said></p>
    <p n="690"><said who="#Syme">“ It was an allusion to my family , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>firmly .<said who="#Syme">“ My aunt played Wagner badly . It was a painful subject . We are always being insulted about it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="691"><said who="#the_Professor">“ This seems most extraordinary , ”</said>said the gentleman who was decore , looking doubtfully at the Marquis .</p>
    <p n="692"><said who="#Syme">“ Oh , I assure you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>earnestly ,<said who="#Syme">“ the whole of your conversation was simply packed with sinister allusions to my aunt 's weaknesses . ”</said></p>
    <p n="693"><said who="#the_Professor">“ This is nonsense ! ”</said>said the second gentleman .<said who="#the_Professor">“ I for one have said nothing for half an hour except that I liked the singing of that girl with black hair . ”</said></p>
    <p n="694"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , there you are again ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>indignantly .<said who="#Syme">“ My aunt 's was red . ”</said></p>
    <p n="695"><said who="#the_Professor">“ It seems to me , ”</said>said the other ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ that you are simply seeking a pretext to insult the Marquis . ”</said></p>
    <p n="696"><said who="#Syme">“ By George ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, facing round and looking at him ,<said who="#Syme">“ what a clever chap you are ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="697">The Marquis started up with eyes flaming like a tiger 's .</p>
    <p n="698"><said who="#Syme">“ Seeking a quarrel with me ! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Syme">“ Seeking a fight with me ! By God ! there was never a man who had to seek long . These gentlemen will perhaps act for me . There are still four hours of daylight . Let us fight this evening . ”</said></p>
    <p n="699"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>bowed with a quite beautiful graciousness .</p>
    <p n="700"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Marquis , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ your action is worthy of your fame and blood . Permit me to consult for a moment with the gentlemen in whose hands I shall place myself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="701">In three long strides he rejoined his companions , and they , who had seen his champagne-inspired attack and listened to his idiotic explanations , were quite startled at the look of him . For now that he came back to them he was quite sober , a little pale , and he spoke in a low voice of passionate practicality .</p>
    <p n="702"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I have done it , ”</said>he said hoarsely .<said who="#the_Professor">“ I have fixed a fight on the beast . But look here , and listen carefully . There is no time for talk . You are my seconds , and everything must come from you . Now you must insist , and insist absolutely , on the duel coming off after seven tomorrow , so as to give me the chance of preventing him from catching the 7. 45 for Paris . If he misses that he misses his crime . He can n't refuse to meet you on such a small point of time and place . But this is what he will do . He will choose a field somewhere near a wayside station , where he can pick up the train . He is a very good swordsman , and he will trust to killing me in time to catch it . But I can fence well too , and I think I can keep him in play , at any rate , until the train is lost . Then perhaps he may kill me to console his feelings . You understand ? Very well then , let me introduce you to some charming friends of mine , ”</said>and leading them quickly across the parade , he presented them to the Marquis 's seconds by two very aristocratic names of which they had not previously heard .</p>
    <p n="703"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was subject to spasms of singular common sense , not otherwise a part of his character . They were ( as he said of his impulse about the spectacles ) poetic intuitions , and they sometimes rose to the exaltation of prophecy .</p>
    <p n="704">He had correctly calculated in this case the policy of his opponent . When the Marquis was informed by his seconds that<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>could only fight in the morning , he must fully have realised that an obstacle had suddenly arisen between him and his bomb-throwing business in the capital . Naturally he could not explain this objection to his friends , so he chose the course which<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had predicted . He induced his seconds to settle on a small meadow not far from the railway , and he trusted to the fatality of the first engagement .</p>
    <p n="705">When he came down very coolly to the field of honour , no one could have guessed that he had any anxiety about a journey ; his hands were in his pockets , his straw hat on the back of his head , his handsome face brazen in the sun . But it might have struck a stranger as odd that there appeared in his train , not only his seconds carrying the sword-case , but two of his servants carrying a portmanteau and a luncheon basket .</p>
    <p n="706">Early as was the hour , the sun soaked everything in warmth , and<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was vaguely surprised to see so many spring flowers burning gold and silver in the tall grass in which the whole company stood almost knee-deep .</p>
    <p n="707">With the exception of the Marquis , all the men were in sombre and solemn morning-dress , with hats like black chimney-pots ; the little Doctor especially , with the addition of his black spectacles , looked like an undertaker in a farce .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>could not help feeling a comic contrast between this funereal church parade of apparel and the rich and glistening meadow , growing wild flowers everywhere . But , indeed , this comic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black hats was but a symbol of the tragic contrast between the yellow blossoms and the black business . On his right was a little wood ; far away to his left lay the long curve of the railway line , which he was , so to speak , guarding from the Marquis , whose goal and escape it was . In front of him , behind the black group of his opponents , he could see , like a tinted cloud , a small almond bush in flower against the faint line of the sea .</p>
    <p n="708">The member of the Legion of Honour , whose name it seemed was<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel Ducroix</persName>, approached<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>and<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>with great politeness , and suggested that the play should terminate with the first considerable hurt .</p>
    <p n="709"><persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, however , having been carefully coached by<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>upon this point of policy , insisted , with great dignity and in very bad French , that it should continue until one of the combatants was disabled .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had made up his mind that he could avoid disabling the Marquis and prevent the Marquis from disabling him for at least twenty minutes . In twenty minutes the Paris train would have gone by .</p>
    <p n="710"><said who="#the_Professor">“ To a man of the well-known skill and valour of Monsieur de St. Eustache , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>solemnly ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ it must be a matter of indifference which method is adopted , and our principal has strong reasons for demanding the longer encounter , reasons the delicacy of which prevent me from being explicit , but for the just and honourable nature of which I can — ”</said></p>
    <p n="711"><said who="#Syme">“ Peste ! ”</said>broke from the Marquis behind , whose face had suddenly darkened , “ let us stop talking and begin , ” and he slashed off the head of a tall flower with his stick .</p>
    <p n="712"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>understood his rude impatience and instinctively looked over his shoulder to see whether the train was coming in sight . But there was no smoke on the horizon .</p>
    <p n="713"><persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel Ducroix</persName>knelt down and unlocked the case , taking out a pair of twin swords , which took the sunlight and turned to two streaks of white fire . He offered one to the Marquis , who snatched it without ceremony , and another to<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, who took it , bent it , and poised it with as much delay as was consistent with dignity .</p>
    <p n="714">Then<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>took out another pair of blades , and taking one himself and giving another to<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, proceeded to place the men .</p>
    <p n="715">Both combatants had thrown off their coats and waistcoats , and stood sword in hand . The seconds stood on each side of the line of fight with drawn swords also , but still sombre in their dark frock-coats and hats . The principals saluted .<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">The Colonel</persName>said quietly ,<said who="#the_Colonel">“ Engage ! ”</said>and the two blades touched and tingled .</p>
    <p n="716">When the jar of the joined iron ran up<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s arm , all the fantastic fears that have been the subject of this story fell from him like dreams from a man waking up in bed . He remembered them clearly and in order as mere delusions of the nerves — how the fear of<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>had been the fear of the tyrannic accidents of nightmare , and how the fear of the Doctor had been the fear of the airless vacuum of science . The first was the old fear that any miracle might happen , the second the more hopeless modern fear that no miracle can ever happen . But he saw that these fears were fancies , for he found himself in the presence of the great fact of the fear of death , with its coarse and pitiless common sense . He felt like a man who had dreamed all night of falling over precipices , and had woke up on the morning when he was to be hanged . For as soon as he had seen the sunlight run down the channel of his foe 's foreshortened blade , and as soon as he had felt the two tongues of steel touch , vibrating like two living things , he knew that his enemy was a terrible fighter , and that probably his last hour had come .</p>
    <p n="717">He felt a strange and vivid value in all the earth around him , in the grass under his feet ; he felt the love of life in all living things . He could almost fancy that he heard the grass growing ; he could almost fancy that even as he stood fresh flowers were springing up and breaking into blossom in the meadow — flowers blood red and burning gold and blue , fulfilling the whole pageant of the spring . And whenever his eyes strayed for a flash from the calm , staring , hypnotic eyes of the Marquis , they saw the little tuft of almond tree against the sky-line . He had the feeling that if by some miracle he escaped he would be ready to sit for ever before that almond tree , desiring nothing else in the world .</p>
    <p n="718">But while earth and sky and everything had the living beauty of a thing lost , the other half of his head was as clear as glass , and he was parrying his enemy 's point with a kind of clockwork skill of which he had hardly supposed himself capable . Once his enemy 's point ran along his wrist , leaving a slight streak of blood , but it either was not noticed or was tacitly ignored . Every now and then he riposted , and once or twice he could almost fancy that he felt his point go home , but as there was no blood on blade or shirt he supposed he was mistaken . Then came an interruption and a change .</p>
    <p n="719">At the risk of losing all , the Marquis , interrupting his quiet stare , flashed one glance over his shoulder at the line of railway on his right . Then he turned on<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>a face transfigured to that of a fiend , and began to fight as if with twenty weapons . The attack came so fast and furious , that the one shining sword seemed a shower of shining arrows .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had no chance to look at the railway ; but also he had no need . He could guess the reason of the Marquis 's sudden madness of battle — the Paris train was in sight .</p>
    <p n="720">But the Marquis 's morbid energy over-reached itself . Twice<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, parrying , knocked his opponent 's point far out of the fighting circle ; and the third time his riposte was so rapid , that there was no doubt about the hit this time .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s sword actually bent under the weight of the Marquis 's body , which it had pierced .</p>
    <p n="721"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was as certain that he had stuck his blade into his enemy as a gardener that he has stuck his spade into the ground . Yet the Marquis sprang back from the stroke without a stagger , and<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>stood staring at his own sword-point like an idiot . There was no blood on it at all .</p>
    <p n="722">There was an instant of rigid silence , and then<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>in his turn fell furiously on the other , filled with a flaming curiosity . The Marquis was probably , in a general sense , a better fencer than he , as he had surmised at the beginning , but at the moment the Marquis seemed distraught and at a disadvantage . He fought wildly and even weakly , and he constantly looked away at the railway line , almost as if he feared the train more than the pointed steel .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, on the other hand , fought fiercely but still carefully , in an intellectual fury , eager to solve the riddle of his own bloodless sword . For this purpose , he aimed less at the Marquis 's body , and more at his throat and head . A minute and a half afterwards he felt his point enter the man 's neck below the jaw . It came out clean . Half mad , he thrust again , and made what should have been a bloody scar on the Marquis 's cheek . But there was no scar .</p>
    <p n="723">For one moment the heaven of<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>again grew black with supernatural terrors . Surely the man had a charmed life . But this new spiritual dread was a more awful thing than had been the mere spiritual topsy-turvydom symbolised by the paralytic who pursued him .<persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>was only a goblin ; this man was a devil — perhaps he was the Devil ! Anyhow , this was certain , that three times had a human sword been driven into him and made no mark . When<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had that thought he drew himself up , and all that was good in him sang high up in the air as a high wind sings in the trees . He thought of all the human things in his story — of the Chinese lanterns in Saffron Park , of the girl 's red hair in the garden , of the honest , beer-swilling sailors down by the dock , of his loyal companions standing by . Perhaps he had been chosen as a champion of all these fresh and kindly things to cross swords with the enemy of all creation .<said who="#the_Professor">“ After all , ”</said>he said to himself , “ I am more than a devil ; I am a man . I can do the one thing which Satan himself cannot do — I can die , ” and as the word went through his head , he heard a faint and far-off hoot , which would soon be the roar of the Paris train .</p>
    <p n="724">He fell to fighting again with a supernatural levity , like a Mohammedan panting for Paradise . As the train came nearer and nearer he fancied he could see people putting up the floral arches in Paris ; he joined in the growing noise and the glory of the great Republic whose gate he was guarding against Hell . His thoughts rose higher and higher with the rising roar of the train , which ended , as if proudly , in a long and piercing whistle . The train stopped .</p>
    <p n="725">Suddenly , to the astonishment of everyone the Marquis sprang back quite out of sword reach and threw down his sword . The leap was wonderful , and not the less wonderful because<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had plunged his sword a moment before into the man 's thigh .</p>
    <p n="726"><said who="#Syme">“ Stop ! ”</said>said the Marquis in a voice that compelled a momentary obedience .<said who="#Syme">“ I want to say something . ”</said></p>
    <p n="727"><said who="#Ducroix">“ What is the matter ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel Ducroix</persName>, staring .<said who="#Ducroix">“ Has there been foul play ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="728"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ There has been foul play somewhere , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, who was a little pale .<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Our principal has wounded the Marquis four times at least , and he is none the worse . ”</said></p>
    <p n="729">The Marquis put up his hand with a curious air of ghastly patience .</p>
    <p n="730"><said who="#Ducroix">“ Please let me speak , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Ducroix">“ It is rather important .<persName corresp="#Mr._Syme">Mr. Syme</persName>, ”</said>he continued , turning to his opponent ,<said who="#Ducroix">“ we are fighting today , if I remember right , because you expressed a wish ( which I thought irrational ) to pull my nose . Would you oblige me by pulling my nose now as quickly as possible ? I have to catch a train . ”</said></p>
    <p n="731"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ I protest that this is most irregular , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>indignantly .</p>
    <p n="732"><said who="#Ducroix">“ It is certainly somewhat opposed to precedent , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel Ducroix</persName>, looking wistfully at his principal .<said who="#Ducroix">“ There is , I think , one case on record ( Captain Bellegarde and the Baron Zumpt ) in which the weapons were changed in the middle of the encounter at the request of one of the combatants . But one can hardly call one 's nose a weapon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="733"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Will you or will you not pull my nose ? ”</said>said the Marquis in exasperation .<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Come , come ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Syme">Mr. Syme</persName>! You wanted to do it , do it ! You can have no conception of how important it is to me . Do n't be so selfish ! Pull my nose at once , when I ask you ! ”</said>and he bent slightly forward with a fascinating smile . The Paris train , panting and groaning , had grated into a little station behind the neighbouring hill .</p>
    <p n="734"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had the feeling he had more than once had in these adventures — the sense that a horrible and sublime wave lifted to heaven was just toppling over . Walking in a world he half understood , he took two paces forward and seized the Roman nose of this remarkable nobleman . He pulled it hard , and it came off in his hand .</p>
    <p n="735">He stood for some seconds with a foolish solemnity , with the pasteboard proboscis still between his fingers , looking at it , while the sun and the clouds and the wooded hills looked down upon this imbecile scene .</p>
    <p n="736">The Marquis broke the silence in a loud and cheerful voice .</p>
    <p n="737"><said who="#Ducroix">“ If anyone has any use for my left eyebrow , ”</said>he said , “ he can have it .<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel Ducroix</persName>, do accept my left eyebrow ! It 's the kind of thing that might come in useful any day , ” and he gravely tore off one of his swarthy Assyrian brows , bringing about half his brown forehead with it , and politely offered it to<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>, who stood crimson and speechless with rage .</p>
    <p n="738"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ If I had known , ”</said>he spluttered ,<said who="#the_Colonel">“ that I was acting for a poltroon who pads himself to fight — ”</said></p>
    <p n="739"><said who="#Ducroix">“ Oh , I know , I know ! ”</said>said the Marquis , recklessly throwing various parts of himself right and left about the field .<said who="#Ducroix">“ You are making a mistake ; but it can n't be explained just now . I tell you the train has come into the station ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="740"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>fiercely ,<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ and the train shall go out of the station . It shall go out without you . We know well enough for what devil 's work — ”</said></p>
    <p n="741">The mysterious Marquis lifted his hands with a desperate gesture . He was a strange scarecrow standing there in the sun with half his old face peeled off , and half another face glaring and grinning from underneath .</p>
    <p n="742"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Will you drive me mad ? ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ The train — ”</said></p>
    <p n="743"><said who="#Syme">“ You shall not go by the train , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>firmly , and grasped his sword .</p>
    <p n="744">The wild figure turned towards<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, and seemed to be gathering itself for a sublime effort before speaking .</p>
    <p n="745"><said who="#Syme">“ You great fat , blasted , blear-eyed , blundering , thundering , brainless , Godforsaken , doddering , damned fool ! ”</said>he said without taking breath .<said who="#Syme">“ You great silly , pink-faced , towheaded turnip ! You — ”</said></p>
    <p n="746"><said who="#Syme">“ You shall not go by this train , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="747"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ And why the infernal blazes , ”</said>roared the other ,<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ should I want to go by the train ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="748"><said who="#the_Professor">“ We know all , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>sternly .<said who="#the_Professor">“ You are going to Paris to throw a bomb ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="749"><said who="#Syme">“ Going to Jericho to throw a Jabberwock ! ”</said>cried the other , tearing his hair , which came off easily .</p>
    <p n="750"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Have you all got softening of the brain , that you do n't realise what I am ? Did you really think I wanted to catch that train ? Twenty Paris trains might go by for me . Damn Paris trains ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="751"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Then what did you care about ? ”</said>began<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.</p>
    <p n="752"><said who="#Syme">“ What did I care about ? I did n't care about catching the train ; I cared about whether the train caught me , and now , by God ! it has caught me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="753"><said who="#Syme">“ I regret to inform you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with restraint ,<said who="#Syme">“ that your remarks convey no impression to my mind . Perhaps if you were to remove the remains of your original forehead and some portion of what was once your chin , your meaning would become clearer . Mental lucidity fulfils itself in many ways . What do you mean by saying that the train has caught you ? It may be my literary fancy , but somehow I feel that it ought to mean something . ”</said></p>
    <p n="754"><said who="#the_Professor">“ It means everything , ”</said>said the other ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ and the end of everything . Sunday has us now in the hollow of his hand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="755"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Us ! ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, as if stupefied .<said who="#the_Professor">“ What do you mean by ‘ us ’ ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="756"><said who="#Syme">“ The police , of course ! ”</said>said the Marquis , and tore off his scalp and half his face .</p>
    <p n="757">The head which emerged was the blonde , well brushed , smooth-haired head which is common in the English constabulary , but the face was terribly pale .</p>
    <p n="758"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I am<persName corresp="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">Inspector Ratcliffe</persName>, ”</said>he said , with a sort of haste that verged on harshness .<said who="#the_Professor">“ My name is pretty well known to the police , and I can see well enough that you belong to them . But if there is any doubt about my position , I have a card , ”</said>and he began to pull a blue card from his pocket .</p>
    <p n="759"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>gave a tired gesture .</p>
    <p n="760"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Oh , do n't show it us , ”</said>he said wearily ;<said who="#the_Professor">“ we 've got enough of them to equip a paper-chase . ”</said></p>
    <p n="761">The little man named<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>, had , like many men who seem to be of a mere vivacious vulgarity , sudden movements of good taste . Here he certainly saved the situation . In the midst of this staggering transformation scene he stepped forward with all the gravity and responsibility of a second , and addressed the two seconds of the Marquis .</p>
    <p n="762"><said who="#Bull">“ Gentlemen , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Bull">“ we all owe you a serious apology ; but I assure you that you have not been made the victims of such a low joke as you imagine , or indeed of anything undignified in a man of honour . You have not wasted your time ; you have helped to save the world . We are not buffoons , but very desperate men at war with a vast conspiracy . A secret society of anarchists is hunting us like hares ; not such unfortunate madmen as may here or there throw a bomb through starvation or German philosophy , but a rich and powerful and fanatical church , a church of eastern pessimism , which holds it holy to destroy mankind like vermin . How hard they hunt us you can gather from the fact that we are driven to such disguises as those for which I apologise , and to such pranks as this one by which you suffer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="763">The younger second of the Marquis , a short man with a black moustache , bowed politely , and said —</p>
    <p n="764"><said who="#Bull">“ Of course , I accept the apology ; but you will in your turn forgive me if I decline to follow you further into your difficulties , and permit myself to say good morning ! The sight of an acquaintance and distinguished fellow-townsman coming to pieces in the open air is unusual , and , upon the whole , sufficient for one day .<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel Ducroix</persName>, I would in no way influence your actions , but if you feel with me that our present society is a little abnormal , I am now going to walk back to the town . ”</said></p>
    <p n="765"><persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel Ducroix</persName>moved mechanically , but then tugged abruptly at his white moustache and broke out —</p>
    <p n="766"><said who="#Ducroix">“ No , by George ! I wo n't . If these gentlemen are really in a mess with a lot of low wreckers like that , I 'll see them through it . I have fought for France , and it is hard if I can n't fight for civilization . ”</said></p>
    <p n="767"><persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>took off his hat and waved it , cheering as at a public meeting .</p>
    <p n="768"><said who="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">“ Do n't make too much noise , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">Inspector Ratcliffe</persName>,<said who="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">“ Sunday may hear you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="769"><said who="#Bull">“ Sunday ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>, and dropped his hat .</p>
    <p n="770"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Yes , ”</said>retorted<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>,<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ he may be with them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="771"><said who="#Syme">“ With whom ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="772"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ With the people out of that train , ”</said>said the other .</p>
    <p n="773"><said who="#Syme">“ What you say seems utterly wild , ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ Why , as a matter of fact — But , my God , ”</said>he cried out suddenly , like a man who sees an explosion a long way off ,<said who="#Syme">“ by God ! if this is true the whole bally lot of us on the Anarchist Council were against anarchy ! Every born man was a detective except<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>and his personal secretary . What can it mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="774"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Mean ! ”</said>said the new policeman with incredible violence .<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ It means that we are struck dead ! Do n't you know Sunday ? Do n't you know that his jokes are always so big and simple that one has never thought of them ? Can you think of anything more like Sunday than this , that he should put all his powerful enemies on the Supreme Council , and then take care that it was not supreme ? I tell you he has bought every trust , he has captured every cable , he has control of every railway line — especially of that railway line ! ”</said>and he pointed a shaking finger towards the small wayside station .<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ The whole movement was controlled by him ; half the world was ready to rise for him . But there were just five people , perhaps , who would have resisted him ... and the old devil put them on the Supreme Council , to waste their time in watching each other . Idiots that we are , he planned the whole of our idiocies ! Sunday knew that<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>would chase<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>through London , and that<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>would fight me in France . And he was combining great masses of capital , and seizing great lines of telegraphy , while we five idiots were running after each other like a lot of confounded babies playing blind man 's buff . ”</said></p>
    <p n="775"><said who="#Syme">“ Well ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with a sort of steadiness .</p>
    <p n="776"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Well , ”</said>replied the other with sudden serenity ,<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ he has found us playing blind man 's buff today in a field of great rustic beauty and extreme solitude . He has probably captured the world ; it only remains to him to capture this field and all the fools in it . And since you really want to know what was my objection to the arrival of that train , I will tell you . My objection was that Sunday or his Secretary has just this moment got out of it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="777"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>uttered an involuntary cry , and they all turned their eyes towards the far-off station . It was quite true that a considerable bulk of people seemed to be moving in their direction . But they were too distant to be distinguished in any way .</p>
    <p n="778"><said who="#Syme">“ It was a habit of the late Marquis de St. Eustache , ”</said>said the new policeman , producing a leather case ,<said who="#Syme">“ always to carry a pair of opera glasses . Either<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>or<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>is coming after us with that mob . They have caught us in a nice quiet place where we are under no temptations to break our oaths by calling the police .<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, I have a suspicion that you will see better through these than through your own highly decorative spectacles . ”</said></p>
    <p n="779">He handed the field-glasses to the Doctor , who immediately took off his spectacles and put the apparatus to his eyes .</p>
    <p n="780"><said who="#the_Professor">“ It cannot be as bad as you say , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, somewhat shaken .<said who="#the_Professor">“ There are a good number of them certainly , but they may easily be ordinary tourists . ”</said></p>
    <p n="781"><said who="#Bull">“ Do ordinary tourists , ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>, with the fieldglasses to his eyes ,<said who="#Bull">“ wear black masks half-way down the face ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="782"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>almost tore the glasses out of his hand , and looked through them . Most men in the advancing mob really looked ordinary enough ; but it was quite true that two or three of the leaders in front wore black half-masks almost down to their mouths . This disguise is very complete , especially at such a distance , and<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>found it impossible to conclude anything from the clean-shaven jaws and chins of the men talking in the front . But presently as they talked they all smiled and one of them smiled on one side .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="11">
    <p n="783"><said>“<persName corresp="#the_President">The President</persName>is not with them , anyhow , ”</said>he said , and wiped his forehead .</p>
    <p n="784"><said who="#Ducroix">“ But surely they are right away on the horizon , ”</said>said the bewildered<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel</persName>, blinking and but half recovered from<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>'s hasty though polite explanation .<said who="#Ducroix">“ Could you possibly know your President among all those people ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="785"><said who="#Syme">“ Could I know a white elephant among all those people ! ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>somewhat irritably .<said who="#Syme">“ As you very truly say , they are on the horizon ; but if he were walking with them ... by God ! I believe this ground would shake . ”</said></p>
    <p n="786">After an instant 's pause the new man called<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>said with gloomy decision —</p>
    <p n="787"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Of course<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>is n't with them . I wish to Gemini he were . Much more likely<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>is riding in triumph through Paris , or sitting on the ruins of St. Paul 's Cathedral . ”</said></p>
    <p n="788"><said who="#Syme">“ This is absurd ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ Something may have happened in our absence ; but he cannot have carried the world with a rush like that . It is quite true , ”</said>he added , frowning dubiously at the distant fields that lay towards the little station ,<said who="#Syme">“ it is certainly true that there seems to be a crowd coming this way ; but they are not all the army that you make out . ”</said></p>
    <p n="789"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Oh , they , ”</said>said the new detective contemptuously ; “ no they are not a very valuable force . But let me tell you frankly that they are precisely calculated to our value — we are not much , my boy , in Sunday 's universe . He has got hold of all the cables and telegraphs himself . But to kill the Supreme Council he regards as a trivial matter , like a post card ; it may be left to his private secretary , ” and he spat on the grass .</p>
    <p n="790">Then he turned to the others and said somewhat austerely —</p>
    <p n="791"><said who="#Syme">“ There is a great deal to be said for death ; but if anyone has any preference for the other alternative , I strongly advise him to walk after me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="792">With these words , he turned his broad back and strode with silent energy towards the wood . The others gave one glance over their shoulders , and saw that the dark cloud of men had detached itself from the station and was moving with a mysterious discipline across the plain . They saw already , even with the naked eye , black blots on the foremost faces , which marked the masks they wore . They turned and followed their leader , who had already struck the wood , and disappeared among the twinkling trees .</p>
    <p n="793">The sun on the grass was dry and hot . So in plunging into the wood they had a cool shock of shadow , as of divers who plunge into a dim pool . The inside of the wood was full of shattered sunlight and shaken shadows . They made a sort of shuddering veil , almost recalling the dizziness of a cinematograph . Even the solid figures walking with him<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>could hardly see for the patterns of sun and shade that danced upon them . Now a man 's head was lit as with a light of Rembrandt , leaving all else obliterated ; now again he had strong and staring white hands with the face of a negro . The ex-Marquis had pulled the old straw hat over his eyes , and the black shade of the brim cut his face so squarely in two that it seemed to be wearing one of the black half-masks of their pursuers . The fancy tinted<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s overwhelming sense of wonder . Was he wearing a mask ? Was anyone wearing a mask ? Was anyone anything ? This wood of witchery , in which men 's faces turned black and white by turns , in which their figures first swelled into sunlight and then faded into formless night , this mere chaos of chiaroscuro ( after the clear daylight outside ) , seemed to<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>a perfect symbol of the world in which he had been moving for three days , this world where men took off their beards and their spectacles and their noses , and turned into other people . That tragic self-confidence which he had felt when he believed that the Marquis was a devil had strangely disappeared now that he knew that the Marquis was a friend . He felt almost inclined to ask after all these bewilderments what was a friend and what an enemy . Was there anything that was apart from what it seemed ? The Marquis had taken off his nose and turned out to be a detective . Might he not just as well take off his head and turn out to be a hobgoblin ? Was not everything , after all , like this bewildering woodland , this dance of dark and light ? Everything only a glimpse , the glimpse always unforeseen , and always forgotten . For<persName corresp="#Gabriel_Syme">Gabriel Syme</persName>had found in the heart of that sun-splashed wood what many modern painters had found there . He had found the thing which the modern people call Impressionism , which is another name for that final scepticism which can find no floor to the universe .</p>
    <p n="794">As a man in an evil dream strains himself to scream and wake ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>strove with a sudden effort to fling off this last and worst of his fancies . With two impatient strides he overtook the man in the Marquis 's straw hat , the man whom he had come to address as<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>. In a voice exaggeratively loud and cheerful , he broke the bottomless silence and made conversation .</p>
    <p n="795"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ May I ask , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ where on earth we are all going to ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="796">So genuine had been the doubts of his soul , that he was quite glad to hear his companion speak in an easy , human voice .</p>
    <p n="797"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ We must get down through the town of Lancy to the sea , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ I think that part of the country is least likely to be with them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="798"><said who="#Syme">“ What can you mean by all this ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ They can n't be running the real world in that way . Surely not many working men are anarchists , and surely if they were , mere mobs could not beat modern armies and police . ”</said></p>
    <p n="799"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Mere mobs ! ”</said>repeated his new friend with a snort of scorn .<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ So you talk about mobs and the working classes as if they were the question . You 've got that eternal idiotic idea that if anarchy came it would come from the poor . Why should it ? The poor have been rebels , but they have never been anarchists ; they have more interest than anyone else in there being some decent government . The poor man really has a stake in the country . The rich man has n't ; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht . The poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly ; the rich have always objected to being governed at all . Aristocrats were always anarchists , as you can see from the barons ’ wars . ”</said></p>
    <p n="800"><said who="#Syme">“ As a lecture on English history for the little ones , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ this is all very nice ; but I have not yet grasped its application . ”</said></p>
    <p n="801"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Its application is , ”</said>said his informant ,<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ that most of old Sunday 's right-hand men are South African and American millionaires . That is why he has got hold of all the communications ; and that is why the last four champions of the anti-anarchist police force are running through a wood like rabbits . ”</said></p>
    <p n="802"><said who="#Syme">“ Millionaires I can understand , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>thoughtfully ,<said who="#Syme">“ they are nearly all mad . But getting hold of a few wicked old gentlemen with hobbies is one thing ; getting hold of great Christian nations is another . I would bet the nose off my face ( forgive the allusion ) that Sunday would stand perfectly helpless before the task of converting any ordinary healthy person anywhere . ”</said></p>
    <p n="803"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Well , ”</said>said the other ,<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ it rather depends what sort of person you mean . ”</said></p>
    <p n="804"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , for instance , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, “ he could never convert that person , ” and he pointed straight in front of him .</p>
    <p n="805">They had come to an open space of sunlight , which seemed to express to<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>the final return of his own good sense ; and in the middle of this forest clearing was a figure that might well stand for that common sense in an almost awful actuality . Burnt by the sun and stained with perspiration , and grave with the bottomless gravity of small necessary toils , a heavy French peasant was cutting wood with a hatchet . His cart stood a few yards off , already half full of timber ; and the horse that cropped the grass was , like his master , valorous but not desperate ; like his master , he was even prosperous , but yet was almost sad . The man was a Norman , taller than the average of the French and very angular ; and his swarthy figure stood dark against a square of sunlight , almost like some allegoric figure of labour frescoed on a ground of gold .</p>
    <p n="806"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Syme">Mr. Syme</persName>is saying , ”</said>called out<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>to the French<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel</persName>,<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ that this man , at least , will never be an anarchist . ”</said></p>
    <p n="807"><said who="#Ducroix">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Syme">Mr. Syme</persName>is right enough there , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel Ducroix</persName>, laughing ,<said who="#Ducroix">“ if only for the reason that he has plenty of property to defend . But I forgot that in your country you are not used to peasants being wealthy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="808"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ He looks poor , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>doubtfully .</p>
    <p n="809"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ Quite so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>;<said who="#the_Colonel">“ that is why he is rich . ”</said></p>
    <p n="810"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ I have an idea , ”</said>called out<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>suddenly ;<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ how much would he take to give us a lift in his cart ? Those dogs are all on foot , and we could soon leave them behind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="811"><said who="#Syme">“ Oh , give him anything ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>eagerly .<said who="#Syme">“ I have piles of money on me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="812"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ That will never do , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>;<said who="#the_Colonel">“ he will never have any respect for you unless you drive a bargain . ”</said></p>
    <p n="813"><said who="#Bull">“ Oh , if he haggles ! ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>impatiently .</p>
    <p n="814"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ He haggles because he is a free man , ”</said>said the other .<said who="#the_Colonel">“ You do not understand ; he would not see the meaning of generosity . He is not being tipped . ”</said></p>
    <p n="815">And even while they seemed to hear the heavy feet of their strange pursuers behind them , they had to stand and stamp while the French<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel</persName>talked to the French wood-cutter with all the leisurely badinage and bickering of market-day . At the end of the four minutes , however , they saw that<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>was right , for the wood-cutter entered into their plans , not with the vague servility of a tout too-well paid , but with the seriousness of a solicitor who had been paid the proper fee . He told them that the best thing they could do was to make their way down to the little inn on the hills above Lancy , where the innkeeper , an old soldier who had become devout in his latter years , would be certain to sympathise with them , and even to take risks in their support . The whole company , therefore , piled themselves on top of the stacks of wood , and went rocking in the rude cart down the other and steeper side of the woodland . Heavy and ramshackle as was the vehicle , it was driven quickly enough , and they soon had the exhilarating impression of distancing altogether those , whoever they were , who were hunting them . For , after all , the riddle as to where the anarchists had got all these followers was still unsolved . One man 's presence had sufficed for them ; they had fled at the first sight of the deformed smile of<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>.<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>every now and then looked back over his shoulder at the army on their track .</p>
    <p n="816">As the wood grew first thinner and then smaller with distance , he could see the sunlit slopes beyond it and above it ; and across these was still moving the square black mob like one monstrous beetle . In the very strong sunlight and with his own very strong eyes , which were almost telescopic ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>could see this mass of men quite plainly . He could see them as separate human figures ; but he was increasingly surprised by the way in which they moved as one man . They seemed to be dressed in dark clothes and plain hats , like any common crowd out of the streets ; but they did not spread and sprawl and trail by various lines to the attack , as would be natural in an ordinary mob . They moved with a sort of dreadful and wicked woodenness , like a staring army of automatons .</p>
    <p n="817"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>pointed this out to<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>.</p>
    <p n="818"><said who="#Syme">“ Yes , ”</said>replied the policeman ,<said who="#Syme">“ that 's discipline . That 's Sunday . He is perhaps five hundred miles off , but the fear of him is on all of them , like the finger of God . Yes , they are walking regularly ; and you bet your boots that they are talking regularly , yes , and thinking regularly . But the one important thing for us is that they are disappearing regularly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="819"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>nodded . It was true that the black patch of the pursuing men was growing smaller and smaller as the peasant belaboured his horse .</p>
    <p n="820">The level of the sunlit landscape , though flat as a whole , fell away on the farther side of the wood in billows of heavy slope towards the sea , in a way not unlike the lower slopes of the Sussex downs . The only difference was that in Sussex the road would have been broken and angular like a little brook , but here the white French road fell sheer in front of them like a waterfall . Down this direct descent the cart clattered at a considerable angle , and in a few minutes , the road growing yet steeper , they saw below them the little harbour of Lancy and a great blue arc of the sea . The travelling cloud of their enemies had wholly disappeared from the horizon .</p>
    <p n="821">The horse and cart took a sharp turn round a clump of elms , and the horse 's nose nearly struck the face of an old gentleman who was sitting on the benches outside the little cafe of “ Le Soleil d'Or . ” The peasant grunted an apology , and got down from his seat . The others also descended one by one , and spoke to the old gentleman with fragmentary phrases of courtesy , for it was quite evident from his expansive manner that he was the owner of the little tavern .</p>
    <p n="822">He was a white-haired , apple-faced old boy , with sleepy eyes and a grey moustache ; stout , sedentary , and very innocent , of a type that may often be found in France , but is still commoner in Catholic Germany . Everything about him , his pipe , his pot of beer , his flowers , and his beehive , suggested an ancestral peace ; only when his visitors looked up as they entered the inn-parlour , they saw the sword upon the wall .</p>
    <p n="823"><persName corresp="#the_Colonel">The Colonel</persName>, who greeted the innkeeper as an old friend , passed rapidly into the inn-parlour , and sat down ordering some ritual refreshment . The military decision of his action interested<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, who sat next to him , and he took the opportunity when the old innkeeper had gone out of satisfying his curiosity .</p>
    <p n="824"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ May I ask you ,<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel</persName>, ”</said>he said in a low voice ,<said who="#the_Colonel">“ why we have come here ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="825"><persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel Ducroix</persName>smiled behind his bristly white moustache .</p>
    <p n="826"><said who="#Ducroix">“ For two reasons , sir , ”</said>he said ;<said who="#Ducroix">“ and I will give first , not the most important , but the most utilitarian . We came here because this is the only place within twenty miles in which we can get horses . ”</said></p>
    <p n="827"><said who="#Syme">“ Horses ! ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, looking up quickly .</p>
    <p n="828"><said who="#Ducroix">“ Yes , ”</said>replied the other ;<said who="#Ducroix">“ if you people are really to distance your enemies it is horses or nothing for you , unless of course you have bicycles and motor-cars in your pocket . ”</said></p>
    <p n="829"><said who="#Syme">“ And where do you advise us to make for ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>doubtfully .</p>
    <p n="830"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ Beyond question , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>,<said who="#the_Colonel">“ you had better make all haste to the police station beyond the town . My friend , whom I seconded under somewhat deceptive circumstances , seems to me to exaggerate very much the possibilities of a general rising ; but even he would hardly maintain , I suppose , that you were not safe with the gendarmes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="831"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>nodded gravely ; then he said abruptly —</p>
    <p n="832"><said who="#Syme">“ And your other reason for coming here ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="833"><said who="#Ducroix">“ My other reason for coming here , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Ducroix</persName>soberly ,<said who="#Ducroix">“ is that it is just as well to see a good man or two when one is possibly near to death . ”</said></p>
    <p n="834"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>looked up at the wall , and saw a crudely-painted and pathetic religious picture . Then he said —</p>
    <p n="835"><said who="#Syme">“ You are right , ”</said>and then almost immediately afterwards ,<said who="#Syme">“ Has anyone seen about the horses ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="836"><said who="#Ducroix">“ Yes , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Ducroix</persName>,<said who="#Ducroix">“ you may be quite certain that I gave orders the moment I came in . Those enemies of yours gave no impression of hurry , but they were really moving wonderfully fast , like a well-trained army . I had no idea that the anarchists had so much discipline . You have not a moment to waste . ”</said></p>
    <p n="837">Almost as he spoke , the old innkeeper with the blue eyes and white hair came ambling into the room , and announced that six horses were saddled outside .</p>
    <p n="838">By<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Ducroix</persName>'s advice the five others equipped themselves with some portable form of food and wine , and keeping their duelling swords as the only weapons available , they clattered away down the steep , white road . The two servants , who had carried the Marquis 's luggage when he was a marquis , were left behind to drink at the cafe by common consent , and not at all against their own inclination .</p>
    <p n="839">By this time the afternoon sun was slanting westward , and by its rays<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>could see the sturdy figure of the old innkeeper growing smaller and smaller , but still standing and looking after them quite silently , the sunshine in his silver hair .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had a fixed , superstitious fancy , left in his mind by the chance phrase of<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>, that this was indeed , perhaps , the last honest stranger whom he should ever see upon the earth .</p>
    <p n="840">He was still looking at this dwindling figure , which stood as a mere grey blot touched with a white flame against the great green wall of the steep down behind him . And as he stared over the top of the down behind the innkeeper , there appeared an army of black-clad and marching men . They seemed to hang above the good man and his house like a black cloud of locusts . The horses had been saddled none too soon .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="12">
    <p n="841">URGING the horses to a gallop , without respect to the rather rugged descent of the road , the horsemen soon regained their advantage over the men on the march , and at last the bulk of the first buildings of Lancy cut off the sight of their pursuers . Nevertheless , the ride had been a long one , and by the time they reached the real town the west was warming with the colour and quality of sunset .<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">The Colonel</persName>suggested that , before making finally for the police station , they should make the effort , in passing , to attach to themselves one more individual who might be useful .</p>
    <p n="842"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ Four out of the five rich men in this town , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#the_Colonel">“ are common swindlers . I suppose the proportion is pretty equal all over the world . The fifth is a friend of mine , and a very fine fellow ; and what is even more important from our point of view , he owns a motor-car . ”</said></p>
    <p n="843"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I am afraid , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>in his mirthful way , looking back along the white road on which the black , crawling patch might appear at any moment ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ I am afraid we have hardly time for afternoon calls . ”</said></p>
    <p n="844"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ Doctor<persName>Renard</persName>'s house is only three minutes off , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>.</p>
    <p n="845"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Our danger , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>,<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ is not two minutes off . ”</said></p>
    <p n="846"><said who="#Syme">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ if we ride on fast we must leave them behind , for they are on foot . ”</said></p>
    <p n="847"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ He has a motor-car , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>.</p>
    <p n="848"><said who="#Bull">“ But we may not get it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>.</p>
    <p n="849"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ Yes , he is quite on your side . ”</said></p>
    <p n="850"><said who="#Bull">“ But he might be out . ”</said></p>
    <p n="851"><said who="#Syme">“ Hold your tongue , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>suddenly .<said who="#Syme">“ What is that noise ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="852">For a second they all sat as still as equestrian statues , and for a second — for two or three or four seconds — heaven and earth seemed equally still . Then all their ears , in an agony of attention , heard along the road that indescribable thrill and throb that means only one thing — horses !</p>
    <p n="853"><persName corresp="#the_Colonel">The Colonel</persName>'s face had an instantaneous change , as if lightning had struck it , and yet left it scatheless .</p>
    <p n="854"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ They have done us , ”</said>he said , with brief military irony .<said who="#the_Colonel">“ Prepare to receive cavalry ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="855"><said who="#Syme">“ Where can they have got the horses ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, as he mechanically urged his steed to a canter .</p>
    <p n="856"><persName corresp="#the_Colonel">The Colonel</persName>was silent for a little , then he said in a strained voice —</p>
    <p n="857"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ I was speaking with strict accuracy when I said that the ‘ Soleil d'Or ’ was the only place where one can get horses within twenty miles . ”</said></p>
    <p n="858"><said who="#Syme">“ No ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>violently ,<said who="#Syme">“ I do n't believe he 'd do it . Not with all that white hair . ”</said></p>
    <p n="859"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ He may have been forced , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>gently .<said who="#the_Colonel">“ They must be at least a hundred strong , for which reason we are all going to see my friend<persName>Renard</persName>, who has a motor-car . ”</said></p>
    <p n="860">With these words he swung his horse suddenly round a street corner , and went down the street with such thundering speed , that the others , though already well at the gallop , had difficulty in following the flying tail of his horse .</p>
    <p n="861"><persName corresp="#Dr._Renard">Dr. Renard</persName>inhabited a high and comfortable house at the top of a steep street , so that when the riders alighted at his door they could once more see the solid green ridge of the hill , with the white road across it , standing up above all the roofs of the town . They breathed again to see that the road as yet was clear , and they rang the bell .</p>
    <p n="862"><persName corresp="#Dr._Renard">Dr. Renard</persName>was a beaming , brown-bearded man , a good example of that silent but very busy professional class which France has preserved even more perfectly than England . When the matter was explained to him he pooh-poohed the panic of the ex-Marquis altogether ; he said , with the solid French scepticism , that there was no conceivable probability of a general anarchist rising .<said who="#the_Colonel">“ Anarchy , ”</said>he said , shrugging his shoulders ,<said who="#the_Colonel">“ it is childishness ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="863"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ Et ca , ”</said>cried out<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>suddenly , pointing over the other 's shoulder ,<said who="#the_Colonel">“ and that is childishness , is n't it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="864">They all looked round , and saw a curve of black cavalry come sweeping over the top of the hill with all the energy of Attila . Swiftly as they rode , however , the whole rank still kept well together , and they could see the black vizards of the first line as level as a line of uniforms . But although the main black square was the same , though travelling faster , there was now one sensational difference which they could see clearly upon the slope of the hill , as if upon a slanted map . The bulk of the riders were in one block ; but one rider flew far ahead of the column , and with frantic movements of hand and heel urged his horse faster and faster , so that one might have fancied that he was not the pursuer but the pursued . But even at that great distance they could see something so fanatical , so unquestionable in his figure , that they knew it was<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>himself .<said who="#the_Colonel">“ I am sorry to cut short a cultured discussion , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>,<said who="#the_Colonel">“ but can you lend me your motor-car now , in two minutes ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="865"><said who="#Dr._Renard">“ I have a suspicion that you are all mad , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Renard">Dr. Renard</persName>, smiling sociably ;<said who="#Dr._Renard">“ but God forbid that madness should in any way interrupt friendship . Let us go round to the garage . ”</said></p>
    <p n="866"><persName corresp="#Dr._Renard">Dr. Renard</persName>was a mild man with monstrous wealth ; his rooms were like the Musee de Cluny , and he had three motor-cars . These , however , he seemed to use very sparingly , having the simple tastes of the French middle class , and when his impatient friends came to examine them , it took them some time to assure themselves that one of them even could be made to work . This with some difficulty they brought round into the street before the Doctor 's house . When they came out of the dim garage they were startled to find that twilight had already fallen with the abruptness of night in the tropics . Either they had been longer in the place than they imagined , or some unusual canopy of cloud had gathered over the town . They looked down the steep streets , and seemed to see a slight mist coming up from the sea .</p>
    <p n="867"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ It is now or never , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>.<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ I hear horses . ”</said></p>
    <p n="868"><said who="#the_Professor">“ No , ”</said>corrected<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>,<said who="#the_Professor">“ a horse . ”</said></p>
    <p n="869">And as they listened , it was evident that the noise , rapidly coming nearer on the rattling stones , was not the noise of the whole cavalcade but that of the one horseman , who had left it far behind — the insane Secretary .</p>
    <p n="870"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s family , like most of those who end in the simple life , had once owned a motor , and he knew all about them . He had leapt at once into the chauffeur 's seat , and with flushed face was wrenching and tugging at the disused machinery . He bent his strength upon one handle , and then said quite quietly —</p>
    <p n="871"><said who="#Syme">“ I am afraid it 's no go . ”</said></p>
    <p n="872">As he spoke , there swept round the corner a man rigid on his rushing horse , with the rush and rigidity of an arrow . He had a smile that thrust out his chin as if it were dislocated . He swept alongside of the stationary car , into which its company had crowded , and laid his hand on the front . It was<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>, and his mouth went quite straight in the solemnity of triumph .</p>
    <p n="873"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was leaning hard upon the steering wheel , and there was no sound but the rumble of the other pursuers riding into the town . Then there came quite suddenly a scream of scraping iron , and the car leapt forward . It plucked<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>clean out of his saddle , as a knife is whipped out of its sheath , trailed him kicking terribly for twenty yards , and left him flung flat upon the road far in front of his frightened horse . As the car took the corner of the street with a splendid curve , they could just see the other anarchists filling the street and raising their fallen leader .</p>
    <p n="874"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I can n't understand why it has grown so dark , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>at last in a low voice .</p>
    <p n="875"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Going to be a storm , I think , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>.<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ I say , it 's a pity we have n't got a light on this car , if only to see by . ”</said></p>
    <p n="876"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ We have , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>, and from the floor of the car he fished up a heavy , old-fashioned , carved iron lantern with a light inside it . It was obviously an antique , and it would seem as if its original use had been in some way semi-religious , for there was a rude moulding of a cross upon one of its sides .</p>
    <p n="877"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Where on earth did you get that ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.</p>
    <p n="878"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ I got it where I got the car , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>, chuckling ,<said who="#the_Colonel">“ from my best friend . While our friend here was fighting with the steering wheel , I ran up the front steps of the house and spoke to<persName>Renard</persName>, who was standing in his own porch , you will remember . ‘ I suppose , ’ I said , ‘ there 's no time to get a lamp . ’ He looked up , blinking amiably at the beautiful arched ceiling of his own front hall . From this was suspended , by chains of exquisite ironwork , this lantern , one of the hundred treasures of his treasure house . By sheer force he tore the lamp out of his own ceiling , shattering the painted panels , and bringing down two blue vases with his violence . Then he handed me the iron lantern , and I put it in the car . Was I not right when I said that<persName corresp="#Dr._Renard">Dr. Renard</persName>was worth knowing ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="879"><said who="#Syme">“ You were , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>seriously , and hung the heavy lantern over the front . There was a certain allegory of their whole position in the contrast between the modern automobile and its strange ecclesiastical lamp . Hitherto they had passed through the quietest part of the town , meeting at most one or two pedestrians , who could give them no hint of the peace or the hostility of the place . Now , however , the windows in the houses began one by one to be lit up , giving a greater sense of habitation and humanity .<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>turned to the new detective who had led their flight , and permitted himself one of his natural and friendly smiles .</p>
    <p n="880"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ These lights make one feel more cheerful . ”</said></p>
    <p n="881"><persName corresp="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">Inspector Ratcliffe</persName>drew his brows together .</p>
    <p n="882"><said who="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">“ There is only one set of lights that make me more cheerful , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">“ and they are those lights of the police station which I can see beyond the town . Please God we may be there in ten minutes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="883">Then all<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>'s boiling good sense and optimism broke suddenly out of him .</p>
    <p n="884"><said who="#Bull">“ Oh , this is all raving nonsense ! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Bull">“ If you really think that ordinary people in ordinary houses are anarchists , you must be madder than an anarchist yourself . If we turned and fought these fellows , the whole town would fight for us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="885"><said who="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">“ No , ”</said>said the other with an immovable simplicity ,<said who="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">“ the whole town would fight for them . We shall see . ”</said></p>
    <p n="886">While they were speaking<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>had leant forward with sudden excitement .</p>
    <p n="887"><said who="#the_Professor">“ What is that noise ? ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="888"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ Oh , the horses behind us , I suppose , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>.<said who="#the_Colonel">“ I thought we had got clear of them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="889"><said who="#the_Professor">“ The horses behind us ! No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>,<said who="#the_Professor">“ it is not horses , and it is not behind us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="890">Almost as he spoke , across the end of the street before them two shining and rattling shapes shot past . They were gone almost in a flash , but everyone could see that they were motor-cars , and<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>stood up with a pale face and swore that they were the other two motor-cars from<persName corresp="#Dr._Renard">Dr. Renard</persName>'s garage .</p>
    <p n="891"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I tell you they were his , ”</said>he repeated , with wild eyes ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ and they were full of men in masks ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="892"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ Absurd ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>angrily .<said who="#the_Colonel">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Renard">Dr. Renard</persName>would never give them his cars . ”</said></p>
    <p n="893"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ He may have been forced , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>quietly .<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ The whole town is on their side . ”</said></p>
    <p n="894"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ You still believe that , ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>incredulously .</p>
    <p n="895"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ You will all believe it soon , ”</said>said the other with a hopeless calm .</p>
    <p n="896">There was a puzzled pause for some little time , and then<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>began again abruptly —</p>
    <p n="897"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ No , I can n't believe it . The thing is nonsense . The plain people of a peaceable French town — ”</said></p>
    <p n="898">He was cut short by a bang and a blaze of light , which seemed close to his eyes . As the car sped on it left a floating patch of white smoke behind it , and<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had heard a shot shriek past his ear .</p>
    <p n="899"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ My God ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>,<said who="#the_Colonel">“ someone has shot at us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="900"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ It need not interrupt conversation , ”</said>said the gloomy<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>.<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Pray resume your remarks ,<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel</persName>. You were talking , I think , about the plain people of a peaceable French town . ”</said></p>
    <p n="901">The staring<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel</persName>was long past minding satire . He rolled his eyes all round the street .</p>
    <p n="902"><said who="#Ducroix">“ It is extraordinary , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Ducroix">“ most extraordinary . ”</said></p>
    <p n="903"><said who="#Syme">“ A fastidious person , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ might even call it unpleasant . However , I suppose those lights out in the field beyond this street are the Gendarmerie . We shall soon get there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="904"><said who="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">Inspector Ratcliffe</persName>,<said who="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">“ we shall never get there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="905">He had been standing up and looking keenly ahead of him . Now he sat down and smoothed his sleek hair with a weary gesture .</p>
    <p n="906"><said who="#Bull">“ What do you mean ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>sharply .</p>
    <p n="907"><said who="#the_pessimist">“ I mean that we shall never get there , ”</said>said the pessimist placidly .<said who="#the_pessimist">“ They have two rows of armed men across the road already ; I can see them from here . The town is in arms , as I said it was . I can only wallow in the exquisite comfort of my own exactitude . ”</said></p>
    <p n="908">And<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>sat down comfortably in the car and lit a cigarette , but the others rose excitedly and stared down the road .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had slowed down the car as their plans became doubtful , and he brought it finally to a standstill just at the corner of a side street that ran down very steeply to the sea .</p>
    <p n="909">The town was mostly in shadow , but the sun had not sunk ; wherever its level light could break through , it painted everything a burning gold . Up this side street the last sunset light shone as sharp and narrow as the shaft of artificial light at the theatre . It struck the car of the five friends , and lit it like a burning chariot . But the rest of the street , especially the two ends of it , was in the deepest twilight , and for some seconds they could see nothing . Then<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, whose eyes were the keenest , broke into a little bitter whistle , and said ,</p>
    <p n="910"><said who="#Syme">“ It is quite true . There is a crowd or an army or some such thing across the end of that street . ”</said></p>
    <p n="911"><said who="#Bull">“ Well , if there is , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>impatiently ,<said who="#Bull">“ it must be something else — a sham fight or the mayor 's birthday or something . I cannot and will not believe that plain , jolly people in a place like this walk about with dynamite in their pockets . Get on a bit ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, and let us look at them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="912">The car crawled about a hundred yards farther , and then they were all startled by<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>breaking into a high crow of laughter .</p>
    <p n="913"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Why , you silly mugs ! ”</said>he cried ,<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ what did I tell you . That crowd 's as law-abiding as a cow , and if it were n't , it 's on our side . ”</said></p>
    <p n="914"><said who="#Bull">“ How do you know ? ”</said>asked the professor , staring .</p>
    <p n="915"><said who="#Bull">“ You blind bat , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>,<said who="#Bull">“ do n't you see who is leading them ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="916">They peered again , and then<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>, with a catch in his voice , cried out —</p>
    <p n="917"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ Why , it 's<persName>Renard</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="918">There was , indeed , a rank of dim figures running across the road , and they could not be clearly seen ; but far enough in front to catch the accident of the evening light was stalking up and down the unmistakable<persName corresp="#Dr._Renard">Dr. Renard</persName>, in a white hat , stroking his long brown beard , and holding a revolver in his left hand .</p>
    <p n="919"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ What a fool I 've been ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>.<said who="#the_Colonel">“ Of course , the dear old boy has turned out to help us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="920"><persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>was bubbling over with laughter , swinging the sword in his hand as carelessly as a cane . He jumped out of the car and ran across the intervening space , calling out —</p>
    <p n="921"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Renard">Dr. Renard</persName>!<persName corresp="#Dr._Renard">Dr. Renard</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="922">An instant after<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>thought his own eyes had gone mad in his head . For the philanthropic<persName corresp="#Dr._Renard">Dr. Renard</persName>had deliberately raised his revolver and fired twice at<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>, so that the shots rang down the road .</p>
    <p n="923">Almost at the same second as the puff of white cloud went up from this atrocious explosion a long puff of white cloud went up also from the cigarette of the cynical<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>. Like all the rest he turned a little pale , but he smiled .<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, at whom the bullets had been fired , just missing his scalp , stood quite still in the middle of the road without a sign of fear , and then turned very slowly and crawled back to the car , and climbed in with two holes through his hat .</p>
    <p n="924"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Well , ”</said>said the cigarette smoker slowly ,<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ what do you think now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="925"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ I think , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>with precision ,<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ that I am lying in bed at No . 217 Peabody Buildings , and that I shall soon wake up with a jump ; or , if that 's not it , I think that I am sitting in a small cushioned cell in Hanwell , and that the doctor can n't make much of my case . But if you want to know what I do n't think , I 'll tell you . I do n't think what you think . I do n't think , and I never shall think , that the mass of ordinary men are a pack of dirty modern thinkers . No , sir , I 'm a democrat , and I still do n't believe that Sunday could convert one average navvy or counter-jumper . No , I may be mad , but humanity is n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="926"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>turned his bright blue eyes on<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>with an earnestness which he did not commonly make clear .</p>
    <p n="927"><said who="#Bull">“ You are a very fine fellow , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Bull">“ You can believe in a sanity which is not merely your sanity . And you 're right enough about humanity , about peasants and people like that jolly old innkeeper . But you 're not right about<persName>Renard</persName>. I suspected him from the first . He 's rationalistic , and , what 's worse , he 's rich . When duty and religion are really destroyed , it will be by the rich . ”</said></p>
    <p n="928"><said who="#Syme">“ They are really destroyed now , ”</said>said the man with a cigarette , and rose with his hands in his pockets .<said who="#Syme">“ The devils are coming on ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="929">The men in the motor-car looked anxiously in the direction of his dreamy gaze , and they saw that the whole regiment at the end of the road was advancing upon them ,<persName corresp="#Dr._Renard">Dr. Renard</persName>marching furiously in front , his beard flying in the breeze .</p>
    <p n="930"><persName corresp="#the_Colonel">The Colonel</persName>sprang out of the car with an intolerant exclamation .</p>
    <p n="931"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ Gentlemen , ”</said>he cried ,<said who="#the_Colonel">“ the thing is incredible . It must be a practical joke . If you knew<persName>Renard</persName>as I do — it 's like calling Queen<persName>Victoria</persName>a dynamiter . If you had got the man 's character into your head — ”</said></p>
    <p n="932"><said who="#Syme">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>sardonically ,<said who="#Syme">“ has at least got it into his hat . ”</said></p>
    <p n="933"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ I tell you it can n't be ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>, stamping .</p>
    <p n="934"><said who="#Syme">“<persName>Renard</persName>shall explain it . He shall explain it to me , ”</said>and he strode forward .</p>
    <p n="935"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ Do n't be in such a hurry , ”</said>drawled the smoker .<said who="#the_Colonel">“ He will very soon explain it to all of us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="936">But the impatient<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel</persName>was already out of earshot , advancing towards the advancing enemy . The excited<persName corresp="#Dr._Renard">Dr. Renard</persName>lifted his pistol again , but perceiving his opponent , hesitated , and<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>came face to face with him with frantic gestures of remonstrance .</p>
    <p n="937"><said who="#Syme">“ It is no good , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ He will never get anything out of that old heathen . I vote we drive bang through the thick of them , bang as the bullets went through<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>'s hat . We may all be killed , but we must kill a tidy number of them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="938"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ I wo n't ‘ ave it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, growing more vulgar in the sincerity of his virtue .<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ The poor chaps may be making a mistake . Give<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>a chance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="939"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Shall we go back , then ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.</p>
    <p n="940"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>in a cold voice ,<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ the street behind us is held too . In fact , I seem to see there another friend of yours ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="941"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>spun round smartly , and stared backwards at the track which they had travelled . He saw an irregular body of horsemen gathering and galloping towards them in the gloom . He saw above the foremost saddle the silver gleam of a sword , and then as it grew nearer the silver gleam of an old man 's hair . The next moment , with shattering violence , he had swung the motor round and sent it dashing down the steep side street to the sea , like a man that desired only to die .</p>
    <p n="942"><said who="#the_Professor">“ What the devil is up ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, seizing his arm .</p>
    <p n="943"><said who="#Syme">“ The morning star has fallen ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, as his own car went down the darkness like a falling star .</p>
    <p n="944">The others did not understand his words , but when they looked back at the street above they saw the hostile cavalry coming round the corner and down the slopes after them ; and foremost of all rode the good innkeeper , flushed with the fiery innocence of the evening light .</p>
    <p n="945"><said who="#the_Professor">“ The world is insane ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, and buried his face in his hands .</p>
    <p n="946"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>in adamantine humility ,<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ it is I . ”</said></p>
    <p n="947"><said who="#the_Professor">“ What are we going to do ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.</p>
    <p n="948"><said who="#Syme">“ At this moment , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, with a scientific detachment ,<said who="#Syme">“ I think we are going to smash into a lamppost . ”</said></p>
    <p n="949">The next instant the automobile had come with a catastrophic jar against an iron object . The instant after that four men had crawled out from under a chaos of metal , and a tall lean lamp-post that had stood up straight on the edge of the marine parade stood out , bent and twisted , like the branch of a broken tree .</p>
    <p n="950"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Well , we smashed something , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, with a faint smile .<said who="#the_Professor">“ That 's some comfort . ”</said></p>
    <p n="951"><said who="#Syme">“ You 're becoming an anarchist , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, dusting his clothes with his instinct of daintiness .</p>
    <p n="952"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Everyone is , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>.</p>
    <p n="953">As they spoke , the white-haired horseman and his followers came thundering from above , and almost at the same moment a dark string of men ran shouting along the sea-front .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>snatched a sword , and took it in his teeth ; he stuck two others under his arm-pits , took a fourth in his left hand and the lantern in his right , and leapt off the high parade on to the beach below .</p>
    <p n="954">The others leapt after him , with a common acceptance of such decisive action , leaving the debris and the gathering mob above them .</p>
    <p n="955"><said who="#Syme">“ We have one more chance , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, taking the steel out of his mouth .<said who="#Syme">“ Whatever all this pandemonium means , I suppose the police station will help us . We can n't get there , for they hold the way . But there 's a pier or breakwater runs out into the sea just here , which we could defend longer than anything else , like Horatius and his bridge . We must defend it till the Gendarmerie turn out . Keep after me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="956">They followed him as he went crunching down the beach , and in a second or two their boots broke not on the sea gravel , but on broad , flat stones . They marched down a long , low jetty , running out in one arm into the dim , boiling sea , and when they came to the end of it they felt that they had come to the end of their story . They turned and faced the town .</p>
    <p n="957">That town was transfigured with uproar . All along the high parade from which they had just descended was a dark and roaring stream of humanity , with tossing arms and fiery faces , groping and glaring towards them . The long dark line was dotted with torches and lanterns ; but even where no flame lit up a furious face , they could see in the farthest figure , in the most shadowy gesture , an organised hate . It was clear that they were the accursed of all men , and they knew not why .</p>
    <p n="958">Two or three men , looking little and black like monkeys , leapt over the edge as they had done and dropped on to the beach . These came ploughing down the deep sand , shouting horribly , and strove to wade into the sea at random . The example was followed , and the whole black mass of men began to run and drip over the edge like black treacle .</p>
    <p n="959">Foremost among the men on the beach<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>saw the peasant who had driven their cart . He splashed into the surf on a huge cart-horse , and shook his axe at them .</p>
    <p n="960"><said who="#Syme">“ The peasant ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ They have not risen since the Middle Ages . ”</said></p>
    <p n="961"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Even if the police do come now , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>mournfully ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ they can do nothing with this mob . ”</said></p>
    <p n="962"><said who="#Bull">“ Nonsense ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>desperately ;<said who="#Bull">“ there must be some people left in the town who are human . ”</said></p>
    <p n="963"><said who="#the_Professor">“ No , ”</said>said the hopeless Inspector ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ the human being will soon be extinct . We are the last of mankind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="964"><said who="#the_Professor">“ It may be , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>absently . Then he added in his dreamy voice ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ What is all that at the end of the ‘ Dunciad ’ ?</said></p>
    <p n="965">‘ Nor public flame ; nor private , dares to shine ; Nor human light is left , nor glimpse divine ! Lo ! thy dread Empire , Chaos , is restored ; Light dies before thine uncreating word : Thy hand , great Anarch , lets the curtain fall ; And universal darkness buries all . ’ ”</p>
    <p n="966"><said who="#Bull">“ Stop ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>suddenly ,<said who="#Bull">“ the gendarmes are out . ”</said></p>
    <p n="967">The low lights of the police station were indeed blotted and broken with hurrying figures , and they heard through the darkness the clash and jingle of a disciplined cavalry .</p>
    <p n="968"><said who="#Bull">“ They are charging the mob ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>in ecstacy or alarm .</p>
    <p n="969"><said who="#Syme">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ they are formed along the parade . ”</said></p>
    <p n="970"><said who="#Bull">“ They have unslung their carbines , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>dancing with excitement .</p>
    <p n="971"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>,<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ and they are going to fire on us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="972">As he spoke there came a long crackle of musketry , and bullets seemed to hop like hailstones on the stones in front of them .</p>
    <p n="973"><said who="#the_Professor">“ The gendarmes have joined them ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, and struck his forehead .</p>
    <p n="974"><said who="#Bull">“ I am in the padded cell , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>solidly .</p>
    <p n="975">There was a long silence , and then<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>said , looking out over the swollen sea , all a sort of grey purple —</p>
    <p n="976"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ What does it matter who is mad or who is sane ? We shall all be dead soon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="977"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>turned to him and said —</p>
    <p n="978"><said who="#Syme">“ You are quite hopeless , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="979">Mr.<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>kept a stony silence ; then at last he said quietly —</p>
    <p n="980"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ No ; oddly enough I am not quite hopeless . There is one insane little hope that I cannot get out of my mind . The power of this whole planet is against us , yet I cannot help wondering whether this one silly little hope is hopeless yet . ”</said></p>
    <p n="981"><said who="#Syme">“ In what or whom is your hope ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with curiosity .</p>
    <p n="982"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ In a man I never saw , ”</said>said the other , looking at the leaden sea .</p>
    <p n="983"><said who="#Syme">“ I know what you mean , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>in a low voice ,<said who="#Syme">“ the man in the dark room . But Sunday must have killed him by now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="984"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Perhaps , ”</said>said the other steadily ;<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ but if so , he was the only man whom Sunday found it hard to kill . ”</said></p>
    <p n="985"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I heard what you said , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, with his back turned .<said who="#the_Professor">“ I also am holding hard on to the thing I never saw . ”</said></p>
    <p n="986">All of a sudden<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, who was standing as if blind with introspective thought , swung round and cried out , like a man waking from sleep —</p>
    <p n="987"><said who="#Syme">“ Where is<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>? I thought he was with us ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="988"><said who="#Bull">“<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">The Colonel</persName>! Yes , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>,<said who="#Bull">“ where on earth is<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="989"><said who="#the_Professor">“ He went to speak to<persName>Renard</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.</p>
    <p n="990"><said who="#Syme">“ We cannot leave him among all those beasts , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ Let us die like gentlemen if — ”</said></p>
    <p n="991"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Do not pity<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>, with a pale sneer .<said who="#Ratcliffe">“ He is extremely comfortable . He is — ”</said></p>
    <p n="992"><said who="#Syme">“ No ! no ! no ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>in a kind of frenzy ,<said who="#Syme">“ not<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>too ! I will never believe it ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="993"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Will you believe your eyes ? ”</said>asked the other , and pointed to the beach .</p>
    <p n="994">Many of their pursuers had waded into the water shaking their fists , but the sea was rough , and they could not reach the pier . Two or three figures , however , stood on the beginning of the stone footway , and seemed to be cautiously advancing down it . The glare of a chance lantern lit up the faces of the two foremost . One face wore a black half-mask , and under it the mouth was twisting about in such a madness of nerves that the black tuft of beard wriggled round and round like a restless , living thing . The other was the red face and white moustache of<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel Ducroix</persName>. They were in earnest consultation .</p>
    <p n="995"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Yes , he is gone too , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, and sat down on a stone .<said who="#the_Professor">“ Everything 's gone . I 'm gone ! I can n't trust my own bodily machinery . I feel as if my own hand might fly up and strike me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="996"><said who="#Syme">“ When my hand flies up , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, “ it will strike somebody else , ” and he strode along the pier towards<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>, the sword in one hand and the lantern in the other .</p>
    <p n="997">As if to destroy the last hope or doubt ,<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>, who saw him coming , pointed his revolver at him and fired . The shot missed<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, but struck his sword , breaking it short at the hilt .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>rushed on , and swung the iron lantern above his head .</p>
    <p n="998"><said who="#the_Colonel">“ Judas before Herod ! ”</said>he said , and struck<persName corresp="#the_Colonel">the Colonel</persName>down upon the stones . Then he turned to<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>, whose frightful mouth was almost foaming now , and held the lamp high with so rigid and arresting a gesture , that the man was , as it were , frozen for a moment , and forced to hear .</p>
    <p n="999"><said who="#Syme">“ Do you see this lantern ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>in a terrible voice .<said who="#Syme">“ Do you see the cross carved on it , and the flame inside ? You did not make it . You did not light it . Better men than you , men who could believe and obey , twisted the entrails of iron and preserved the legend of fire . There is not a street you walk on , there is not a thread you wear , that was not made as this lantern was , by denying your philosophy of dirt and rats . You can make nothing . You can only destroy . You will destroy mankind ; you will destroy the world . Let that suffice you . Yet this one old Christian lantern you shall not destroy . It shall go where your empire of apes will never have the wit to find it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1000">He struck<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>once with the lantern so that he staggered ; and then , whirling it twice round his head , sent it flying far out to sea , where it flared like a roaring rocket and fell .</p>
    <p n="1001"><said who="#Syme">“ Swords ! ”</said>shouted<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, turning his flaming face to the three behind him .<said who="#Syme">“ Let us charge these dogs , for our time has come to die . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1002">His three companions came after him sword in hand .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s sword was broken , but he rent a bludgeon from the fist of a fisherman , flinging him down . In a moment they would have flung themselves upon the face of the mob and perished , when an interruption came .<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">The Secretary</persName>, ever since<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s speech , had stood with his hand to his stricken head as if dazed ; now he suddenly pulled off his black mask .</p>
    <p n="1003">The pale face thus peeled in the lamplight revealed not so much rage as astonishment . He put up his hand with an anxious authority .</p>
    <p n="1004"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ There is some mistake , ”</said>he said .<said who="#the_Secretary">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Syme">Mr. Syme</persName>, I hardly think you understand your position . I arrest you in the name of the law . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1005"><said who="#Syme">“ Of the law ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, and dropped his stick .</p>
    <p n="1006"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Certainly ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>.<said who="#the_Secretary">“ I am a detective from Scotland Yard , ”</said>and he took a small blue card from his pocket .</p>
    <p n="1007"><said who="#the_Professor">“ And what do you suppose we are ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>, and threw up his arms .</p>
    <p n="1008"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ You , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>stiffly ,<said who="#the_Secretary">“ are , as I know for a fact , members of the Supreme Anarchist Council . Disguised as one of you , I — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1009"><persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>tossed his sword into the sea .</p>
    <p n="1010"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ There never was any Supreme Anarchist Council , ”</said>he said .<said who="#the_Secretary">“ We were all a lot of silly policemen looking at each other . And all these nice people who have been peppering us with shot thought we were the dynamiters . I knew I could n't be wrong about the mob , ”</said>he said , beaming over the enormous multitude , which stretched away to the distance on both sides .<said who="#the_Secretary">“ Vulgar people are never mad . I 'm vulgar myself , and I know . I am now going on shore to stand a drink to everybody here . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="13">
    <p n="1011">NEXT morning five bewildered but hilarious people took the boat for Dover . The poor old<persName corresp="#Ducroix">Colonel</persName>might have had some cause to complain , having been first forced to fight for two factions that did n't exist , and then knocked down with an iron lantern . But he was a magnanimous old gentleman , and being much relieved that neither party had anything to do with dynamite , he saw them off on the pier with great geniality .</p>
    <p n="1012">The five reconciled detectives had a hundred details to explain to each other .<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">The Secretary</persName>had to tell<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>how they had come to wear masks originally in order to approach the supposed enemy as fellow-conspirators .</p>
    <p n="1013"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had to explain how they had fled with such swiftness through a civilised country . But above all these matters of detail which could be explained , rose the central mountain of the matter that they could not explain . What did it all mean ? If they were all harmless officers , what was Sunday ? If he had not seized the world , what on earth had he been up to ?<persName corresp="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">Inspector Ratcliffe</persName>was still gloomy about this .</p>
    <p n="1014"><said who="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">“ I can n't make head or tail of old Sunday 's little game any more than you can , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">“ But whatever else Sunday is , he is n't a blameless citizen . Damn it ! do you remember his face ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1015"><said who="#Syme">“ I grant you , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ that I have never been able to forget it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1016"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>, “ I suppose we can find out soon , for tomorrow we have our next general meeting . You will excuse me , ” he said , with a rather ghastly smile ,<said who="#the_Secretary">“ for being well acquainted with my secretarial duties . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1017"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I suppose you are right , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>reflectively .<said who="#the_Professor">“ I suppose we might find it out from him ; but I confess that I should feel a bit afraid of asking Sunday who he really is . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1018"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Why , ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>,<said who="#the_Secretary">“ for fear of bombs ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1019"><said who="#the_Professor">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>,<said who="#the_Professor">“ for fear he might tell me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1020"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Let us have some drinks , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, after a silence .</p>
    <p n="1021">Throughout their whole journey by boat and train they were highly convivial , but they instinctively kept together .<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, who had always been the optimist of the party , endeavoured to persuade the other four that the whole company could take the same hansom cab from<persName>Victoria</persName>; but this was over-ruled , and they went in a four-wheeler , with<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>on the box , singing . They finished their journey at an hotel in Piccadilly Circus , so as to be close to the early breakfast next morning in Leicester Square . Yet even then the adventures of the day were not entirely over .<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, discontented with the general proposal to go to bed , had strolled out of the hotel at about eleven to see and taste some of the beauties of London . Twenty minutes afterwards , however , he came back and made quite a clamour in the hall .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, who tried at first to soothe him , was forced at last to listen to his communication with quite new attention .</p>
    <p n="1022"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ I tell you I 've seen him ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, with thick emphasis .</p>
    <p n="1023"><said who="#Syme">“ Whom ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>quickly .<said who="#Syme">“ Not<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1024"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Not so bad as that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, with unnecessary laughter ,<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ not so bad as that . I 've got him here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1025"><said who="#Syme">“ Got whom here ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>impatiently .</p>
    <p n="1026"><said who="#Gogol">“ Hairy man , ”</said>said the other lucidly , “ man that used to be hairy man —<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>. Here he is , ” and he pulled forward by a reluctant elbow the identical young man who five days before had marched out of the Council with thin red hair and a pale face , the first of all the sham anarchists who had been exposed .</p>
    <p n="1027"><said who="#Syme">“ Why do you worry with me ? ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Syme">“ You have expelled me as a spy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1028"><said who="#Syme">“ We are all spies ! ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1029"><said who="#Syme">“ We 're all spies ! ”</said>shouted<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ Come and have a drink . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1030">Next morning the battalion of the reunited six marched stolidly towards the hotel in Leicester Square .</p>
    <p n="1031"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ This is more cheerful , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>;<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ we are six men going to ask one man what he means . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1032"><said who="#Syme">“ I think it is a bit queerer than that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ I think it is six men going to ask one man what they mean . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1033">They turned in silence into the Square , and though the hotel was in the opposite corner , they saw at once the little balcony and a figure that looked too big for it . He was sitting alone with bent head , poring over a newspaper . But all his councillors , who had come to vote him down , crossed that Square as if they were watched out of heaven by a hundred eyes .</p>
    <p n="1034">They had disputed much upon their policy , about whether they should leave the unmasked<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>without and begin diplomatically , or whether they should bring him in and blow up the gunpowder at once . The influence of<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>and<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>prevailed for the latter course , though<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>to the last asked them why they attacked Sunday so rashly .</p>
    <p n="1035"><said who="#Syme">“ My reason is quite simple , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ I attack him rashly because I am afraid of him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1036">They followed<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>up the dark stair in silence , and they all came out simultaneously into the broad sunlight of the morning and the broad sunlight of Sunday 's smile .</p>
    <p n="1037"><said who="#Syme">“ Delightful ! ”</said>he said .<said who="#Syme">“ So pleased to see you all . What an exquisite day it is . Is the Czar dead ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1038"><persName corresp="#the_Secretary">The Secretary</persName>, who happened to be foremost , drew himself together for a dignified outburst .</p>
    <p n="1039"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ No , sir , ”</said>he said sternly “ there has been no massacre . I bring you news of no such disgusting spectacles . ”</p>
    <p n="1040"><said who="#the_President">“ Disgusting spectacles ? ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>, with a bright , inquiring smile .<said who="#the_President">“ You mean<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>'s spectacles ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1041"><persName corresp="#the_Secretary">The Secretary</persName>choked for a moment , and<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>went on with a sort of smooth appeal —</p>
    <p n="1042"><said who="#the_President">“ Of course , we all have our opinions and even our eyes , but really to call them disgusting before the man himself — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1043"><persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>tore off his spectacles and broke them on the table .</p>
    <p n="1044"><said who="#the_President">“ My spectacles are blackguardly , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#the_President">“ but I 'm not . Look at my face . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1045"><said who="#the_President">“ I dare say it 's the sort of face that grows on one , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>,<said who="#the_President">“ in fact , it grows on you ; and who am I to quarrel with the wild fruits upon the Tree of Life ? I dare say it will grow on me some day . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1046"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ We have no time for tomfoolery , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>, breaking in savagely .<said who="#the_Secretary">“ We have come to know what all this means . Who are you ? What are you ? Why did you get us all here ? Do you know who and what we are ? Are you a half-witted man playing the conspirator , or are you a clever man playing the fool ? Answer me , I tell you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1047"><said who="#the_President">“ Candidates , ”</said>murmured Sunday ,<said who="#the_President">“ are only required to answer eight out of the seventeen questions on the paper . As far as I can make out , you want me to tell you what I am , and what you are , and what this table is , and what this Council is , and what this world is for all I know . Well , I will go so far as to rend the veil of one mystery . If you want to know what you are , you are a set of highly well-intentioned young jackasses . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1048"><said who="#Syme">“ And you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, leaning forward ,<said who="#Syme">“ what are you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1049"><said who="#the_President">“ I ? What am I ? ”</said>roared<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>, and he rose slowly to an incredible height , like some enormous wave about to arch above them and break .<said who="#the_President">“ You want to know what I am , do you ?<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>, you are a man of science . Grub in the roots of those trees and find out the truth about them .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, you are a poet . Stare at those morning clouds . But I tell you this , that you will have found out the truth of the last tree and the top-most cloud before the truth about me . You will understand the sea , and I shall be still a riddle ; you shall know what the stars are , and not know what I am . Since the beginning of the world all men have hunted me like a wolf — kings and sages , and poets and lawgivers , all the churches , and all the philosophies . But I have never been caught yet , and the skies will fall in the time I turn to bay . I have given them a good run for their money , and I will now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1050">Before one of them could move , the monstrous man had swung himself like some huge ourang-outang over the balustrade of the balcony . Yet before he dropped he pulled himself up again as on a horizontal bar , and thrusting his great chin over the edge of the balcony , said solemnly —</p>
    <p n="1051"><said who="#the_President">“ There 's one thing I 'll tell you though about who I am . I am the man in the dark room , who made you all policemen . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1052">With that he fell from the balcony , bouncing on the stones below like a great ball of india-rubber , and went bounding off towards the corner of the Alhambra , where he hailed a hansom-cab and sprang inside it . The six detectives had been standing thunderstruck and livid in the light of his last assertion ; but when he disappeared into the cab ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s practical senses returned to him , and leaping over the balcony so recklessly as almost to break his legs , he called another cab .</p>
    <p n="1053">He and<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>sprang into the cab together ,<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>and the Inspector into another , while<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>and the late<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>scrambled into a third just in time to pursue the flying<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, who was pursuing the flying President . Sunday led them a wild chase towards the north-west , his cabman , evidently under the influence of more than common inducements , urging the horse at breakneck speed . But<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was in no mood for delicacies , and he stood up in his own cab shouting ,<said who="#Syme">“ Stop thief ! ”</said>until crowds ran along beside his cab , and policemen began to stop and ask questions . All this had its influence upon<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>'s cabman , who began to look dubious , and to slow down to a trot . He opened the trap to talk reasonably to his fare , and in so doing let the long whip droop over the front of the cab . Sunday leant forward , seized it , and jerked it violently out of the man 's hand . Then standing up in front of the cab himself , he lashed the horse and roared aloud , so that they went down the streets like a flying storm . Through street after street and square after square went whirling this preposterous vehicle , in which the fare was urging the horse and the driver trying desperately to stop it . The other three cabs came after it ( if the phrase be permissible of a cab ) like panting hounds . Shops and streets shot by like rattling arrows .</p>
    <p n="1054">At the highest ecstacy of speed , Sunday turned round on the splashboard where he stood , and sticking his great grinning head out of the cab , with white hair whistling in the wind , he made a horrible face at his pursuers , like some colossal urchin . Then raising his right hand swiftly , he flung a ball of paper in<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s face and vanished .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>caught the thing while instinctively warding it off , and discovered that it consisted of two crumpled papers . One was addressed to himself , and the other to<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, with a very long , and it is to be feared partly ironical , string of letters after his name .<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>'s address was , at any rate , considerably longer than his communication , for the communication consisted entirely of the words :—</p>
    <p n="1055"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ What about Martin Tupper now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1056"><said who="#Bull">“ What does the old maniac mean ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>, staring at the words .<said who="#Bull">“ What does yours say ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1057"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s message was , at any rate , longer , and ran as follows :—</p>
    <p n="1058"><said who="#Syme">“ No one would regret anything in the nature of an interference by the Archdeacon more than I. I trust it will not come to that . But , for the last time , where are your goloshes ? The thing is too bad , especially after what uncle said . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1059"><persName corresp="#the_President">The President</persName>'s cabman seemed to be regaining some control over his horse , and the pursuers gained a little as they swept round into the Edgware Road . And here there occurred what seemed to the allies a providential stoppage . Traffic of every kind was swerving to right or left or stopping , for down the long road was coming the unmistakable roar announcing the fire-engine , which in a few seconds went by like a brazen thunderbolt . But quick as it went by , Sunday had bounded out of his cab , sprung at the fire-engine , caught it , slung himself on to it , and was seen as he disappeared in the noisy distance talking to the astonished fireman with explanatory gestures .</p>
    <p n="1060"><said who="#Syme">“ After him ! ”</said>howled<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ He can n't go astray now . There 's no mistaking a fire-engine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1061">The three cabmen , who had been stunned for a moment , whipped up their horses and slightly decreased the distance between themselves and their disappearing prey .<persName corresp="#the_President">The President</persName>acknowledged this proximity by coming to the back of the car , bowing repeatedly , kissing his hand , and finally flinging a neatly-folded note into the bosom of<persName corresp="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">Inspector Ratcliffe</persName>. When that gentleman opened it , not without impatience , he found it contained the words :—</p>
    <p n="1062"><said who="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">“ Fly at once . The truth about your trouser-stretchers is known . — A FRIEND . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1063">The fire-engine had struck still farther to the north , into a region that they did not recognise ; and as it ran by a line of high railings shadowed with trees , the six friends were startled , but somewhat relieved , to see<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>leap from the fire-engine , though whether through another whim or the increasing protest of his entertainers they could not see . Before the three cabs , however , could reach up to the spot , he had gone up the high railings like a huge grey cat , tossed himself over , and vanished in a darkness of leaves .</p>
    <p n="1064"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with a furious gesture stopped his cab , jumped out , and sprang also to the escalade . When he had one leg over the fence and his friends were following , he turned a face on them which shone quite pale in the shadow .</p>
    <p n="1065"><said who="#Syme">“ What place can this be ? ”</said>he asked .<said who="#Syme">“ Can it be the old devil 's house ? I 've heard he has a house in North London . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1066"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ All the better , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>grimly , planting a foot in a foothold ,<said who="#the_Secretary">“ we shall find him at home . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1067"><said who="#Syme">“ No , but it is n't that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, knitting his brows .<said who="#Syme">“ I hear the most horrible noises , like devils laughing and sneezing and blowing their devilish noses ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1068"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ His dogs barking , of course , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1069"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Why not say his black-beetles barking ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>furiously ,<said who="#the_Secretary">“ snails barking ! geraniums barking ! Did you ever hear a dog bark like that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1070">He held up his hand , and there came out of the thicket a long growling roar that seemed to get under the skin and freeze the flesh — a low thrilling roar that made a throbbing in the air all about them .</p>
    <p n="1071"><said who="#Gogol">“ The dogs of Sunday would be no ordinary dogs , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>, and shuddered .</p>
    <p n="1072"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had jumped down on the other side , but he still stood listening impatiently .</p>
    <p n="1073"><said who="#Gogol">“ Well , listen to that , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Gogol">“ is that a dog — anybody 's dog ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1074">There broke upon their ear a hoarse screaming as of things protesting and clamouring in sudden pain ; and then , far off like an echo , what sounded like a long nasal trumpet .</p>
    <p n="1075"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Well , his house ought to be hell ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>;<said who="#the_Secretary">“ and if it is hell , I 'm going in ! ”</said>and he sprang over the tall railings almost with one swing .</p>
    <p n="1076">The others followed . They broke through a tangle of plants and shrubs , and came out on an open path . Nothing was in sight , but<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>suddenly struck his hands together .</p>
    <p n="1077"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Why , you asses , ”</said>he cried ,<said who="#the_Secretary">“ it 's the Zoo ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1078">As they were looking round wildly for any trace of their wild quarry , a keeper in uniform came running along the path with a man in plain clothes .</p>
    <p n="1079"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Has it come this way ? ”</said>gasped the keeper .</p>
    <p n="1080"><said who="#Syme">“ Has what ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1081"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ The elephant ! ”</said>cried the keeper .<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ An elephant has gone mad and run away ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1082"><said who="#Syme">“ He has run away with an old gentleman , ”</said>said the other stranger breathlessly ,<said who="#Syme">“ a poor old gentleman with white hair ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1083"><said who="#Syme">“ What sort of old gentleman ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, with great curiosity .</p>
    <p n="1084"><said who="#the_keeper">“ A very large and fat old gentleman in light grey clothes , ”</said>said the keeper eagerly .</p>
    <p n="1085"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ if he 's that particular kind of old gentleman , if you 're quite sure that he 's a large and fat old gentleman in grey clothes , you may take my word for it that the elephant has not run away with him . He has run away with the elephant . The elephant is not made by God that could run away with him if he did not consent to the elopement . And , by thunder , there he is ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1086">There was no doubt about it this time . Clean across the space of grass , about two hundred yards away , with a crowd screaming and scampering vainly at his heels , went a huge grey elephant at an awful stride , with his trunk thrown out as rigid as a ship 's bowsprit , and trumpeting like the trumpet of doom . On the back of the bellowing and plunging animal sat President Sunday with all the placidity of a sultan , but goading the animal to a furious speed with some sharp object in his hand .</p>
    <p n="1087"><said who="#Syme">“ Stop him ! ”</said>screamed the populace .<said who="#Syme">“ He 'll be out of the gate ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1088"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Stop a landslide ! ”</said>said the keeper .<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ He is out of the gate ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1089">And even as he spoke , a final crash and roar of terror announced that the great grey elephant had broken out of the gates of the Zoological Gardens , and was careening down Albany Street like a new and swift sort of omnibus .</p>
    <p n="1090"><said who="#Bull">“ Great Lord ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>,<said who="#Bull">“ I never knew an elephant could go so fast . Well , it must be hansom-cabs again if we are to keep him in sight . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1091">As they raced along to the gate out of which the elephant had vanished ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>felt a glaring panorama of the strange animals in the cages which they passed . Afterwards he thought it queer that he should have seen them so clearly . He remembered especially seeing pelicans , with their preposterous , pendant throats . He wondered why the pelican was the symbol of charity , except it was that it wanted a good deal of charity to admire a pelican . He remembered a hornbill , which was simply a huge yellow beak with a small bird tied on behind it . The whole gave him a sensation , the vividness of which he could not explain , that<persName>Nature</persName>was always making quite mysterious jokes . Sunday had told them that they would understand him when they had understood the stars . He wondered whether even the archangels understood the hornbill .</p>
    <p n="1092">The six unhappy detectives flung themselves into cabs and followed the elephant sharing the terror which he spread through the long stretch of the streets . This time Sunday did not turn round , but offered them the solid stretch of his unconscious back , which maddened them , if possible , more than his previous mockeries . Just before they came to Baker Street , however , he was seen to throw something far up into the air , as a boy does a ball meaning to catch it again . But at their rate of racing it fell far behind , just by the cab containing<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>; and in faint hope of a clue or for some impulse unexplainable , he stopped his cab so as to pick it up . It was addressed to himself , and was quite a bulky parcel . On examination , however , its bulk was found to consist of thirty-three pieces of paper of no value wrapped one round the other . When the last covering was torn away it reduced itself to a small slip of paper , on which was written :—</p>
    <p n="1093"><said who="#Gogol">“ The word , I fancy , should be ‘ pink ’ . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1094">The man once known as<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>said nothing , but the movements of his hands and feet were like those of a man urging a horse to renewed efforts .</p>
    <p n="1095">Through street after street , through district after district , went the prodigy of the flying elephant , calling crowds to every window , and driving the traffic left and right . And still through all this insane publicity the three cabs toiled after it , until they came to be regarded as part of a procession , and perhaps the advertisement of a circus . They went at such a rate that distances were shortened beyond belief , and<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>saw the Albert Hall in Kensington when he thought that he was still in Paddington . The animal 's pace was even more fast and free through the empty , aristocratic streets of South Kensington , and he finally headed towards that part of the sky-line where the enormous Wheel of Earl 's Court stood up in the sky . The wheel grew larger and larger , till it filled heaven like the wheel of stars .</p>
    <p n="1096">The beast outstripped the cabs . They lost him round several corners , and when they came to one of the gates of the Earl 's Court Exhibition they found themselves finally blocked . In front of them was an enormous crowd ; in the midst of it was an enormous elephant , heaving and shuddering as such shapeless creatures do . But<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>had disappeared .</p>
    <p n="1097"><said who="#Syme">“ Where has he gone to ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, slipping to the ground .</p>
    <p n="1098"><said who="#the_President">“ Gentleman rushed into the Exhibition , sir ! ”</said>said an official in a dazed manner . Then he added in an injured voice :<said who="#the_President">“ Funny gentleman , sir . Asked me to hold his horse , and gave me this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1099">He held out with distaste a piece of folded paper , addressed :<said who="#Syme">“ To<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>of the Central Anarchist Council . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1100"><persName corresp="#the_Secretary">The Secretary</persName>, raging , rent it open , and found written inside it :—</p>
    <p n="1101"><said>“ When the herring runs a mile , Let<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>smile ; When the herring tries to fly , Let<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>die . Rustic Proverb . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1102"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Why the eternal crikey , ”</said>began<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>,<said who="#the_Secretary">“ did you let the man in ? Do people commonly come to your Exhibition riding on mad elephants ? Do — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1103"><said who="#Syme">“ Look ! ”</said>shouted<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>suddenly .<said who="#Syme">“ Look over there ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1104"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Look at what ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>savagely .</p>
    <p n="1105"><said who="#Syme">“ Look at the captive balloon ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, and pointed in a frenzy .</p>
    <p n="1106"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Why the blazes should I look at a captive balloon ? ”</said>demanded<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>.<said who="#the_Secretary">“ What is there queer about a captive balloon ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1107"><said who="#Syme">“ Nothing , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ except that it is n't captive ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1108">They all turned their eyes to where the balloon swung and swelled above the Exhibition on a string , like a child 's balloon . A second afterwards the string came in two just under the car , and the balloon , broken loose , floated away with the freedom of a soap bubble .</p>
    <p n="1109"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Ten thousand devils ! ”</said>shrieked<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>.<said who="#the_Secretary">“ He 's got into it ! ”</said>and he shook his fists at the sky .</p>
    <p n="1110">The balloon , borne by some chance wind , came right above them , and they could see the great white head of<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>peering over the side and looking benevolently down on them .</p>
    <p n="1111"><said who="#the_Professor">“ God bless my soul ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>with the elderly manner that he could never disconnect from his bleached beard and parchment face .<said who="#the_Professor">“ God bless my soul ! I seemed to fancy that something fell on the top of my hat ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1112">He put up a trembling hand and took from that shelf a piece of twisted paper , which he opened absently only to find it inscribed with a true lover 's knot and , the words :—</p>
    <p n="1113"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Your beauty has not left me indifferent .— From LITTLE SNOWDROP . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1114">There was a short silence , and then<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>said , biting his beard —</p>
    <p n="1115"><said who="#Syme">“ I 'm not beaten yet . The blasted thing must come down somewhere . Let 's follow it ! ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="14">
    <p n="1116">ACROSS green fields , and breaking through blooming hedges , toiled six draggled detectives , about five miles out of London . The optimist of the party had at first proposed that they should follow the balloon across South England in hansom-cabs . But he was ultimately convinced of the persistent refusal of the balloon to follow the roads , and the still more persistent refusal of the cabmen to follow the balloon . Consequently the tireless though exasperated travellers broke through black thickets and ploughed through ploughed fields till each was turned into a figure too outrageous to be mistaken for a tramp . Those green hills of Surrey saw the final collapse and tragedy of the admirable light grey suit in which<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had set out from Saffron Park . His silk hat was broken over his nose by a swinging bough , his coat-tails were torn to the shoulder by arresting thorns , the clay of England was splashed up to his collar ; but he still carried his yellow beard forward with a silent and furious determination , and his eyes were still fixed on that floating ball of gas , which in the full flush of sunset seemed coloured like a sunset cloud .</p>
    <p n="1117"><said who="#Syme">“ After all , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Syme">“ it is very beautiful ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1118"><said who="#the_Professor">“ It is singularly and strangely beautiful ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.<said who="#the_Professor">“ I wish the beastly gas-bag would burst ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1119"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>,<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ I hope it wo n't . It might hurt the old boy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1120"><said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ Hurt him ! ”</said>said the vindictive<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>,<said who="#Professor_de_Worms">“ hurt him ! Not as much as I 'd hurt him if I could get up with him . Little Snowdrop ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1121"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ I do n't want him hurt , somehow , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1122"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ What ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>bitterly .<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Do you believe all that tale about his being our man in the dark room ? Sunday would say he was anybody . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1123"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ I do n't know whether I believe it or not , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>.<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ But it is n't that that I mean . I can n't wish old Sunday 's balloon to burst because — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1124"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>impatiently ,<said who="#Syme">“ because ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1125"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Well , because he 's so jolly like a balloon himself , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>desperately .<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ I do n't understand a word of all that idea of his being the same man who gave us all our blue cards . It seems to make everything nonsense . But I do n't care who knows it , I always had a sympathy for old Sunday himself , wicked as he was . Just as if he was a great bouncing baby . How can I explain what my queer sympathy was ? It did n't prevent my fighting him like hell ! Shall I make it clear if I say that I liked him because he was so fat ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1126"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ You will not , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1127"><said who="#Bull">“ I 've got it now , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>,<said who="#Bull">“ it was because he was so fat and so light . Just like a balloon . We always think of fat people as heavy , but he could have danced against a sylph . I see now what I mean . Moderate strength is shown in violence , supreme strength is shown in levity . It was like the old speculations — what would happen if an elephant could leap up in the sky like a grasshopper ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1128"><said who="#Syme">“ Our elephant , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, looking upwards ,<said who="#Syme">“ has leapt into the sky like a grasshopper . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1129"><said who="#Bull">“ And somehow , ”</said>concluded<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>,<said who="#Bull">“ that 's why I can n't help liking old Sunday . No , it 's not an admiration of force , or any silly thing like that . There is a kind of gaiety in the thing , as if he were bursting with some good news . Have n't you sometimes felt it on a spring day ? You know<persName>Nature</persName>plays tricks , but somehow that day proves they are good-natured tricks . I never read the Bible myself , but that part they laugh at is literal truth , ‘ Why leap ye , ye high hills ? ’ The hills do leap — at least , they try to .... Why do I like Sunday ?... how can I tell you ?... because he 's such a Bounder . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1130">There was a long silence , and then<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>said in a curious , strained voice —</p>
    <p n="1131"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ You do not know Sunday at all . Perhaps it is because you are better than I , and do not know hell . I was a fierce fellow , and a trifle morbid from the first . The man who sits in darkness , and who chose us all , chose me because I had all the crazy look of a conspirator — because my smile went crooked , and my eyes were gloomy , even when I smiled . But there must have been something in me that answered to the nerves in all these anarchic men . For when I first saw Sunday he expressed to me , not your airy vitality , but something both gross and sad in the<persName>Nature</persName>of Things . I found him smoking in a twilight room , a room with brown blind down , infinitely more depressing than the genial darkness in which our master lives . He sat there on a bench , a huge heap of a man , dark and out of shape . He listened to all my words without speaking or even stirring . I poured out my most passionate appeals , and asked my most eloquent questions . Then , after a long silence , the Thing began to shake , and I thought it was shaken by some secret malady . It shook like a loathsome and living jelly . It reminded me of everything I had ever read about the base bodies that are the origin of life — the deep sea lumps and protoplasm . It seemed like the final form of matter , the most shapeless and the most shameful . I could only tell myself , from its shudderings , that it was something at least that such a monster could be miserable . And then it broke upon me that the bestial mountain was shaking with a lonely laughter , and the laughter was at me . Do you ask me to forgive him that ? It is no small thing to be laughed at by something at once lower and stronger than oneself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1132"><said who="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">“ Surely you fellows are exaggerating wildly , ”</said>cut in the clear voice of<persName corresp="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">Inspector Ratcliffe</persName>.<said who="#Inspector_Ratcliffe">“ President Sunday is a terrible fellow for one 's intellect , but he is not such a Barnum 's freak physically as you make out . He received me in an ordinary office , in a grey check coat , in broad daylight . He talked to me in an ordinary way . But I 'll tell you what is a trifle creepy about Sunday . His room is neat , his clothes are neat , everything seems in order ; but he 's absent-minded . Sometimes his great bright eyes go quite blind . For hours he forgets that you are there . Now absent-mindedness is just a bit too awful in a bad man . We think of a wicked man as vigilant . We can n't think of a wicked man who is honestly and sincerely dreamy , because we dare n't think of a wicked man alone with himself . An absentminded man means a good-natured man . It means a man who , if he happens to see you , will apologise . But how will you bear an absentminded man who , if he happens to see you , will kill you ? That is what tries the nerves , abstraction combined with cruelty . Men have felt it sometimes when they went through wild forests , and felt that the animals there were at once innocent and pitiless . They might ignore or slay . How would you like to pass ten mortal hours in a parlour with an absent-minded tiger ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1133"><said who="#Syme">“ And what do you think of Sunday ,<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1134"><said who="#Gogol">“ I do n't think of Sunday on principle , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>simply ,<said who="#Gogol">“ any more than I stare at the sun at noonday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1135"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , that is a point of view , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>thoughtfully .<said who="#Syme">“ What do you say ,<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1136"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>was walking with bent head and trailing stick , and he did not answer at all .</p>
    <p n="1137"><said who="#Syme">“ Wake up ,<persName corresp="#Professor_de_Worms">Professor</persName>! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>genially .<said who="#Syme">“ Tell us what you think of Sunday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1138"><persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>spoke at last very slowly .</p>
    <p n="1139"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I think something , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ that I cannot say clearly . Or , rather , I think something that I cannot even think clearly . But it is something like this . My early life , as you know , was a bit too large and loose .</said></p>
    <p n="1140"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , when I saw Sunday 's face I thought it was too large — everybody does , but I also thought it was too loose . The face was so big , that one could n't focus it or make it a face at all . The eye was so far away from the nose , that it was n't an eye . The mouth was so much by itself , that one had to think of it by itself . The whole thing is too hard to explain . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1141">He paused for a little , still trailing his stick , and then went on —</p>
    <p n="1142"><said who="#the_Professor">“ But put it this way . Walking up a road at night , I have seen a lamp and a lighted window and a cloud make together a most complete and unmistakable face . If anyone in heaven has that face I shall know him again . Yet when I walked a little farther I found that there was no face , that the window was ten yards away , the lamp ten hundred yards , the cloud beyond the world . Well , Sunday 's face escaped me ; it ran away to right and left , as such chance pictures run away . And so his face has made me , somehow , doubt whether there are any faces . I do n't know whether your face ,<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>, is a face or a combination in perspective . Perhaps one black disc of your beastly glasses is quite close and another fifty miles away . Oh , the doubts of a materialist are not worth a dump . Sunday has taught me the last and the worst doubts , the doubts of a spiritualist . I am a Buddhist , I suppose ; and Buddhism is not a creed , it is a doubt . My poor dear<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>, I do not believe that you really have a face . I have not faith enough to believe in matter . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1143"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s eyes were still fixed upon the errant orb , which , reddened in the evening light , looked like some rosier and more innocent world .</p>
    <p n="1144"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Have you noticed an odd thing , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Syme">“ about all your descriptions ? Each man of you finds Sunday quite different , yet each man of you can only find one thing to compare him to — the universe itself .<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>finds him like the earth in spring ,<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>like the sun at noonday .<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">The Secretary</persName>is reminded of the shapeless protoplasm , and the Inspector of the carelessness of virgin forests .<persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>says he is like a changing landscape . This is queer , but it is queerer still that I also have had my odd notion about<persName corresp="#the_President">the President</persName>, and I also find that I think of Sunday as I think of the whole world . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1145"><said who="#Bull">“ Get on a little faster ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>;<said who="#Bull">“ never mind the balloon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1146"><said who="#Syme">“ When I first saw Sunday , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>slowly ,<said who="#Syme">“ I only saw his back ; and when I saw his back , I knew he was the worst man in the world . His neck and shoulders were brutal , like those of some apish god . His head had a stoop that was hardly human , like the stoop of an ox . In fact , I had at once the revolting fancy that this was not a man at all , but a beast dressed up in men 's clothes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1147"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Get on , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1148"><said who="#Syme">“ And then the queer thing happened . I had seen his back from the street , as he sat in the balcony . Then I entered the hotel , and coming round the other side of him , saw his face in the sunlight . His face frightened me , as it did everyone ; but not because it was brutal , not because it was evil . On the contrary , it frightened me because it was so beautiful , because it was so good . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1149"><said who="#the_Secretary">“<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>,<said who="#the_Secretary">“ are you ill ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1150"><said who="#Syme">“ It was like the face of some ancient archangel , judging justly after heroic wars . There was laughter in the eyes , and in the mouth honour and sorrow . There was the same white hair , the same great , grey-clad shoulders that I had seen from behind . But when I saw him from behind I was certain he was an animal , and when I saw him in front I knew he was a god . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1151"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Pan , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>dreamily ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ was a god and an animal . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1152"><said who="#Syme">“ Then , and again and always , ”</said>went on<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>like a man talking to himself ,<said who="#Syme">“ that has been for me the mystery of Sunday , and it is also the mystery of the world . When I see the horrible back , I am sure the noble face is but a mask . When I see the face but for an instant , I know the back is only a jest . Bad is so bad , that we cannot but think good an accident ; good is so good , that we feel certain that evil could be explained . But the whole came to a kind of crest yesterday when I raced Sunday for the cab , and was just behind him all the way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1153"><said who="#Ratcliffe">“ Had you time for thinking then ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1154"><said who="#Syme">“ Time , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ for one outrageous thought . I was suddenly possessed with the idea that the blind , blank back of his head really was his face — an awful , eyeless face staring at me ! And I fancied that the figure running in front of me was really a figure running backwards , and dancing as he ran . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1155"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Horrible ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, and shuddered .</p>
    <p n="1156"><said who="#Syme">“ Horrible is not the word , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>.<said who="#Syme">“ It was exactly the worst instant of my life . And yet ten minutes afterwards , when he put his head out of the cab and made a grimace like a gargoyle , I knew that he was only like a father playing hide-and-seek with his children . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1157"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ It is a long game , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>, and frowned at his broken boots .</p>
    <p n="1158"><said who="#Syme">“ Listen to me , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>with extraordinary emphasis .<said who="#Syme">“ Shall I tell you the secret of the whole world ? It is that we have only known the back of the world . We see everything from behind , and it looks brutal . That is not a tree , but the back of a tree . That is not a cloud , but the back of a cloud . Cannot you see that everything is stooping and hiding a face ? If we could only get round in front — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1159"><said who="#Bull">“ Look ! ”</said>cried out<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>clamorously ,<said who="#Bull">“ the balloon is coming down ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1160">There was no need to cry out to<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, who had never taken his eyes off it . He saw the great luminous globe suddenly stagger in the sky , right itself , and then sink slowly behind the trees like a setting sun .</p>
    <p n="1161">The man called<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>, who had hardly spoken through all their weary travels , suddenly threw up his hands like a lost spirit .</p>
    <p n="1162"><said who="#Gogol">“ He is dead ! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Gogol">“ And now I know he was my friend — my friend in the dark ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1163"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Dead ! ”</said>snorted<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>.<said who="#the_Secretary">“ You will not find him dead easily . If he has been tipped out of the car , we shall find him rolling as a colt rolls in a field , kicking his legs for fun . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1164"><said who="#the_Professor">“ Clashing his hoofs , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>.<said who="#the_Professor">“ The colts do , and so did Pan . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1165"><said who="#Dr._Bull">“ Pan again ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>irritably .<said who="#Dr._Bull">“ You seem to think Pan is everything . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1166"><said who="#the_Professor">“ So he is , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>,<said who="#the_Professor">“ in Greek . He means everything . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1167"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Do n't forget , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>, looking down ,<said who="#the_Secretary">“ that he also means Panic . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1168"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had stood without hearing any of the exclamations .</p>
    <p n="1169"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ It fell over there , ”</said>he said shortly .<said who="#the_Secretary">“ Let us follow it ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1170">Then he added with an indescribable gesture —</p>
    <p n="1171"><said who="#Syme">“ Oh , if he has cheated us all by getting killed ! It would be like one of his larks . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1172">He strode off towards the distant trees with a new energy , his rags and ribbons fluttering in the wind . The others followed him in a more footsore and dubious manner . And almost at the same moment all six men realised that they were not alone in the little field .</p>
    <p n="1173">Across the square of turf a tall man was advancing towards them , leaning on a strange long staff like a sceptre . He was clad in a fine but old-fashioned suit with knee-breeches ; its colour was that shade between blue , violet and grey which can be seen in certain shadows of the woodland . His hair was whitish grey , and at the first glance , taken along with his knee-breeches , looked as if it was powdered . His advance was very quiet ; but for the silver frost upon his head , he might have been one to the shadows of the wood .</p>
    <p n="1174"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Gentlemen , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#the_Secretary">“ my master has a carriage waiting for you in the road just by . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1175"><said who="#Syme">“ Who is your master ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, standing quite still .</p>
    <p n="1176"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ I was told you knew his name , ”</said>said the man respectfully .</p>
    <p n="1177">There was a silence , and then<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>said —</p>
    <p n="1178"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ Where is this carriage ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1179"><said who="#the_stranger">“ It has been waiting only a few moments , ”</said>said the stranger .<said who="#the_stranger">“ My master has only just come home . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1180"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>looked left and right upon the patch of green field in which he found himself . The hedges were ordinary hedges , the trees seemed ordinary trees ; yet he felt like a man entrapped in fairyland .</p>
    <p n="1181">He looked the mysterious ambassador up and down , but he could discover nothing except that the man 's coat was the exact colour of the purple shadows , and that the man 's face was the exact colour of the red and brown and golden sky .</p>
    <p n="1182"><said who="#Syme">“ Show us the place , ”</said><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>said briefly , and without a word the man in the violet coat turned his back and walked towards a gap in the hedge , which let in suddenly the light of a white road .</p>
    <p n="1183">As the six wanderers broke out upon this thoroughfare , they saw the white road blocked by what looked like a long row of carriages , such a row of carriages as might close the approach to some house in Park Lane . Along the side of these carriages stood a rank of splendid servants , all dressed in the grey-blue uniform , and all having a certain quality of stateliness and freedom which would not commonly belong to the servants of a gentleman , but rather to the officials and ambassadors of a great king . There were no less than six carriages waiting , one for each of the tattered and miserable band . All the attendants ( as if in court-dress ) wore swords , and as each man crawled into his carriage they drew them , and saluted with a sudden blaze of steel .</p>
    <p n="1184"><said who="#Bull">“ What can it all mean ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>of<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>as they separated .<said who="#Bull">“ Is this another joke of Sunday 's ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1185"><said who="#Syme">“ I do n't know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>as he sank wearily back in the cushions of his carriage ;<said who="#Syme">“ but if it is , it 's one of the jokes you talk about . It 's a good-natured one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1186">The six adventurers had passed through many adventures , but not one had carried them so utterly off their feet as this last adventure of comfort . They had all become inured to things going roughly ; but things suddenly going smoothly swamped them . They could not even feebly imagine what the carriages were ; it was enough for them to know that they were carriages , and carriages with cushions . They could not conceive who the old man was who had led them ; but it was quite enough that he had certainly led them to the carriages .</p>
    <p n="1187"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>drove through a drifting darkness of trees in utter abandonment . It was typical of him that while he had carried his bearded chin forward fiercely so long as anything could be done , when the whole business was taken out of his hands he fell back on the cushions in a frank collapse .</p>
    <p n="1188">Very gradually and very vaguely he realised into what rich roads the carriage was carrying him . He saw that they passed the stone gates of what might have been a park , that they began gradually to climb a hill which , while wooded on both sides , was somewhat more orderly than a forest . Then there began to grow upon him , as upon a man slowly waking from a healthy sleep , a pleasure in everything . He felt that the hedges were what hedges should be , living walls ; that a hedge is like a human army , disciplined , but all the more alive . He saw high elms behind the hedges , and vaguely thought how happy boys would be climbing there . Then his carriage took a turn of the path , and he saw suddenly and quietly , like a long , low , sunset cloud , a long , low house , mellow in the mild light of sunset . All the six friends compared notes afterwards and quarrelled ; but they all agreed that in some unaccountable way the place reminded them of their boyhood . It was either this elm-top or that crooked path , it was either this scrap of orchard or that shape of a window ; but each man of them declared that he could remember this place before he could remember his mother .</p>
    <p n="1189">When the carriages eventually rolled up to a large , low , cavernous gateway , another man in the same uniform , but wearing a silver star on the grey breast of his coat , came out to meet them . This impressive person said to the bewildered<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>—</p>
    <p n="1190"><said who="#Syme">“ Refreshments are provided for you in your room . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1191"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, under the influence of the same mesmeric sleep of amazement , went up the large oaken stairs after the respectful attendant . He entered a splendid suite of apartments that seemed to be designed specially for him . He walked up to a long mirror with the ordinary instinct of his class , to pull his tie straight or to smooth his hair ; and there he saw the frightful figure that he was — blood running down his face from where the bough had struck him , his hair standing out like yellow rags of rank grass , his clothes torn into long , wavering tatters . At once the whole enigma sprang up , simply as the question of how he had got there , and how he was to get out again . Exactly at the same moment a man in blue , who had been appointed as his valet , said very solemnly —</p>
    <p n="1192"><said who="#Syme">“ I have put out your clothes , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1193"><said who="#Syme">“ Clothes ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>sardonically .<said who="#Syme">“ I have no clothes except these , ”</said>and he lifted two long strips of his frock-coat in fascinating festoons , and made a movement as if to twirl like a ballet girl .</p>
    <p n="1194"><said who="#Bull">“ My master asks me to say , ”</said>said the attendant ,<said who="#Bull">“ that there is a fancy dress ball tonight , and that he desires you to put on the costume that I have laid out . Meanwhile , sir , there is a bottle of Burgundy and some cold pheasant , which he hopes you will not refuse , as it is some hours before supper . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1195"><said who="#Syme">“ Cold pheasant is a good thing , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>reflectively ,<said who="#Syme">“ and Burgundy is a spanking good thing . But really I do not want either of them so much as I want to know what the devil all this means , and what sort of costume you have got laid out for me . Where is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1196">The servant lifted off a kind of ottoman a long peacock-blue drapery , rather of the nature of a domino , on the front of which was emblazoned a large golden sun , and which was splashed here and there with flaming stars and crescents .</p>
    <p n="1197"><said who="#Syme">“ You 're to be dressed as Thursday , sir , ”</said>said the valet somewhat affably .</p>
    <p n="1198"><said who="#Syme">“ Dressed as Thursday ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>in meditation .<said who="#Syme">“ It does n't sound a warm costume . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1199"><said who="#Bull">“ Oh , yes , sir , ”</said>said the other eagerly ,<said who="#Bull">“ the Thursday costume is quite warm , sir . It fastens up to the chin . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1200"><said who="#Syme">“ Well , I do n't understand anything , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, sighing .<said who="#Syme">“ I have been used so long to uncomfortable adventures that comfortable adventures knock me out . Still , I may be allowed to ask why I should be particularly like Thursday in a green frock spotted all over with the sun and moon . Those orbs , I think , shine on other days . I once saw the moon on Tuesday , I remember . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1201"><said who="#Syme">“ Beg pardon , sir , ”</said>said the valet , “ Bible also provided for you , ” and with a respectful and rigid finger he pointed out a passage in the first chapter of Genesis .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>read it wondering . It was that in which the fourth day of the week is associated with the creation of the sun and moon . Here , however , they reckoned from a Christian Sunday .</p>
    <p n="1202"><said who="#Syme">“ This is getting wilder and wilder , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, as he sat down in a chair .<said who="#Syme">“ Who are these people who provide cold pheasant and Burgundy , and green clothes and Bibles ? Do they provide everything ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1203"><said who="#the_attendant">“ Yes , sir , everything , ”</said>said the attendant gravely .<said who="#the_attendant">“ Shall I help you on with your costume ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1204"><said who="#Syme">“ Oh , hitch the bally thing on ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>impatiently .</p>
    <p n="1205">But though he affected to despise the mummery , he felt a curious freedom and naturalness in his movements as the blue and gold garment fell about him ; and when he found that he had to wear a sword , it stirred a boyish dream . As he passed out of the room he flung the folds across his shoulder with a gesture , his sword stood out at an angle , and he had all the swagger of a troubadour . For these disguises did not disguise , but reveal .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="15">
    <p n="1206">AS<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>strode along the corridor he saw<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>standing at the top of a great flight of stairs . The man had never looked so noble . He was draped in a long robe of starless black , down the centre of which fell a band or broad stripe of pure white , like a single shaft of light . The whole looked like some very severe ecclesiastical vestment . There was no need for<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>to search his memory or the Bible in order to remember that the first day of creation marked the mere creation of light out of darkness . The vestment itself would alone have suggested the symbol ; and<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>felt also how perfectly this pattern of pure white and black expressed the soul of the pale and austere Secretary , with his inhuman veracity and his cold frenzy , which made him so easily make war on the anarchists , and yet so easily pass for one of them .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was scarcely surprised to notice that , amid all the ease and hospitality of their new surroundings , this man 's eyes were still stern . No smell of ale or orchards could make<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>cease to ask a reasonable question .</p>
    <p n="1207">If<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>had been able to see himself , he would have realised that he , too , seemed to be for the first time himself and no one else . For if<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>stood for that philosopher who loves the original and formless light ,<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was a type of the poet who seeks always to make the light in special shapes , to split it up into sun and star . The philosopher may sometimes love the infinite ; the poet always loves the finite . For him the great moment is not the creation of light , but the creation of the sun and moon .</p>
    <p n="1208">As they descended the broad stairs together they overtook<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>, who was clad in spring green like a huntsman , and the pattern upon whose garment was a green tangle of trees . For he stood for that third day on which the earth and green things were made , and his square , sensible face , with its not unfriendly cynicism , seemed appropriate enough to it .</p>
    <p n="1209">They were led out of another broad and low gateway into a very large old English garden , full of torches and bonfires , by the broken light of which a vast carnival of people were dancing in motley dress .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>seemed to see every shape in<persName>Nature</persName>imitated in some crazy costume . There was a man dressed as a windmill with enormous sails , a man dressed as an elephant , a man dressed as a balloon ; the two last , together , seemed to keep the thread of their farcical adventures .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>even saw , with a queer thrill , one dancer dressed like an enormous hornbill , with a beak twice as big as himself — the queer bird which had fixed itself on his fancy like a living question while he was rushing down the long road at the Zoological Gardens . There were a thousand other such objects , however . There was a dancing lamp-post , a dancing apple tree , a dancing ship . One would have thought that the untamable tune of some mad musician had set all the common objects of field and street dancing an eternal jig . And long afterwards , when<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was middle-aged and at rest , he could never see one of those particular objects — a lamppost , or an apple tree , or a windmill — without thinking that it was a strayed reveller from that revel of masquerade .</p>
    <p n="1210">On one side of this lawn , alive with dancers , was a sort of green bank , like the terrace in such old-fashioned gardens .</p>
    <p n="1211">Along this , in a kind of crescent , stood seven great chairs , the thrones of the seven days .<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>and<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>were already in their seats ;<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>was just mounting to his .<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>, or Tuesday , had his simplicity well symbolised by a dress designed upon the division of the waters , a dress that separated upon his forehead and fell to his feet , grey and silver , like a sheet of rain .<persName corresp="#the_Professor">The Professor</persName>, whose day was that on which the birds and fishes — the ruder forms of life — were created , had a dress of dim purple , over which sprawled goggle-eyed fishes and outrageous tropical birds , the union in him of unfathomable fancy and of doubt .<persName corresp="#Dr._Bull">Dr. Bull</persName>, the last day of Creation , wore a coat covered with heraldic animals in red and gold , and on his crest a man rampant . He lay back in his chair with a broad smile , the picture of an optimist in his element .</p>
    <p n="1212">One by one the wanderers ascended the bank and sat in their strange seats . As each of them sat down a roar of enthusiasm rose from the carnival , such as that with which crowds receive kings . Cups were clashed and torches shaken , and feathered hats flung in the air . The men for whom these thrones were reserved were men crowned with some extraordinary laurels . But the central chair was empty .</p>
    <p n="1213"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>was on the left hand of it and<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">the Secretary</persName>on the right .<persName corresp="#the_Secretary">The Secretary</persName>looked across the empty throne at<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, and said , compressing his lips —</p>
    <p n="1214"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ We do not know yet that he is not dead in a field . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1215">Almost as<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>heard the words , he saw on the sea of human faces in front of him a frightful and beautiful alteration , as if heaven had opened behind his head . But Sunday had only passed silently along the front like a shadow , and had sat in the central seat . He was draped plainly , in a pure and terrible white , and his hair was like a silver flame on his forehead .</p>
    <p n="1216">For a long time — it seemed for hours — that huge masquerade of mankind swayed and stamped in front of them to marching and exultant music . Every couple dancing seemed a separate romance ; it might be a fairy dancing with a pillar-box , or a peasant girl dancing with the moon ; but in each case it was , somehow , as absurd as Alice in Wonderland , yet as grave and kind as a love story . At last , however , the thick crowd began to thin itself . Couples strolled away into the garden-walks , or began to drift towards that end of the building where stood smoking , in huge pots like fish-kettles , some hot and scented mixtures of old ale or wine . Above all these , upon a sort of black framework on the roof of the house , roared in its iron basket a gigantic bonfire , which lit up the land for miles . It flung the homely effect of firelight over the face of vast forests of grey or brown , and it seemed to fill with warmth even the emptiness of upper night . Yet this also , after a time , was allowed to grow fainter ; the dim groups gathered more and more round the great cauldrons , or passed , laughing and clattering , into the inner passages of that ancient house . Soon there were only some ten loiterers in the garden ; soon only four . Finally the last stray merry-maker ran into the house whooping to his companions . The fire faded , and the slow , strong stars came out . And the seven strange men were left alone , like seven stone statues on their chairs of stone . Not one of them had spoken a word .</p>
    <p n="1217">They seemed in no haste to do so , but heard in silence the hum of insects and the distant song of one bird . Then Sunday spoke , but so dreamily that he might have been continuing a conversation rather than beginning one .</p>
    <p n="1218"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ We will eat and drink later , ”</said>he said .<said who="#the_Secretary">“ Let us remain together a little , we who have loved each other so sadly , and have fought so long . I seem to remember only centuries of heroic war , in which you were always heroes — epic on epic , iliad on iliad , and you always brothers in arms . Whether it was but recently ( for time is nothing ) , or at the beginning of the world , I sent you out to war . I sat in the darkness , where there is not any created thing , and to you I was only a voice commanding valour and an unnatural virtue . You heard the voice in the dark , and you never heard it again . The sun in heaven denied it , the earth and sky denied it , all human wisdom denied it . And when I met you in the daylight I denied it myself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1219"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>stirred sharply in his seat , but otherwise there was silence , and the incomprehensible went on .</p>
    <p n="1220"><said who="#Syme">“ But you were men . You did not forget your secret honour , though the whole cosmos turned an engine of torture to tear it out of you . I knew how near you were to hell . I know how you , Thursday , crossed swords with King Satan , and how you , Wednesday , named me in the hour without hope . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1221">There was complete silence in the starlit garden , and then the black-browed Secretary , implacable , turned in his chair towards Sunday , and said in a harsh voice —</p>
    <p n="1222"><said who="#Syme">“ Who and what are you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1223"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ I am the Sabbath , ”</said>said the other without moving .<said who="#the_Secretary">“ I am the peace of God . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1224"><persName corresp="#the_Secretary">The Secretary</persName>started up , and stood crushing his costly robe in his hand .</p>
    <p n="1225"><said who="#the_Secretary">“ I know what you mean , ”</said>he cried ,<said who="#the_Secretary">“ and it is exactly that that I cannot forgive you . I know you are contentment , optimism , what do they call the thing , an ultimate reconciliation . Well , I am not reconciled . If you were the man in the dark room , why were you also Sunday , an offense to the sunlight ? If you were from the first our father and our friend , why were you also our greatest enemy ? We wept , we fled in terror ; the iron entered into our souls — and you are the peace of God ! Oh , I can forgive God His anger , though it destroyed nations ; but I cannot forgive Him His peace . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1226">Sunday answered not a word , but very slowly he turned his face of stone upon<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>as if asking a question .</p>
    <p n="1227"><said who="#Syme">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>,<said who="#Syme">“ I do not feel fierce like that . I am grateful to you , not only for wine and hospitality here , but for many a fine scamper and free fight . But I should like to know . My soul and heart are as happy and quiet here as this old garden , but my reason is still crying out . I should like to know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1228">Sunday looked at<persName corresp="#Ratcliffe">Ratcliffe</persName>, whose clear voice said —</p>
    <p n="1229"><said who="#Syme">“ It seems so silly that you should have been on both sides and fought yourself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1230"><persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>said —</p>
    <p n="1231"><said who="#Bull">“ I understand nothing , but I am happy . In fact , I am going to sleep . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1232"><said who="#the_Professor">“ I am not happy , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Professor">the Professor</persName>with his head in his hands ,<said who="#the_Professor">“ because I do not understand . You let me stray a little too near to hell . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1233">And then<persName corresp="#Gogol">Gogol</persName>said , with the absolute simplicity of a child —</p>
    <p n="1234"><said who="#Gogol">“ I wish I knew why I was hurt so much . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1235">Still Sunday said nothing , but only sat with his mighty chin upon his hand , and gazed at the distance . Then at last he said —</p>
    <p n="1236"><said who="#Gogol">“ I have heard your complaints in order . And here , I think , comes another to complain , and we will hear him also . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1237">The falling fire in the great cresset threw a last long gleam , like a bar of burning gold , across the dim grass . Against this fiery band was outlined in utter black the advancing legs of a black-clad figure . He seemed to have a fine close suit with knee-breeches such as that which was worn by the servants of the house , only that it was not blue , but of this absolute sable . He had , like the servants , a kind of sword by his side . It was only when he had come quite close to the crescent of the seven and flung up his face to look at them , that<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>saw , with thunder-struck clearness , that the face was the broad , almost ape-like face of his old friend<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, with its rank red hair and its insulting smile .</p>
    <p n="1238"><said who="#Syme">“<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>! ”</said>gasped<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, half-rising from his seat .<said who="#Syme">“ Why , this is the real anarchist ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1239"><said who="#Gregory">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, with a great and dangerous restraint ,<said who="#Gregory">“ I am the real anarchist . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1240"><said who="#Bull">“ ‘ Now there was a day , ’ ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Bull">Bull</persName>, who seemed really to have fallen asleep ,<said who="#Bull">“ ‘ when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="1241"><said who="#Gregory">“ You are right , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, and gazed all round .<said who="#Gregory">“ I am a destroyer . I would destroy the world if I could . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1242">A sense of a pathos far under the earth stirred up in<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>, and he spoke brokenly and without sequence .</p>
    <p n="1243"><said who="#Gregory">“ Oh , most unhappy man , ”</said>he cried ,<said who="#Gregory">“ try to be happy ! You have red hair like your sister . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1244"><said who="#Gregory">“ My red hair , like red flames , shall burn up the world , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>.<said who="#Gregory">“ I thought I hated everything more than common men can hate anything ; but I find that I do not hate everything so much as I hate you ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1245"><said who="#Syme">“ I never hated you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>very sadly .</p>
    <p n="1246">Then out of this unintelligible creature the last thunders broke .</p>
    <p n="1247"><said who="#Syme">“ You ! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Syme">“ You never hated because you never lived . I know what you are all of you , from first to last — you are the people in power ! You are the police — the great fat , smiling men in blue and buttons ! You are the Law , and you have never been broken . But is there a free soul alive that does not long to break you , only because you have never been broken ? We in revolt talk all kind of nonsense doubtless about this crime or that crime of the Government . It is all folly ! The only crime of the Government is that it governs . The unpardonable sin of the supreme power is that it is supreme . I do not curse you for being cruel . I do not curse you ( though I might ) for being kind . I curse you for being safe ! You sit in your chairs of stone , and have never come down from them . You are the seven angels of heaven , and you have had no troubles . Oh , I could forgive you everything , you that rule all mankind , if I could feel for once that you had suffered for one hour a real agony such as I — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1248"><persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>sprang to his feet , shaking from head to foot .</p>
    <p n="1249"><said who="#Gregory">“ I see everything , ”</said>he cried ,<said who="#Gregory">“ everything that there is . Why does each thing on the earth war against each other thing ? Why does each small thing in the world have to fight against the world itself ? Why does a fly have to fight the whole universe ? Why does a dandelion have to fight the whole universe ? For the same reason that I had to be alone in the dreadful Council of the Days . So that each thing that obeys law may have the glory and isolation of the anarchist . So that each man fighting for order may be as brave and good a man as the dynamiter . So that the real lie of Satan may be flung back in the face of this blasphemer , so that by tears and torture we may earn the right to say to this man , ‘ You lie ! ’ No agonies can be too great to buy the right to say to this accuser , ‘ We also have suffered . ’</said></p>
    <p n="1250"><said who="#Syme">“ It is not true that we have never been broken . We have been broken upon the wheel . It is not true that we have never descended from these thrones . We have descended into hell . We were complaining of unforgettable miseries even at the very moment when this man entered insolently to accuse us of happiness . I repel the slander ; we have not been happy . I can answer for every one of the great guards of Law whom he has accused . At least — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1251">He had turned his eyes so as to see suddenly the great face of Sunday , which wore a strange smile .</p>
    <p n="1252"><said who="#Gregory">“ Have you , ”</said>he cried in a dreadful voice ,<said who="#Gregory">“ have you ever suffered ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1253">As he gazed , the great face grew to an awful size , grew larger than the colossal mask of Memnon , which had made him scream as a child . It grew larger and larger , filling the whole sky ; then everything went black . Only in the blackness before it entirely destroyed his brain he seemed to hear a distant voice saying a commonplace text that he had heard somewhere ,<said who="#Syme">“ Can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1254">When men in books awake from a vision , they commonly find themselves in some place in which they might have fallen asleep ; they yawn in a chair , or lift themselves with bruised limbs from a field .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>'s experience was something much more psychologically strange if there was indeed anything unreal , in the earthly sense , about the things he had gone through . For while he could always remember afterwards that he had swooned before the face of Sunday , he could not remember having ever come to at all . He could only remember that gradually and naturally he knew that he was and had been walking along a country lane with an easy and conversational companion . That companion had been a part of his recent drama ; it was the red-haired poet<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>. They were walking like old friends , and were in the middle of a conversation about some triviality . But<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>could only feel an unnatural buoyancy in his body and a crystal simplicity in his mind that seemed to be superior to everything that he said or did . He felt he was in possession of some impossible good news , which made every other thing a triviality , but an adorable triviality .</p>
    <p n="1255">Dawn was breaking over everything in colours at once clear and timid ; as if<persName>Nature</persName>made a first attempt at yellow and a first attempt at rose . A breeze blew so clean and sweet , that one could not think that it blew from the sky ; it blew rather through some hole in the sky .<persName corresp="#Syme">Syme</persName>felt a simple surprise when he saw rising all round him on both sides of the road the red , irregular buildings of Saffron Park . He had no idea that he had walked so near London . He walked by instinct along one white road , on which early birds hopped and sang , and found himself outside a fenced garden . There he saw the sister of<persName corresp="#Gregory">Gregory</persName>, the girl with the gold-red hair , cutting lilac before breakfast , with the great unconscious gravity of a girl .</p>
