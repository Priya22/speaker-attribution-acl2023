     <p n="14"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ The Signora had no business to do it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ no business at all . She promised us south rooms with a view close together , instead of which here are north rooms , looking into a courtyard , and a long way apart . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="15"><said who="#Lucy">“ And a Cockney , besides ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, who had been further saddened by the Signora 's unexpected accent .<said who="#Lucy">“ It might be London . ”</said>She looked at the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table ; at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people ; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people , heavily framed ; at the notice of the English church ( Rev . Cuthbert Eager , M. A . Oxon . ) , that was the only other decoration of the wall .<said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, do n't you feel , too , that we might be in London ? I can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside . I suppose it is one 's being so tired . ”</said></p>
     <p n="16"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ This meat has surely been used for soup , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, laying down her fork .</p>
     <p n="17"><said who="#Lucy">“ I want so to see<persName corresp="#the_Arno">the Arno</persName>. The rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over<persName corresp="#the_Arno">the Arno</persName>. The Signora had no business to do it at all . Oh , it is a shame ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="18"><said who="#Lucy">“ Any nook does for me , ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>continued ;<said who="#Lucy">“ but it does seem hard that you should n't have a view . ”</said></p>
     <p n="19"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>felt that she had been selfish .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, you must n't spoil me : of course , you must look over<persName corresp="#the_Arno">the Arno</persName>, too . I meant that . The first vacant room in the front — ”</said>“ You must have it , ” said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, part of whose travelling expenses were paid by<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s mother — a piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion .</p>
     <p n="20"><said who="#Charlotte">“ No , no . You must have it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="21"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I insist on it . Your mother would never forgive me ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="22"><said who="#Lucy">“ She would never forgive me . ”</said></p>
     <p n="23">The ladies ’ voices grew animated , and — if the sad truth be owned — a little peevish . They were tired , and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled . Some of their neighbours interchanged glances , and one of them — one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad — leant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument . He said :</p>
     <p n="24"><said who="#Lucy">“ I have a view , I have a view . ”</said></p>
     <p n="25"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>was startled . Generally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking , and often did not find out that they would “ do ” till they had gone . She knew that the intruder was ill-bred , even before she glanced at him . He was an old man , of heavy build , with a fair , shaven face and large eyes . There was something childish in those eyes , though it was not the childishness of senility . What exactly it was<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>did not stop to consider , for her glance passed on to his clothes . These did not attract her . He was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim . So she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her , and then said :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ A view ? Oh , a view ! How delightful a view is ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="26"><said who="#Lucy">“ This is my son , ”</said>said the old man ;<said who="#Lucy">“ his name 's<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>. He has a view too . ”</said></p>
     <p n="27"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Ah , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, repressing<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, who was about to speak .</p>
     <p n="28"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ What I mean , ”</said>he continued ,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ is that you can have our rooms , and we 'll have yours . We 'll change . ”</said></p>
     <p n="29">The better class of tourist was shocked at this , and sympathized with the new-comers .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, in reply , opened her mouth as little as possible , and said “ Thank you very much indeed ; that is out of the question . ”</p>
     <p n="30"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Why ? ”</said>said the old man , with both fists on the table .</p>
     <p n="31"><said who="#Lucy">“ Because it is quite out of the question , thank you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="32"><said who="#Lucy">“ You see , we do n't like to take — ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. Her cousin again repressed her .</p>
     <p n="33"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ But why ? ”</said>he persisted .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Women like looking at a view ; men do n't . ”</said>And he thumped with his fists like a naughty child , and turned to his son , saying ,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, persuade them ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="34"><said who="#the_son">“ It 's so obvious they should have the rooms , ”</said>said the son .<said who="#the_son">“ There 's nothing else to say . ”</said></p>
     <p n="35">He did not look at the ladies as he spoke , but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, too , was perplexed ; but she saw that they were in for what is known as “ quite a scene , ” and she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt , not with rooms and views , but with — well , with something quite different , whose existence she had not realized before . Now the old man attacked<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>almost violently : Why should she not change ? What possible objection had she ? They would clear out in half an hour .</p>
     <p n="36"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, though skilled in the delicacies of conversation , was powerless in the presence of brutality . It was impossible to snub any one so gross . Her face reddened with displeasure . She looked around as much as to say ,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Are you all like this ? ”</said>And two little old ladies , who were sitting further up the table , with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs , looked back , clearly indicating “ We are not ; we are genteel . ”</p>
     <p n="37"><said who="#Lucy">“ Eat your dinner , dear , ”</said>she said to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured .</p>
     <p n="38"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite .</p>
     <p n="39"><said who="#Lucy">“ Eat your dinner , dear . This pension is a failure . To-morrow we will make a change . ”</said></p>
     <p n="40">Hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it . The curtains at the end of the room parted , and revealed a clergyman , stout but attractive , who hurried forward to take his place at the table , cheerfully apologizing for his lateness .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, who had not yet acquired decency , at once rose to her feet , exclaiming :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Oh , oh ! Why , it 's<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>! Oh , how perfectly lovely ! Oh ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, we must stop now , however bad the rooms are . Oh ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="41"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>said , with more restraint :</p>
     <p n="42"><said>“ How do you do ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>? I expect that you have forgotten us :<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>and<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter 's that very cold Easter . ”</said></p>
     <p n="43">The clergyman , who had the air of one on a holiday , did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him . But he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="44"><said who="#Lucy">“ I AM so glad to see you , ”</said>said the girl , who was in a state of spiritual starvation , and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it .<said who="#Lucy">“ Just fancy how small the world is . Summer Street , too , makes it so specially funny . ”</said></p>
     <p n="45"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>lives in the parish of Summer Street , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, filling up the gap ,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living — ”</said></p>
     <p n="46"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yes , I heard from mother so last week . She did n't know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells ; but I wrote back at once , and I said : ‘<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>is — ’ ”</said></p>
     <p n="47"><said who="#the_clergyman">“ Quite right , ”</said>said the clergyman .<said who="#the_clergyman">“ I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June . I am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood . ”</said></p>
     <p n="48"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Oh , how glad I am ! The name of our house is Windy Corner . ”</said><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>bowed .</p>
     <p n="49"><said who="#the_clergyman">“ There is mother and me generally , and my brother , though it 's not often we get him to ch —— The church is rather far off , I mean . ”</said></p>
     <p n="50"><said>“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, dearest , let<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>eat his dinner . ”</said></p>
     <p n="51"><said who="#Lucy">“ I am eating it , thank you , and enjoying it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="52">He preferred to talk to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, whose playing he remembered , rather than to<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, who probably remembered his sermons . He asked the girl whether she knew Florence well , and was informed at some length that she had never been there before . It is delightful to advise a newcomer , and he was first in the field .<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Do n't neglect the country round , ”</said>his advice concluded .<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole , and round by Settignano , or something of that sort . ”</said></p>
     <p n="53"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ No ! ”</said>cried a voice from the top of the table .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, you are wrong . The first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato . ”</said></p>
     <p n="54"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ That lady looks so clever , ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>to her cousin .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ We are in luck . ”</said></p>
     <p n="55">And , indeed , a perfect torrent of information burst on them . People told them what to see , when to see it , how to stop the electric trams , how to get rid of the beggars , how much to give for a vellum blotter , how much the place would grow upon them . The Pension Bertolini had decided , almost enthusiastically , that they would do . Whichever way they looked , kind ladies smiled and shouted at them . And above all rose the voice of the clever lady , crying :<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Prato ! They must go to Prato . That place is too sweetly squalid for words . I love it ; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability , as you know . ”</said></p>
     <p n="56">The young man named<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>glanced at the clever lady , and then returned moodily to his plate . Obviously he and his father did not do .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, in the midst of her success , found time to wish they did . It gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold ; and when she rose to go , she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow .</p>
     <p n="57">The father did not see it ; the son acknowledged it , not by another bow , but by raising his eyebrows and smiling ; he seemed to be smiling across something .</p>
     <p n="58">She hastened after her cousin , who had already disappeared through the curtains — curtains which smote one in the face , and seemed heavy with more than cloth . Beyond them stood the unreliable Signora , bowing good-evening to her guests , and supported by ‘ Enery , her little boy , and Victorier , her daughter . It made a curious little scene , this attempt of the Cockney to convey the grace and geniality of the South . And even more curious was the drawing-room , which attempted to rival the solid comfort of a Bloomsbury boarding-house . Was this really Italy ?</p>
     <p n="59"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>was already seated on a tightly stuffed arm-chair , which had the colour and the contours of a tomato . She was talking to<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, and as she spoke , her long narrow head drove backwards and forwards , slowly , regularly , as though she were demolishing some invisible obstacle .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ We are most grateful to you , ”</said>she was saying .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ The first evening means so much . When you arrived we were in for a peculiarly mauvais quart d'heure . ”</said></p>
     <p n="60">He expressed his regret .</p>
     <p n="61"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Do you , by any chance , know the name of an old man who sat opposite us at dinner ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="62"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="63"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Is he a friend of yours ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="64"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ We are friendly — as one is in pensions . ”</said></p>
     <p n="65"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Then I will say no more . ”</said></p>
     <p n="66">He pressed her very slightly , and she said more .</p>
     <p n="67"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I am , as it were , ”</said>she concluded ,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ the chaperon of my young cousin ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, and it would be a serious thing if I put her under an obligation to people of whom we know nothing . His manner was somewhat unfortunate . I hope I acted for the best . ”</said></p>
     <p n="68"><said who="#Lucy">“ You acted very naturally , ”</said>said he . He seemed thoughtful , and after a few moments added :<said who="#Lucy">“ All the same , I do n't think much harm would have come of accepting . ”</said></p>
     <p n="69"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ No harm , of course . But we could not be under an obligation . ”</said></p>
     <p n="70"><said who="#Lucy">“ He is rather a peculiar man . ”</said>Again he hesitated , and then said gently :<said who="#Lucy">“ I think he would not take advantage of your acceptance , nor expect you to show gratitude . He has the merit — if it is one — of saying exactly what he means . He has rooms he does not value , and he thinks you would value them . He no more thought of putting you under an obligation than he thought of being polite . It is so difficult — at least , I find it difficult — to understand people who speak the truth . ”</said></p>
     <p n="71"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was pleased , and said :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I was hoping that he was nice ; I do so always hope that people will be nice . ”</said></p>
     <p n="72"><said who="#Lucy">“ I think he is ; nice and tiresome . I differ from him on almost every point of any importance , and so , I expect — I may say I hope — you will differ . But his is a type one disagrees with rather than deplores . When he first came here he not unnaturally put people 's backs up . He has no tact and no manners — I do n't mean by that that he has bad manners — and he will not keep his opinions to himself . We nearly complained about him to our depressing Signora , but I am glad to say we thought better of it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="73"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Am I to conclude , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ that he is a Socialist ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="74"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>accepted the convenient word , not without a slight twitching of the lips .</p>
     <p n="75"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ And presumably he has brought up his son to be a Socialist , too ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="76"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I hardly know<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, for he has n't learnt to talk yet . He seems a nice creature , and I think he has brains . Of course , he has all his father 's mannerisms , and it is quite possible that he , too , may be a Socialist . ”</said></p>
     <p n="77"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Oh , you relieve me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ So you think I ought to have accepted their offer ? You feel I have been narrow-minded and suspicious ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="78"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Not at all , ”</said>he answered ;<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I never suggested that . ”</said></p>
     <p n="79"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ But ought I not to apologize , at all events , for my apparent rudeness ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="80">He replied , with some irritation , that it would be quite unnecessary , and got up from his seat to go to the smoking-room .</p>
     <p n="81"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Was I a bore ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, as soon as he had disappeared .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Why did n't you talk ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>? He prefers young people , I 'm sure . I do hope I have n't monopolized him . I hoped you would have him all the evening , as well as all dinner-time . ”</said></p>
     <p n="82"><said who="#Lucy">“ He is nice , ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.<said who="#Lucy">“ Just what I remember . He seems to see good in every one . No one would take him for a clergyman . ”</said></p>
     <p n="83"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Lucia">Lucia</persName>— ”</said></p>
     <p n="84"><said who="#Lucy">“ Well , you know what I mean . And you know how clergymen generally laugh ;<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>laughs just like an ordinary man . ”</said></p>
     <p n="85"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Funny girl ! How you do remind me of your mother . I wonder if she will approve of<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="86"><said who="#Lucy">“ I 'm sure she will ; and so will<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="87"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I think every one at Windy Corner will approve ; it is the fashionable world . I am used to Tunbridge Wells , where we are all hopelessly behind the times . ”</said></p>
     <p n="88"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>despondently .</p>
     <p n="89">There was a haze of disapproval in the air , but whether the disapproval was of herself , or of<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, or of the fashionable world at Windy Corner , or of the narrow world at Tunbridge Wells , she could not determine . She tried to locate it , but as usual she blundered .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>sedulously denied disapproving of any one , and added “ I am afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion . ”</p>
     <p n="90">And the girl again thought :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I must have been selfish or unkind ; I must be more careful . It is so dreadful for<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, being poor . ”</said></p>
     <p n="91">Fortunately one of the little old ladies , who for some time had been smiling very benignly , now approached and asked if she might be allowed to sit where<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>had sat . Permission granted , she began to chatter gently about Italy , the plunge it had been to come there , the gratifying success of the plunge , the improvement in her sister 's health , the necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night , and of thoroughly emptying the water-bottles in the morning . She handled her subjects agreeably , and they were , perhaps , more worthy of attention than the high discourse upon Guelfs and Ghibellines which was proceeding tempestuously at the other end of the room . It was a real catastrophe , not a mere episode , that evening of hers at Venice , when she had found in her bedroom something that is one worse than a flea , though one better than something else .</p>
     <p n="92"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ But here you are as safe as in England . Signora Bertolini is so English . ”</said></p>
     <p n="93"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yet our rooms smell , ”</said>said poor<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.<said who="#Lucy">“ We dread going to bed . ”</said></p>
     <p n="94"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Ah , then you look into the court . ”</said>She sighed .<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ If only<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>was more tactful ! We were so sorry for you at dinner . ”</said></p>
     <p n="95"><said who="#Lucy">“ I think he was meaning to be kind . ”</said></p>
     <p n="96"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Undoubtedly he was , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.</p>
     <p n="97"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature . Of course , I was holding back on my cousin 's account . ”</said></p>
     <p n="98"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Of course , ”</said>said the little old lady ; and they murmured that one could not be too careful with a young girl .</p>
     <p n="99"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>tried to look demure , but could not help feeling a great fool . No one was careful with her at home ; or , at all events , she had not noticed it .</p>
     <p n="100"><said who="#Lucy">“ About old<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>— I hardly know . No , he is not tactful ; yet , have you ever noticed that there are people who do things which are most indelicate , and yet at the same time — beautiful ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="101"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Beautiful ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, puzzled at the word .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Are not beauty and delicacy the same ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="102"><said who="#Lucy">“ So one would have thought , ”</said>said the other helplessly .<said who="#Lucy">“ But things are so difficult , I sometimes think . ”</said></p>
     <p n="103">She proceeded no further into things , for<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>reappeared , looking extremely pleasant .</p>
     <p n="104"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, ”</said>he cried ,<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ it 's all right about the rooms . I 'm so glad .<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>was talking about it in the smoking-room , and knowing what I did , I encouraged him to make the offer again . He has let me come and ask you . He would be so pleased . ”</said></p>
     <p n="105"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>to her cousin ,<said who="#Lucy">“ we must have the rooms now . The old man is just as nice and kind as he can be . ”</said></p>
     <p n="106"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>was silent .</p>
     <p n="107"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I fear , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, after a pause ,<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ that I have been officious . I must apologize for my interference . ”</said></p>
     <p n="108">Gravely displeased , he turned to go . Not till then did<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>reply :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ My own wishes , dearest<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, are unimportant in comparison with yours . It would be hard indeed if I stopped you doing as you liked at Florence , when I am only here through your kindness . If you wish me to turn these gentlemen out of their rooms , I will do it . Would you then ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, kindly tell<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>that I accept his kind offer , and then conduct him to me , in order that I may thank him personally ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="109">She raised her voice as she spoke ; it was heard all over the drawing-room , and silenced the Guelfs and the Ghibellines . The clergyman , inwardly cursing the female sex , bowed , and departed with her message .</p>
     <p n="110"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Remember ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, I alone am implicated in this . I do not wish the acceptance to come from you . Grant me that , at all events . ”</said></p>
     <p n="111"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>was back , saying rather nervously :</p>
     <p n="112"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>is engaged , but here is his son instead . ”</said></p>
     <p n="113">The young man gazed down on the three ladies , who felt seated on the floor , so low were their chairs .</p>
     <p n="114"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ My father , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ is in his bath , so you cannot thank him personally . But any message given by you to me will be given by me to him as soon as he comes out . ”</said></p>
     <p n="115"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>was unequal to the bath . All her barbed civilities came forth wrong end first . Young<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>scored a notable triumph to the delight of<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>and to the secret delight of<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="116"><said who="#Lucy">“ Poor young man ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, as soon as he had gone .</p>
     <p n="117"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ How angry he is with his father about the rooms ! It is all he can do to keep polite . ”</said></p>
     <p n="118"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ In half an hour or so your rooms will be ready , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>. Then looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins , he retired to his own rooms , to write up his philosophic diary .</p>
     <p n="119"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Oh , dear ! ”</said>breathed the little old lady , and shuddered as if all the winds of heaven had entered the apartment .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Gentlemen sometimes do not realize — ”</said>Her voice faded away , but<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>seemed to understand and a conversation developed , in which gentlemen who did not thoroughly realize played a principal part .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, not realizing either , was reduced to literature . Taking up Baedeker 's Handbook to Northern Italy , she committed to memory the most important dates of Florentine History . For she was determined to enjoy herself on the morrow . Thus the half-hour crept profitably away , and at last<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>rose with a sigh , and said :</p>
     <p n="120"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I think one might venture now . No ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, do not stir . I will superintend the move . ”</said></p>
     <p n="121"><said who="#Lucy">“ How you do do everything , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="122"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Naturally , dear . It is my affair . ”</said></p>
     <p n="123"><said who="#Lucy">“ But I would like to help you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="124"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ No , dear . ”</said></p>
     <p n="125"><persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>'s energy ! And her unselfishness ! She had been thus all her life , but really , on this Italian tour , she was surpassing herself . So<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>felt , or strove to feel . And yet — there was a rebellious spirit in her which wondered whether the acceptance might not have been less delicate and more beautiful . At all events , she entered her own room without any feeling of joy .</p>
     <p n="126"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I want to explain , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ why it is that I have taken the largest room . Naturally , of course , I should have given it to you ; but I happen to know that it belongs to the young man , and I was sure your mother would not like it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="127"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was bewildered .</p>
     <p n="128"><said who="#Lucy">“ If you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under an obligation to his father than to him . I am a woman of the world , in my small way , and I know where things lead to . However ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>is a guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this . ”</said></p>
     <p n="129"><said who="#Lucy">“ Mother would n't mind I 'm sure , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, but again had the sense of larger and unsuspected issues .</p>
     <p n="130"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>only sighed , and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as she wished her good-night . It gave<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>the sensation of a fog , and when she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean night air , thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the lights dancing in<persName corresp="#the_Arno">the Arno</persName>and the cypresses of San Miniato , and the foot-hills of the Apennines , black against the rising moon .</p>
     <p n="131"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, in her room , fastened the window-shutters and locked the door , and then made a tour of the apartment to see where the cupboards led , and whether there were any oubliettes or secret entrances . It was then that she saw , pinned up over the washstand , a sheet of paper on which was scrawled an enormous note of interrogation . Nothing more .</p>
     <p n="132"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ What does it mean ? ”</said>she thought , and she examined it carefully by the light of a candle . Meaningless at first , it gradually became menacing , obnoxious , portentous with evil . She was seized with an impulse to destroy it , but fortunately remembered that she had no right to do so , since it must be the property of young<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>. So she unpinned it carefully , and put it between two pieces of blotting-paper to keep it clean for him . Then she completed her inspection of the room , sighed heavily according to her habit , and went to bed .</p>

    <div type="chapter" n="2">
     <head type="chapter">Chapter II : In Santa Croce with No Baedeker</head>
     <p n="133">It was pleasant to wake up in Florence , to open the eyes upon a bright bare room , with a floor of red tiles which look clean though they are not ; with a painted ceiling whereon pink griffins and blue amorini sport in a forest of yellow violins and bassoons . It was pleasant , too , to fling wide the windows , pinching the fingers in unfamiliar fastenings , to lean out into sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite , and close below ,<persName corresp="#the_Arno">the Arno</persName>, gurgling against the embankment of the road .</p>
     <p n="134">Over the river men were at work with spades and sieves on the sandy foreshore , and on the river was a boat , also diligently employed for some mysterious end . An electric tram came rushing underneath the window . No one was inside it , except one tourist ; but its platforms were overflowing with Italians , who preferred to stand . Children tried to hang on behind , and the conductor , with no malice , spat in their faces to make them let go . Then soldiers appeared — good-looking , undersized men — wearing each a knapsack covered with mangy fur , and a great-coat which had been cut for some larger soldier . Beside them walked officers , looking foolish and fierce , and before them went little boys , turning somersaults in time with the band . The tramcar became entangled in their ranks , and moved on painfully , like a caterpillar in a swarm of ants . One of the little boys fell down , and some white bullocks came out of an archway . Indeed , if it had not been for the good advice of an old man who was selling button-hooks , the road might never have got clear .</p>
     <p n="135">Over such trivialities as these many a valuable hour may slip away , and the traveller who has gone to Italy to study the tactile values of<persName corresp="#Giotto">Giotto</persName>, or the corruption of the Papacy , may return remembering nothing but the blue sky and the men and women who live under it . So it was as well that<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>should tap and come in , and having commented on<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s leaving the door unlocked , and on her leaning out of the window before she was fully dressed , should urge her to hasten herself , or the best of the day would be gone . By the time<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was ready her cousin had done her breakfast , and was listening to the clever lady among the crumbs .</p>
     <p n="136">A conversation then ensued , on not unfamiliar lines .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>was , after all , a wee bit tired , and thought they had better spend the morning settling in ; unless<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>would at all like to go out ?<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>would rather like to go out , as it was her first day in Florence , but , of course , she could go alone .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>could not allow this . Of course she would accompany<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>everywhere . Oh , certainly not ;<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>would stop with her cousin . Oh , no ! that would never do . Oh , yes !</p>
     <p n="137">At this point the clever lady broke in .</p>
     <p n="138"><said who="#Lucy">“ If it is Mrs. Grundy who is troubling you , I do assure you that you can neglect the good person . Being English ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>will be perfectly safe . Italians understand . A dear friend of mine , Contessa Baroncelli , has two daughters , and when she cannot send a maid to school with them , she lets them go in sailor-hats instead . Every one takes them for English , you see , especially if their hair is strained tightly behind . ”</said></p>
     <p n="139"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>was unconvinced by the safety of Contessa Baroncelli 's daughters . She was determined to take<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>herself , her head not being so very bad . The clever lady then said that she was going to spend a long morning in Santa Croce , and if<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>would come too , she would be delighted .</p>
     <p n="140"><said who="#Lucy">“ I will take you by a dear dirty back way ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, and if you bring me luck , we shall have an adventure . ”</said></p>
     <p n="141"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>said that this was most kind , and at once opened the Baedeker , to see where Santa Croce was .</p>
     <p n="142"><said>“ Tut , tut ! Miss<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! I hope we shall soon emancipate you from Baedeker . He does but touch the surface of things . As to the true Italy — he does not even dream of it . The true Italy is only to be found by patient observation . ”</said></p>
     <p n="143">This sounded very interesting , and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>hurried over her breakfast , and started with her new friend in high spirits . Italy was coming at last . The Cockney Signora and her works had vanished like a bad dream .</p>
     <p n="144"><persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>— for that was the clever lady 's name — turned to the right along the sunny Lung ’ Arno . How delightfully warm ! But a wind down the side streets cut like a knife , did n't it ? Ponte alle Grazie — particularly interesting , mentioned by Dante . San Miniato — beautiful as well as interesting ; the crucifix that kissed a murderer —<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>would remember the story . The men on the river were fishing . ( Untrue ; but then , so is most information . ) Then<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>darted under the archway of the white bullocks , and she stopped , and she cried :</p>
     <p n="145"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ A smell ! a true Florentine smell ! Every city , let me teach you , has its own smell . ”</said></p>
     <p n="146"><said who="#Lucy">“ Is it a very nice smell ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, who had inherited from her mother a distaste to dirt .</p>
     <p n="147"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ One does n't come to Italy for niceness , ”</said>was the retort ;<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ one comes for life . Buon giorno ! Buon giorno ! ”</said>bowing right and left .<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Look at that adorable wine-cart ! How the driver stares at us , dear , simple soul ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="148">So<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>proceeded through the streets of the city of Florence , short , fidgety , and playful as a kitten , though without a kitten 's grace . It was a treat for the girl to be with any one so clever and so cheerful ; and a blue military cloak , such as an Italian officer wears , only increased the sense of festivity .</p>
     <p n="149"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Buon giorno ! Take the word of an old woman , Miss<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>: you will never repent of a little civility to your inferiors . That is the true democracy . Though I am a real Radical as well . There , now you 're shocked . ”</said></p>
     <p n="150"><said who="#Lucy">“ Indeed , I 'm not ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.<said who="#Lucy">“ We are Radicals , too , out and out . My father always voted for Mr. Gladstone , until he was so dreadful about Ireland . ”</said></p>
     <p n="151"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ I see , I see . And now you have gone over to the enemy . ”</said></p>
     <p n="152"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , please —! If my father was alive , I am sure he would vote Radical again now that Ireland is all right . And as it is , the glass over our front door was broken last election , and<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>is sure it was the Tories ; but mother says nonsense , a tramp . ”</said></p>
     <p n="153"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Shameful ! A manufacturing district , I suppose ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="154"><said who="#Lucy">“ No — in the Surrey hills . About five miles from Dorking , looking over the Weald . ”</said></p>
     <p n="155"><persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>seemed interested , and slackened her trot .</p>
     <p n="156"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ What a delightful part ; I know it so well . It is full of the very nicest people . Do you know<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry Otway</persName>— a Radical if ever there was ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="157"><said who="#Lucy">“ Very well indeed . ”</said></p>
     <p n="158"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ And old<persName corresp="#Mrs._Butterworth">Mrs. Butterworth</persName>the philanthropist ? ”</said><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Why , she rents a field of us ! How funny ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="159"><persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>looked at the narrow ribbon of sky , and murmured :<said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , you have property in Surrey ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="160"><said who="#Lucy">“ Hardly any , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, fearful of being thought a snob .<said who="#Lucy">“ Only thirty acres — just the garden , all downhill , and some fields . ”</said></p>
     <p n="161"><persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>was not disgusted , and said it was just the size of her aunt 's Suffolk estate . Italy receded . They tried to remember the last name of Lady Louisa some one , who had taken a house near Summer Street the other year , but she had not liked it , which was odd of her . And just as<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>had got the name , she broke off and exclaimed :</p>
     <p n="162"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Bless us ! Bless us and save us ! We 've lost the way . ”</said></p>
     <p n="163">Certainly they had seemed a long time in reaching Santa Croce , the tower of which had been plainly visible from the landing window . But<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>had said so much about knowing her Florence by heart , that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had followed her with no misgivings .</p>
     <p n="164"><said>“ Lost ! lost ! My dear Miss<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, during our political diatribes we have taken a wrong turning . How those horrid Conservatives would jeer at us ! What are we to do ? Two lone females in an unknown town . Now , this is what I call an adventure . ”</said></p>
     <p n="165"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, who wanted to see Santa Croce , suggested , as a possible solution , that they should ask the way there .</p>
     <p n="166"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , but that is the word of a craven ! And no , you are not , not , NOT to look at your Baedeker . Give it to me ; I sha n't let you carry it . We will simply drift . ”</said></p>
     <p n="167">Accordingly they drifted through a series of those grey-brown streets , neither commodious nor picturesque , in which the eastern quarter of the city abounds .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>soon lost interest in the discontent of Lady Louisa , and became discontented herself . For one ravishing moment Italy appeared . She stood in the Square of the Annunziata and saw in the living terra-cotta those divine babies whom no cheap reproduction can ever stale . There they stood , with their shining limbs bursting from the garments of charity , and their strong white arms extended against circlets of heaven .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>thought she had never seen anything more beautiful ; but<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, with a shriek of dismay , dragged her forward , declaring that they were out of their path now by at least a mile .</p>
     <p n="168">The hour was approaching at which the continental breakfast begins , or rather ceases , to tell , and the ladies bought some hot chestnut paste out of a little shop , because it looked so typical . It tasted partly of the paper in which it was wrapped , partly of hair oil , partly of the great unknown . But it gave them strength to drift into another Piazza , large and dusty , on the farther side of which rose a black-and-white facade of surpassing ugliness .<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>spoke to it dramatically . It was Santa Croce . The adventure was over .</p>
     <p n="169"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Stop a minute ; let those two people go on , or I shall have to speak to them . I do detest conventional intercourse . Nasty ! they are going into the church , too . Oh , the Britisher abroad ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="170"><said who="#Lucy">“ We sat opposite them at dinner last night . They have given us their rooms . They were so very kind . ”</said></p>
     <p n="171"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Look at their figures ! ”</said>laughed<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ They walk through my Italy like a pair of cows . It 's very naughty of me , but I would like to set an examination paper at Dover , and turn back every tourist who could n't pass it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="172"><said who="#Lucy">“ What would you ask us ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="173"><persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>laid her hand pleasantly on<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s arm , as if to suggest that she , at all events , would get full marks . In this exalted mood they reached the steps of the great church , and were about to enter it when<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>stopped , squeaked , flung up her arms , and cried :</p>
     <p n="174"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ There goes my local-colour box ! I must have a word with him ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="175">And in a moment she was away over the Piazza , her military cloak flapping in the wind ; nor did she slacken speed till she caught up an old man with white whiskers , and nipped him playfully upon the arm .</p>
     <p n="176"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>waited for nearly ten minutes . Then she began to get tired . The beggars worried her , the dust blew in her eyes , and she remembered that a young girl ought not to loiter in public places . She descended slowly into the Piazza with the intention of rejoining<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, who was really almost too original . But at that moment<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>and her local-colour box moved also , and disappeared down a side street , both gesticulating largely . Tears of indignation came to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s eyes partly because<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>had jilted her , partly because she had taken her Baedeker . How could she find her way home ? How could she find her way about in Santa Croce ? Her first morning was ruined , and she might never be in Florence again . A few minutes ago she had been all high spirits , talking as a woman of culture , and half persuading herself that she was full of originality . Now she entered the church depressed and humiliated , not even able to remember whether it was built by the Franciscans or the Dominicans . Of course , it must be a wonderful building . But how like a barn ! And how very cold ! Of course , it contained frescoes by<persName corresp="#Giotto">Giotto</persName>, in the presence of whose tactile values she was capable of feeling what was proper . But who was to tell her which they were ? She walked about disdainfully , unwilling to be enthusiastic over monuments of uncertain authorship or date . There was no one even to tell her which , of all the sepulchral slabs that paved the nave and transepts , was the one that was really beautiful , the one that had been most praised by Mr. Ruskin .</p>
     <p n="177">Then the pernicious charm of Italy worked on her , and , instead of acquiring information , she began to be happy . She puzzled out the Italian notices — the notices that forbade people to introduce dogs into the church — the notice that prayed people , in the interest of health and out of respect to the sacred edifice in which they found themselves , not to spit . She watched the tourists ; their noses were as red as their Baedekers , so cold was Santa Croce . She beheld the horrible fate that overtook three Papists — two he-babies and a she-baby — who began their career by sousing each other with the Holy Water , and then proceeded to the Machiavelli memorial , dripping but hallowed . Advancing towards it very slowly and from immense distances , they touched the stone with their fingers , with their handkerchiefs , with their heads , and then retreated . What could this mean ? They did it again and again . Then<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>realized that they had mistaken Machiavelli for some saint , hoping to acquire virtue . Punishment followed quickly . The smallest he-baby stumbled over one of the sepulchral slabs so much admired by Mr. Ruskin , and entangled his feet in the features of a recumbent bishop . Protestant as she was ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>darted forward . She was too late . He fell heavily upon the prelate 's upturned toes .</p>
     <p n="178"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Hateful bishop ! ”</said>exclaimed the voice of old<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, who had darted forward also .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Hard in life , hard in death . Go out into the sunshine , little boy , and kiss your hand to the sun , for that is where you ought to be . Intolerable bishop ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="179">The child screamed frantically at these words , and at these dreadful people who picked him up , dusted him , rubbed his bruises , and told him not to be superstitious .</p>
     <p n="180"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Look at him ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Here 's a mess : a baby hurt , cold , and frightened ! But what else can you expect from a church ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="181">The child 's legs had become as melting wax . Each time that old<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>set it erect it collapsed with a roar . Fortunately an Italian lady , who ought to have been saying her prayers , came to the rescue . By some mysterious virtue , which mothers alone possess , she stiffened the little boy 's back-bone and imparted strength to his knees . He stood . Still gibbering with agitation , he walked away .</p>
     <p n="182"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ You are a clever woman , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ You have done more than all the relics in the world . I am not of your creed , but I do believe in those who make their fellow-creatures happy . There is no scheme of the universe — ”</said></p>
     <p n="183">He paused for a phrase .</p>
     <p n="184"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Niente , ”</said>said the Italian lady , and returned to her prayers .</p>
     <p n="185"><said who="#Lucy">“ I 'm not sure she understands English , ”</said>suggested<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="186">In her chastened mood she no longer despised the Emersons . She was determined to be gracious to them , beautiful rather than delicate , and , if possible , to erase<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>'s civility by some gracious reference to the pleasant rooms .</p>
     <p n="187"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ That woman understands everything , ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>'s reply .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ But what are you doing here ? Are you doing the church ? Are you through with the church ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="188"><said who="#Lucy">“ No , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, remembering her grievance .<said who="#Lucy">“ I came here with<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, who was to explain everything ; and just by the door — it is too bad !— she simply ran away , and after waiting quite a time , I had to come in by myself . ”</said></p>
     <p n="189"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Why should n't you ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>.</p>
     <p n="190"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yes , why should n't you come by yourself ? ”</said>said the son , addressing the young lady for the first time .</p>
     <p n="191"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ But<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>has even taken away Baedeker . ”</said></p>
     <p n="192"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Baedeker ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I 'm glad it 's THAT you minded . It 's worth minding , the loss of a Baedeker . THAT 'S worth minding . ”</said></p>
     <p n="193"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was puzzled . She was again conscious of some new idea , and was not sure whither it would lead her .</p>
     <p n="194"><said who="#Lucy">“ If you 've no Baedeker , ”</said>said the son ,<said who="#Lucy">“ you 'd better join us . ”</said>Was this where the idea would lead ? She took refuge in her dignity .</p>
     <p n="195"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Thank you very much , but I could not think of that . I hope you do not suppose that I came to join on to you . I really came to help with the child , and to thank you for so kindly giving us your rooms last night . I hope that you have not been put to any great inconvenience . ”</said></p>
     <p n="196"><said who="#Lucy">“ My dear , ”</said>said the old man gently ,<said who="#Lucy">“ I think that you are repeating what you have heard older people say . You are pretending to be touchy ; but you are not really . Stop being so tiresome , and tell me instead what part of the church you want to see . To take you to it will be a real pleasure . ”</said></p>
     <p n="197">Now , this was abominably impertinent , and she ought to have been furious . But it is sometimes as difficult to lose one 's temper as it is difficult at other times to keep it .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>could not get cross .<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>was an old man , and surely a girl might humour him . On the other hand , his son was a young man , and she felt that a girl ought to be offended with him , or at all events be offended before him . It was at him that she gazed before replying .</p>
     <p n="198"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I am not touchy , I hope . It is the Giottos that I want to see , if you will kindly tell me which they are . ”</said></p>
     <p n="199">The son nodded . With a look of sombre satisfaction , he led the way to the Peruzzi Chapel . There was a hint of the teacher about him . She felt like a child in school who had answered a question rightly .</p>
     <p n="200">The chapel was already filled with an earnest congregation , and out of them rose the voice of a lecturer , directing them how to worship<persName corresp="#Giotto">Giotto</persName>, not by tactful valuations , but by the standards of the spirit .</p>
     <p n="201"><said who="#Giotto">“ Remember , ”</said>he was saying ,<said>“ the facts about this church of Santa Croce ; how it was built by faith in the full fervour of medievalism , before any taint of the Renaissance had appeared . Observe how<persName corresp="#Giotto">Giotto</persName>in these frescoes — now , unhappily , ruined by restoration — is untroubled by the snares of anatomy and perspective . Could anything be more majestic , more pathetic , beautiful , true ? How little , we feel , avails knowledge and technical cleverness against a man who truly feels ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="202"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ No ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, in much too loud a voice for church .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Remember nothing of the sort ! Built by faith indeed ! That simply means the workmen were n't paid properly . And as for the frescoes , I see no truth in them . Look at that fat man in blue ! He must weigh as much as I do , and he is shooting into the sky like an air balloon . ”</said></p>
     <p n="203">He was referring to the fresco of the “ Ascension of St. John . ” Inside , the lecturer 's voice faltered , as well it might . The audience shifted uneasily , and so did<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. She was sure that she ought not to be with these men ; but they had cast a spell over her . They were so serious and so strange that she could not remember how to behave .</p>
     <p n="204"><said who="#Lucy">“ Now , did this happen , or did n't it ? Yes or no ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="205"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>replied :</p>
     <p n="206"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ It happened like this , if it happened at all . I would rather go up to heaven by myself than be pushed by cherubs ; and if I got there I should like my friends to lean out of it , just as they do here . ”</said></p>
     <p n="207"><said who="#Lucy">“ You will never go up , ”</said>said his father .<said who="#Lucy">“ You and I , dear boy , will lie at peace in the earth that bore us , and our names will disappear as surely as our work survives . ”</said></p>
     <p n="208"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Some of the people can only see the empty grave , not the saint , whoever he is , going up . It did happen like that , if it happened at all . ”</said></p>
     <p n="209"><said who="#Lucy">“ Pardon me , ”</said>said a frigid voice .<said who="#Lucy">“ The chapel is somewhat small for two parties . We will incommode you no longer . ”</said></p>
     <p n="210">The lecturer was a clergyman , and his audience must be also his flock , for they held prayer-books as well as guide-books in their hands . They filed out of the chapel in silence . Amongst them were the two little old ladies of the Pension Bertolini — Miss Teresa and Miss Catherine<persName corresp="#Alan">Alan</persName>.</p>
     <p n="211"><said who="#Alan">“ Stop ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>.<said who="#Alan">“ There 's plenty of room for us all . Stop ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="212">The procession disappeared without a word .</p>
     <p n="213">Soon the lecturer could be heard in the next chapel , describing the life of St. Francis .</p>
     <p n="214"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, I do believe that clergyman is the Brixton curate . ”</said></p>
     <p n="215"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>went into the next chapel and returned , saying “ Perhaps he is . I do n't remember . ”</p>
     <p n="216"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Then I had better speak to him and remind him who I am . It 's that Mr . Eager . Why did he go ? Did we talk too loud ? How vexatious . I shall go and say we are sorry . Had n't I better ? Then perhaps he will come back . ”</said></p>
     <p n="217"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ He will not come back , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>.</p>
     <p n="218">But<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, contrite and unhappy , hurried away to apologize to the Rev . Cuthbert Eager .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, apparently absorbed in a lunette , could hear the lecture again interrupted , the anxious , aggressive voice of the old man , the curt , injured replies of his opponent . The son , who took every little contretemps as if it were a tragedy , was listening also .</p>
     <p n="219"><said who="#Lucy">“ My father has that effect on nearly every one , ”</said>he informed her .<said who="#Lucy">“ He will try to be kind . ”</said></p>
     <p n="220"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I hope we all try , ”</said>said she , smiling nervously .</p>
     <p n="221"><said who="#Lucy">“ Because we think it improves our characters . But he is kind to people because he loves them ; and they find him out , and are offended , or frightened . ”</said></p>
     <p n="222"><said who="#Lucy">“ How silly of them ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, though in her heart she sympathized ;<said who="#Lucy">“ I think that a kind action done tactfully — ”</said></p>
     <p n="223"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Tact ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="224">He threw up his head in disdain . Apparently she had given the wrong answer . She watched the singular creature pace up and down the chapel . For a young man his face was rugged , and — until the shadows fell upon it — hard . Enshadowed , it sprang into tenderness . She saw him once again at Rome , on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel , carrying a burden of acorns . Healthy and muscular , he yet gave her the feeling of greyness , of tragedy that might only find solution in the night . The feeling soon passed ; it was unlike her to have entertained anything so subtle . Born of silence and of unknown emotion , it passed when<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>returned , and she could re-enter the world of rapid talk , which was alone familiar to her .</p>
     <p n="225"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Were you snubbed ? ”</said>asked his son tranquilly .</p>
     <p n="226"><said who="#Lucy">“ But we have spoilt the pleasure of I do n't know how many people . They wo n't come back . ”</said></p>
     <p n="227">“ ... full of innate sympathy ... quickness to perceive good in others ... vision of the brotherhood of man ... ” Scraps of the lecture on St. Francis came floating round the partition wall .</p>
     <p n="228"><said who="#Lucy">“ Do n't let us spoil yours , ”</said>he continued to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.<said who="#Lucy">“ Have you looked at those saints ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="229"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.<said who="#Lucy">“ They are lovely . Do you know which is the tombstone that is praised in Ruskin ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="230">He did not know , and suggested that they should try to guess it .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, rather to her relief , refused to move , and she and the old man wandered not unpleasantly about Santa Croce , which , though it is like a barn , has harvested many beautiful things inside its walls . There were also beggars to avoid and guides to dodge round the pillars , and an old lady with her dog , and here and there a priest modestly edging to his Mass through the groups of tourists . But<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>was only half interested . He watched the lecturer , whose success he believed he had impaired , and then he anxiously watched his son .</p>
     <p n="231"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Why will he look at that fresco ? ”</said>he said uneasily .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I saw nothing in it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="232"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I like<persName corresp="#Giotto">Giotto</persName>, ”</said>she replied .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ It is so wonderful what they say about his tactile values . Though I like things like the Della Robbia babies better . ”</said></p>
     <p n="233"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ So you ought . A baby is worth a dozen saints . And my baby 's worth the whole of Paradise , and as far as I can see he lives in Hell . ”</said></p>
     <p n="234"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>again felt that this did not do .</p>
     <p n="235"><said who="#Lucy">“ In Hell , ”</said>he repeated .<said who="#Lucy">“ He 's unhappy . ”</said></p>
     <p n="236"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , dear ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="237"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ How can he be unhappy when he is strong and alive ? What more is one to give him ? And think how he has been brought up — free from all the superstition and ignorance that lead men to hate one another in the name of God . With such an education as that , I thought he was bound to grow up happy . ”</said></p>
     <p n="238">She was no theologian , but she felt that here was a very foolish old man , as well as a very irreligious one . She also felt that her mother might not like her talking to that kind of person , and that<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>would object most strongly .</p>
     <p n="239"><said who="#Charlotte">“ What are we to do with him ? ”</said>he asked .<said who="#Charlotte">“ He comes out for his holiday to Italy , and behaves — like that ; like the little child who ought to have been playing , and who hurt himself upon the tombstone . Eh ? What did you say ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="240"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had made no suggestion . Suddenly he said :</p>
     <p n="241"><said who="#Lucy">“ Now do n't be stupid over this . I do n't require you to fall in love with my boy , but I do think you might try and understand him . You are nearer his age , and if you let yourself go I am sure you are sensible . You might help me . He has known so few women , and you have the time . You stop here several weeks , I suppose ? But let yourself go . You are inclined to get muddled , if I may judge from last night . Let yourself go . Pull out from the depths those thoughts that you do not understand , and spread them out in the sunlight and know the meaning of them . By understanding<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>you may learn to understand yourself . It will be good for both of you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="242">To this extraordinary speech<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>found no answer .</p>
     <p n="243"><said who="#Lucy">“ I only know what it is that 's wrong with him ; not why it is . ”</said></p>
     <p n="244"><said who="#Lucy">“ And what is it ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>fearfully , expecting some harrowing tale .</p>
     <p n="245"><said who="#Charlotte">“ The old trouble ; things wo n't fit . ”</said></p>
     <p n="246"><said who="#Lucy">“ What things ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="247"><said who="#Charlotte">“ The things of the universe . It is quite true . They do n't . ”</said></p>
     <p n="248"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, whatever do you mean ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="249">In his ordinary voice , so that she scarcely realized he was quoting poetry , he said :</p>
     <p n="250"><said who="#Lucy">“ ‘ From far , from eve and morning , And yon twelve-winded sky , The stuff of life to knit me Blew hither : here am I ’</said></p>
     <p n="251"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>and I both know this , but why does it distress him ? We know that we come from the winds , and that we shall return to them ; that all life is perhaps a knot , a tangle , a blemish in the eternal smoothness . But why should this make us unhappy ? Let us rather love one another , and work and rejoice . I do n't believe in this world sorrow . ”</p>
     <p n="252"><persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>assented .</p>
     <p n="253"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ Then make my boy think like us . Make him realize that by the side of the everlasting Why there is a Yes — a transitory Yes if you like , but a Yes . ”</said></p>
     <p n="254">Suddenly she laughed ; surely one ought to laugh . A young man melancholy because the universe would n't fit , because life was a tangle or a wind , or a Yes , or something !</p>
     <p n="255"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ I 'm very sorry , ”</said>she cried .<said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ You 'll think me unfeeling , but — but — ”</said>Then she became matronly .<said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ Oh , but your son wants employment . Has he no particular hobby ? Why , I myself have worries , but I can generally forget them at the piano ; and collecting stamps did no end of good for my brother . Perhaps Italy bores him ; you ought to try the Alps or the Lakes . ”</said></p>
     <p n="256">The old man 's face saddened , and he touched her gently with his hand . This did not alarm her ; she thought that her advice had impressed him and that he was thanking her for it . Indeed , he no longer alarmed her at all ; she regarded him as a kind thing , but quite silly . Her feelings were as inflated spiritually as they had been an hour ago esthetically , before she lost Baedeker . The dear<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, now striding towards them over the tombstones , seemed both pitiable and absurd . He approached , his face in the shadow . He said :</p>

     <p n="260"><said who="#Lucy">“ I see . Those gossiping little Miss Alans must have — ”</said>She checked herself .</p>

I 'm thoroughly happy , and having a splendid time . Pray do n't waste time mourning over me . There 's enough sorrow in the world , is n't there , without trying to invent it . Good-bye .

     <head type="chapter">Chapter III : Music , Violets , and the Letter “ S ”</head>
     <p n="265">It so happened that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, who found daily life rather chaotic , entered a more solid world when she opened the piano . She was then no longer either deferential or patronizing ; no longer either a rebel or a slave . The kingdom of music is not the kingdom of this world ; it will accept those whom breeding and intellect and culture have alike rejected . The commonplace person begins to play , and shoots into the empyrean without effort , whilst we look up , marvelling how he has escaped us , and thinking how we could worship him and love him , would he but translate his visions into human words , and his experiences into human actions . Perhaps he cannot ; certainly he does not , or does so very seldom .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had done so never .</p>
     <p n="266">She was no dazzling executante ; her runs were not at all like strings of pearls , and she struck no more right notes than was suitable for one of her age and situation . Nor was she the passionate young lady , who performs so tragically on a summer 's evening with the window open . Passion was there , but it could not be easily labelled ; it slipped between love and hatred and jealousy , and all the furniture of the pictorial style . And she was tragical only in the sense that she was great , for she loved to play on the side of Victory . Victory of what and over what — that is more than the words of daily life can tell us . But that some sonatas of<persName corresp="#Beethoven">Beethoven</persName>are written tragic no one can gainsay ; yet they can triumph or despair as the player decides , and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had decided that they should triumph .</p>
     <p n="267">A very wet afternoon at the Bertolini permitted her to do the thing she really liked , and after lunch she opened the little draped piano . A few people lingered round and praised her playing , but finding that she made no reply , dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or to sleep . She took no notice of<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>looking for his son , nor of<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>looking for<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, nor of<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>looking for her cigarette-case . Like every true performer , she was intoxicated by the mere feel of the notes : they were fingers caressing her own ; and by touch , not by sound alone , did she come to her desire .</p>
     <p n="268"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, sitting unnoticed in the window , pondered this illogical element in<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, and recalled the occasion at Tunbridge Wells when he had discovered it . It was at one of those entertainments where the upper classes entertain the lower . The seats were filled with a respectful audience , and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish , under the auspices of their vicar , sang , or recited , or imitated the drawing of a champagne cork . Among the promised items was “<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>. Piano .<persName corresp="#Beethoven">Beethoven</persName>, ” and<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>was wondering whether it would be Adelaida , or the march of The Ruins of Athens , when his composure was disturbed by the opening bars of Opus III . He was in suspense all through the introduction , for not until the pace quickens does one know what the performer intends . With the roar of the opening theme he knew that things were going extraordinarily ; in the chords that herald the conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory . He was glad that she only played the first movement , for he could have paid no attention to the winding intricacies of the measures of nine-sixteen . The audience clapped , no less respectful . It was<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>who started the stamping ; it was all that one could do .</p>
     <p n="269"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Who is she ? ”</said>he asked the vicar afterwards .</p>
     <p n="270"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Cousin of one of my parishioners . I do not consider her choice of a piece happy .<persName corresp="#Beethoven">Beethoven</persName>is so usually simple and direct in his appeal that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that , which , if anything , disturbs . ”</said></p>
     <p n="271"><said who="#Beethoven">“ Introduce me . ”</said></p>
     <p n="272"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ She will be delighted . She and<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>are full of the praises of your sermon . ”</said></p>
     <p n="273"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ My sermon ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Why ever did she listen to it ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="274">When he was introduced he understood why , for<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, disjoined from her music stool , was only a young lady with a quantity of dark hair and a very pretty , pale , undeveloped face . She loved going to concerts , she loved stopping with her cousin , she loved iced coffee and meringues . He did not doubt that she loved his sermon also . But before he left Tunbridge Wells he made a remark to the vicar , which he now made to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily towards him :</p>
     <p n="275"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ If<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>ever takes to live as she plays , it will be very exciting both for us and for her . ”</said></p>
     <p n="276"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>at once re-entered daily life .</p>
     <p n="277"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , what a funny thing ! Some one said just the same to mother , and she said she trusted I should never live a duet . ”</said></p>
     <p n="278"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Does n't<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>like music ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="279"><said who="#Lucy">“ She does n't mind it . But she does n't like one to get excited over anything ; she thinks I am silly about it . She thinks — I can n't make out . Once , you know , I said that I liked my own playing better than any one 's . She has never got over it . Of course , I did n't mean that I played well ; I only meant — ”</said></p>
     <p n="280"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Of course , ”</said>said he , wondering why she bothered to explain .</p>
     <p n="281"><said who="#Lucy">“ Music — ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, as if attempting some generality . She could not complete it , and looked out absently upon Italy in the wet . The whole life of the South was disorganized , and the most graceful nation in Europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes .</p>
     <p n="282">The street and the river were dirty yellow , the bridge was dirty grey , and the hills were dirty purple . Somewhere in their folds were concealed<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>and<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, who had chosen this afternoon to visit the Torre del Gallo .</p>
     <p n="283"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ What about music ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>.</p>
     <p n="284"><said who="#Lucy">“ Poor<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>will be sopped , ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s reply .</p>
     <p n="285">The expedition was typical of<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, who would return cold , tired , hungry , and angelic , with a ruined skirt , a pulpy Baedeker , and a tickling cough in her throat . On another day , when the whole world was singing and the air ran into the mouth , like wine , she would refuse to stir from the drawing-room , saying that she was an old thing , and no fit companion for a hearty girl .</p>
     <p n="286"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>has led your cousin astray . She hopes to find the true Italy in the wet I believe . ”</said></p>
     <p n="287"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>is so original , ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. This was a stock remark , the supreme achievement of the Pension Bertolini in the way of definition .<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>was so original .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>had his doubts , but they would have been put down to clerical narrowness . For that , and for other reasons , he held his peace .</p>
     <p n="288"><said who="#Lucy">“ Is it true , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>in awe-struck tone ,<said who="#Lucy">“ that<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>is writing a book ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="289"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ They do say so . ”</said></p>
     <p n="290"><said who="#Lucy">“ What is it about ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="291"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ It will be a novel , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>,<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ dealing with modern Italy . Let me refer you for an account to Miss Catharine<persName corresp="#Alan">Alan</persName>, who uses words herself more admirably than any one I know . ”</said></p>
     <p n="292"><said who="#Lucy">“ I wish<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>would tell me herself . We started such friends . But I do n't think she ought to have run away with Baedeker that morning in Santa Croce .<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>was most annoyed at finding me practically alone , and so I could n't help being a little annoyed with<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="293"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ The two ladies , at all events , have made it up . ”</said></p>
     <p n="294">He was interested in the sudden friendship between women so apparently dissimilar as<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>and<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>. They were always in each other 's company , with<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>a slighted third .<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>he believed he understood , but<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>might reveal unknown depths of strangeness , though not perhaps , of meaning . Was Italy deflecting her from the path of prim chaperon , which he had assigned to her at Tunbridge Wells ? All his life he had loved to study maiden ladies ; they were his specialty , and his profession had provided him with ample opportunities for the work . Girls like<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>were charming to look at , but<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>was , from rather profound reasons , somewhat chilly in his attitude towards the other sex , and preferred to be interested rather than enthralled .</p>
     <p n="295"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, for the third time , said that poor<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>would be sopped .<persName corresp="#the_Arno">The Arno</persName>was rising in flood , washing away the traces of the little carts upon the foreshore . But in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze of yellow , which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse . She opened the window to inspect , and a cold blast entered the room , drawing a plaintive cry from Miss Catharine<persName corresp="#Alan">Alan</persName>, who entered at the same moment by the door .</p>
     <p n="296"><said who="#Alan">“ Oh , dear<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, you will catch a chill ! And<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>here besides . Who would suppose this is Italy ? There is my sister actually nursing the hot-water can ; no comforts or proper provisions . ”</said></p>
     <p n="297">She sidled towards them and sat down , self-conscious as she always was on entering a room which contained one man , or a man and one woman .</p>
     <p n="298"><said who="#Alan">“ I could hear your beautiful playing ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, though I was in my room with the door shut . Doors shut ; indeed , most necessary . No one has the least idea of privacy in this country . And one person catches it from another . ”</said></p>
     <p n="299"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>answered suitably .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>was not able to tell the ladies of his adventure at Modena , where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his bath , exclaiming cheerfully ,<said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ Fa niente , sono vecchia . ”</said>He contented himself with saying :<said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ I quite agree with you ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>. The Italians are a most unpleasant people . They pry everywhere , they see everything , and they know what we want before we know it ourselves . We are at their mercy . They read our thoughts , they foretell our desires . From the cab-driver down to — to<persName corresp="#Giotto">Giotto</persName>, they turn us inside out , and I resent it . Yet in their heart of hearts they are — how superficial ! They have no conception of the intellectual life . How right is Signora Bertolini , who exclaimed to me the other day : ‘ Ho ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, if you knew what I suffer over the children 's edjucaishion . HI wo n't ‘ ave my little Victorier taught by a hignorant Italian what can n't explain nothink ! ’ ”</said></p>
     <p n="300"><persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>did not follow , but gathered that she was being mocked in an agreeable way . Her sister was a little disappointed in<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, having expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who wore a pair of russet whiskers . Indeed , who would have supposed that tolerance , sympathy , and a sense of humour would inhabit that militant form ?</p>
     <p n="301">In the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle , and at last the cause was disclosed . From the chair beneath her she extracted a gun-metal cigarette-case , on which were powdered in turquoise the initials “ E. L . ”</p>
     <p n="302"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ That belongs to<persName>Lavish</persName>. ”</said>said the clergyman .<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ A good fellow ,<persName>Lavish</persName>, but I wish she 'd start a pipe . ”</said></p>
     <p n="303"><said who="#Miss_Alan">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>, divided between awe and mirth .<said who="#Miss_Alan">“ Indeed , though it is dreadful for her to smoke , it is not quite as dreadful as you suppose . She took to it , practically in despair , after her life 's work was carried away in a landslip . Surely that makes it more excusable . ”</said></p>
     <p n="304"><said who="#Lucy">“ What was that ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="305"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>sat back complacently , and<persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>began as follows :<said who="#Miss_Alan">“ It was a novel — and I am afraid , from what I can gather , not a very nice novel . It is so sad when people who have abilities misuse them , and I must say they nearly always do . Anyhow , she left it almost finished in the Grotto of the Calvary at the Capuccini Hotel at Amalfi while she went for a little ink . She said : ‘ Can I have a little ink , please ? ’ But you know what Italians are , and meanwhile the Grotto fell roaring on to the beach , and the saddest thing of all is that she cannot remember what she has written . The poor thing was very ill after it , and so got tempted into cigarettes . It is a great secret , but I am glad to say that she is writing another novel . She told Teresa and Miss Pole the other day that she had got up all the local colour — this novel is to be about modern Italy ; the other was historical — but that she could not start till she had an idea . First she tried Perugia for an inspiration , then she came here — this must on no account get round . And so cheerful through it all ! I cannot help thinking that there is something to admire in every one , even if you do not approve of them . ”</said></p>
     <p n="306"><persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>was always thus being charitable against her better judgment . A delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks , giving them unexpected beauty , just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes rise odours reminiscent of spring . She felt she had made almost too many allowances , and apologized hurriedly for her toleration .</p>
     <p n="307"><said who="#Miss_Alan">“ All the same , she is a little too — I hardly like to say unwomanly , but she behaved most strangely when the Emersons arrived . ”</said></p>
     <p n="308"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>smiled as<persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>plunged into an anecdote which he knew she would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman .</p>
     <p n="309"><said who="#Miss_Alan">“ I do n't know ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, if you have noticed that Miss Pole , the lady who has so much yellow hair , takes lemonade . That old<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, who puts things very strangely — ”</said></p>
     <p n="310">Her jaw dropped . She was silent .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, whose social resources were endless , went out to order some tea , and she continued to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>in a hasty whisper :</p>
     <p n="311"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Stomach . He warned Miss Pole of her stomach-acidity , he called it — and he may have meant to be kind . I must say I forgot myself and laughed ; it was so sudden . As Teresa truly said , it was no laughing matter . But the point is that<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>was positively ATTRACTED by his mentioning S ., and said she liked plain speaking , and meeting different grades of thought . She thought they were commercial travellers — ‘ drummers ’ was the word she used — and all through dinner she tried to prove that England , our great and beloved country , rests on nothing but commerce . Teresa was very much annoyed , and left the table before the cheese , saying as she did so : ‘ There ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, is one who can confute you better than I , ’ and pointed to that beautiful picture of Lord Tennyson . Then<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>said : ‘ Tut ! The early Victorians . ’ Just imagine ! ‘ Tut ! The early Victorians . ’ My sister had gone , and I felt bound to speak . I said : ‘<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, I am an early Victorian ; at least , that is to say , I will hear no breath of censure against our dear Queen . ’ It was horrible speaking . I reminded her how the Queen had been to Ireland when she did not want to go , and I must say she was dumbfounded , and made no reply . But , unluckily ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>overheard this part , and called in his deep voice : ‘ Quite so , quite so ! I honour the woman for her Irish visit . ’ The woman ! I tell things so badly ; but you see what a tangle we were in by this time , all on account of S. having been mentioned in the first place . But that was not all . After dinner<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>actually came up and said : ‘<persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>, I am going into the smoking-room to talk to those two nice men . Come , too . ’ Needless to say , I refused such an unsuitable invitation , and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would broaden my ideas , and said that she had four brothers , all University men , except one who was in the army , who always made a point of talking to commercial travellers . ”</said></p>
     <p n="312"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Let me finish the story , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, who had returned .</p>
     <p n="313"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>tried Miss Pole , myself , every one , and finally said : ‘ I shall go alone . ’ She went . At the end of five minutes she returned unobtrusively with a green baize board , and began playing patience . ”</said></p>
     <p n="314"><said who="#Lucy">“ Whatever happened ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="315"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ No one knows . No one will ever know .<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>will never dare to tell , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>does not think it worth telling . ”</said></p>
     <p n="316"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>— old<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, is he nice or not nice ? I do so want to know . ”</said></p>
     <p n="317"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>laughed and suggested that she should settle the question for herself .</p>
     <p n="318"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ No ; but it is so difficult . Sometimes he is so silly , and then I do not mind him .<persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>, what do you think ? Is he nice ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="319">The little old lady shook her head , and sighed disapprovingly .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, whom the conversation amused , stirred her up by saying :</p>
     <p n="320"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I consider that you are bound to class him as nice ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>, after that business of the violets . ”</said></p>
     <p n="321"><said who="#Miss_Alan">“ Violets ? Oh , dear ! Who told you about the violets ? How do things get round ? A pension is a bad place for gossips . No , I cannot forget how they behaved at Mr . Eager 's lecture at Santa Croce . Oh , poor<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>! It really was too bad . No , I have quite changed . I do NOT like the Emersons . They are not nice . ”</said></p>
     <p n="322"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>smiled nonchalantly . He had made a gentle effort to introduce the Emersons into Bertolini society , and the effort had failed . He was almost the only person who remained friendly to them .<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, who represented intellect , was avowedly hostile , and now the Miss Alans , who stood for good breeding , were following her .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, smarting under an obligation , would scarcely be civil . The case of<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was different . She had given him a hazy account of her adventures in Santa Croce , and he gathered that the two men had made a curious and possibly concerted attempt to annex her , to show her the world from their own strange standpoint , to interest her in their private sorrows and joys . This was impertinent ; he did not wish their cause to be championed by a young girl : he would rather it should fail . After all , he knew nothing about them , and pension joys , pension sorrows , are flimsy things ; whereas<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>would be his parishioner .</p>
     <p n="323"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, with one eye upon the weather , finally said that she thought the Emersons were nice ; not that she saw anything of them now . Even their seats at dinner had been moved .</p>
     <p n="324"><said who="#Lucy">“ But are n't they always waylaying you to go out with them , dear ? ”</said>said the little lady inquisitively .</p>
     <p n="325"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Only once .<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>did n't like it , and said something — quite politely , of course . ”</said></p>
     <p n="326"><said who="#Lucy">“ Most right of her . They do n't understand our ways . They must find their level . ”</said></p>
     <p n="327"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>rather felt that they had gone under . They had given up their attempt — if it was one — to conquer society , and now the father was almost as silent as the son . He wondered whether he would not plan a pleasant day for these folk before they left — some expedition , perhaps , with<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>well chaperoned to be nice to them . It was one of<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories .</p>
     <p n="328">Evening approached while they chatted ; the air became brighter ; the colours on the trees and hills were purified , and<persName corresp="#the_Arno">the Arno</persName>lost its muddy solidity and began to twinkle . There were a few streaks of bluish-green among the clouds , a few patches of watery light upon the earth , and then the dripping facade of San Miniato shone brilliantly in the declining sun .</p>
     <p n="329"><said who="#Miss_Alan">“ Too late to go out , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>in a voice of relief .<said who="#Miss_Alan">“ All the galleries are shut . ”</said></p>
     <p n="330"><said who="#Lucy">“ I think I shall go out , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.<said who="#Lucy">“ I want to go round the town in the circular tram — on the platform by the driver . ”</said></p>
     <p n="331">Her two companions looked grave .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, who felt responsible for her in the absence of<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, ventured to say :</p>
     <p n="332"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I wish we could . Unluckily I have letters . If you do want to go out alone , wo n't you be better on your feet ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="333"><said who="#Miss_Alan">“ Italians , dear , you know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>.</p>
     <p n="334"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Perhaps I shall meet some one who reads me through and through ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="335">But they still looked disapproval , and she so far conceded to<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>as to say that she would only go for a little walk , and keep to the street frequented by tourists .</p>
     <p n="336"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ She ought n't really to go at all , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, as they watched her from the window ,<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ and she knows it . I put it down to too much<persName corresp="#Beethoven">Beethoven</persName>. ”</said></p>

     <p n="337"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>was right .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>never knew her desires so clearly as after music . She had not really appreciated the clergyman 's wit , nor the suggestive twitterings of<persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>. Conversation was tedious ; she wanted something big , and she believed that it would have come to her on the wind-swept platform of an electric tram . This she might not attempt . It was unladylike . Why ? Why were most big things unladylike ?<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>had once explained to her why . It was not that ladies were inferior to men ; it was that they were different . Their mission was to inspire others to achievement rather than to achieve themselves . Indirectly , by means of tact and a spotless name , a lady could accomplish much . But if she rushed into the fray herself she would be first censured , then despised , and finally ignored . Poems had been written to illustrate this point .</p>
     <p n="338">There is much that is immortal in this medieval lady . The dragons have gone , and so have the knights , but still she lingers in our midst . She reigned in many an early Victorian castle , and was Queen of much early Victorian song . It is sweet to protect her in the intervals of business , sweet to pay her honour when she has cooked our dinner well . But alas ! the creature grows degenerate . In her heart also there are springing up strange desires . She too is enamoured of heavy winds , and vast panoramas , and green expanses of the sea . She has marked the kingdom of this world , how full it is of wealth , and beauty , and war — a radiant crust , built around the central fires , spinning towards the receding heavens . Men , declaring that she inspires them to it , move joyfully over the surface , having the most delightful meetings with other men , happy , not because they are masculine , but because they are alive . Before the show breaks up she would like to drop the august title of the Eternal Woman , and go there as her transitory self .</p>
     <p n="339"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>does not stand for the medieval lady , who was rather an ideal to which she was bidden to lift her eyes when feeling serious . Nor has she any system of revolt . Here and there a restriction annoyed her particularly , and she would transgress it , and perhaps be sorry that she had done so . This afternoon she was peculiarly restive . She would really like to do something of which her well-wishers disapproved . As she might not go on the electric tram , she went to Alinari 's shop .</p>
     <p n="340">There she bought a photograph of Botticelli 's “ Birth of Venus . ” Venus , being a pity , spoilt the picture , otherwise so charming , and<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>had persuaded her to do without it . ( A pity in art of course signified the nude . ) Giorgione 's “ Tempesta , ” the “ Idolino , ” some of the Sistine frescoes and the Apoxyomenos , were added to it . She felt a little calmer then , and bought Fra Angelico 's “ Coronation , ”<persName corresp="#Giotto">Giotto</persName>'s “ Ascension of St. John , ” some Della Robbia babies , and some Guido Reni Madonnas . For her taste was catholic , and she extended uncritical approval to every well-known name .</p>
     <p n="341">But though she spent nearly seven lire , the gates of liberty seemed still unopened . She was conscious of her discontent ; it was new to her to be conscious of it .<said who="#Giotto">“ The world , ”</said>she thought ,<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ is certainly full of beautiful things , if only I could come across them . ”</said>It was not surprising that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>disapproved of music , declaring that it always left her daughter peevish , unpractical , and touchy .</p>
     <p n="342"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Nothing ever happens to me , ”</said>she reflected , as she entered the Piazza Signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels , now fairly familiar to her . The great square was in shadow ; the sunshine had come too late to strike it . Neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight , half god , half ghost , and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who idled together on its marge . The Loggia showed as the triple entrance of a cave , wherein many a deity , shadowy , but immortal , looking forth upon the arrivals and departures of mankind . It was the hour of unreality — the hour , that is , when unfamiliar things are real . An older person at such an hour and in such a place might think that sufficient was happening to him , and rest content .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>desired more .</p>
     <p n="343">She fixed her eyes wistfully on the tower of the palace , which rose out of the lower darkness like a pillar of roughened gold . It seemed no longer a tower , no longer supported by earth , but some unattainable treasure throbbing in the tranquil sky . Its brightness mesmerized her , still dancing before her eyes when she bent them to the ground and started towards home .</p>
     <p n="344">Then something did happen .</p>
     <p n="345">Two Italians by the Loggia had been bickering about a debt .<said who="#Lucy">“ Cinque lire , ”</said>they had cried ,<said who="#Lucy">“ cinque lire ! ”</said>They sparred at each other , and one of them was hit lightly upon the chest . He frowned ; he bent towards<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>with a look of interest , as if he had an important message for her . He opened his lips to deliver it , and a stream of red came out between them and trickled down his unshaven chin .</p>
     <p n="346">That was all . A crowd rose out of the dusk . It hid this extraordinary man from her , and bore him away to the fountain . Mr.<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>happened to be a few paces away , looking at her across the spot where the man had been . How very odd ! Across something . Even as she caught sight of him he grew dim ; the palace itself grew dim , swayed above her , fell on to her softly , slowly , noiselessly , and the sky fell with it .</p>
     <p n="347">She thought :<said who="#George_Emerson">“ Oh , what have I done ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="348"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , what have I done ? ”</said>she murmured , and opened her eyes .</p>
     <p n="349"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>still looked at her , but not across anything . She had complained of dullness , and lo ! one man was stabbed , and another held her in his arms .</p>
     <p n="350">They were sitting on some steps in the Uffizi Arcade . He must have carried her . He rose when she spoke , and began to dust his knees . She repeated :</p>
     <p n="351"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Oh , what have I done ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="352"><said who="#Lucy">“ You fainted . ”</said></p>
     <p n="353"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ I — I am very sorry . ”</said></p>
     <p n="354"><said who="#Lucy">“ How are you now ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="355"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Perfectly well — absolutely well . ”</said>And she began to nod and smile .</p>
     <p n="356"><said who="#Lucy">“ Then let us come home . There 's no point in our stopping . ”</said></p>
     <p n="357">He held out his hand to pull her up . She pretended not to see it . The cries from the fountain — they had never ceased — rang emptily . The whole world seemed pale and void of its original meaning .</p>
     <p n="358"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ How very kind you have been ! I might have hurt myself falling . But now I am well . I can go alone , thank you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="359">His hand was still extended .</p>
     <p n="360"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Oh , my photographs ! ”</said>she exclaimed suddenly .</p>
     <p n="361"><said who="#Lucy">“ What photographs ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="362"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ I bought some photographs at Alinari 's . I must have dropped them out there in the square . ”</said>She looked at him cautiously .<said who="#George_Emerson">“ Would you add to your kindness by fetching them ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="363">He added to his kindness . As soon as he had turned his back ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>arose with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards<persName corresp="#the_Arno">the Arno</persName>.</p>
     <p n="364"><said who="#the_Arno">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="365">She stopped with her hand on her heart .</p>
     <p n="366"><said who="#the_Arno">“ You sit still ; you are n't fit to go home alone . ”</said></p>
     <p n="367"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yes , I am , thank you so very much . ”</said></p>
     <p n="368"><said who="#the_Arno">“ No , you are n't . You 'd go openly if you were . ”</said></p>
     <p n="369"><said who="#Lucy">“ But I had rather — ”</said></p>
     <p n="370"><said who="#the_Arno">“ Then I do n't fetch your photographs . ”</said></p>
     <p n="371"><said who="#Lucy">“ I had rather be alone . ”</said></p>
     <p n="372">He said imperiously :<said who="#the_Arno">“ The man is dead — the man is probably dead ; sit down till you are rested . ”</said>She was bewildered , and obeyed him .<said who="#the_Arno">“ And do n't move till I come back . ”</said></p>
     <p n="373">In the distance she saw creatures with black hoods , such as appear in dreams . The palace tower had lost the reflection of the declining day , and joined itself to earth . How should she talk to<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>when he returned from the shadowy square ? Again the thought occurred to her ,<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Oh , what have I done ? ”</said>— the thought that she , as well as the dying man , had crossed some spiritual boundary .</p>
     <p n="374">He returned , and she talked of the murder . Oddly enough , it was an easy topic . She spoke of the Italian character ; she became almost garrulous over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before . Being strong physically , she soon overcame the horror of blood . She rose without his assistance , and though wings seemed to flutter inside her , she walked firmly enough towards<persName corresp="#the_Arno">the Arno</persName>. There a cabman signalled to them ; they refused him .</p>
     <p n="375"><said who="#the_Arno">“ And the murderer tried to kiss him , you say — how very odd Italians are !— and gave himself up to the police !<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>was saying that Italians know everything , but I think they are rather childish . When my cousin and I were at the Pitti yesterday — What was that ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="376">He had thrown something into the stream .</p>
     <p n="377"><said who="#the_Arno">“ What did you throw in ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="378"><said who="#the_Arno">“ Things I did n't want , ”</said>he said crossly .</p>
     <p n="379"><said who="#the_Arno">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="380"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Well ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="381"><said who="#the_Arno">“ Where are the photographs ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="382">He was silent .</p>
     <p n="383"><said who="#the_Arno">“ I believe it was my photographs that you threw away . ”</said></p>
     <p n="384"><said who="#the_Arno">“ I did n't know what to do with them , ”</said>he cried , and his voice was that of an anxious boy . Her heart warmed towards him for the first time .<said who="#the_Arno">“ They were covered with blood . There ! I 'm glad I 've told you ; and all the time we were making conversation I was wondering what to do with them . ”</said>He pointed down-stream .<said who="#the_Arno">“ They 've gone . ”</said>The river swirled under the bridge ,<said who="#the_Arno">“ I did mind them so , and one is so foolish , it seemed better that they should go out to the sea — I do n't know ; I may just mean that they frightened me . ”</said>Then the boy verged into a man .<said who="#the_Arno">“ For something tremendous has happened ; I must face it without getting muddled . It is n't exactly that a man has died . ”</said></p>
     <p n="385">Something warned<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>that she must stop him .</p>
     <p n="386"><said who="#the_Arno">“ It has happened , ”</said>he repeated ,<said who="#the_Arno">“ and I mean to find out what it is . ”</said></p>
     <p n="387"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>— ”</said></p>
     <p n="388">He turned towards her frowning , as if she had disturbed him in some abstract quest .</p>
     <p n="389"><said who="#Lucy">“ I want to ask you something before we go in . ”</said></p>
     <p n="390">They were close to their pension . She stopped and leant her elbows against the parapet of the embankment . He did likewise . There is at times a magic in identity of position ; it is one of the things that have suggested to us eternal comradeship . She moved her elbows before saying :</p>
     <p n="391"><said who="#Lucy">“ I have behaved ridiculously . ”</said></p>
     <p n="392">He was following his own thoughts .</p>
     <p n="393"><said who="#Lucy">“ I was never so much ashamed of myself in my life ; I cannot think what came over me . ”</said></p>
     <p n="394"><said who="#the_Arno">“ I nearly fainted myself , ”</said>he said ; but she felt that her attitude repelled him .</p>
     <p n="395"><said who="#Lucy">“ Well , I owe you a thousand apologies . ”</said></p>
     <p n="396"><said who="#the_Arno">“ Oh , all right . ”</said></p>
     <p n="397"><said who="#Lucy">“ And — this is the real point — you know how silly people are gossiping — ladies especially , I am afraid — you understand what I mean ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="398"><said who="#the_Arno">“ I 'm afraid I do n't . ”</said></p>
     <p n="399"><said who="#Lucy">“ I mean , would you not mention it to any one , my foolish behaviour ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="400"><said who="#the_Arno">“ Your behaviour ? Oh , yes , all right — all right . ”</said></p>
     <p n="401"><said who="#Lucy">“ Thank you so much . And would you — ”</said></p>
     <p n="402">She could not carry her request any further . The river was rushing below them , almost black in the advancing night . He had thrown her photographs into it , and then he had told her the reason . It struck her that it was hopeless to look for chivalry in such a man . He would do her no harm by idle gossip ; he was trustworthy , intelligent , and even kind ; he might even have a high opinion of her . But he lacked chivalry ; his thoughts , like his behaviour , would not be modified by awe . It was useless to say to him ,<said who="#the_Arno">“ And would you — ”</said>and hope that he would complete the sentence for himself , averting his eyes from her nakedness like the knight in that beautiful picture . She had been in his arms , and he remembered it , just as he remembered the blood on the photographs that she had bought in Alinari 's shop . It was not exactly that a man had died ; something had happened to the living : they had come to a situation where character tells , and where childhood enters upon the branching paths of Youth .</p>
     <p n="403"><said who="#Lucy">“ Well , thank you so much , ”</said>she repeated ,<said who="#Lucy">“ How quickly these accidents do happen , and then one returns to the old life ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="404"><said who="#the_Arno">“ I do n't . ”</said></p>
     <p n="405">Anxiety moved her to question him .</p>
     <p n="406">His answer was puzzling :<said who="#Lucy">“ I shall probably want to live . ”</said></p>
     <p n="407"><said who="#the_Arno">“ But why ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>? What do you mean ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="408"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I shall want to live , I say . ”</said></p>
     <p n="409">Leaning her elbows on the parapet , she contemplated the River Arno , whose roar was suggesting some unexpected melody to her ears .</p>

     <head type="chapter">Chapter V : Possibilities of a Pleasant Outing</head>
     <p n="410">It was a family saying that “ you never knew which way<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>Bartlett would turn . ” She was perfectly pleasant and sensible over<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s adventure , found the abridged account of it quite adequate , and paid suitable tribute to the courtesy of Mr.<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>. She and<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>had had an adventure also . They had been stopped at the Dazio coming back , and the young officials there , who seemed impudent and desoeuvre , had tried to search their reticules for provisions . It might have been most unpleasant . Fortunately<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>was a match for any one .</p>
     <p n="411">For good or for evil ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was left to face her problem alone . None of her friends had seen her , either in the Piazza or , later on , by the embankment .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, indeed , noticing her startled eyes at dinner-time , had again passed to himself the remark of “ Too much<persName corresp="#Beethoven">Beethoven</persName>. ” But he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure , not that she had encountered it . This solitude oppressed her ; she was accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or , at all events , contradicted ; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking right or wrong .</p>
     <p n="412">At breakfast next morning she took decisive action . There were two plans between which she had to choose .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>was walking up to the Torre del Gallo with the Emersons and some American ladies . Would<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>and<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>join the party ?<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>declined for herself ; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon . But she thought it an admirable idea for<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, who hated shopping , changing money , fetching letters , and other irksome duties — all of which<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone .</p>
     <p n="413"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ No ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>! ”</said>cried the girl , with real warmth .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ It 's very kind of<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, but I am certainly coming with you . I had much rather . ”</said></p>
     <p n="414"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Very well , dear , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, with a faint flush of pleasure that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. How abominably she behaved to<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, now as always ! But now she should alter . All morning she would be really nice to her .</p>
     <p n="415">She slipped her arm into her cousin 's , and they started off along the Lung ’ Arno . The river was a lion that morning in strength , voice , and colour .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>insisted on leaning over the parapet to look at it . She then made her usual remark , which was “ How I do wish<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>and your mother could see this , too ! ”</p>
     <p n="416"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>fidgeted ; it was tiresome of<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>to have stopped exactly where she did .</p>
     <p n="417"><said who="#Charlotte">“ Look ,<persName corresp="#Lucia">Lucia</persName>! Oh , you are watching for the Torre del Gallo party . I feared you would repent you of your choice . ”</said></p>
     <p n="418">Serious as the choice had been ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>did not repent . Yesterday had been a muddle — queer and odd , the kind of thing one could not write down easily on paper — but she had a feeling that<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>and her shopping were preferable to<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>and the summit of the Torre del Gallo . Since she could not unravel the tangle , she must take care not to re-enter it . She could protest sincerely against<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>'s insinuations .</p>
     <p n="419">But though she had avoided the chief actor , the scenery unfortunately remained .<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, with the complacency of fate , led her from the river to the Piazza Signoria . She could not have believed that stones , a Loggia , a fountain , a palace tower , would have such significance . For a moment she understood the nature of ghosts .</p>
     <p n="420">The exact site of the murder was occupied , not by a ghost , but by<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, who had the morning newspaper in her hand . She hailed them briskly . The dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an idea which she thought would work up into a book .</p>
     <p n="421"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Oh , let me congratulate you ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ After your despair of yesterday ! What a fortunate thing ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="422"><said who="#Lucy">“ Aha !<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, come you here I am in luck . Now , you are to tell me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning . ”</said><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>poked at the ground with her parasol .</p>
     <p n="423"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ But perhaps you would rather not ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="424"><said who="#Lucy">“ I 'm sorry — if you could manage without it , I think I would rather not . ”</said></p>
     <p n="425">The elder ladies exchanged glances , not of disapproval ; it is suitable that a girl should feel deeply .</p>
     <p n="426"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ It is I who am sorry , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>“ literary hacks are shameless creatures . I believe there 's no secret of the human heart into which we would n't pry . ”</p>
     <p n="427">She marched cheerfully to the fountain and back , and did a few calculations in realism . Then she said that she had been in the Piazza since eight o'clock collecting material . A good deal of it was unsuitable , but of course one always had to adapt . The two men had quarrelled over a five-franc note . For the five-franc note she should substitute a young lady , which would raise the tone of the tragedy , and at the same time furnish an excellent plot .</p>
     <p n="428"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ What is the heroine 's name ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.</p>
     <p n="429"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Leonora , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>; her own name was<persName corresp="#Eleanor">Eleanor</persName>.</p>
     <p n="430"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I do hope she 's nice . ”</said></p>
     <p n="431">That desideratum would not be omitted .</p>
     <p n="432"><said who="#Eleanor">“ And what is the plot ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="433">Love , murder , abduction , revenge , was the plot . But it all came while the fountain plashed to the satyrs in the morning sun .</p>
     <p n="434"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ I hope you will excuse me for boring on like this , ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>concluded .<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ It is so tempting to talk to really sympathetic people . Of course , this is the barest outline . There will be a deal of local colouring , descriptions of Florence and the neighbourhood , and I shall also introduce some humorous characters . And let me give you all fair warning : I intend to be unmerciful to the British tourist . ”</said></p>
     <p n="435"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Oh , you wicked woman , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I am sure you are thinking of the Emersons . ”</said></p>
     <p n="436"><persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>gave a Machiavellian smile .</p>
     <p n="437"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ I confess that in Italy my sympathies are not with my own countrymen . It is the neglected Italians who attract me , and whose lives I am going to paint so far as I can . For I repeat and I insist , and I have always held most strongly , that a tragedy such as yesterday 's is not the less tragic because it happened in humble life . ”</said></p>
     <p n="438">There was a fitting silence when<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>had concluded . Then the cousins wished success to her labours , and walked slowly away across the square .</p>
     <p n="439"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ She is my idea of a really clever woman , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ That last remark struck me as so particularly true . It should be a most pathetic novel . ”</said></p>
     <p n="440"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>assented . At present her great aim was not to get put into it . Her perceptions this morning were curiously keen , and she believed that<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>had her on trial for an ingenue .</p>
     <p n="441"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ She is emancipated , but only in the very best sense of the word , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>slowly .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ None but the superficial would be shocked at her . We had a long talk yesterday . She believes in justice and truth and human interest . She told me also that she has a high opinion of the destiny of woman — Mr . Eager ! Why , how nice ! What a pleasant surprise ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="442"><said who="#the_chaplain">“ Ah , not for me , ”</said>said the chaplain blandly ,<said who="#the_chaplain">“ for I have been watching you and<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>for quite a little time . ”</said></p>
     <p n="443"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ We were chatting to<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="444">His brow contracted .</p>
     <p n="445"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ So I saw . Were you indeed ? Andate via ! sono occupato ! ”</said>The last remark was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a courteous smile .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I am about to venture a suggestion . Would you and<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>be disposed to join me in a drive some day this week — a drive in the hills ? We might go up by Fiesole and back by Settignano . There is a point on that road where we could get down and have an hour 's ramble on the hillside . The view thence of Florence is most beautiful — far better than the hackneyed view of Fiesole . It is the view that<persName>Alessio Baldovinetti</persName>is fond of introducing into his pictures . That man had a decided feeling for landscape . Decidedly . But who looks at it to-day ? Ah , the world is too much for us . ”</said></p>
     <p n="446"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>had not heard of<persName>Alessio Baldovinetti</persName>, but she knew that Mr . Eager was no commonplace chaplain . He was a member of the residential colony who had made Florence their home . He knew the people who never walked about with Baedekers , who had learnt to take a siesta after lunch , who took drives the pension tourists had never heard of , and saw by private influence galleries which were closed to them . Living in delicate seclusion , some in furnished flats , others in Renaissance villas on Fiesole 's slope , they read , wrote , studied , and exchanged ideas , thus attaining to that intimate knowledge , or rather perception , of Florence which is denied to all who carry in their pockets the coupons of Cook .</p>
     <p n="447">Therefore an invitation from the chaplain was something to be proud of . Between the two sections of his flock he was often the only link , and it was his avowed custom to select those of his migratory sheep who seemed worthy , and give them a few hours in the pastures of the permanent . Tea at a Renaissance villa ? Nothing had been said about it yet . But if it did come to that — how<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>would enjoy it !</p>
     <p n="448">A few days ago and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>would have felt the same . But the joys of life were grouping themselves anew . A drive in the hills with Mr . Eager and<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>— even if culminating in a residential tea-party — was no longer the greatest of them . She echoed the raptures of<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>somewhat faintly . Only when she heard that<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>was also coming did her thanks become more sincere .</p>
     <p n="449"><said who="#the_chaplain">“ So we shall be a partie carree , ”</said>said the chaplain .<said who="#the_chaplain">“ In these days of toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of purity . Andate via ! andate presto , presto ! Ah , the town ! Beautiful as it is , it is the town . ”</said></p>
     <p n="450">They assented .</p>
     <p n="451"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ This very square — so I am told — witnessed yesterday the most sordid of tragedies . To one who loves the Florence of Dante and Savonarola there is something portentous in such desecration — portentous and humiliating . ”</said></p>
     <p n="452"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Humiliating indeed , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>happened to be passing through as it happened . She can hardly bear to speak of it . ”</said>She glanced at<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>proudly .</p>
     <p n="453"><said who="#Lucy">“ And how came we to have you here ? ”</said>asked the chaplain paternally .</p>
     <p n="454"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>'s recent liberalism oozed away at the question .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Do not blame her , please , Mr . Eager . The fault is mine : I left her unchaperoned . ”</said></p>
     <p n="455"><said who="#Lucy">“ So you were here alone ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>? ”</said>His voice suggested sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing details would not be unacceptable . His dark , handsome face drooped mournfully towards her to catch her reply .</p>
     <p n="456"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ Practically . ”</said></p>
     <p n="457"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ One of our pension acquaintances kindly brought her home , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, adroitly concealing the sex of the preserver .</p>
     <p n="458"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ For her also it must have been a terrible experience . I trust that neither of you was at all — that it was not in your immediate proximity ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="459">Of the many things<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was noticing to-day , not the least remarkable was this : the ghoulish fashion in which respectable people will nibble after blood .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>had kept the subject strangely pure .</p>
     <p n="460"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ He died by the fountain , I believe , ”</said>was her reply .</p>
     <p n="461"><said who="#Lucy">“ And you and your friend — ”</said></p>
     <p n="462"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Were over at the Loggia . ”</said></p>
     <p n="463"><said who="#Lucy">“ That must have saved you much . You have not , of course , seen the disgraceful illustrations which the gutter Press — This man is a public nuisance ; he knows that I am a resident perfectly well , and yet he goes on worrying me to buy his vulgar views . ”</said></p>
     <p n="464">Surely the vendor of photographs was in league with<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>— in the eternal league of Italy with youth . He had suddenly extended his book before<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>and Mr . Eager , binding their hands together by a long glossy ribbon of churches , pictures , and views .</p>
     <p n="465"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ This is too much ! ”</said>cried the chaplain , striking petulantly at one of Fra Angelico 's angels . She tore . A shrill cry rose from the vendor . The book it seemed , was more valuable than one would have supposed .</p>
     <p n="466"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Willingly would I purchase — ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.</p>
     <p n="467"><said who="#Lucy">“ Ignore him , ”</said>said Mr . Eager sharply , and they all walked rapidly away from the square .</p>
     <p n="468">But an Italian can never be ignored , least of all when he has a grievance . His mysterious persecution of Mr . Eager became relentless ; the air rang with his threats and lamentations . He appealed to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>; would not she intercede ? He was poor — he sheltered a family — the tax on bread . He waited , he gibbered , he was recompensed , he was dissatisfied , he did not leave them until he had swept their minds clean of all thoughts whether pleasant or unpleasant .</p>
     <p n="469">Shopping was the topic that now ensued . Under the chaplain 's guidance they selected many hideous presents and mementoes — florid little picture-frames that seemed fashioned in gilded pastry ; other little frames , more severe , that stood on little easels , and were carven out of oak ; a blotting book of vellum ; a Dante of the same material ; cheap mosaic brooches , which the maids , next Christmas , would never tell from real ; pins , pots , heraldic saucers , brown art-photographs ; Eros and Psyche in alabaster ; St. Peter to match — all of which would have cost less in London .</p>
     <p n="470">This successful morning left no pleasant impressions on<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. She had been a little frightened , both by<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>and by Mr . Eager , she knew not why . And as they frightened her , she had , strangely enough , ceased to respect them . She doubted that<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>was a great artist . She doubted that Mr . Eager was as full of spirituality and culture as she had been led to suppose . They were tried by some new test , and they were found wanting . As for<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>— as for<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>she was exactly the same . It might be possible to be nice to her ; it was impossible to love her .</p>
     <p n="471"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ The son of a labourer ; I happen to know it for a fact . A mechanic of some sort himself when he was young ; then he took to writing for the Socialistic Press . I came across him at Brixton . ”</said></p>
     <p n="472">They were talking about the Emersons .</p>
     <p n="473"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ How wonderfully people rise in these days ! ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, fingering a model of the leaning Tower of Pisa .</p>
     <p n="474"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Generally , ”</said>replied Mr . Eager ,<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ one has only sympathy for their success . The desire for education and for social advance — in these things there is something not wholly vile . There are some working men whom one would be very willing to see out here in Florence — little as they would make of it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="475"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Is he a journalist now ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>asked ,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ He is not ; he made an advantageous marriage . ”</said></p>
     <p n="476">He uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning , and ended with a sigh .</p>
     <p n="477"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Oh , so he has a wife . ”</said></p>
     <p n="478"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Dead ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, dead . I wonder — yes I wonder how he has the effrontery to look me in the face , to dare to claim acquaintance with me . He was in my London parish long ago . The other day in Santa Croce , when he was with<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, I snubbed him . Let him beware that he does not get more than a snub . ”</said></p>
     <p n="479"><said who="#Lucy">“ What ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, flushing .</p>
     <p n="480"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Exposure ! ”</said>hissed Mr . Eager .</p>
     <p n="481">He tried to change the subject ; but in scoring a dramatic point he had interested his audience more than he had intended .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>was full of very natural curiosity .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, though she wished never to see the Emersons again , was not disposed to condemn them on a single word .</p>
     <p n="482"><said who="#Lucy">“ Do you mean , ”</said>she asked ,<said who="#Lucy">“ that he is an irreligious man ? We know that already . ”</said></p>
     <p n="483"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, dear — ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, gently reproving her cousin 's penetration .</p>
     <p n="484"><said who="#Lucy">“ I should be astonished if you knew all . The boy — an innocent child at the time — I will exclude . God knows what his education and his inherited qualities may have made him . ”</said></p>
     <p n="485"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Perhaps , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ it is something that we had better not hear . ”</said></p>
     <p n="486"><said who="#Lucy">“ To speak plainly , ”</said>said Mr . Eager ,<said who="#Lucy">“ it is . I will say no more . ”</said>For the first time<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s rebellious thoughts swept out in words — for the first time in her life .</p>
     <p n="487"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ You have said very little . ”</said></p>
     <p n="488"><said who="#Lucy">“ It was my intention to say very little , ”</said>was his frigid reply .</p>
     <p n="489">He gazed indignantly at the girl , who met him with equal indignation . She turned towards him from the shop counter ; her breast heaved quickly . He observed her brow , and the sudden strength of her lips . It was intolerable that she should disbelieve him .</p>
     <p n="490"><said who="#Lucy">“ Murder , if you want to know , ”</said>he cried angrily .<said who="#Lucy">“ That man murdered his wife ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="491"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ How ? ”</said>she retorted .</p>
     <p n="492"><said who="#Lucy">“ To all intents and purposes he murdered her . That day in Santa Croce — did they say anything against me ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="493"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Not a word , Mr . Eager — not a single word . ”</said></p>
     <p n="494"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , I thought they had been libelling me to you . But I suppose it is only their personal charms that makes you defend them . ”</said></p>
     <p n="495"><said who="#Lucy">“ I 'm not defending them , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, losing her courage , and relapsing into the old chaotic methods .<said who="#Lucy">“ They 're nothing to me . ”</said></p>
     <p n="496"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ How could you think she was defending them ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, much discomfited by the unpleasant scene . The shopman was possibly listening .</p>
     <p n="497"><said who="#Lucy">“ She will find it difficult . For that man has murdered his wife in the sight of God . ”</said></p>
     <p n="498">The addition of God was striking . But the chaplain was really trying to qualify a rash remark . A silence followed which might have been impressive , but was merely awkward . Then<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>hastily purchased the Leaning Tower , and led the way into the street .</p>
     <p n="499"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I must be going , ”</said>said he , shutting his eyes and taking out his watch .</p>
     <p n="500"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>thanked him for his kindness , and spoke with enthusiasm of the approaching drive .</p>
     <p n="501"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Drive ? Oh , is our drive to come off ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="502"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was recalled to her manners , and after a little exertion the complacency of Mr . Eager was restored .</p>
     <p n="503"><said who="#Lucy">“ Bother the drive ! ”</said>exclaimed the girl , as soon as he had departed .<said who="#Lucy">“ It is just the drive we had arranged with<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>without any fuss at all . Why should he invite us in that absurd manner ? We might as well invite him . We are each paying for ourselves . ”</said></p>
     <p n="504"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, who had intended to lament over the Emersons , was launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts .</p>
     <p n="505"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ If that is so , dear — if the drive we and<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>are going with Mr . Eager is really the same as the one we are going with<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, then I foresee a sad kettle of fish . ”</said></p>
     <p n="506"><said who="#Lucy">“ How ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="507"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Because<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>has asked<persName corresp="#Eleanor">Eleanor</persName><persName>Lavish</persName>to come , too . ”</said></p>
     <p n="508"><said who="#Lucy">“ That will mean another carriage . ”</said></p>
     <p n="509"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Far worse . Mr . Eager does not like<persName corresp="#Eleanor">Eleanor</persName>. She knows it herself . The truth must be told ; she is too unconventional for him . ”</said></p>
     <p n="510">They were now in the newspaper-room at the English bank .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>stood by the central table , heedless of Punch and the Graphic , trying to answer , or at all events to formulate the questions rioting in her brain . The well-known world had broken up , and there emerged Florence , a magic city where people thought and did the most extraordinary things . Murder , accusations of murder , A lady clinging to one man and being rude to another — were these the daily incidents of her streets ? Was there more in her frank beauty than met the eye — the power , perhaps , to evoke passions , good and bad , and to bring them speedily to a fulfillment ?</p>
     <p n="511">Happy<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, who , though greatly troubled over things that did not matter , seemed oblivious to things that did ; who could conjecture with admirable delicacy “ where things might lead to , ” but apparently lost sight of the goal as she approached it . Now she was crouching in the corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag which hung in chaste concealment round her neck . She had been told that this was the only safe way to carry money in Italy ; it must only be broached within the walls of the English bank . As she groped she murmured :<said who="#Charlotte">“ Whether it is<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>who forgot to tell Mr . Eager , or Mr . Eager who forgot when he told us , or whether they have decided to leave<persName corresp="#Eleanor">Eleanor</persName>out altogether — which they could scarcely do — but in any case we must be prepared . It is you they really want ; I am only asked for appearances . You shall go with the two gentlemen , and I and<persName corresp="#Eleanor">Eleanor</persName>will follow behind . A one-horse carriage would do for us . Yet how difficult it is ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="512"><said who="#Lucy">“ It is indeed , ”</said>replied the girl , with a gravity that sounded sympathetic .</p>
     <p n="513"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ What do you think about it ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, flushed from the struggle , and buttoning up her dress .</p>
     <p n="514"><said who="#Lucy">“ I do n't know what I think , nor what I want . ”</said></p>
     <p n="515"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Oh , dear ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! I do hope Florence is n't boring you . Speak the word , and , as you know , I would take you to the ends of the earth to-morrow . ”</said></p>
     <p n="516"><said who="#Lucy">“ Thank you ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, and pondered over the offer .</p>
     <p n="517">There were letters for her at the bureau — one from her brother , full of athletics and biology ; one from her mother , delightful as only her mother 's letters could be . She had read in it of the crocuses which had been bought for yellow and were coming up puce , of the new parlour-maid , who had watered the ferns with essence of lemonade , of the semi-detached cottages which were ruining Summer Street , and breaking the heart of<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry Otway</persName>. She recalled the free , pleasant life of her home , where she was allowed to do everything , and where nothing ever happened to her . The road up through the pine-woods , the clean drawing-room , the view over the Sussex Weald — all hung before her bright and distinct , but pathetic as the pictures in a gallery to which , after much experience , a traveller returns .</p>
     <p n="518"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ And the news ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.</p>
     <p n="519"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>and her son have gone to Rome , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, giving the news that interested her least .<said who="#Lucy">“ Do you know the Vyses ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="520"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Oh , not that way back . We can never have too much of the dear Piazza Signoria . ”</said></p>
     <p n="521"><said who="#Lucy">“ They 're nice people , the Vyses . So clever — my idea of what 's really clever . Do n't you long to be in Rome ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="522"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I die for it ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="523">The Piazza Signoria is too stony to be brilliant . It has no grass , no flowers , no frescoes , no glittering walls of marble or comforting patches of ruddy brick . By an odd chance — unless we believe in a presiding genius of places — the statues that relieve its severity suggest , not the innocence of childhood , nor the glorious bewilderment of youth , but the conscious achievements of maturity . Perseus and Judith , Hercules and Thusnelda , they have done or suffered something , and though they are immortal , immortality has come to them after experience , not before . Here , not only in the solitude of<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>, might a hero meet a goddess , or a heroine a god .</p>
     <p n="524"><said who="#Nature">“<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>! ”</said>cried the girl suddenly .<said who="#Nature">“ Here 's an idea . What if we popped off to Rome to-morrow — straight to the Vyses ’ hotel ? For I do know what I want . I 'm sick of Florence . No , you said you 'd go to the ends of the earth ! Do ! Do ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="525"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, with equal vivacity , replied :</p>
     <p n="526"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Oh , you droll person ! Pray , what would become of your drive in the hills ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="527">They passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square , laughing over the unpractical suggestion .</p>

     <head type="chapter">Chapter VI : The Reverend Arthur Beebe , the Reverend Cuthbert Eager ,</head>
     <p n="528"><persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, Mr.<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>, Miss<persName corresp="#Eleanor">Eleanor</persName><persName>Lavish</persName>, Miss<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>Bartlett , and Miss<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName><persName corresp="#Freddy">Honeychurch</persName>Drive Out in Carriages to See a View ; Italians Drive Them .</p>
     <p n="529">It was<persName corresp="#Phaethon">Phaethon</persName>who drove them to Fiesole that memorable day , a youth all irresponsibility and fire , recklessly urging his master 's horses up the stony hill .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>recognized him at once . Neither the Ages of Faith nor the Age of Doubt had touched him ; he was<persName corresp="#Phaethon">Phaethon</persName>in Tuscany driving a cab . And it was<persName corresp="#Persephone">Persephone</persName>whom he asked leave to pick up on the way , saying that she was his sister —<persName corresp="#Persephone">Persephone</persName>, tall and slender and pale , returning with the Spring to her mother 's cottage , and still shading her eyes from the unaccustomed light . To her Mr . Eager objected , saying that here was the thin edge of the wedge , and one must guard against imposition . But the ladies interceded , and when it had been made clear that it was a very great favour , the goddess was allowed to mount beside the god .</p>
     <p n="530"><persName corresp="#Phaethon">Phaethon</persName>at once slipped the left rein over her head , thus enabling himself to drive with his arm round her waist . She did not mind . Mr . Eager , who sat with his back to the horses , saw nothing of the indecorous proceeding , and continued his conversation with<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. The other two occupants of the carriage were old<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>and<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>. For a dreadful thing had happened :<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, without consulting Mr . Eager , had doubled the size of the party . And though<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>and<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>had planned all the morning how the people were to sit , at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their heads , and<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>got in with<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, while<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, with<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, followed on behind .</p>
     <p n="531">It was hard on the poor chaplain to have his partie carree thus transformed . Tea at a Renaissance villa , if he had ever meditated it , was now impossible .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>and<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>had a certain style about them , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, though unreliable , was a man of parts . But a shoddy lady writer and a journalist who had murdered his wife in the sight of God — they should enter no villa at his introduction .</p>
     <p n="532"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, elegantly dressed in white , sat erect and nervous amid these explosive ingredients , attentive to Mr . Eager , repressive towards<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, watchful of old<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, hitherto fortunately asleep , thanks to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of Spring . She looked on the expedition as the work of<persName corresp="#Fate">Fate</persName>. But for it she would have avoided<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>successfully . In an open manner he had shown that he wished to continue their intimacy . She had refused , not because she disliked him , but because she did not know what had happened , and suspected that he did know . And this frightened her .</p>
     <p n="533">For the real event — whatever it was — had taken place , not in the Loggia , but by the river . To behave wildly at the sight of death is pardonable . But to discuss it afterwards , to pass from discussion into silence , and through silence into sympathy , that is an error , not of a startled emotion , but of the whole fabric . There was really something blameworthy ( she thought ) in their joint contemplation of the shadowy stream , in the common impulse which had turned them to the house without the passing of a look or word . This sense of wickedness had been slight at first . She had nearly joined the party to the Torre del Gallo . But each time that she avoided<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>it became more imperative that she should avoid him again . And now celestial irony , working through her cousin and two clergymen , did not suffer her to leave Florence till she had made this expedition with him through the hills .</p>
     <p n="534">Meanwhile Mr . Eager held her in civil converse ; their little tiff was over .</p>
     <p n="535"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ So ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, you are travelling ? As a student of art ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="536"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ Oh , dear me , no — oh , no ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="537"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Perhaps as a student of human nature , ”</said>interposed<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>,<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ like myself ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="538"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Oh , no . I am here as a tourist . ”</said></p>
     <p n="539"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Oh , indeed , ”</said>said Mr . Eager .<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Are you indeed ? If you will not think me rude , we residents sometimes pity you poor tourists not a little — handed about like a parcel of goods from Venice to Florence , from Florence to Rome , living herded together in pensions or hotels , quite unconscious of anything that is outside Baedeker , their one anxiety to get ‘ done ’ or ‘ through ’ and go on somewhere else . The result is , they mix up towns , rivers , palaces in one inextricable whirl . You know the American girl in Punch who says : ‘ Say , poppa , what did we see at Rome ? ’ And the father replies : ‘ Why , guess Rome was the place where we saw the yaller dog . ’ There 's travelling for you . Ha ! ha ! ha ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="540"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ I quite agree , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, who had several times tried to interrupt his mordant wit .<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ The narrowness and superficiality of the Anglo-Saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace . ”</said></p>
     <p n="541"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Quite so . Now , the English colony at Florence ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>— and it is of considerable size , though , of course , not all equally — a few are here for trade , for example . But the greater part are students . Lady Helen Laverstock is at present busy over Fra Angelico . I mention her name because we are passing her villa on the left . No , you can only see it if you stand — no , do not stand ; you will fall . She is very proud of that thick hedge . Inside , perfect seclusion . One might have gone back six hundred years . Some critics believe that her garden was the scene of The Decameron , which lends it an additional interest , does it not ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="542"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ It does indeed ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Tell me , where do they place the scene of that wonderful seventh day ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="543">But Mr . Eager proceeded to tell<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>that on the right lived Mr . Someone Something , an American of the best type — so rare !— and that the Somebody Elses were farther down the hill .<said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ Doubtless you know her monographs in the series of ‘ Mediaeval Byways ’ ? He is working at Gemistus Pletho . Sometimes as I take tea in their beautiful grounds I hear , over the wall , the electric tram squealing up the new road with its loads of hot , dusty , unintelligent tourists who are going to ‘ do ’ Fiesole in an hour in order that they may say they have been there , and I think — think — I think how little they think what lies so near them . ”</said></p>
     <p n="544">During this speech the two figures on the box were sporting with each other disgracefully .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had a spasm of envy . Granted that they wished to misbehave , it was pleasant for them to be able to do so . They were probably the only people enjoying the expedition . The carriage swept with agonizing jolts up through the Piazza of Fiesole and into the Settignano road .</p>
     <p n="545"><said who="#Lucy">“ Piano ! piano ! ”</said>said Mr . Eager , elegantly waving his hand over his head .</p>
     <p n="546"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ Va bene , signore , va bene , va bene , ”</said>crooned the driver , and whipped his horses up again .</p>
     <p n="547">Now Mr . Eager and<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>began to talk against each other on the subject of<persName>Alessio Baldovinetti</persName>. Was he a cause of the Renaissance , or was he one of its manifestations ? The other carriage was left behind . As the pace increased to a gallop the large , slumbering form of<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>was thrown against the chaplain with the regularity of a machine .</p>
     <p n="548"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Piano ! piano ! ”</said>said he , with a martyred look at<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="549">An extra lurch made him turn angrily in his seat .<persName corresp="#Phaethon">Phaethon</persName>, who for some time had been endeavouring to kiss<persName corresp="#Persephone">Persephone</persName>, had just succeeded .</p>
     <p n="550">A little scene ensued , which , as<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>said afterwards , was most unpleasant . The horses were stopped , the lovers were ordered to disentangle themselves , the boy was to lose his pourboire , the girl was immediately to get down .</p>
     <p n="551"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ She is my sister , ”</said>said he , turning round on them with piteous eyes .</p>
     <p n="552">Mr . Eager took the trouble to tell him that he was a liar .</p>
     <p n="553"><persName corresp="#Phaethon">Phaethon</persName>hung down his head , not at the matter of the accusation , but at its manner . At this point<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, whom the shock of stopping had awoke , declared that the lovers must on no account be separated , and patted them on the back to signify his approval . And<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, though unwilling to ally him , felt bound to support the cause of Bohemianism .</p>
     <p n="554"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Most certainly I would let them be , ”</said>she cried .<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ But I dare say I shall receive scant support . I have always flown in the face of the conventions all my life . This is what I call an adventure . ”</said></p>
     <p n="555"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ We must not submit , ”</said>said Mr . Eager .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I knew he was trying it on . He is treating us as if we were a party of Cook 's tourists . ”</said></p>
     <p n="556"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Surely no ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, her ardour visibly decreasing .</p>
     <p n="557">The other carriage had drawn up behind , and sensible<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave themselves properly .</p>
     <p n="558"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Leave them alone , ”</said><persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>begged the chaplain , of whom he stood in no awe .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Do we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the box when it happens to sit there ? To be driven by lovers — A king might envy us , and if we part them it 's more like sacrilege than anything I know . ”</said></p>
     <p n="559">Here the voice of<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>was heard saying that a crowd had begun to collect .</p>
     <p n="560">Mr . Eager , who suffered from an over-fluent tongue rather than a resolute will , was determined to make himself heard . He addressed the driver again . Italian in the mouth of Italians is a deep-voiced stream , with unexpected cataracts and boulders to preserve it from monotony . In Mr . Eager 's mouth it resembled nothing so much as an acid whistling fountain which played ever higher and higher , and quicker and quicker , and more and more shrilly , till abruptly it was turned off with a click .</p>
     <p n="561"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Signorina ! ”</said>said the man to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, when the display had ceased . Why should he appeal to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>?</p>
     <p n="562"><said who="#Persephone">“ Signorina ! ”</said>echoed<persName corresp="#Persephone">Persephone</persName>in her glorious contralto . She pointed at the other carriage . Why ?</p>
     <p n="563">For a moment the two girls looked at each other . Then<persName corresp="#Persephone">Persephone</persName>got down from the box .</p>
     <p n="564"><said who="#Persephone">“ Victory at last ! ”</said>said Mr . Eager , smiting his hands together as the carriages started again .</p>
     <p n="565"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ It is not victory , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ It is defeat . You have parted two people who were happy . ”</said></p>
     <p n="566">Mr . Eager shut his eyes . He was obliged to sit next to<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, but he would not speak to him . The old man was refreshed by sleep , and took up the matter warmly . He commanded<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>to agree with him ; he shouted for support to his son .</p>
     <p n="567"><said who="#Lucy">“ We have tried to buy what cannot be bought with money . He has bargained to drive us , and he is doing it . We have no rights over his soul . ”</said></p>
     <p n="568"><persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>frowned . It is hard when a person you have classed as typically British speaks out of his character .</p>
     <p n="569"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ He was not driving us well , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ He jolted us . ”</said></p>
     <p n="570"><said who="#Lucy">“ That I deny . It was as restful as sleeping . Aha ! he is jolting us now . Can you wonder ? He would like to throw us out , and most certainly he is justified . And if I were superstitious I 'd be frightened of the girl , too . It does n't do to injure young people . Have you ever heard of Lorenzo de Medici ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="571"><persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>bristled .</p>
     <p n="572"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Most certainly I have . Do you refer to Lorenzo il Magnifico , or to Lorenzo , Duke of Urbino , or to Lorenzo surnamed Lorenzino on account of his diminutive stature ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="573"><said who="#Lucy">“ The Lord knows . Possibly he does know , for I refer to Lorenzo the poet . He wrote a line — so I heard yesterday — which runs like this : ‘ Do n't go fighting against the Spring . ’ ”</said></p>
     <p n="574">Mr . Eager could not resist the opportunity for erudition .</p>
     <p n="575"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Non fate guerra al Maggio , ”</said>he murmured .<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ ‘ War not with the May ’ would render a correct meaning . ”</said></p>
     <p n="576"><said who="#Lucy">“ The point is , we have warred with it . Look . ”</said>He pointed to the Val d'Arno , which was visible far below them , through the budding trees .<said who="#Lucy">“ Fifty miles of Spring , and we 've come up to admire them . Do you suppose there 's any difference between Spring in nature and Spring in man ? But there we go , praising the one and condemning the other as improper , ashamed that the same work eternally through both . ”</said></p>
     <p n="577">No one encouraged him to talk . Presently Mr . Eager gave a signal for the carriages to stop and marshalled the party for their ramble on the hill . A hollow like a great amphitheatre , full of terraced steps and misty olives , now lay between them and the heights of Fiesole , and the road , still following its curve , was about to sweep on to a promontory which stood out in the plain . It was this promontory , uncultivated , wet , covered with bushes and occasional trees , which had caught the fancy of<persName>Alessio Baldovinetti</persName>nearly five hundred years before . He had ascended it , that diligent and rather obscure master , possibly with an eye to business , possibly for the joy of ascending . Standing there , he had seen that view of the Val d'Arno and distant Florence , which he afterwards had introduced not very effectively into his work . But where exactly had he stood ? That was the question which Mr . Eager hoped to solve now . And<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, whose nature was attracted by anything problematical , had become equally enthusiastic .</p>
     <p n="578">But it is not easy to carry the pictures of<persName>Alessio Baldovinetti</persName>in your head , even if you have remembered to look at them before starting . And the haze in the valley increased the difficulty of the quest .</p>
     <p n="579">The party sprang about from tuft to tuft of grass , their anxiety to keep together being only equalled by their desire to go different directions . Finally they split into groups .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>clung to<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>and<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>; the Emersons returned to hold laborious converse with the drivers ; while the two clergymen , who were expected to have topics in common , were left to each other .</p>
     <p n="580">The two elder ladies soon threw off the mask . In the audible whisper that was now so familiar to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>they began to discuss , not<persName>Alessio Baldovinetti</persName>, but the drive .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>had asked Mr.<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>what his profession was , and he had answered “ the railway . ” She was very sorry that she had asked him . She had no idea that it would be such a dreadful answer , or she would not have asked him .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>had turned the conversation so cleverly , and she hoped that the young man was not very much hurt at her asking him .</p>
     <p n="581"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ The railway ! ”</said>gasped<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Oh , but I shall die ! Of course it was the railway ! ”</said>She could not control her mirth .<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ He is the image of a porter — on , on the South-Eastern . ”</said></p>
     <p n="582"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“<persName corresp="#Eleanor">Eleanor</persName>, be quiet , ”</said>plucking at her vivacious companion .<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Hush ! They 'll hear — the Emersons — ”</said></p>
     <p n="583"><said who="#Eleanor">“ I can n't stop . Let me go my wicked way . A porter — ”</said></p>
     <p n="584"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“<persName corresp="#Eleanor">Eleanor</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="585"><said who="#Lucy">“ I 'm sure it 's all right , ”</said>put in<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.<said who="#Lucy">“ The Emersons wo n't hear , and they would n't mind if they did . ”</said></p>
     <p n="586"><persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>did not seem pleased at this .</p>
     <p n="587"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>listening ! ”</said>she said rather crossly .<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Pouf ! Wouf ! You naughty girl ! Go away ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="588"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, you ought to be with Mr . Eager , I 'm sure . ”</said></p>
     <p n="589"><said who="#Lucy">“ I can n't find them now , and I do n't want to either . ”</said></p>
     <p n="590"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Mr . Eager will be offended . It is your party . ”</said></p>
     <p n="591"><said who="#Lucy">“ Please , I 'd rather stop here with you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="592"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ No , I agree , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ It 's like a school feast ; the boys have got separated from the girls . Miss<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, you are to go . We wish to converse on high topics unsuited for your ear . ”</said></p>
     <p n="593">The girl was stubborn . As her time at Florence drew to its close she was only at ease amongst those to whom she felt indifferent . Such a one was<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, and such for the moment was<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>. She wished she had not called attention to herself ; they were both annoyed at her remark and seemed determined to get rid of her .</p>
     <p n="594"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ How tired one gets , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Oh , I do wish<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>and your mother could be here . ”</said></p>
     <p n="595">Unselfishness with<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>had entirely usurped the functions of enthusiasm .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>did not look at the view either . She would not enjoy anything till she was safe at Rome .</p>
     <p n="596"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Then sit you down , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Observe my foresight . ”</said></p>
     <p n="597">With many a smile she produced two of those mackintosh squares that protect the frame of the tourist from damp grass or cold marble steps . She sat on one ; who was to sit on the other ?</p>
     <p n="598"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>; without a moment 's doubt ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. The ground will do for me . Really I have not had rheumatism for years . If I do feel it coming on I shall stand . Imagine your mother 's feelings if I let you sit in the wet in your white linen . ”</said>She sat down heavily where the ground looked particularly moist .<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Here we are , all settled delightfully . Even if my dress is thinner it will not show so much , being brown . Sit down , dear ; you are too unselfish ; you do n't assert yourself enough . ”</said>She cleared her throat .<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Now do n't be alarmed ; this is n't a cold . It 's the tiniest cough , and I have had it three days . It 's nothing to do with sitting here at all . ”</said></p>
     <p n="599">There was only one way of treating the situation . At the end of five minutes<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>departed in search of<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>and Mr . Eager , vanquished by the mackintosh square .</p>
     <p n="600">She addressed herself to the drivers , who were sprawling in the carriages , perfuming the cushions with cigars . The miscreant , a bony young man scorched black by the sun , rose to greet her with the courtesy of a host and the assurance of a relative .</p>
     <p n="601"><said who="#Lucy">“ Dove ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, after much anxious thought .</p>
     <p n="602">His face lit up . Of course he knew where , Not so far either . His arm swept three-fourths of the horizon . He should just think he did know where . He pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them towards her , as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge .</p>
     <p n="603">More seemed necessary . What was the Italian for “ clergyman ” ?</p>
     <p n="604"><said who="#Lucy">“ Dove buoni uomini ? ”</said>said she at last .</p>
     <p n="605">Good ? Scarcely the adjective for those noble beings ! He showed her his cigar .</p>
     <p n="606"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Uno — piu — piccolo , ”</said>was her next remark , implying “ Has the cigar been given to you by<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, the smaller of the two good men ? ”</p>
     <p n="607">She was correct as usual . He tied the horse to a tree , kicked it to make it stay quiet , dusted the carriage , arranged his hair , remoulded his hat , encouraged his moustache , and in rather less than a quarter of a minute was ready to conduct her . Italians are born knowing the way . It would seem that the whole earth lay before them , not as a map , but as a chess-board , whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well as the squares . Any one can find places , but the finding of people is a gift from God .</p>
     <p n="608">He only stopped once , to pick her some great blue violets . She thanked him with real pleasure . In the company of this common man the world was beautiful and direct . For the first time she felt the influence of Spring . His arm swept the horizon gracefully ; violets , like other things , existed in great profusion there ;<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ would she like to see them ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="609"><said who="#Lucy">“ Ma buoni uomini . ”</said></p>
     <p n="610">He bowed . Certainly . Good men first , violets afterwards . They proceeded briskly through the undergrowth , which became thicker and thicker . They were nearing the edge of the promontory , and the view was stealing round them , but the brown network of the bushes shattered it into countless pieces . He was occupied in his cigar , and in holding back the pliant boughs . She was rejoicing in her escape from dullness . Not a step , not a twig , was unimportant to her .</p>
     <p n="611"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ What is that ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="612">There was a voice in the wood , in the distance behind them . The voice of Mr . Eager ? He shrugged his shoulders . An Italian 's ignorance is sometimes more remarkable than his knowledge . She could not make him understand that perhaps they had missed the clergymen . The view was forming at last ; she could discern the river , the golden plain , other hills .</p>
     <p n="613"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Eccolo ! ”</said>he exclaimed .</p>
     <p n="614">At the same moment the ground gave way , and with a cry she fell out of the wood . Light and beauty enveloped her . She had fallen on to a little open terrace , which was covered with violets from end to end .</p>
     <p n="615"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Courage ! ”</said>cried her companion , now standing some six feet above .<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Courage and love . ”</said></p>
     <p n="616">She did not answer . From her feet the ground sloped sharply into view , and violets ran down in rivulets and streams and cataracts , irrigating the hillside with blue , eddying round the tree stems collecting into pools in the hollows , covering the grass with spots of azure foam . But never again were they in such profusion ; this terrace was the well-head , the primal source whence beauty gushed out to water the earth .</p>
     <p n="617">Standing at its brink , like a swimmer who prepares , was the good man . But he was not the good man that she had expected , and he was alone .</p>
     <p n="618"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>had turned at the sound of her arrival . For a moment he contemplated her , as one who had fallen out of heaven . He saw radiant joy in her face , he saw the flowers beat against her dress in blue waves . The bushes above them closed . He stepped quickly forward and kissed her .</p>
     <p n="619">Before she could speak , almost before she could feel , a voice called ,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>!<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>!<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! ”</said>The silence of life had been broken by<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>who stood brown against the view .</p>

     <head type="chapter">Chapter VII : They Return</head>
     <p n="620">Some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the afternoon . What it was and exactly how the players had sided ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was slow to discover . Mr . Eager had met them with a questioning eye .<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>had repulsed him with much small talk .<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, seeking his son , was told whereabouts to find him .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, who wore the heated aspect of a neutral , was bidden to collect the factions for the return home . There was a general sense of groping and bewilderment . Pan had been amongst them — not the great god Pan , who has been buried these two thousand years , but the little god Pan , who presides over social contretemps and unsuccessful picnics .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>had lost every one , and had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a pleasant surprise .<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>had lost<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had lost Mr . Eager .<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>had lost<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>.<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>had lost a mackintosh square .<persName corresp="#Phaethon">Phaethon</persName>had lost the game .</p>
     <p n="621">That last fact was undeniable . He climbed on to the box shivering , with his collar up , prophesying the swift approach of bad weather .<said who="#Phaethon">“ Let us go immediately , ”</said>he told them .<said who="#Phaethon">“ The signorino will walk . ”</said></p>
     <p n="622"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ All the way ? He will be hours , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>.</p>
     <p n="623"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Apparently . I told him it was unwise . ”</said>He would look no one in the face ; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him . He alone had played skilfully , using the whole of his instinct , while the others had used scraps of their intelligence . He alone had divined what things were , and what he wished them to be . He alone had interpreted the message that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had received five days before from the lips of a dying man .<persName corresp="#Persephone">Persephone</persName>, who spends half her life in the grave — she could interpret it also . Not so these English . They gain knowledge slowly , and perhaps too late .</p>
     <p n="624">The thoughts of a cab-driver , however just , seldom affect the lives of his employers . He was the most competent of<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>'s opponents , but infinitely the least dangerous . Once back in the town , he and his insight and his knowledge would trouble English ladies no more . Of course , it was most unpleasant ; she had seen his black head in the bushes ; he might make a tavern story out of it . But after all , what have we to do with taverns ? Real menace belongs to the drawing-room . It was of drawing-room people that<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>thought as she journeyed downwards towards the fading sun .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>sat beside her ; Mr . Eager sat opposite , trying to catch her eye ; he was vaguely suspicious . They spoke of<persName>Alessio Baldovinetti</persName>.</p>
     <p n="625">Rain and darkness came on together . The two ladies huddled together under an inadequate parasol . There was a lightning flash , and<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>who was nervous , screamed from the carriage in front . At the next flash ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>screamed also . Mr . Eager addressed her professionally :</p>
     <p n="626"><said who="#Lucy">“ Courage ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, courage and faith . If I might say so , there is something almost blasphemous in this horror of the elements . Are we seriously to suppose that all these clouds , all this immense electrical display , is simply called into existence to extinguish you or me ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="627"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ No — of course — ”</said></p>
     <p n="628"><said who="#Lucy">“ Even from the scientific standpoint the chances against our being struck are enormous . The steel knives , the only articles which might attract the current , are in the other carriage . And , in any case , we are infinitely safer than if we were walking . Courage — courage and faith . ”</said></p>
     <p n="629">Under the rug ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>felt the kindly pressure of her cousin 's hand . At times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it afterwards .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, by this timely exercise of her muscles , gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross examination .</p>
     <p n="630">She renewed it when the two carriages stopped , half into Florence .</p>
     <p n="631"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Mr . Eager ! ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ We want your assistance . Will you interpret for us ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="632"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Ask your driver which way<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>went . The boy may lose his way . He may be killed . ”</said></p>
     <p n="633"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Go , Mr . Eager , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ do n't ask our driver ; our driver is no help . Go and support poor<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>—, he is nearly demented . ”</said></p>
     <p n="634"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ He may be killed ! ”</said>cried the old man .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ He may be killed ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="635"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Typical behaviour , ”</said>said the chaplain , as he quitted the carriage .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ In the presence of reality that kind of person invariably breaks down . ”</said></p>
     <p n="636"><said who="#Lucy">“ What does he know ? ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>as soon as they were alone .<said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, how much does Mr . Eager know ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="637"><said who="#Charlotte">“ Nothing , dearest ; he knows nothing . But — ”</said>she pointed at the driver - “ HE knows everything . Dearest , had we better ? Shall I ? ” She took out her purse .<said who="#Phaethon">“ It is dreadful to be entangled with low-class people . He saw it all . ”</said>Tapping<persName corresp="#Phaethon">Phaethon</persName>'s back with her guide-book , she said ,<said who="#Phaethon">“ Silenzio ! ”</said>and offered him a franc .</p>
     <p n="638"><said who="#Phaethon">“ Va bene , ”</said>he replied , and accepted it . As well this ending to his day as any . But<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, a mortal maid , was disappointed in him .</p>
     <p n="639">There was an explosion up the road . The storm had struck the overhead wire of the tramline , and one of the great supports had fallen . If they had not stopped perhaps they might have been hurt . They chose to regard it as a miraculous preservation , and the floods of love and sincerity , which fructify every hour of life , burst forth in tumult . They descended from the carriages ; they embraced each other . It was as joyful to be forgiven past unworthinesses as to forgive them . For a moment they realized vast possibilities of good .</p>
     <p n="640">The older people recovered quickly . In the very height of their emotion they knew it to be unmanly or unladylike .<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>calculated that , even if they had continued , they would not have been caught in the accident . Mr . Eager mumbled a temperate prayer . But the drivers , through miles of dark squalid road , poured out their souls to the dryads and the saints , and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>poured out hers to her cousin .</p>
     <p n="641"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, dear<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, kiss me . Kiss me again . Only you can understand me . You warned me to be careful . And I — I thought I was developing . ”</said></p>
     <p n="642"><said who="#Charlotte">“ Do not cry , dearest . Take your time . ”</said></p>
     <p n="643"><said who="#Lucy">“ I have been obstinate and silly — worse than you know , far worse . Once by the river — Oh , but he is n't killed — he would n't be killed , would he ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="644">The thought disturbed her repentance . As a matter of fact , the storm was worst along the road ; but she had been near danger , and so she thought it must be near to every one .</p>
     <p n="645"><said who="#Lucy">“ I trust not . One would always pray against that . ”</said></p>
     <p n="646"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ He is really — I think he was taken by surprise , just as I was before . But this time I 'm not to blame ; I want you to believe that . I simply slipped into those violets . No , I want to be really truthful . I am a little to blame . I had silly thoughts . The sky , you know , was gold , and the ground all blue , and for a moment he looked like some one in a book . ”</said></p>
     <p n="647"><said who="#Lucy">“ In a book ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="648"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Heroes — gods — the nonsense of schoolgirls . ”</said></p>
     <p n="649"><said who="#Lucy">“ And then ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="650"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ But ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, you know what happened then . ”</said></p>
     <p n="651"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>was silent . Indeed , she had little more to learn . With a certain amount of insight she drew her young cousin affectionately to her . All the way back<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s body was shaken by deep sighs , which nothing could repress .</p>
     <p n="652"><said who="#Lucy">“ I want to be truthful , ”</said>she whispered .<said who="#Lucy">“ It is so hard to be absolutely truthful . ”</said></p>
     <p n="653"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Do n't be troubled , dearest . Wait till you are calmer . We will talk it over before bed-time in my room . ”</said></p>
     <p n="654">So they re-entered the city with hands clasped . It was a shock to the girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others . The storm had ceased , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>was easier about his son .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>had regained good humour , and Mr . Eager was already snubbing<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>.<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>alone she was sure of —<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, whose exterior concealed so much insight and love .</p>
     <p n="655">The luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long evening . She thought not so much of what had happened as of how she should describe it . All her sensations , her spasms of courage , her moments of unreasonable joy , her mysterious discontent , should be carefully laid before her cousin . And together in divine confidence they would disentangle and interpret them all .</p>
     <p n="656"><said who="#Charlotte">“ At last , ”</said>thought she ,<said who="#Charlotte">“ I shall understand myself . I sha n't again be troubled by things that come out of nothing , and mean I do n't know what . ”</said></p>
     <p n="657"><persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>asked her to play . She refused vehemently . Music seemed to her the employment of a child . She sat close to her cousin , who , with commendable patience , was listening to a long story about lost luggage . When it was over she capped it by a story of her own .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>became rather hysterical with the delay . In vain she tried to check , or at all events to accelerate , the tale . It was not till a late hour that<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>had recovered her luggage and could say in her usual tone of gentle reproach :</p>
     <p n="658"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Well , dear , I at all events am ready for Bedfordshire . Come into my room , and I will give a good brush to your hair . ”</said></p>
     <p n="659">With some solemnity the door was shut , and a cane chair placed for the girl . Then<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>said “ So what is to be done ? ”</p>
     <p n="660">She was unprepared for the question . It had not occurred to her that she would have to do anything . A detailed exhibition of her emotions was all that she had counted upon .</p>
     <p n="661"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ What is to be done ? A point , dearest , which you alone can settle . ”</said></p>
     <p n="662">The rain was streaming down the black windows , and the great room felt damp and chilly , One candle burnt trembling on the chest of drawers close to<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>'s toque , which cast monstrous and fantastic shadows on the bolted door . A tram roared by in the dark , and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>felt unaccountably sad , though she had long since dried her eyes . She lifted them to the ceiling , where the griffins and bassoons were colourless and vague , the very ghosts of joy .</p>
     <p n="663"><said who="#Lucy">“ It has been raining for nearly four hours , ”</said>she said at last .</p>
     <p n="664"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>ignored the remark .</p>
     <p n="665"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ How do you propose to silence him ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="666"><said who="#Lucy">“ The driver ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="667"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ My dear girl , no ; Mr.<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="668"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>began to pace up and down the room .</p>
     <p n="669"><said who="#Lucy">“ I do n't understand , ”</said>she said at last .</p>
     <p n="670">She understood very well , but she no longer wished to be absolutely truthful .</p>
     <p n="671"><said who="#Lucy">“ How are you going to stop him talking about it ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="672"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I have a feeling that talk is a thing he will never do . ”</said></p>
     <p n="673"><said who="#Lucy">“ I , too , intend to judge him charitably . But unfortunately I have met the type before . They seldom keep their exploits to themselves . ”</said></p>
     <p n="674"><said who="#Lucy">“ Exploits ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, wincing under the horrible plural .</p>
     <p n="675"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ My poor dear , did you suppose that this was his first ? Come here and listen to me . I am only gathering it from his own remarks . Do you remember that day at lunch when he argued with<persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>that liking one person is an extra reason for liking another ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="676"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, whom at the time the argument had pleased .</p>
     <p n="677"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Well , I am no prude . There is no need to call him a wicked young man , but obviously he is thoroughly unrefined . Let us put it down to his deplorable antecedents and education , if you wish . But we are no farther on with our question . What do you propose to do ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="678">An idea rushed across<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s brain , which , had she thought of it sooner and made it part of her , might have proved victorious .</p>
     <p n="679"><said who="#Lucy">“ I propose to speak to him , ”</said>said she .</p>
     <p n="680"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>uttered a cry of genuine alarm .</p>
     <p n="681"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ You see ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, your kindness — I shall never forget it . But — as you said — it is my affair . Mine and his . ”</said></p>
     <p n="682"><said who="#Charlotte">“ And you are going to IMPLORE him , to BEG him to keep silence ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="683"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Certainly not . There would be no difficulty . Whatever you ask him he answers , yes or no ; then it is over . I have been frightened of him . But now I am not one little bit . ”</said></p>
     <p n="684"><said who="#Charlotte">“ But we fear him for you , dear . You are so young and inexperienced , you have lived among such nice people , that you cannot realize what men can be — how they can take a brutal pleasure in insulting a woman whom her sex does not protect and rally round . This afternoon , for example , if I had not arrived , what would have happened ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="685"><said who="#Lucy">“ I can n't think , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>gravely .</p>
     <p n="686">Something in her voice made<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>repeat her question , intoning it more vigorously .</p>
     <p n="687"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ What would have happened if I had n't arrived ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="688"><said who="#Lucy">“ I can n't think , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>again .</p>
     <p n="689"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ When he insulted you , how would you have replied ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="690"><said who="#Lucy">“ I had n't time to think . You came . ”</said></p>
     <p n="691"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Yes , but wo n't you tell me now what you would have done ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="692"><said who="#Lucy">“ I should have — ”</said>She checked herself , and broke the sentence off . She went up to the dripping window and strained her eyes into the darkness . She could not think what she would have done .</p>
     <p n="693"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Come away from the window , dear , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ You will be seen from the road . ”</said></p>
     <p n="694"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>obeyed . She was in her cousin 's power . She could not modulate out the key of self-abasement in which she had started . Neither of them referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>and settle the matter , whatever it was , with him .</p>
     <p n="695"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>became plaintive .</p>
     <p n="696"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Oh , for a real man ! We are only two women , you and I.<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>is hopeless . There is Mr . Eager , but you do not trust him . Oh , for your brother ! He is young , but I know that his sister 's insult would rouse in him a very lion . Thank God , chivalry is not yet dead . There are still left some men who can reverence woman . ”</said></p>
     <p n="697">As she spoke , she pulled off her rings , of which she wore several , and ranged them upon the pin cushion . Then she blew into her gloves and said :</p>
     <p n="698"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ It will be a push to catch the morning train , but we must try . ”</said></p>
     <p n="699"><said who="#Lucy">“ What train ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="700"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ The train to Rome . ”</said>She looked at her gloves critically .</p>
     <p n="701">The girl received the announcement as easily as it had been given .</p>
     <p n="702"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ When does the train to Rome go ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="703"><said who="#Lucy">“ At eight . ”</said></p>
     <p n="704"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Signora Bertolini would be upset . ”</said></p>
     <p n="705"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ We must face that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, not liking to say that she had given notice already .</p>
     <p n="706"><said who="#Lucy">“ She will make us pay for a whole week 's pension . ”</said></p>
     <p n="707"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I expect she will . However , we shall be much more comfortable at the Vyses ’ hotel . Is n't afternoon tea given there for nothing ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="708"><said who="#Charlotte">“ Yes , but they pay extra for wine . ”</said>After this remark she remained motionless and silent . To her tired eyes<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>throbbed and swelled like a ghostly figure in a dream .</p>
     <p n="709">They began to sort their clothes for packing , for there was no time to lose , if they were to catch the train to Rome .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, when admonished , began to move to and fro between the rooms , more conscious of the discomforts of packing by candlelight than of a subtler ill.<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, who was practical without ability , knelt by the side of an empty trunk , vainly endeavouring to pave it with books of varying thickness and size . She gave two or three sighs , for the stooping posture hurt her back , and , for all her diplomacy , she felt that she was growing old . The girl heard her as she entered the room , and was seized with one of those emotional impulses to which she could never attribute a cause . She only felt that the candle would burn better , the packing go easier , the world be happier , if she could give and receive some human love . The impulse had come before to-day , but never so strongly . She knelt down by her cousin 's side and took her in her arms .</p>
     <p n="710"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>returned the embrace with tenderness and warmth . But she was not a stupid woman , and she knew perfectly well that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>did not love her , but needed her to love . For it was in ominous tones that she said , after a long pause :</p>
     <p n="711"><said>“ Dearest<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, how will you ever forgive me ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="712"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was on her guard at once , knowing by bitter experience what forgiving<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>meant . Her emotion relaxed , she modified her embrace a little , and she said :</p>
     <p n="713"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>dear , what do you mean ? As if I have anything to forgive ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="714"><said who="#Lucy">“ You have a great deal , and I have a very great deal to forgive myself , too . I know well how much I vex you at every turn . ”</said></p>
     <p n="715"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ But no — ”</said></p>
     <p n="716"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>assumed her favourite role , that of the prematurely aged martyr .</p>
     <p n="717"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Ah , but yes ! I feel that our tour together is hardly the success I had hoped . I might have known it would not do . You want some one younger and stronger and more in sympathy with you . I am too uninteresting and old-fashioned — only fit to pack and unpack your things . ”</said></p>
     <p n="718"><said who="#Lucy">“ Please — ”</said></p>
     <p n="719"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ My only consolation was that you found people more to your taste , and were often able to leave me at home . I had my own poor ideas of what a lady ought to do , but I hope I did not inflict them on you more than was necessary . You had your own way about these rooms , at all events . ”</said></p>
     <p n="720"><said who="#Lucy">“ You must n't say these things , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>softly .</p>
     <p n="721">She still clung to the hope that she and<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>loved each other , heart and soul . They continued to pack in silence .</p>
     <p n="722"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I have been a failure , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, as she struggled with the straps of<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s trunk instead of strapping her own .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Failed to make you happy ; failed in my duty to your mother . She has been so generous to me ; I shall never face her again after this disaster . ”</said></p>
     <p n="723"><said who="#Lucy">“ But mother will understand . It is not your fault , this trouble , and it is n't a disaster either . ”</said></p>
     <p n="724"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ It is my fault , it is a disaster . She will never forgive me , and rightly . Fur instance , what right had I to make friends with<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>? ”</said></p>
     <p n="725"><said who="#Lucy">“ Every right . ”</said></p>
     <p n="726"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ When I was here for your sake ? If I have vexed you it is equally true that I have neglected you . Your mother will see this as clearly as I do , when you tell her . ”</said></p>
     <p n="727"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, from a cowardly wish to improve the situation , said :</p>
     <p n="728"><said who="#Lucy">“ Why need mother hear of it ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="729"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ But you tell her everything ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="730"><said who="#Lucy">“ I suppose I do generally . ”</said></p>
     <p n="731"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I dare not break your confidence . There is something sacred in it . Unless you feel that it is a thing you could not tell her . ”</said></p>
     <p n="732">The girl would not be degraded to this .</p>
     <p n="733"><said who="#Lucy">“ Naturally I should have told her . But in case she should blame you in any way , I promise I will not , I am very willing not to . I will never speak of it either to her or to any one . ”</said></p>
     <p n="734">Her promise brought the long-drawn interview to a sudden close .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>pecked her smartly on both cheeks , wished her good-night , and sent her to her own room .</p>
     <p n="735">For a moment the original trouble was in the background .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>would seem to have behaved like a cad throughout ; perhaps that was the view which one would take eventually . At present she neither acquitted nor condemned him ; she did not pass judgment . At the moment when she was about to judge him her cousin 's voice had intervened , and , ever since , it was<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>who had dominated ;<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>who , even now , could be heard sighing into a crack in the partition wall ;<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, who had really been neither pliable nor humble nor inconsistent . She had worked like a great artist ; for a time — indeed , for years — she had been meaningless , but at the end there was presented to the girl the complete picture of a cheerless , loveless world in which the young rush to destruction until they learn better — a shamefaced world of precautions and barriers which may avert evil , but which do not seem to bring good , if we may judge from those who have used them most .</p>
     <p n="736"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was suffering from the most grievous wrong which this world has yet discovered : diplomatic advantage had been taken of her sincerity , of her craving for sympathy and love . Such a wrong is not easily forgotten . Never again did she expose herself without due consideration and precaution against rebuff . And such a wrong may react disastrously upon the soul .</p>
     <p n="737">The door-bell rang , and she started to the shutters . Before she reached them she hesitated , turned , and blew out the candle . Thus it was that , though she saw some one standing in the wet below , he , though he looked up , did not see her .</p>
     <p n="738">To reach his room he had to go by hers . She was still dressed . It struck her that she might slip into the passage and just say that she would be gone before he was up , and that their extraordinary intercourse was over .</p>
     <p n="739">Whether she would have dared to do this was never proved . At the critical moment<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>opened her own door , and her voice said :</p>
     <p n="740"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I wish one word with you in the drawing-room ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, please . ”</said></p>
     <p n="741">Soon their footsteps returned , and<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>said :<said who="#Lucy">“ Good-night ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="742">His heavy , tired breathing was the only reply ; the chaperon had done her work .</p>
     <p n="743"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>cried aloud :<said who="#Lucy">“ It is n't true . It can n't all be true . I want not to be muddled . I want to grow older quickly . ”</said></p>

     <p n="747">The drawing-room curtains at Windy Corner had been pulled to meet , for the carpet was new and deserved protection from the August sun . They were heavy curtains , reaching almost to the ground , and the light that filtered through them was subdued and varied . A poet — none was present — might have quoted , “ Life like a dome of many coloured glass , ” or might have compared the curtains to sluice-gates , lowered against the intolerable tides of heaven . Without was poured a sea of radiance ; within , the glory , though visible , was tempered to the capacities of man .</p>
     <p n="748">Two pleasant people sat in the room . One — a boy of nineteen — was studying a small manual of anatomy , and peering occasionally at a bone which lay upon the piano . From time to time he bounced in his chair and puffed and groaned , for the day was hot and the print small , and the human frame fearfully made ; and his mother , who was writing a letter , did continually read out to him what she had written . And continually did she rise from her seat and part the curtains so that a rivulet of light fell across the carpet , and make the remark that they were still there .</p>
     <p n="749"><said who="#Freddy">“ Where are n't they ? ”</said>said the boy , who was<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s brother .<said who="#Freddy">“ I tell you I 'm getting fairly sick . ”</said></p>
     <p n="750"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ For goodness ’ sake go out of my drawing-room , then ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, who hoped to cure her children of slang by taking it literally .</p>
     <p n="751"><persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>did not move or reply .</p>
     <p n="752"><said who="#Freddy">“ I think things are coming to a head , ”</said>she observed , rather wanting her son 's opinion on the situation if she could obtain it without undue supplication .</p>
     <p n="753"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Time they did . ”</said></p>
     <p n="754"><said who="#Freddy">“ I am glad that<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>is asking her this once more . ”</said></p>
     <p n="755"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ It 's his third go , is n't it ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="756"><said>“<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>I do call the way you talk unkind . ”</said></p>
     <p n="757"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I did n't mean to be unkind . ”</said>Then he added :<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ But I do think<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>might have got this off her chest in Italy . I do n't know how girls manage things , but she can n't have said ‘ No ’ properly before , or she would n't have to say it again now . Over the whole thing — I can n't explain — I do feel so uncomfortable . ”</said></p>
     <p n="758"><said who="#Freddy">“ Do you indeed , dear ? How interesting ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="759"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I feel — never mind . ”</said></p>
     <p n="760">He returned to his work .</p>
     <p n="761"><said who="#Freddy">“ Just listen to what I have written to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>. I said : ‘ Dear<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>. ’ ”</said></p>
     <p n="762"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Yes , mother , you told me . A jolly good letter . ”</said></p>
     <p n="763"><said who="#Freddy">“ I said : ‘ Dear<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted , if<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>wishes it . But — ’ ”</said>She stopped reading ,<said who="#Freddy">“ I was rather amused at<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>asking my permission at all . He has always gone in for unconventionality , and parents nowhere , and so forth . When it comes to the point , he can n't get on without me . ”</said></p>
     <p n="764"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Nor me . ”</said></p>
     <p n="765"><said who="#Freddy">“ You ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="766"><persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>nodded .</p>
     <p n="767"><said who="#Freddy">“ What do you mean ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="768"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ He asked me for my permission also . ”</said></p>
     <p n="769">She exclaimed :<said who="#Freddy">“ How very odd of him ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="770"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Why so ? ”</said>asked the son and heir .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Why should n't my permission be asked ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="771"><said who="#Freddy">“ What do you know about<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>or girls or anything ? What ever did you say ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="772"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I said to<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, ‘ Take her or leave her ; it 's no business of mine ! ’ ”</said></p>
     <p n="773"><said who="#Freddy">“ What a helpful answer ! ”</said>But her own answer , though more normal in its wording , had been to the same effect .</p>
     <p n="774"><said who="#Freddy">“ The bother is this , ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="775">Then he took up his work again , too shy to say what the bother was .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>went back to the window .</p>
     <p n="776"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, you must come . There they still are ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="777"><said who="#Freddy">“ I do n't see you ought to go peeping like that . ”</said></p>
     <p n="778"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Peeping like that ! Ca n't I look out of my own window ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="779">But she returned to the writing-table , observing , as she passed her son ,<said who="#Freddy">“ Still page 322 ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>snorted , and turned over two leaves . For a brief space they were silent . Close by , beyond the curtains , the gentle murmur of a long conversation had never ceased .</p>
     <p n="780"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ The bother is this : I have put my foot in it with<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>most awfully . ”</said>He gave a nervous gulp .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Not content with ‘ permission ’ , which I did give — that is to say , I said , ‘ I do n't mind ’ — well , not content with that , he wanted to know whether I was n't off my head with joy . He practically put it like this : Was n't it a splendid thing for<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>and for Windy Corner generally if he married her ? And he would have an answer — he said it would strengthen his hand . ”</said></p>
     <p n="781"><said who="#Freddy">“ I hope you gave a careful answer , dear . ”</said></p>
     <p n="782"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I answered ‘ No ’ ”</said>said the boy , grinding his teeth .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ There ! Fly into a stew ! I can n't help it — had to say it . I had to say no . He ought never to have asked me . ”</said></p>
     <p n="783"><said who="#Freddy">“ Ridiculous child ! ”</said>cried his mother .<said who="#Freddy">“ You think you 're so holy and truthful , but really it 's only abominable conceit . Do you suppose that a man like<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>would take the slightest notice of anything you say ? I hope he boxed your ears . How dare you say no ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="784"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Oh , do keep quiet , mother ! I had to say no when I could n't say yes . I tried to laugh as if I did n't mean what I said , and , as<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>laughed too , and went away , it may be all right . But I feel my foot 's in it . Oh , do keep quiet , though , and let a man do some work . ”</said></p>
     <p n="785"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, with the air of one who has considered the subject ,<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I shall not keep quiet . You know all that has passed between them in Rome ; you know why he is down here , and yet you deliberately insult him , and try to turn him out of my house . ”</said></p>
     <p n="786"><said who="#Freddy">“ Not a bit ! ”</said>he pleaded .<said who="#Freddy">“ I only let out I did n't like him . I do n't hate him , but I do n't like him . What I mind is that he 'll tell<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="787">He glanced at the curtains dismally .</p>
     <p n="788"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Well , I like him , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I know his mother ; he 's good , he 's clever , he 's rich , he 's well connected — Oh , you need n't kick the piano ! He 's well connected — I 'll say it again if you like : he 's well connected . ”</said>She paused , as if rehearsing her eulogy , but her face remained dissatisfied . She added :<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ And he has beautiful manners . ”</said></p>
     <p n="789"><said who="#Freddy">“ I liked him till just now . I suppose it 's having him spoiling<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s first week at home ; and it 's also something that<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>said , not knowing . ”</said></p>
     <p n="790"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>? ”</said>said his mother , trying to conceal her interest .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I do n't see how<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>comes in . ”</said></p>
     <p n="791"><said who="#Freddy">“ You know<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s funny way , when you never quite know what he means . He said : ‘<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>is an ideal bachelor . ’ I was very cute , I asked him what he meant . He said ‘ Oh , he 's like me — better detached . ’ I could n't make him say any more , but it set me thinking . Since<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>has come after<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>he has n't been so pleasant , at least — I can n't explain . ”</said></p>
     <p n="792"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ You never can , dear . But I can . You are jealous of<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>because he may stop<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>knitting you silk ties . ”</said></p>
     <p n="793">The explanation seemed plausible , and<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>tried to accept it . But at the back of his brain there lurked a dim mistrust .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>praised one too much for being athletic . Was that it ?<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>made one talk in one 's own way . This tired one . Was that it ? And<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>was the kind of fellow who would never wear another fellow 's cap . Unaware of his own profundity ,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>checked himself . He must be jealous , or he would not dislike a man for such foolish reasons .</p>
     <p n="794"><said who="#Freddy">“ Will this do ? ”</said>called his mother .<said who="#Freddy">“ ‘ Dear<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>,—<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted if<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>wishes it . ’ Then I put in at the top , ‘ and I have told<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>so . ’ I must write the letter out again — ‘ and I have told<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>so . But<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>seems very uncertain , and in these days young people must decide for themselves . ’ I said that because I did n't want<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>to think us old-fashioned . She goes in for lectures and improving her mind , and all the time a thick layer of flue under the beds , and the maid 's dirty thumb-marks where you turn on the electric light . She keeps that flat abominably — ”</said></p>
     <p n="795"><said who="#Freddy">“ Suppose<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>marries<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, would she live in a flat , or in the country ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="796"><said who="#Cecil">“ Do n't interrupt so foolishly . Where was I ? Oh yes — ‘ Young people must decide for themselves . I know that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>likes your son , because she tells me everything , and she wrote to me from Rome when he asked her first . ’ No , I 'll cross that last bit out — it looks patronizing . I 'll stop at ‘ because she tells me everything . ’ Or shall I cross that out , too ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="797"><said who="#Freddy">“ Cross it out , too , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="798"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>left it in .</p>
     <p n="799"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Then the whole thing runs : ‘ Dear Mrs .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Vyse</persName>.—<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>has just asked my permission about it , and I should be delighted if<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>wishes it , and I have told<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>so . But<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>seems very uncertain , and in these days young people must decide for themselves . I know that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>likes your son , because she tells me everything . But I do not know — ’ ”</said></p>
     <p n="800"><said who="#Freddy">“ Look out ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="801">The curtains parted .</p>
     <p n="802"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s first movement was one of irritation . He could n't bear the<persName corresp="#Freddy">Honeychurch</persName>habit of sitting in the dark to save the furniture . Instinctively he give the curtains a twitch , and sent them swinging down their poles . Light entered . There was revealed a terrace , such as is owned by many villas with trees each side of it , and on it a little rustic seat , and two flower-beds . But it was transfigured by the view beyond , for Windy Corner was built on the range that overlooks the Sussex Weald .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, who was in the little seat , seemed on the edge of a green magic carpet which hovered in the air above the tremulous world .</p>
     <p n="803"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>entered .</p>
     <p n="804">Appearing thus late in the story ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>must be at once described . He was medieval . Like a Gothic statue . Tall and refined , with shoulders that seemed braced square by an effort of the will , and a head that was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision , he resembled those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a French cathedral . Well educated , well endowed , and not deficient physically , he remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows as self-consciousness , and whom the medieval , with dimmer vision , worshipped as asceticism . A Gothic statue implies celibacy , just as a Greek statue implies fruition , and perhaps this was what<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>meant . And<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, who ignored history and art , perhaps meant the same when he failed to imagine<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>wearing another fellow 's cap .</p>
     <p n="805"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>left her letter on the writing table and moved towards her young acquaintance .</p>
     <p n="806"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>! ”</said>she exclaimed —<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ oh ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, do tell me ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="807"><said who="#Cecil">“ I promessi sposi , ”</said>said he .</p>
     <p n="808">They stared at him anxiously .</p>
     <p n="809"><said who="#Cecil">“ She has accepted me , ”</said>he said , and the sound of the thing in English made him flush and smile with pleasure , and look more human .</p>
     <p n="810"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I am so glad , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, while<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>proffered a hand that was yellow with chemicals . They wished that they also knew Italian , for our phrases of approval and of amazement are so connected with little occasions that we fear to use them on great ones . We are obliged to become vaguely poetic , or to take refuge in Scriptural reminiscences .</p>
     <p n="811"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Welcome as one of the family ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, waving her hand at the furniture .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ This is indeed a joyous day ! I feel sure that you will make our dear<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>happy . ”</said></p>
     <p n="812"><said who="#Freddy">“ I hope so , ”</said>replied the young man , shifting his eyes to the ceiling .</p>
     <p n="813"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ We mothers — ”</said>simpered<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, and then realized that she was affected , sentimental , bombastic — all the things she hated most . Why could she not be<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, who stood stiff in the middle of the room ; looking very cross and almost handsome ?</p>
     <p n="814"><said who="#Cecil">“ I say ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, for conversation seemed to flag .</p>
     <p n="815"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>rose from the seat . She moved across the lawn and smiled in at them , just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis . Then she saw her brother 's face . Her lips parted , and she took him in her arms . He said ,<said who="#Lucy">“ Steady on ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="816"><said who="#Cecil">“ Not a kiss for me ? ”</said>asked her mother .</p>
     <p n="817"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>kissed her also .</p>
     <p n="818"><said who="#Cecil">“ Would you take them into the garden and tell<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>all about it ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>suggested .<said who="#Cecil">“ And I 'd stop here and tell my mother . ”</said></p>
     <p n="819"><said who="#Freddy">“ We go with<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, as if taking orders .</p>
     <p n="820"><said who="#Cecil">“ Yes , you go with<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="821">They passed into the sunlight .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>watched them cross the terrace , and descend out of sight by the steps . They would descend — he knew their ways — past the shrubbery , and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed , until they reached the kitchen garden , and there , in the presence of the potatoes and the peas , the great event would be discussed .</p>
     <p n="822">Smiling indulgently , he lit a cigarette , and rehearsed the events that had led to such a happy conclusion .</p>
     <p n="823">He had known<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>for several years , but only as a commonplace girl who happened to be musical . He could still remember his depression that afternoon at Rome , when she and her terrible cousin fell on him out of the blue , and demanded to be taken to St. Peter 's . That day she had seemed a typical tourist — shrill , crude , and gaunt with travel . But Italy worked some marvel in her . It gave her light , and — which he held more precious — it gave her shadow . Soon he detected in her a wonderful reticence . She was like a woman of<persName corresp="#Leonardo">Leonardo</persName>da Vinci 's , whom we love not so much for herself as for the things that she will not tell us , The things are assuredly not of this life ; no woman of<persName corresp="#Leonardo">Leonardo</persName>'s could have anything so vulgar as a “ story . ” She did develop most wonderfully day by day .</p>
     <p n="824">So it happened that from patronizing civility he had slowly passed if not to passion , at least to a profound uneasiness . Already at Rome he had hinted to her that they might be suitable for each other . It had touched him greatly that she had not broken away at the suggestion . Her refusal had been clear and gentle ; after it — as the horrid phrase went — she had been exactly the same to him as before . Three months later , on the margin of Italy , among the flower-clad Alps , he had asked her again in bald , traditional language . She reminded him of a<persName corresp="#Leonardo">Leonardo</persName>more than ever ; her sunburnt features were shadowed by fantastic rock ; at his words she had turned and stood between him and the light with immeasurable plains behind her . He walked home with her unashamed , feeling not at all like a rejected suitor . The things that really mattered were unshaken .</p>
     <p n="825">So now he had asked her once more , and , clear and gentle as ever , she had accepted him , giving no coy reasons for her delay , but simply saying that she loved him and would do her best to make him happy . His mother , too , would be pleased ; she had counselled the step ; he must write her a long account .</p>
     <p n="826">Glancing at his hand , in case any of<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>'s chemicals had come off on it , he moved to the writing table . There he saw “ Dear<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>, ” followed by many erasures . He recoiled without reading any more , and after a little hesitation sat down elsewhere , and pencilled a note on his knee .</p>
     <p n="827">Then he lit another cigarette , which did not seem quite as divine as the first , and considered what might be done to make Windy Corner drawing-room more distinctive . With that outlook it should have been a successful room , but the trail of Tottenham Court Road was upon it ; he could almost visualize the motor-vans of Messrs. Shoolbred and Messrs . Maple arriving at the door and depositing this chair , those varnished book-cases , that writing-table . The table recalled<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>'s letter . He did not want to read that letter — his temptations never lay in that direction ; but he worried about it none the less . It was his own fault that she was discussing him with his mother ; he had wanted her support in his third attempt to win<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>; he wanted to feel that others , no matter who they were , agreed with him , and so he had asked their permission .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>had been civil , but obtuse in essentials , while as for<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>— “ He is only a boy , ” he reflected .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I represent all that he despises . Why should he want me for a brother-in-law ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="828">The Honeychurches were a worthy family , but he began to realize that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was of another clay ; and perhaps — he did not put it very definitely — he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as soon as possible .</p>
     <p n="829"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>! ”</said>said the maid , and the new rector of Summer Street was shown in ; he had at once started on friendly relations , owing to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s praise of him in her letters from Florence .</p>
     <p n="830"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>greeted him rather critically .</p>
     <p n="831"><said who="#Cecil">“ I 've come for tea ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>. Do you suppose that I shall get it ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="832"><said who="#Mr._Vyse">“ I should say so . Food is the thing one does get here — Do n't sit in that chair ; young<persName corresp="#Freddy">Honeychurch</persName>has left a bone in it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="833"><said who="#Cecil">“ Pfui ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="834"><said who="#Cecil">“ I know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>.<said who="#Cecil">“ I know . I can n't think why<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>allows it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="835">For<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>considered the bone and the Maples ’ furniture separately ; he did not realize that , taken together , they kindled the room into the life that he desired .</p>
     <p n="836"><said who="#Cecil">“ I 've come for tea and for gossip . Is n't this news ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="837"><said who="#Cecil">“ News ? I do n't understand you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>.<said who="#Cecil">“ News ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="838"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, whose news was of a very different nature , prattled forward .</p>
     <p n="839"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I met<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry Otway</persName>as I came up ; I have every reason to hope that I am first in the field . He has bought Cissie and Albert from Mr. Flack ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="840"><said who="#Cecil">“ Has he indeed ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, trying to recover himself . Into what a grotesque mistake had he fallen ! Was it likely that a clergyman and a gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant ? But his stiffness remained , and , though he asked who Cissie and Albert might be , he still thought<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>rather a bounder .</p>
     <p n="841"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Unpardonable question ! To have stopped a week at Windy Corner and not to have met Cissie and Albert , the semi-detached villas that have been run up opposite the church ! I 'll set<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>after you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="842"><said who="#Cecil">“ I 'm shockingly stupid over local affairs , ”</said>said the young man languidly .<said who="#Cecil">“ I can n't even remember the difference between a Parish Council and a Local Government Board . Perhaps there is no difference , or perhaps those are n't the right names . I only go into the country to see my friends and to enjoy the scenery . It is very remiss of me . Italy and London are the only places where I do n't feel to exist on sufferance . ”</said></p>
     <p n="843"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, distressed at this heavy reception of Cissie and Albert , determined to shift the subject .</p>
     <p n="844"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Let me see ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>— I forget — what is your profession ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="845"><said who="#Cecil">“ I have no profession , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>.<said who="#Cecil">“ It is another example of my decadence . My attitude quite an indefensible one — is that so long as I am no trouble to any one I have a right to do as I like . I know I ought to be getting money out of people , or devoting myself to things I do n't care a straw about , but somehow , I 've not been able to begin . ”</said></p>
     <p n="846"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ You are very fortunate , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ It is a wonderful opportunity , the possession of leisure . ”</said></p>
     <p n="847">His voice was rather parochial , but he did not quite see his way to answering naturally . He felt , as all who have regular occupation must feel , that others should have it also .</p>
     <p n="848"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I am glad that you approve . I dare n't face the healthy person — for example ,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName><persName corresp="#Freddy">Honeychurch</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="849"><said who="#Cecil">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>'s a good sort , is n't he ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="850"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Admirable . The sort who has made England what she is . ”</said></p>
     <p n="851"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>wondered at himself . Why , on this day of all others , was he so hopelessly contrary ? He tried to get right by inquiring effusively after<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s mother , an old lady for whom he had no particular regard . Then he flattered the clergyman , praised his liberal-mindedness , his enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science .</p>
     <p n="852"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Where are the others ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>at last ,<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I insist on extracting tea before evening service . ”</said></p>
     <p n="853"><said who="#Cecil">“ I suppose Anne never told them you were here . In this house one is so coached in the servants the day one arrives . The fault of Anne is that she begs your pardon when she hears you perfectly , and kicks the chair-legs with her feet . The faults of Mary — I forget the faults of Mary , but they are very grave . Shall we look in the garden ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="854"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I know the faults of Mary . She leaves the dust-pans standing on the stairs . ”</said></p>
     <p n="855"><said who="#Cecil">“ The fault of Euphemia is that she will not , simply will not , chop the suet sufficiently small . ”</said></p>
     <p n="856">They both laughed , and things began to go better .</p>
     <p n="857"><said who="#Cecil">“ The faults of<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>— ”</said><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>continued .</p>
     <p n="858"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Ah , he has too many . No one but his mother can remember the faults of<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>. Try the faults of<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>; they are not innumerable . ”</said></p>
     <p n="859"><said who="#Cecil">“ She has none , ”</said>said the young man , with grave sincerity .</p>
     <p n="860"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I quite agree . At present she has none . ”</said></p>
     <p n="861"><said who="#Cecil">“ At present ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="862"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I 'm not cynical . I 'm only thinking of my pet theory about<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>. Does it seem reasonable that she should play so wonderfully , and live so quietly ? I suspect that one day she will be wonderful in both . The water-tight compartments in her will break down , and music and life will mingle . Then we shall have her heroically good , heroically bad — too heroic , perhaps , to be good or bad . ”</said></p>
     <p n="863"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>found his companion interesting .</p>
     <p n="864"><said who="#Cecil">“ And at present you think her not wonderful as far as life goes ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="865"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Well , I must say I 've only seen her at Tunbridge Wells , where she was not wonderful , and at Florence . Since I came to Summer Street she has been away . You saw her , did n't you , at Rome and in the Alps . Oh , I forgot ; of course , you knew her before . No , she was n't wonderful in Florence either , but I kept on expecting that she would be . ”</said></p>
     <p n="866"><said who="#Cecil">“ In what way ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="867">Conversation had become agreeable to them , and they were pacing up and down the terrace .</p>
     <p n="868"><said who="#Cecil">“ I could as easily tell you what tune she 'll play next . There was simply the sense that she had found wings , and meant to use them . I can show you a beautiful picture in my Italian diary :<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>as a kite ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>holding the string . Picture number two : the string breaks . ”</said></p>
     <p n="869">The sketch was in his diary , but it had been made afterwards , when he viewed things artistically . At the time he had given surreptitious tugs to the string himself .</p>
     <p n="870"><said who="#Cecil">“ But the string never broke ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="871"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ No . I might n't have seen<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>rise , but I should certainly have heard<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>fall . ”</said></p>
     <p n="872"><said who="#Cecil">“ It has broken now , ”</said>said the young man in low , vibrating tones .</p>
     <p n="873">Immediately he realized that of all the conceited , ludicrous , contemptible ways of announcing an engagement this was the worst . He cursed his love of metaphor ; had he suggested that he was a star and that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was soaring up to reach him ?</p>
     <p n="874"><said who="#Lucy">“ Broken ? What do you mean ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="875"><said who="#Cecil">“ I meant , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>stiffly ,<said who="#Cecil">“ that she is going to marry me . ”</said></p>
     <p n="876">The clergyman was conscious of some bitter disappointment which he could not keep out of his voice .</p>
     <p n="877"><said who="#Lucy">“ I am sorry ; I must apologize . I had no idea you were intimate with her , or I should never have talked in this flippant , superficial way .<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>, you ought to have stopped me . ”</said>And down the garden he saw<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>herself ; yes , he was disappointed .</p>
     <p n="878"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, who naturally preferred congratulations to apologies , drew down his mouth at the corners . Was this the reception his action would get from the world ? Of course , he despised the world as a whole ; every thoughtful man should ; it is almost a test of refinement . But he was sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered .</p>
     <p n="879">Occasionally he could be quite crude .</p>
     <p n="880"><said who="#Cecil">“ I am sorry I have given you a shock , ”</said>he said dryly .<said who="#Cecil">“ I fear that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s choice does not meet with your approval . ”</said></p>
     <p n="881"><said who="#Lucy">“ Not that . But you ought to have stopped me . I know<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>only a little as time goes . Perhaps I ought n't to have discussed her so freely with any one ; certainly not with you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="882"><said who="#Cecil">“ You are conscious of having said something indiscreet ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="883"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>pulled himself together . Really ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>had the art of placing one in the most tiresome positions . He was driven to use the prerogatives of his profession .</p>
     <p n="884"><said who="#Mr._Vyse">“ No , I have said nothing indiscreet . I foresaw at Florence that her quiet , uneventful childhood must end , and it has ended . I realized dimly enough that she might take some momentous step . She has taken it . She has learnt — you will let me talk freely , as I have begun freely — she has learnt what it is to love : the greatest lesson , some people will tell you , that our earthly life provides . ”</said>It was now time for him to wave his hat at the approaching trio . He did not omit to do so .<said who="#Mr._Vyse">“ She has learnt through you , ”</said>and if his voice was still clerical , it was now also sincere ;<said who="#Mr._Vyse">“ let it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to her . ”</said></p>
     <p n="885"><said who="#Cecil">“ Grazie tante ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, who did not like parsons .</p>
     <p n="886"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Have you heard ? ”</said>shouted<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>as she toiled up the sloping garden .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, have you heard the news ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="887"><persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, now full of geniality , whistled the wedding march . Youth seldom criticizes the accomplished fact .</p>
     <p n="888"><said who="#Freddy">“ Indeed I have ! ”</said>he cried . He looked at<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. In her presence he could not act the parson any longer — at all events not without apology .<said who="#Freddy">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, I 'm going to do what I am always supposed to do , but generally I 'm too shy . I want to invoke every kind of blessing on them , grave and gay , great and small . I want them all their lives to be supremely good and supremely happy as husband and wife , as father and mother . And now I want my tea . ”</said></p>
     <p n="889"><said who="#the_lady">“ You only asked for it just in time , ”</said>the lady retorted .<said who="#the_lady">“ How dare you be serious at Windy Corner ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="890">He took his tone from her . There was no more heavy beneficence , no more attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the Scriptures . None of them dared or was able to be serious any more .</p>
     <p n="891">An engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe . Away from it , in the solitude of their rooms ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, and even<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, might again be critical . But in its presence and in the presence of each other they were sincerely hilarious . It has a strange power , for it compels not only the lips , but the very heart . The chief parallel to compare one great thing with another — is the power over us of a temple of some alien creed . Standing outside , we deride or oppose it , or at the most feel sentimental . Inside , though the saints and gods are not ours , we become true believers , in case any true believer should be present .</p>
     <p n="892">So it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant tea-party . If they were hypocrites they did not know it , and their hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true . Anne , putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present , stimulated them greatly . They could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave them ere she kicked the drawing-room door .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>chirruped .<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>was at his wittiest , referring to<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>as the “ Fiasco ” — family honoured pun on fiance .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, amusing and portly , promised well as a mother-in-law . As for<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>and<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, for whom the temple had been built , they also joined in the merry ritual , but waited , as earnest worshippers should , for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy .</p>

     <p n="893">A few days after the engagement was announced<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>made<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>and her Fiasco come to a little garden-party in the neighbourhood , for naturally she wanted to show people that her daughter was marrying a presentable man .</p>
     <p n="894"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>was more than presentable ; he looked distinguished , and it was very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, and his long , fair face responding when<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>spoke to him . People congratulated<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, which is , I believe , a social blunder , but it pleased her , and she introduced<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>rather indiscriminately to some stuffy dowagers .</p>
     <p n="895">At tea a misfortune took place : a cup of coffee was upset over<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s figured silk , and though<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>feigned indifference , her mother feigned nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated by a sympathetic maid . They were gone some time , and<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>was left with the dowagers . When they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been .</p>
     <p n="896"><said who="#Cecil">“ Do you go to much of this sort of thing ? ”</said>he asked when they were driving home .</p>
     <p n="897"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , now and then , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, who had rather enjoyed herself .</p>
     <p n="898"><said who="#Cecil">“ Is it typical of country society ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="899"><said who="#Lucy">“ I suppose so . Mother , would it be ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="900"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Plenty of society , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, who was trying to remember the hang of one of the dresses .</p>
     <p n="901">Seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>bent towards<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>and said :</p>
     <p n="902"><said who="#Lucy">“ To me it seemed perfectly appalling , disastrous , portentous . ”</said></p>
     <p n="903"><said who="#Cecil">“ I am so sorry that you were stranded . ”</said></p>
     <p n="904"><said who="#Lucy">“ Not that , but the congratulations . It is so disgusting , the way an engagement is regarded as public property — a kind of waste place where every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment . All those old women smirking ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="905"><said who="#Cecil">“ One has to go through it , I suppose . They wo n't notice us so much next time . ”</said></p>
     <p n="906"><said who="#Lucy">“ But my point is that their whole attitude is wrong . An engagement — horrid word in the first place — is a private matter , and should be treated as such . ”</said></p>
     <p n="907">Yet the smirking old women , however wrong individually , were racially correct . The spirit of the generations had smiled through them , rejoicing in the engagement of<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>because it promised the continuance of life on earth . To<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>it promised something quite different — personal love . Hence<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s irritation and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s belief that his irritation was just .</p>
     <p n="908"><said who="#Lucy">“ How tiresome ! ”</said>she said .<said who="#Lucy">“ Could n't you have escaped to tennis ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="909"><said who="#Cecil">“ I do n't play tennis — at least , not in public . The neighbourhood is deprived of the romance of me being athletic . Such romance as I have is that of the Inglese Italianato . ”</said></p>
     <p n="910"><said who="#Lucy">“ Inglese Italianato ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="911"><said who="#Cecil">“ E un diavolo incarnato ! You know the proverb ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="912">She did not . Nor did it seem applicable to a young man who had spent a quiet winter in Rome with his mother . But<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, since his engagement , had taken to affect a cosmopolitan naughtiness which he was far from possessing .</p>
     <p n="913"><said who="#Cecil">“ Well , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Cecil">“ I cannot help it if they do disapprove of me . There are certain irremovable barriers between myself and them , and I must accept them . ”</said></p>
     <p n="914"><said who="#Lucy">“ We all have our limitations , I suppose , ”</said>said wise<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="915"><said who="#Cecil">“ Sometimes they are forced on us , though , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, who saw from her remark that she did not quite understand his position .</p>
     <p n="916"><said who="#Lucy">“ How ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="917"><said who="#Cecil">“ It makes a difference does n't it , whether we fully fence ourselves in , or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="918">She thought a moment , and agreed that it did make a difference .</p>
     <p n="919"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Difference ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, suddenly alert .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I do n't see any difference . Fences are fences , especially when they are in the same place . ”</said></p>
     <p n="920"><said who="#Cecil">“ We were speaking of motives , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, on whom the interruption jarred .</p>
     <p n="921"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, look here . ”</said>She spread out her knees and perched her card-case on her lap .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ This is me . That 's Windy Corner . The rest of the pattern is the other people . Motives are all very well , but the fence comes here . ”</said></p>
     <p n="922"><said who="#Lucy">“ We were n't talking of real fences , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, laughing .</p>
     <p n="923"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Oh , I see , dear — poetry . ”</said></p>
     <p n="924">She leant placidly back .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>wondered why<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had been amused .</p>
     <p n="925"><said who="#Lucy">“ I tell you who has no ‘ fences , ’ as you call them , ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Lucy">“ and that 's<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="926"><said who="#Cecil">“ A parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless . ”</said></p>
     <p n="927"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was slow to follow what people said , but quick enough to detect what they meant . She missed<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s epigram , but grasped the feeling that prompted it .</p>
     <p n="928"><said who="#Cecil">“ Do n't you like<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>? ”</said>she asked thoughtfully .</p>
     <p n="929"><said who="#Lucy">“ I never said so ! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Lucy">“ I consider him far above the average . I only denied — ”</said>And he swept off on the subject of fences again , and was brilliant .</p>
     <p n="930"><said who="#Cecil">“ Now , a clergyman that I do hate , ”</said>said she wanting to say something sympathetic ,<said who="#Cecil">“ a clergyman that does have fences , and the most dreadful ones , is Mr . Eager , the English chaplain at Florence . He was truly insincere — not merely the manner unfortunate . He was a snob , and so conceited , and he did say such unkind things . ”</said></p>
     <p n="931"><said who="#Lucy">“ What sort of things ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="932"><said who="#Cecil">“ There was an old man at the Bertolini whom he said had murdered his wife . ”</said></p>
     <p n="933"><said who="#Lucy">“ Perhaps he had . ”</said></p>
     <p n="934"><said who="#Cecil">“ No ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="935"><said who="#Lucy">“ Why ‘ no ’ ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="936"><said who="#Cecil">“ He was such a nice old man , I 'm sure . ”</said></p>
     <p n="937"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>laughed at her feminine inconsequence .</p>
     <p n="938"><said who="#Cecil">“ Well , I did try to sift the thing . Mr . Eager would never come to the point . He prefers it vague — said the old man had ‘ practically ’ murdered his wife — had murdered her in the sight of God . ”</said></p>
     <p n="939"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Hush , dear ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>absently .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ But is n't it intolerable that a person whom we 're told to imitate should go round spreading slander ? It was , I believe , chiefly owing to him that the old man was dropped . People pretended he was vulgar , but he certainly was n't that . ”</said></p>
     <p n="940"><said who="#Cecil">“ Poor old man ! What was his name ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="941"><said who="#Lucy">“ Harris , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>glibly .</p>
     <p n="942"><said who="#Cecil">“ Let 's hope that Mrs. Harris there war n't no sich person , ”</said>said her mother .</p>
     <p n="943"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>nodded intelligently .</p>
     <p n="944"><said who="#Cecil">“ Is n't Mr . Eager a parson of the cultured type ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
     <p n="945"><said who="#Lucy">“ I do n't know . I hate him . I 've heard him lecture on<persName corresp="#Giotto">Giotto</persName>. I hate him . Nothing can hide a petty nature . I HATE him . ”</said></p>
     <p n="946"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ My goodness gracious me , child ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ You 'll blow my head off ! Whatever is there to shout over ? I forbid you and<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>to hate any more clergymen . ”</said></p>
     <p n="947">He smiled . There was indeed something rather incongruous in<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s moral outburst over Mr . Eager . It was as if one should see the<persName corresp="#Leonardo">Leonardo</persName>on the ceiling of the Sistine . He longed to hint to her that not here lay her vocation ; that a woman 's power and charm reside in mystery , not in muscular rant . But possibly rant is a sign of vitality : it mars the beautiful creature , but shows that she is alive . After a moment , he contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain approval . He forebore to repress the sources of youth .</p>
     <p n="948"><persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>— simplest of topics , he thought — lay around them . He praised the pine-woods , the deep lasts of bracken , the crimson leaves that spotted the hurt-bushes , the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road . The outdoor world was not very familiar to him , and occasionally he went wrong in a question of fact .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>'s mouth twitched when he spoke of the perpetual green of the larch .</p>
     <p n="949"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I count myself a lucky person , ”</said>he concluded ,<said who="#Nature">“ When I 'm in London I feel I could never live out of it . When I 'm in the country I feel the same about the country . After all , I do believe that birds and trees and the sky are the most wonderful things in life , and that the people who live amongst them must be the best . It 's true that in nine cases out of ten they do n't seem to notice anything . The country gentleman and the country labourer are each in their way the most depressing of companions . Yet they may have a tacit sympathy with the workings of<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>which is denied to us of the town . Do you feel that ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>? ”</said></p>
     <p n="950"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>started and smiled . She had not been attending .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria , felt irritable , and determined not to say anything interesting again .</p>
     <p n="951"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had not attended either . Her brow was wrinkled , and she still looked furiously cross — the result , he concluded , of too much moral gymnastics . It was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an August wood .</p>
     <p n="952"><said who="#Lucy">“ ‘ Come down , O maid , from yonder mountain height , ’ ”</said>he quoted , and touched her knee with his own .</p>
     <p n="953">She flushed again and said :<said who="#Cecil">“ What height ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="954"><said who="#Lucy">“ ‘ Come down , O maid , from yonder mountain height , What pleasure lives in height ( the shepherd sang ) . In height and in the splendour of the hills ? ’ Let us take<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>'s advice and hate clergymen no more . What 's this place ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="955"><said who="#Lucy">“ Summer Street , of course , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, and roused herself .</p>
     <p n="956">The woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow . Pretty cottages lined it on two sides , and the upper and third side was occupied by a new stone church , expensively simple , a charming shingled spire .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s house was near the church . In height it scarcely exceeded the cottages . Some great mansions were at hand , but they were hidden in the trees . The scene suggested a Swiss Alp rather than the shrine and centre of a leisured world , and was marred only by two ugly little villas — the villas that had competed with<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s engagement , having been acquired by<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry Otway</persName>the very afternoon that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had been acquired by<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>.</p>
     <p n="957">“ Cissie ” was the name of one of these villas , “ Albert ” of the other . These titles were not only picked out in shaded Gothic on the garden gates , but appeared a second time on the porches , where they followed the semicircular curve of the entrance arch in block capitals . “ Albert ” was inhabited . His tortured garden was bright with geraniums and lobelias and polished shells . His little windows were chastely swathed in Nottingham lace . “ Cissie ” was to let . Three notice-boards , belonging to Dorking agents , lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising fact . Her paths were already weedy ; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn was yellow with dandelions .</p>
     <p n="958"><said who="#Cecil">“ The place is ruined ! ”</said>said the ladies mechanically .<said who="#Cecil">“ Summer Street will never be the same again . ”</said></p>
     <p n="959">As the carriage passed , “ Cissie 's ” door opened , and a gentleman came out of her .</p>
     <p n="960"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Stop ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, touching the coachman with her parasol .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Here 's<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>. Now we shall know .<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>, pull those things down at once ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="961"><persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry Otway</persName>— who need not be described — came to the carriage and said “<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, I meant to . I can n't , I really can n't turn out Miss Flack . ”</p>
     <p n="962"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Am I not always right ? She ought to have gone before the contract was signed . Does she still live rent free , as she did in her nephew 's time ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="963"><said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ But what can I do ? ”</said>He lowered his voice .<said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ An old lady , so very vulgar , and almost bedridden . ”</said></p>
     <p n="964"><said who="#Cecil">“ Turn her out , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>bravely .</p>
     <p n="965"><persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>sighed , and looked at the villas mournfully . He had had full warning of Mr. Flack 's intentions , and might have bought the plot before building commenced : but he was apathetic and dilatory . He had known Summer Street for so many years that he could not imagine it being spoilt . Not till Mrs. Flack had laid the foundation stone , and the apparition of red and cream brick began to rise did he take alarm . He called on Mr. Flack , the local builder ,— a most reasonable and respectful man — who agreed that tiles would have made more artistic roof , but pointed out that slates were cheaper . He ventured to differ , however , about the Corinthian columns which were to cling like leeches to the frames of the bow windows , saying that , for his part , he liked to relieve the facade by a bit of decoration .<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>hinted that a column , if possible , should be structural as well as decorative .</p>
     <p n="966">Mr. Flack replied that all the columns had been ordered , adding ,<said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ and all the capitals different — one with dragons in the foliage , another approaching to the Ionian style , another introducing Mrs. Flack 's initials — every one different . ”</said>For he had read his Ruskin . He built his villas according to his desire ; and not until he had inserted an immovable aunt into one of them did<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>buy .</p>
     <p n="967">This futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness as he leant on<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>'s carriage . He had failed in his duties to the country-side , and the country-side was laughing at him as well . He had spent money , and yet Summer Street was spoilt as much as ever . All he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for “ Cissie ” — some one really desirable .</p>
     <p n="968"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ The rent is absurdly low , ”</said>he told them ,<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ and perhaps I am an easy landlord . But it is such an awkward size . It is too large for the peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves . ”</said></p>
     <p n="969"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>had been hesitating whether he should despise the villas or despise<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>for despising them . The latter impulse seemed the more fruitful .</p>
     <p n="970"><said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ You ought to find a tenant at once , ”</said>he said maliciously .<said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ It would be a perfect paradise for a bank clerk . ”</said></p>
     <p n="971"><said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ Exactly ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>excitedly .<said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ That is exactly what I fear ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>. It will attract the wrong type of people . The train service has improved — a fatal improvement , to my mind . And what are five miles from a station in these days of bicycles ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="972"><said who="#Lucy">“ Rather a strenuous clerk it would be , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="973"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, who had his full share of mediaeval mischievousness , replied that the physique of the lower middle classes was improving at a most appalling rate . She saw that he was laughing at their harmless neighbour , and roused herself to stop him .</p>
     <p n="974"><said who="#Cecil">“<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>! ”</said>she exclaimed ,<said who="#Cecil">“ I have an idea . How would you like spinsters ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="975"><said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, it would be splendid . Do you know any such ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="976"><said who="#Cecil">“ Yes ; I met them abroad . ”</said></p>
     <p n="977"><said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ Gentlewomen ? ”</said>he asked tentatively .</p>
     <p n="978"><said who="#Cecil">“ Yes , indeed , and at the present moment homeless . I heard from them last week — Miss Teresa and Miss Catharine<persName corresp="#Alan">Alan</persName>. I 'm really not joking . They are quite the right people .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>knows them , too . May I tell them to write to you ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="979"><said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ Indeed you may ! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ Here we are with the difficulty solved already . How delightful it is ! Extra facilities — please tell them they shall have extra facilities , for I shall have no agents ’ fees . Oh , the agents ! The appalling people they have sent me ! One woman , when I wrote — a tactful letter , you know — asking her to explain her social position to me , replied that she would pay the rent in advance . As if one cares about that ! And several references I took up were most unsatisfactory — people swindlers , or not respectable . And oh , the deceit ! I have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week . The deceit of the most promising people . My dear<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, the deceit ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="980">She nodded .</p>
     <p n="981"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ My advice , ”</said>put in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>,<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ is to have nothing to do with<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>and her decayed gentlewomen at all . I know the type . Preserve me from people who have seen better days , and bring heirlooms with them that make the house smell stuffy . It 's a sad thing , but I 'd far rather let to some one who is going up in the world than to some one who has come down . ”</said></p>
     <p n="982"><said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ I think I follow you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>;<said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ but it is , as you say , a very sad thing . ”</said></p>
     <p n="983"><said who="#Lucy">“ The Misses<persName corresp="#Alan">Alan</persName>are n't that ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="984"><said who="#Cecil">“ Yes , they are , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>.<said who="#Cecil">“ I have n't met them but I should say they were a highly unsuitable addition to the neighbourhood . ”</said></p>
     <p n="985"><said who="#Lucy">“ Do n't listen to him ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>— he 's tiresome . ”</said></p>
     <p n="986"><said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ It 's I who am tiresome , ”</said>he replied .<said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ I ought n't to come with my troubles to young people . But really I am so worried , and Lady Otway will only say that I cannot be too careful , which is quite true , but no real help . ”</said></p>
     <p n="987"><said who="#Cecil">“ Then may I write to my Misses<persName corresp="#Alan">Alan</persName>? ”</said></p>
     <p n="988"><said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ Please ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="989">But his eye wavered when<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>exclaimed :</p>
     <p n="990"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Beware ! They are certain to have canaries .<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>, beware of canaries : they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then the mice come . Beware of women altogether . Only let to a man . ”</said></p>
     <p n="991"><said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ Really — ”</said>he murmured gallantly , though he saw the wisdom of her remark .</p>
     <p n="992"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Men do n't gossip over tea-cups . If they get drunk , there 's an end of them — they lie down comfortably and sleep it off . If they 're vulgar , they somehow keep it to themselves . It does n't spread so . Give me a man — of course , provided he 's clean . ”</said></p>
     <p n="993"><persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>blushed . Neither he nor<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>enjoyed these open compliments to their sex . Even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much distinction . He suggested that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, if she had time , should descend from the carriage and inspect “ Cissie ” for herself . She was delighted .<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>had intended her to be poor and to live in such a house . Domestic arrangements always attracted her , especially when they were on a small scale .</p>
     <p n="994"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>pulled<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>back as she followed her mother .</p>
     <p n="995"><said who="#Cecil">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Cecil">“ what if we two walk home and leave you ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="996"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Certainly ! ”</said>was her cordial reply .</p>
     <p n="997"><persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>likewise seemed almost too glad to get rid of them . He beamed at them knowingly , said ,<said who="#Cecil">“ Aha ! young people , young people ! ”</said>and then hastened to unlock the house .</p>
     <p n="998"><said who="#Cecil">“ Hopeless vulgarian ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, almost before they were out of earshot .</p>
     <p n="999"><said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1000"><said who="#Cecil">“ I can n't help it . It would be wrong not to loathe that man . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1001"><said who="#Sir_Harry_Otway">“ He is n't clever , but really he is nice . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1002"><said who="#Cecil">“ No ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, he stands for all that is bad in country life . In London he would keep his place . He would belong to a brainless club , and his wife would give brainless dinner parties . But down here he acts the little god with his gentility , and his patronage , and his sham aesthetics , and every one — even your mother — is taken in . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1003"><said who="#Lucy">“ All that you say is quite true , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, though she felt discouraged .<said who="#Lucy">“ I wonder whether — whether it matters so very much . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1004"><said who="#Cecil">“ It matters supremely .<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>is the essence of that garden-party . Oh , goodness , how cross I feel ! How I do hope he 'll get some vulgar tenant in that villa — some woman so really vulgar that he 'll notice it . GENTLEFOLKS ! Ugh ! with his bald head and retreating chin ! But let 's forget him . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1005">This<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was glad enough to do . If<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>disliked<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry Otway</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered to her would escape ? For instance ,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>.<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>was neither clever , nor subtle , nor beautiful , and what prevented<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>from saying , any minute , “ It would be wrong not to loathe<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>” ? And what would she reply ? Further than<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>she did not go , but he gave her anxiety enough . She could only assure herself that<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>had known<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>some time , and that they had always got on pleasantly , except , perhaps , during the last few days , which was an accident , perhaps .</p>
     <p n="1006"><said who="#Freddy">“ Which way shall we go ? ”</said>she asked him .</p>
     <p n="1007"><persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>— simplest of topics , she thought — was around them . Summer Street lay deep in the woods , and she had stopped where a footpath diverged from the highroad .</p>
     <p n="1008"><said who="#Nature">“ Are there two ways ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1009"><said who="#Freddy">“ Perhaps the road is more sensible , as we 're got up smart . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1010"><said who="#Cecil">“ I 'd rather go through the wood , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, With that subdued irritation that she had noticed in him all the afternoon .<said who="#Cecil">“ Why is it ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, that you always say the road ? Do you know that you have never once been with me in the fields or the wood since we were engaged ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1011"><said who="#Lucy">“ Have n't I ? The wood , then , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, startled at his queerness , but pretty sure that he would explain later ; it was not his habit to leave her in doubt as to his meaning .</p>
     <p n="1012">She led the way into the whispering pines , and sure enough he did explain before they had gone a dozen yards .</p>
     <p n="1013"><said who="#Lucy">“ I had got an idea — I dare say wrongly — that you feel more at home with me in a room . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1014"><said who="#Cecil">“ A room ? ”</said>she echoed , hopelessly bewildered .</p>
     <p n="1015"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yes . Or , at the most , in a garden , or on a road . Never in the real country like this . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1016"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, whatever do you mean ? I have never felt anything of the sort . You talk as if I was a kind of poetess sort of person . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1017"><said who="#Cecil">“ I do n't know that you are n't . I connect you with a view — a certain type of view . Why should n't you connect me with a room ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1018">She reflected a moment , and then said , laughing :</p>
     <p n="1019"><said who="#Lucy">“ Do you know that you 're right ? I do . I must be a poetess after all . When I think of you it 's always as in a room . How funny ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1020">To her surprise , he seemed annoyed .</p>
     <p n="1021"><said who="#Lucy">“ A drawing-room , pray ? With no view ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1022"><said who="#Cecil">“ Yes , with no view , I fancy . Why not ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1023"><said who="#Lucy">“ I 'd rather , ”</said>he said reproachfully ,<said who="#Lucy">“ that connected me with the open air . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1024">She said again ,<said who="#Lucy">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, whatever do you mean ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1025">As no explanation was forthcoming , she shook off the subject as too difficult for a girl , and led him further into the wood , pausing every now and then at some particularly beautiful or familiar combination of the trees . She had known the wood between Summer Street and Windy Corner ever since she could walk alone ; she had played at losing<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>in it , when<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>was a purple-faced baby ; and though she had been to Italy , it had lost none of its charm .</p>
     <p n="1026">Presently they came to a little clearing among the pines — another tiny green alp , solitary this time , and holding in its bosom a shallow pool .</p>
     <p n="1027">She exclamed ,<said who="#Freddy">“ The Sacred Lake ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1028"><said who="#Lucy">“ Why do you call it that ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1029"><said>“ I can n't remember why . I suppose it comes out of some book . It 's only a puddle now , but you see that stream going through it ? Well , a good deal of water comes down after heavy rains , and can n't get away at once , and the pool becomes quite large and beautiful . Then<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>used to bathe there . He is very fond of it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1030"><said who="#Lucy">“ And you ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1031">He meant ,<said who="#Freddy">“ Are you fond of it ? ”</said>But she answered dreamily ,<said who="#Freddy">“ I bathed here , too , till I was found out . Then there was a row . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1032">At another time he might have been shocked , for he had depths of prudishness within him . But now ? with his momentary cult of the fresh air , he was delighted at her admirable simplicity . He looked at her as she stood by the pool 's edge . She was got up smart , as she phrased it , and she reminded him of some brilliant flower that has no leaves of its own , but blooms abruptly out of a world of green .</p>
     <p n="1033"><said who="#Freddy">“ Who found you out ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1034"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, ”</said>she murmured .<said who="#Lucy">“ She was stopping with us .<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>—<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1035"><said who="#Charlotte">“ Poor girl ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1036">She smiled gravely . A certain scheme , from which hitherto he had shrank , now appeared practical .</p>
     <p n="1037"><said who="#Freddy">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1038"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yes , I suppose we ought to be going , ”</said>was her reply .</p>
     <p n="1039"><said who="#Freddy">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, I want to ask something of you that I have never asked before . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1040">At the serious note in his voice she stepped frankly and kindly towards him .</p>
     <p n="1041"><said who="#Freddy">“ What ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1042"><said who="#Cecil">“ Hitherto never — not even that day on the lawn when you agreed to marry me — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1043">He became self-conscious and kept glancing round to see if they were observed . His courage had gone .</p>
     <p n="1044"><said who="#Freddy">“ Yes ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1045"><said who="#Cecil">“ Up to now I have never kissed you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1046">She was as scarlet as if he had put the thing most indelicately .</p>
     <p n="1047"><said who="#Freddy">“ No — more you have , ”</said>she stammered .</p>
     <p n="1048"><said who="#Cecil">“ Then I ask you — may I now ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1049"><said who="#Freddy">“ Of course , you may ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>. You might before . I can n't run at you , you know . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1050">At that supreme moment he was conscious of nothing but absurdities . Her reply was inadequate . She gave such a business-like lift to her veil . As he approached her he found time to wish that he could recoil . As he touched her , his gold pince-nez became dislodged and was flattened between them .</p>
     <p n="1051">Such was the embrace . He considered , with truth , that it had been a failure . Passion should believe itself irresistible . It should forget civility and consideration and all the other curses of a refined nature . Above all , it should never ask for leave where there is a right of way . Why could he not do as any labourer or navvy — nay , as any young man behind the counter would have done ? He recast the scene .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was standing flowerlike by the water , he rushed up and took her in his arms ; she rebuked him , permitted him and revered him ever after for his manliness . For he believed that women revere men for their manliness .</p>
     <p n="1052">They left the pool in silence , after this one salutation . He waited for her to make some remark which should show him her inmost thoughts . At last she spoke , and with fitting gravity .</p>
     <p n="1053"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>was the name , not Harris . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1054"><said who="#Freddy">“ What name ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1055"><said who="#Lucy">“ The old man 's . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1056"><said who="#Freddy">“ What old man ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1057"><said who="#Lucy">“ That old man I told you about . The one Mr . Eager was so unkind to . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1058">He could not know that this was the most intimate conversation they had ever had .</p>

     <head type="chapter">Chapter X : Cecil as a Humourist</head>
     <p n="1059">The society out of which<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>proposed to rescue<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was perhaps no very splendid affair , yet it was more splendid than her antecedents entitled her to . Her father , a prosperous local solicitor , had built Windy Corner , as a speculation at the time the district was opening up , and , falling in love with his own creation , had ended by living there himself . Soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter . Other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and others , again , among the pine-trees behind , and northward on the chalk barrier of the downs . Most of these houses were larger than Windy Corner , and were filled by people who came , not from the district , but from London , and who mistook the Honeychurches for the remnants of an indigenous aristocracy . He was inclined to be frightened , but his wife accepted the situation without either pride or humility .<said who="#Lucy">“ I cannot think what people are doing , ”</said>she would say ,<said who="#Freddy">“ but it is extremely fortunate for the children . ”</said>She called everywhere ; her calls were returned with enthusiasm , and by the time people found out that she was not exactly of their milieu , they liked her , and it did not seem to matter . When Mr.<persName corresp="#Freddy">Honeychurch</persName>died , he had the satisfaction — which few honest solicitors despise — of leaving his family rooted in the best society obtainable .</p>
     <p n="1060">The best obtainable . Certainly many of the immigrants were rather dull , and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>realized this more vividly since her return from Italy . Hitherto she had accepted their ideals without questioning — their kindly affluence , their inexplosive religion , their dislike of paper-bags , orange-peel , and broken bottles . A Radical out and out , she learnt to speak with horror of Suburbia . Life , so far as she troubled to conceive it , was a circle of rich , pleasant people , with identical interests and identical foes . In this circle , one thought , married , and died . Outside it were poverty and vulgarity for ever trying to enter , just as the London fog tries to enter the pine-woods pouring through the gaps in the northern hills . But , in Italy , where any one who chooses may warm himself in equality , as in the sun , this conception of life vanished . Her senses expanded ; she felt that there was no one whom she might not get to like , that social barriers were irremovable , doubtless , but not particularly high . You jump over them just as you jump into a peasant 's olive-yard in the Apennines , and he is glad to see you . She returned with new eyes .</p>
     <p n="1061">So did<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>; but Italy had quickened<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, not to tolerance , but to irritation . He saw that the local society was narrow , but , instead of saying ,<said who="#Lucy">“ Does that very much matter ? ”</said>he rebelled , and tried to substitute for it the society he called broad . He did not realize that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had consecrated her environment by the thousand little civilities that create a tenderness in time , and that though her eyes saw its defects , her heart refused to despise it entirely . Nor did he realize a more important point — that if she was too great for this society , she was too great for all society , and had reached the stage where personal intercourse would alone satisfy her . A rebel she was , but not of the kind he understood — a rebel who desired , not a wider dwelling-room , but equality beside the man she loved . For Italy was offering her the most priceless of all possessions — her own soul .</p>
     <p n="1062">Playing bumble-puppy with<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>Beebe , niece to the rector , and aged thirteen — an ancient and most honourable game , which consists in striking tennis-balls high into the air , so that they fall over the net and immoderately bounce ; some hit<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>; others are lost . The sentence is confused , but the better illustrates<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s state of mind , for she was trying to talk to<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>at the same time .</p>
     <p n="1063"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , it has been such a nuisance — first he , then they — no one knowing what they wanted , and every one so tiresome . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1064"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ But they really are coming now , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I wrote to Miss Teresa a few days ago — she was wondering how often the butcher called , and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably . They are coming . I heard from them this morning .</said></p>
     <p n="1065"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I shall hate those Miss Alans ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>cried .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Just because they 're old and silly one 's expected to say ‘ How sweet ! ’ I hate their ‘ if ’ - ing and ‘ but ’ - ing and ‘ and ’ - ing . And poor<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>— serve her right — worn to a shadow . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1066"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>watched the shadow springing and shouting over the tennis-court .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>was absent — one did not play bumble-puppy when he was there .</p>
     <p n="1067"><said who="#Cecil">“ Well , if they are coming — No ,<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>, not Saturn . ”</said>Saturn was a tennis-ball whose skin was partially unsewn . When in motion his orb was encircled by a ring .<said who="#Cecil">“ If they are coming ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>will let them move in before the twenty-ninth , and he will cross out the clause about whitewashing the ceilings , because it made them nervous , and put in the fair wear and tear one .— That does n't count . I told you not Saturn . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1068"><said who="#Freddy">“ Saturn 's all right for bumble-puppy , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, joining them .<said who="#Freddy">“<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>, do n't you listen to her . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1069"><said who="#Beebe">“ Saturn does n't bounce . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1070"><said who="#Freddy">“ Saturn bounces enough . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1071"><said who="#Beebe">“ No , he does n't . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1072"><said who="#Freddy">“ Well ; he bounces better than the Beautiful White Devil . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1073"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Hush , dear , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1074"><said who="#Freddy">“ But look at<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>— complaining of Saturn , and all the time 's got the Beautiful White Devil in her hand , ready to plug it in . That 's right ,<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>, go for her — get her over the shins with the racquet — get her over the shins ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1075"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>fell , the Beautiful White Devil rolled from her hand .</p>
     <p n="1076"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>picked it up , and said :<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ The name of this ball is Vittoria Corombona , please . ”</said>But his correction passed unheeded .</p>
     <p n="1077"><persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls to fury , and in half a minute he had transformed<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>from a well-mannered child into a howling wilderness . Up in the house<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>heard them , and , though he was full of entertaining news , he did not come down to impart it , in case he got hurt . He was not a coward and bore necessary pain as well as any man . But he hated the physical violence of the young . How right it was ! Sure enough it ended in a cry .</p>
     <p n="1078"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I wish the Miss Alans could see this , ”</said>observed<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, just as<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, who was nursing the injured<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>, was in turn lifted off her feet by her brother .</p>
     <p n="1079"><said who="#Freddy">“ Who are the Miss Alans ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>panted .</p>
     <p n="1080"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ They have taken Cissie Villa . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1081"><said who="#Freddy">“ That was n't the name — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1082">Here his foot slipped , and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass . An interval elapses .</p>
     <p n="1083"><said who="#Lucy">“ Was n't what name ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, with her brother 's head in her lap .</p>
     <p n="1084"><said who="#Freddy">“<persName corresp="#Alan">Alan</persName>was n't the name of the people<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>'s let to . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1085"><said who="#Lucy">“ Nonsense ,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>! You know nothing about it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1086"><said who="#Lucy">“ Nonsense yourself ! I 've this minute seen him . He said to me : ‘ Ahem !<persName corresp="#Freddy">Honeychurch</persName>, ’ ”</said>—<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>was an indifferent mimic —<said who="#Lucy">“ ‘ ahem ! ahem ! I have at last procured really dee-sire-rebel tenants . ’ I said , ‘ ooray , old boy ! ’ and slapped him on the back . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1087"><said who="#Freddy">“ Exactly . The Miss Alans ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1088"><said who="#Lucy">“ Rather not . More like Anderson . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1089"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Oh , good gracious , there is n't going to be another muddle ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>exclaimed .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Do you notice ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, I 'm always right ? I said do n't interfere with Cissie Villa . I 'm always right . I 'm quite uneasy at being always right so often . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1090"><said who="#Lucy">“ It 's only another muddle of<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>'s .<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>does n't even know the name of the people he pretends have taken it instead . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1091"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Yes , I do . I 've got it .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1092"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ What name ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1093"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>. I 'll bet you anything you like . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1094"><said who="#Lucy">“ What a weathercock<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>is , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>quietly .<said who="#Lucy">“ I wish I had never bothered over it at all . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1095">Then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, whose opinion of her rose daily , whispered to his niece that THAT was the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong .</p>
     <p n="1096">Meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>from the contemplation of her own abilities .</p>
     <p n="1097"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>? Do you know what Emersons they are ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1098"><said who="#Freddy">“ I do n't know whether they 're any Emersons , ”</said>retorted<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, who was democratic . Like his sister and like most young people , he was naturally attracted by the idea of equality , and the undeniable fact that there are different kinds of Emersons annoyed him beyond measure .</p>
     <p n="1099"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I trust they are the right sort of person . All right ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>”</said>— she was sitting up again —<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I see you looking down your nose and thinking your mother 's a snob . But there is a right sort and a wrong sort , and it 's affectation to pretend there is n't . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1100"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>'s a common enough name , ”</said><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>remarked .</p>
     <p n="1101">She was gazing sideways . Seated on a promontory herself , she could see the pine-clad promontories descending one beyond another into the Weald . The further one descended the garden , the more glorious was this lateral view .</p>
     <p n="1102"><said who="#Lucy">“ I was merely going to remark ,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, that I trusted they were no relations of<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>the philosopher , a most trying man . Pray , does that satisfy you ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1103"><said who="#Freddy">“ Oh , yes , ”</said>he grumbled .<said who="#Freddy">“ And you will be satisfied , too , for they 're friends of<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>; so ”</said>— elaborate irony —<said who="#Freddy">“ you and the other country families will be able to call in perfect safety . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1104"><said who="#Lucy">“ CECIL ? ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1105"><said who="#Freddy">“ Do n't be rude , dear , ”</said>said his mother placidly .<said who="#Freddy">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, do n't screech . It 's a new bad habit you 're getting into . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1106"><said who="#Lucy">“ But has<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>— ”</said></p>
     <p n="1107"><said who="#Freddy">“ Friends of<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s , ”</said>he repeated ,<said who="#Lucy">“ ‘ and so really dee-sire-rebel . Ahem !<persName corresp="#Freddy">Honeychurch</persName>, I have just telegraphed to them . ’ ”</said></p>
     <p n="1108">She got up from the grass .</p>
     <p n="1109">It was hard on<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>sympathized with her very much . While she believed that her snub about the Miss Alans came from<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry Otway</persName>, she had borne it like a good girl . She might well “ screech ” when she heard that it came partly from her lover .<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>was a tease — something worse than a tease : he took a malicious pleasure in thwarting people . The clergyman , knowing this , looked at<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>with more than his usual kindness .</p>
     <p n="1110">When she exclaimed ,<said who="#Mr._Vyse">“ But<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s Emersons — they can n't possibly be the same ones — there is that — ”</said>he did not consider that the exclamation was strange , but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation while she recovered her composure . He diverted it as follows :</p>
     <p n="1111"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ The Emersons who were at Florence , do you mean ? No , I do n't suppose it will prove to be them . It is probably a long cry from them to friends of<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>'s . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, the oddest people ! The queerest people ! For our part we liked them , did n't we ? ”</said>He appealed to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ There was a great scene over some violets . They picked violets and filled all the vases in the room of these very Miss Alans who have failed to come to Cissie Villa . Poor little ladies ! So shocked and so pleased . It used to be one of Miss Catharine 's great stories . ‘ My dear sister loves flowers , ’ it began . They found the whole room a mass of blue — vases and jugs — and the story ends with ‘ So ungentlemanly and yet so beautiful . ’ It is all very difficult . Yes , I always connect those Florentine Emersons with violets . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1112"><said who="#Freddy">“ Fiasco 's done you this time , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, not seeing that his sister 's face was very red . She could not recover herself .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>saw it , and continued to divert the conversation .</p>
     <p n="1113"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ These particular Emersons consisted of a father and a son — the son a goodly , if not a good young man ; not a fool , I fancy , but very immature — pessimism , et cetera . Our special joy was the father — such a sentimental darling , and people declared he had murdered his wife . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1114">In his normal state<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>would never have repeated such gossip , but he was trying to shelter<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>in her little trouble . He repeated any rubbish that came into his head .</p>
     <p n="1115"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Murdered his wife ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, do n't desert us — go on playing bumble-puppy . Really , the Pension Bertolini must have been the oddest place . That 's the second murderer I 've heard of as being there . Whatever was<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>doing to stop ? By-the-by , we really must ask<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>here some time . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1116"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>could recall no second murderer . He suggested that his hostess was mistaken . At the hint of opposition she warmed . She was perfectly sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had been told . The name escaped her . What was the name ? Oh , what was the name ? She clasped her knees for the name . Something in Thackeray . She struck her matronly forehead .</p>
     <p n="1117"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>asked her brother whether<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>was in .</p>
     <p n="1118"><said who="#Cecil">“ Oh , do n't go ! ”</said>he cried , and tried to catch her by the ankles .</p>
     <p n="1119"><said who="#Lucy">“ I must go , ”</said>she said gravely .<said who="#Lucy">“ Do n't be silly . You always overdo it when you play . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1120">As she left them her mother 's shout of “ Harris ! ” shivered the tranquil air , and reminded her that she had told a lie and had never put it right . Such a senseless lie , too , yet it shattered her nerves and made her connect these Emersons , friends of<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s , with a pair of nondescript tourists . Hitherto truth had come to her naturally . She saw that for the future she must be more vigilant , and be — absolutely truthful ? Well , at all events , she must not tell lies . She hurried up the garden , still flushed with shame . A word from<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>would soothe her , she was sure .</p>
     <p n="1121"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1122"><said who="#Cecil">“ Hullo ! ”</said>he called , and leant out of the smoking-room window . He seemed in high spirits .<said who="#Cecil">“ I was hoping you 'd come . I heard you all bear-gardening , but there 's better fun up here . I , even I , have won a great victory for the Comic Muse .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>Meredith 's right — the cause of Comedy and the cause of Truth are really the same ; and I , even I , have found tenants for the distressful Cissie Villa . Do n't be angry ! Do n't be angry ! You 'll forgive me when you hear it all . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1123">He looked very attractive when his face was bright , and he dispelled her ridiculous forebodings at once .</p>
     <p n="1124"><said who="#Lucy">“ I have heard , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>has told us . Naughty<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>! I suppose I must forgive you . Just think of all the trouble I took for nothing ! Certainly the Miss Alans are a little tiresome , and I 'd rather have nice friends of yours . But you ought n't to tease one so . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1125"><said who="#Cecil">“ Friends of mine ? ”</said>he laughed .<said who="#Cecil">“ But ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, the whole joke is to come ! Come here . ”</said>But she remained standing where she was .<said who="#Cecil">“ Do you know where I met these desirable tenants ? In the National Gallery , when I was up to see my mother last week . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1126"><said who="#Lucy">“ What an odd place to meet people ! ”</said>she said nervously .<said who="#Lucy">“ I do n't quite understand . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1127"><said who="#Cecil">“ In the Umbrian Room . Absolute strangers . They were admiring Luca Signorelli — of course , quite stupidly . However , we got talking , and they refreshed me not — a little . They had been to Italy . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1128"><said who="#Lucy">“ But ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>— ”</said>proceeded hilariously .</p>
     <p n="1129"><said who="#Cecil">“ In the course of conversation they said that they wanted a country cottage — the father to live there , the son to run down for week-ends . I thought , ‘ What a chance of scoring off<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>! ’ and I took their address and a London reference , found they were n't actual blackguards — it was great sport — and wrote to him , making out — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1130"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>! No , it 's not fair . I 've probably met them before — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1131">He bore her down .</p>
     <p n="1132"><said who="#Cecil">“ Perfectly fair . Anything is fair that punishes a snob . That old man will do the neighbourhood a world of good .<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>is too disgusting with his ‘ decayed gentlewomen . ’ I meant to read him a lesson some time . No ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, the classes ought to mix , and before long you 'll agree with me . There ought to be intermarriage — all sorts of things . I believe in democracy — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1133"><said who="#Lucy">“ No , you do n't , ”</said>she snapped .<said who="#Lucy">“ You do n't know what the word means . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1134">He stared at her , and felt again that she had failed to be Leonardesque .<said who="#Cecil">“ No , you do n't ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1135">Her face was inartistic — that of a peevish virago .</p>
     <p n="1136"><said who="#Lucy">“ It is n't fair ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>. I blame you — I blame you very much indeed . You had no business to undo my work about the Miss Alans , and make me look ridiculous . You call it scoring off<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry</persName>, but do you realize that it is all at my expense ? I consider it most disloyal of you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1137">She left him .</p>
     <p n="1138"><said who="#Cecil">“ Temper ! ”</said>he thought , raising his eyebrows .</p>
     <p n="1139">No , it was worse than temper — snobbishness . As long as<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>thought that his own smart friends were supplanting the Miss Alans , she had not minded . He perceived that these new tenants might be of value educationally . He would tolerate the father and draw out the son , who was silent . In the interests of the Comic Muse and of Truth , he would bring them to Windy Corner .</p>

     <head type="chapter">Chapter XI : In Mrs. Vyse 's Well-Appointed Flat</head>
     <p n="1140">The Comic Muse , though able to look after her own interests , did not disdain the assistance of<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>. His idea of bringing the Emersons to Windy Corner struck her as decidedly good , and she carried through the negotiations without a hitch .<persName corresp="#Sir_Harry_Otway">Sir Harry Otway</persName>signed the agreement , met<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, who was duly disillusioned . The Miss Alans were duly offended , and wrote a dignified letter to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, whom they held responsible for the failure .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>planned pleasant moments for the new-comers , and told<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>that<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>must call on them as soon as they arrived . Indeed , so ample was the Muse 's equipment that she permitted Mr. Harris , never a very robust criminal , to droop his head , to be forgotten , and to die .</p>
     <p n="1141"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>— to descend from bright heaven to earth , whereon there are shadows because there are hills —<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was at first plunged into despair , but settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least . Now that she was engaged , the Emersons would scarcely insult her and were welcome into the neighbourhood . And<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>was welcome to bring whom he would into the neighbourhood . Therefore<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>was welcome to bring the Emersons into the neighbourhood . But , as I say , this took a little thinking , and — so illogical are girls — the event remained rather greater and rather more dreadful than it should have done . She was glad that a visit to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>now fell due ; the tenants moved into Cissie Villa while she was safe in the London flat .</p>
     <p n="1142"><said who="#Mrs._Vyse">“<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>—<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>darling , ”</said>she whispered the evening she arrived , and crept into his arms .</p>
     <p n="1143"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, too , became demonstrative . He saw that the needful fire had been kindled in<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. At last she longed for attention , as a woman should , and looked up to him because he was a man .</p>
     <p n="1144"><said who="#Lucy">“ So you do love me , little thing ? ”</said>he murmured .</p>
     <p n="1145"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, I do , I do ! I do n't know what I should do without you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1146">Several days passed . Then she had a letter from<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>. A coolness had sprung up between the two cousins , and they had not corresponded since they parted in August . The coolness dated from what<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>would call “ the flight to Rome , ” and in Rome it had increased amazingly . For the companion who is merely uncongenial in the mediaeval world becomes exasperating in the classical .<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, unselfish in the Forum , would have tried a sweeter temper than<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s , and once , in the Baths of Caracalla , they had doubted whether they could continue their tour .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had said she would join the Vyses —<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>was an acquaintance of her mother , so there was no impropriety in the plan and<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>had replied that she was quite used to being abandoned suddenly . Finally nothing happened ; but the coolness remained , and , for<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, was even increased when she opened the letter and read as follows . It had been forwarded from Windy Corner .</p>
     <p n="1147"><said who="#Lucy">“ Tunbridge Wells ,</said></p>

     <p n="1149"><said who="#Lucy">“ Dearest<persName corresp="#Lucia">Lucia</persName>,</said></p>
     <p n="1150"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I have news of you at last !<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>has been bicycling in your parts , but was not sure whether a call would be welcome . Puncturing her tire near Summer Street , and it being mended while she sat very woebegone in that pretty churchyard , she saw to her astonishment , a door open opposite and the younger<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>man come out . He said his father had just taken the house . He SAID he did not know that you lived in the neighbourhood (? ) . He never suggested giving<persName corresp="#Eleanor">Eleanor</persName>a cup of tea . Dear<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, I am much worried , and I advise you to make a clean breast of his past behaviour to your mother ,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>, who will forbid him to enter the house , etc . That was a great misfortune , and I dare say you have told them already .<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>is so sensitive . I remember how I used to get on his nerves at Rome . I am very sorry about it all , and should not feel easy unless I warned you .</said></p>
     <p n="1151"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Believe me ,</said></p>
     <p n="1152"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Your anxious and loving cousin ,</said></p>

     <p n="1154"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was much annoyed , and replied as follows :</p>
     <p n="1155"><said who="#Lucy">“ Beauchamp Mansions , S. W .</said></p>
     <p n="1156"><said who="#Lucy">“ Dear<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>,</said></p>
     <p n="1157"><said who="#Lucy">“ Many thanks for your warning . When<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>forgot himself on the mountain , you made me promise not to tell mother , because you said she would blame you for not being always with me . I have kept that promise , and cannot possibly tell her now . I have said both to her and<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>that I met the Emersons at Florence , and that they are respectable people — which I do think — and the reason that he offered<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>no tea was probably that he had none himself . She should have tried at the Rectory . I cannot begin making a fuss at this stage . You must see that it would be too absurd . If the Emersons heard I had complained of them , they would think themselves of importance , which is exactly what they are not . I like the old father , and look forward to seeing him again . As for the son , I am sorry for him when we meet , rather than for myself . They are known to<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, who is very well and spoke of you the other day . We expect to be married in January .</said></p>
     <p n="1158"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>cannot have told you much about me , for I am not at Windy Corner at all , but here . Please do not put ‘ Private ’ outside your envelope again . No one opens my letters .</said></p>
     <p n="1159"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yours affectionately ,</said></p>
     <p n="1160"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ L. M.<persName corresp="#Freddy">Honeychurch</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1161">Secrecy has this disadvantage : we lose the sense of proportion ; we cannot tell whether our secret is important or not . Were<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>and her cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s life if he discovered it , or with a little thing which he would laugh at ?<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>suggested the former . Perhaps she was right . It had become a great thing now . Left to herself ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>would have told her mother and her lover ingenuously , and it would have remained a little thing .<said who="#Cecil">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>, not Harris ”</said>; it was only that a few weeks ago . She tried to tell<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>even now when they were laughing about some beautiful lady who had smitten his heart at school . But her body behaved so ridiculously that she stopped .</p>
     <p n="1162">She and her secret stayed ten days longer in the deserted Metropolis visiting the scenes they were to know so well later on . It did her no harm ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>thought , to learn the framework of society , while society itself was absent on the golf-links or the moors . The weather was cool , and it did her no harm . In spite of the season ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>managed to scrape together a dinner-party consisting entirely of the grandchildren of famous people . The food was poor , but the talk had a witty weariness that impressed the girl . One was tired of everything , it seemed . One launched into enthusiasms only to collapse gracefully , and pick oneself up amid sympathetic laughter . In this atmosphere the Pension Bertolini and Windy Corner appeared equally crude , and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>saw that her London career would estrange her a little from all that she had loved in the past .</p>
     <p n="1163">The grandchildren asked her to play the piano .</p>
     <p n="1164">She played<persName corresp="#Schumann">Schumann</persName>. “ Now some<persName corresp="#Beethoven">Beethoven</persName>” called<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, when the querulous beauty of the music had died . She shook her head and played<persName corresp="#Schumann">Schumann</persName>again . The melody rose , unprofitably magical . It broke ; it was resumed broken , not marching once from the cradle to the grave . The sadness of the incomplete — the sadness that is often Life , but should never be Art — throbbed in its disjected phrases , and made the nerves of the audience throb . Not thus had she played on the little draped piano at the Bertolini , and “ Too much<persName corresp="#Schumann">Schumann</persName>” was not the remark that<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>had passed to himself when she returned .</p>
     <p n="1165">When the guests were gone , and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had gone to bed ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>paced up and down the drawing-room , discussing her little party with her son .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>was a nice woman , but her personality , like many another 's , had been swamped by London , for it needs a strong head to live among many people . The too vast orb of her fate had crushed her ; and she had seen too many seasons , too many cities , too many men , for her abilities , and even with<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>she was mechanical , and behaved as if he was not one son , but , so to speak , a filial crowd .</p>
     <p n="1166"><said who="#Mrs._Vyse">“ Make<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>one of us , ”</said>she said , looking round intelligently at the end of each sentence , and straining her lips apart until she spoke again .<said who="#Mrs._Vyse">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>is becoming wonderful — wonderful . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1167"><said who="#Cecil">“ Her music always was wonderful . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1168"><said who="#Mrs._Vyse">“ Yes , but she is purging off the<persName corresp="#Freddy">Honeychurch</persName>taint , most excellent Honeychurches , but you know what I mean . She is not always quoting servants , or asking one how the pudding is made . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1169"><said who="#Cecil">“ Italy has done it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1170"><said who="#Mrs._Vyse">“ Perhaps , ”</said>she murmured , thinking of the museum that represented Italy to her .<said who="#Mrs._Vyse">“ It is just possible .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, mind you marry her next January . She is one of us already . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1171"><said who="#Cecil">“ But her music ! ”</said>he exclaimed .<said who="#Cecil">“ The style of her ! How she kept to<persName corresp="#Schumann">Schumann</persName>when , like an idiot , I wanted<persName corresp="#Beethoven">Beethoven</persName>.<persName corresp="#Schumann">Schumann</persName>was right for this evening .<persName corresp="#Schumann">Schumann</persName>was the thing . Do you know , mother , I shall have our children educated just like<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. Bring them up among honest country folks for freshness , send them to Italy for subtlety , and then — not till then — let them come to London . I do n't believe in these London educations — ”</said>He broke off , remembering that he had had one himself , and concluded ,<said who="#Cecil">“ At all events , not for women . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1172"><said who="#Mrs._Vyse">“ Make her one of us , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>, and processed to bed .</p>
     <p n="1173">As she was dozing off , a cry — the cry of nightmare — rang from<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s room .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>could ring for the maid if she liked but<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>thought it kind to go herself . She found the girl sitting upright with her hand on her cheek .</p>
     <p n="1174"><said who="#Lucy">“ I am so sorry ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>— it is these dreams . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1175"><said who="#Mrs._Vyse">“ Bad dreams ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1176"><said who="#Lucy">“ Just dreams . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1177">The elder lady smiled and kissed her , saying very distinctly :<said who="#Mrs._Vyse">“ You should have heard us talking about you , dear . He admires you more than ever . Dream of that . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1178"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>returned the kiss , still covering one cheek with her hand .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Mrs. Vyse</persName>recessed to bed .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, whom the cry had not awoke , snored . Darkness enveloped the flat .</p>

     <p n="1179">It was a Saturday afternoon , gay and brilliant after abundant rains , and the spirit of youth dwelt in it , though the season was now autumn . All that was gracious triumphed . As the motorcars passed through Summer Street they raised only a little dust , and their stench was soon dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or of the pines .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, at leisure for life 's amenities , leant over his Rectory gate .<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>leant by him , smoking a pendant pipe .</p>

     <p n="1183"><persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, whom his fellow-creatures never amused , suggested that the new people might be feeling a bit busy , and so on , since they had only just moved in .</p>
     <p n="1184"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I suggested we should hinder them , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ They are worth it . ”</said>Unlatching the gate , he sauntered over the triangular green to Cissie Villa .<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Hullo ! ”</said>he cried , shouting in at the open door , through which much squalor was visible .</p>
     <p n="1185">A grave voice replied ,<said who="#Freddy">“ Hullo ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1186"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I 've brought some one to see you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1187"><said who="#Freddy">“ I 'll be down in a minute . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1188">The passage was blocked by a wardrobe , which the removal men had failed to carry up the stairs .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>edged round it with difficulty . The sitting-room itself was blocked with books .</p>
     <p n="1189"><said who="#Freddy">“ Are these people great readers ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>whispered .<said who="#Freddy">“ Are they that sort ? ”</said></p>

     <p n="1212">Then<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth .

     <p n="1230"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>bowed his head , dusty and sombre , exhaling the peculiar smell of one who has handled furniture .</p>

     <p n="1233"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>felt bound to assist his young friend , and led the way out of the house and into the pine-woods . How glorious it was ! For a little time the voice of old<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>pursued them dispensing good wishes and philosophy . It ceased , and they only heard the fair wind blowing the bracken and the trees .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, who could be silent , but who could not bear silence , was compelled to chatter , since the expedition looked like a failure , and neither of his companions would utter a word .

     <p n="1234"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ And what a coincidence that you should meet<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>! Did you realize that you would find all the Pension Bertolini down here ? ”</said></p>

     <p n="1247"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject . But he was infinitely tolerant of the young , and had no desire to snub<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>.</p>

     <p n="1249">Silence .</p>
     <p n="1250">Wishing to round off the episode , he added ;<said who="#George_Emerson">“ We are all so glad that you have come . ”</said></p>

     <p n="1253"><said who="#Freddy">“ Oh , good ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, mopping his brow .</p>
     <p n="1254"><said who="#Freddy">“ In there 's the pond . I wish it was bigger , ”</said>he added apologetically .</p>
     <p n="1255">They climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles . There lay the pond , set in its little alp of green — only a pond , but large enough to contain the human body , and pure enough to reflect the sky . On account of the rains , the waters had flooded the surrounding grass , which showed like a beautiful emerald path , tempting these feet towards the central pool .</p>
     <p n="1256"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ It 's distinctly successful , as ponds go , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ No apologies are necessary for the pond . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1257"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>sat down where the ground was dry , and drearily unlaced his boots .</p>
     <p n="1258"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Are n't those masses of willow-herb splendid ? I love willow-herb in seed . What 's the name of this aromatic plant ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1259">No one knew , or seemed to care .</p>
     <p n="1260"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ These abrupt changes of vegetation — this little spongeous tract of water plants , and on either side of it all the growths are tough or brittle — heather , bracken , hurts , pines . Very charming , very charming .</said></p>
     <p n="1261"><said who="#Freddy">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, are n't you bathing ? ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, as he stripped himself .</p>
     <p n="1262"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>thought he was not .</p>
     <p n="1263"><said who="#Freddy">“ Water 's wonderful ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, prancing in .</p>
     <p n="1264"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Water 's water , ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>. Wetting his hair first — a sure sign of apathy — he followed<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>into the divine , as indifferent as if he were a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds . It was necessary to use his muscles . It was necessary to keep clean .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>watched them , and watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their heads .</p>
     <p n="1265"><said who="#Freddy">“ Apooshoo , apooshoo , apooshoo , ”</said>went<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, swimming for two strokes in either direction , and then becoming involved in reeds or mud .</p>
     <p n="1266"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Is it worth it ? ”</said>asked the other , Michelangelesque on the flooded margin .</p>
     <p n="1267">The bank broke away , and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the question properly .</p>
     <p n="1268"><said who="#Freddy">“ Hee-poof — I 've swallowed a pollywog ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, water 's wonderful , water 's simply ripping . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1269"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Water 's not so bad , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, reappearing from his plunge , and sputtering at the sun .</p>
     <p n="1270"><said who="#Freddy">“ Water 's wonderful .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, do . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1271"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Apooshoo , kouf . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1272"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, who was hot , and who always acquiesced where possible , looked around him . He could detect no parishioners except the pine-trees , rising up steeply on all sides , and gesturing to each other against the blue . How glorious it was ! The world of motor-cars and rural Deans receded inimitably . Water , sky , evergreens , a wind — these things not even the seasons can touch , and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of man ?</p>
     <p n="1273"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I may as well wash too ”</said>; and soon his garments made a third little pile on the sward , and he too asserted the wonder of the water .</p>
     <p n="1274">It was ordinary water , nor was there very much of it , and , as<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>said , it reminded one of swimming in a salad . The three gentlemen rotated in the pool breast high , after the fashion of the nymphs in Gotterdammerung . But either because the rains had given a freshness or because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat , or because two of the gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit — for some reason or other a change came over them , and they forgot Italy and Botany and<persName corresp="#Fate">Fate</persName>. They began to play .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>and<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>splashed each other . A little deferentially , they splashed<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>. He was quiet : they feared they had offended him . Then all the forces of youth burst out . He smiled , flung himself at them , splashed them , ducked them , kicked them , muddied them , and drove them out of the pool .</p>
     <p n="1275"><said who="#Freddy">“ Race you round it , then , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, and they raced in the sunshine , and<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>took a short cut and dirtied his shins , and had to bathe a second time . Then<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>consented to run — a memorable sight .</p>
     <p n="1276">They ran to get dry , they bathed to get cool , they played at being Indians in the willow-herbs and in the bracken , they bathed to get clean . And all the time three little bundles lay discreetly on the sward , proclaiming :</p>
     <p n="1277"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ No . We are what matters . Without us shall no enterprise begin . To us shall all flesh turn in the end . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1278"><said who="#Freddy">“ A try ! A try ! ”</said>yelled<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, snatching up<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>'s bundle and placing it beside an imaginary goal-post .</p>
     <p n="1279"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Socker rules , ”</said><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>retorted , scattering<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>'s bundle with a kick .</p>
     <p n="1280"><said who="#Freddy">“ Goal ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1281"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Goal ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1282"><said who="#Freddy">“ Pass ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1283"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Take care my watch ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1284">Clothes flew in all directions .</p>
     <p n="1285"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Take care my hat ! No , that 's enough ,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>. Dress now . No , I say ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1286">But the two young men were delirious . Away they twinkled into the trees ,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>with a clerical waistcoat under his arm ,<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>with a wide-awake hat on his dripping hair .</p>
     <p n="1287"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ That 'll do ! ”</said>shouted<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, remembering that after all he was in his own parish . Then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a Rural Dean .<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Hi ! Steady on ! I see people coming you fellows ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1288">Yells , and widening circles over the dappled earth .</p>
     <p n="1289"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Hi ! hi ! LADIES ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1290">Neither<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>nor<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>was truly refined . Still , they did not hear<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s last warning or they would have avoided<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, who were walking down to call on old<persName corresp="#Mrs._Butterworth">Mrs. Butterworth</persName>.<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>dropped the waistcoat at their feet , and dashed into some bracken .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>whooped in their faces , turned and scudded away down the path to the pond , still clad in<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s hat .</p>
     <p n="1291"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Gracious alive ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Whoever were those unfortunate people ? Oh , dears , look away ! And poor<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, too ! Whatever has happened ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1292"><said who="#Cecil">“ Come this way immediately , ”</said>commanded<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, who always felt that he must lead women , though knew not whither , and protect them , though he knew not against what . He led them now towards the bracken where<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>sat concealed .</p>
     <p n="1293"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Oh , poor<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>! Was that his waistcoat we left in the path ?<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s waistcoat — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1294">No business of ours , said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, glancing at<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, who was all parasol and evidently “ minded . ”</p>
     <p n="1295"><said who="#Cecil">“ I fancy<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>jumped back into the pond . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1296"><said who="#Lucy">“ This way , please ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, this way . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1297">They followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions .</p>
     <p n="1298"><said who="#Freddy">“ Well , I can n't help it , ”</said>said a voice close ahead , and<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>reared a freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds .<said who="#Freddy">“ I can n't be trodden on , can I ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1299"><said who="#Cecil">“ Good gracious me , dear ; so it 's you ! What miserable management ! Why not have a comfortable bath at home , with hot and cold laid on ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1300"><said who="#Freddy">“ Look here , mother , a fellow must wash , and a fellow 's got to dry , and if another fellow — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1301"><said who="#Cecil">“ Dear , no doubt you 're right as usual , but you are in no position to argue .

How unfortunate again — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1302">For<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>was just crawling out of the pond , On whose surface garments of an intimate nature did float ; while<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, the world-weary<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, shouted to<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>that he had hooked a fish .</p>
     <p n="1303"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ And me , I 've swallowed one , ”</said>answered he of the bracken .<said>“ I 've swallowed a pollywog . It wriggleth in my tummy . I shall die —<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>you beast , you 've got on my bags . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1304"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Hush , dears , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, who found it impossible to remain shocked .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ And do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first .

     <p n="1307">He regarded himself as dressed . Barefoot , bare-chested , radiant and personable against the shadowy woods , he called :</p>

     <p n="1310"><persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>bowed .</p>
     <p n="1311">That evening and all that night the water ran away . On the morrow the pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory . It had been a call to the blood and to the relaxed will , a passing benediction whose influence did not pass , a holiness , a spell , a momentary chalice for youth .</p>

     <head type="chapter">Chapter XIII : How Miss Bartlett 's Boiler Was So Tiresome</head>
     <p n="1312">How often had<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>rehearsed this bow , this interview ! But she had always rehearsed them indoors , and with certain accessories , which surely we have a right to assume . Who could foretell that she and<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>would meet in the rout of a civilization , amidst an army of coats and collars and boots that lay wounded over the sunlit earth ? She had imagined a young<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, who might be shy or morbid or indifferent or furtively impudent . She was prepared for all of these . But she had never imagined one who would be happy and greet her with the shout of the morning star .</p>
     <p n="1313">Indoors herself , partaking of tea with old<persName corresp="#Mrs._Butterworth">Mrs. Butterworth</persName>, she reflected that it is impossible to foretell the future with any degree of accuracy , that it is impossible to rehearse life . A fault in the scenery , a face in the audience , an irruption of the audience on to the stage , and all our carefully planned gestures mean nothing , or mean too much .<said who="#Mrs._Butterworth">“ I will bow , ”</said>she had thought .<said who="#Mrs._Butterworth">“ I will not shake hands with him . That will be just the proper thing . ”</said>She had bowed — but to whom ? To gods , to heroes , to the nonsense of school-girls ! She had bowed across the rubbish that cumbers the world .</p>
     <p n="1314">So ran her thoughts , while her faculties were busy with<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>. It was another of those dreadful engagement calls .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Butterworth">Mrs. Butterworth</persName>had wanted to see him , and he did not want to be seen . He did not want to hear about hydrangeas , why they change their colour at the seaside . He did not want to join the C. O. S. When cross he was always elaborate , and made long , clever answers where “ Yes ” or “ No ” would have done .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>soothed him and tinkered at the conversation in a way that promised well for their married peace . No one is perfect , and surely it is wiser to discover the imperfections before wedlock .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, indeed , though not in word , had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing satisfactory .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, though she disliked the teacher , regarded the teaching as profound , and applied it to her lover .</p>
     <p n="1315"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, ”</said>said her mother , when they got home ,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ is anything the matter with<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1316">The question was ominous ; up till now<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>had behaved with charity and restraint .</p>
     <p n="1317"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ No , I do n't think so , mother ;<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s all right . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1318"><said who="#Lucy">“ Perhaps he 's tired . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1319"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>compromised : perhaps<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>was a little tired .</p>
     <p n="1320"><said who="#Cecil">“ Because otherwise ”</said>— she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering displeasure —<said who="#Cecil">“ because otherwise I cannot account for him . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1321"><said who="#Lucy">“ I do think<persName corresp="#Mrs._Butterworth">Mrs. Butterworth</persName>is rather tiresome , if you mean that . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1322"><said>“<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>has told you to think so . You were devoted to her as a little girl , and nothing will describe her goodness to you through the typhoid fever . No — it is just the same thing everywhere . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1323"><said who="#Lucy">“ Let me just put your bonnet away , may I ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1324"><said who="#Cecil">“ Surely he could answer her civilly for one half-hour ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1325"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>has a very high standard for people , ”</said>faltered<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, seeing trouble ahead .<said who="#Lucy">“ It 's part of his ideals — it is really that that makes him sometimes seem — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1326"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Oh , rubbish ! If high ideals make a young man rude , the sooner he gets rid of them the better , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, handing her the bonnet .</p>
     <p n="1327"><said who="#Lucy">“ Now , mother ! I 've seen you cross with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Butterworth">Mrs. Butterworth</persName>yourself ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1328"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Not in that way . At times I could wring her neck . But not in that way . No . It is the same with<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>all over . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1329"><said who="#Lucy">“ By-the-by — I never told you . I had a letter from<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>while I was away in London . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1330">This attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile , and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>resented it .</p>
     <p n="1331"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Since<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>came back from London , nothing appears to please him . Whenever I speak he winces ;— I see him ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>; it is useless to contradict me . No doubt I am neither artistic nor literary nor intellectual nor musical , but I cannot help the drawing-room furniture ; your father bought it and we must put up with it , will<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>kindly remember . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1332"><said who="#Lucy">“ I — I see what you mean , and certainly<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>ought n't to . But he does not mean to be uncivil — he once explained — it is the things that upset him — he is easily upset by ugly things — he is not uncivil to PEOPLE . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1333"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Is it a thing or a person when<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>sings ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1334"><said who="#Lucy">“ You can n't expect a really musical person to enjoy comic songs as we do . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1335"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Then why did n't he leave the room ? Why sit wriggling and sneering and spoiling everyone 's pleasure ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1336"><said who="#Lucy">“ We must n't be unjust to people , ”</said>faltered<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. Something had enfeebled her , and the case for<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, which she had mastered so perfectly in London , would not come forth in an effective form . The two civilizations had clashed —<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>hinted that they might — and she was dazzled and bewildered , as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization had blinded her eyes . Good taste and bad taste were only catchwords , garments of diverse cut ; and music itself dissolved to a whisper through pine-trees , where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song .</p>
     <p n="1337">She remained in much embarrassment , while<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>changed her frock for dinner ; and every now and then she said a word , and made things no better . There was no concealing the fact ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>had meant to be supercilious , and he had succeeded . And<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>— she knew not why — wished that the trouble could have come at any other time .</p>
     <p n="1338"><said who="#Lucy">“ Go and dress , dear ; you 'll be late . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1339"><said who="#Cecil">“ All right , mother — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1340"><said who="#Lucy">“ Do n't say ‘ All right ’ and stop . Go . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1341">She obeyed , but loitered disconsolately at the landing window . It faced north , so there was little view , and no view of the sky . Now , as in the winter , the pine-trees hung close to her eyes . One connected the landing window with depression . No definite problem menaced her , but she sighed to herself ,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Oh , dear , what shall I do , what shall I do ? ”</said>It seemed to her that every one else was behaving very badly . And she ought not to have mentioned<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>'s letter . She must be more careful ; her mother was rather inquisitive , and might have asked what it was about . Oh , dear , should she do ?— and then<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>came bounding up-stairs , and joined the ranks of the ill-behaved .</p>
     <p n="1342"><said who="#Lucy">“ I say , those are topping people . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1343"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ My dear baby , how tiresome you 've been ! You have no business to take them bathing in the Sacred it 's much too public . It was all right for you but most awkward for every one else . Do be more careful . You forget the place is growing half suburban . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1344"><said who="#Lucy">“ I say , is anything on to-morrow week ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1345"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Not that I know of . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1346"><said who="#Lucy">“ Then I want to ask the Emersons up to Sunday tennis . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1347"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Oh , I would n't do that ,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, I would n't do that with all this muddle . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1348"><said who="#Freddy">“ What 's wrong with the court ? They wo n't mind a bump or two , and I 've ordered new balls . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1349"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I meant it 's better not . I really mean it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1350">He seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the passage . She pretended not to mind , but she could have screamed with temper .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they impeded Mary with her brood of hot-water cans . Then<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>opened her door and said :<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, what a noise you 're making ! I have something to say to you . Did you say you had had a letter from<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>? ”</said>and<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>ran away .</p>

     <p n="1352"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ How 's<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1353"><said who="#Lucy">“ All right . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1354"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1355">The unfortunate girl returned .</p>
     <p n="1356"><said who="#Freddy">“ You 've a bad habit of hurrying away in the middle of one 's sentences . Did<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>mention her boiler ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1357"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Her WHAT ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1358"><said who="#Freddy">“ Do n't you remember that her boiler was to be had out in October , and her bath cistern cleaned out , and all kinds of terrible to-doings ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1359"><said who="#Lucy">“ I can n't remember all<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>'s worries , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>bitterly .<said who="#Lucy">“ I shall have enough of my own , now that you are not pleased with<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1360"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>might have flamed out . She did not . She said :<said who="#Lucy">“ Come here , old lady — thank you for putting away my bonnet — kiss me . ”</said>And , though nothing is perfect ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>felt for the moment that her mother and Windy Corner and the Weald in the declining sun were perfect .</p>
     <p n="1361">So the grittiness went out of life . It generally did at Windy Corner . At the last minute , when the social machine was clogged hopelessly , one member or other of the family poured in a drop of oil .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>despised their methods — perhaps rightly . At all events , they were not his own .</p>
     <p n="1362">Dinner was at half-past seven .<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>gabbled the grace , and they drew up their heavy chairs and fell to . Fortunately , the men were hungry . Nothing untoward occurred until the pudding . Then<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>said :</p>
     <p n="1363"><said who="#Freddy">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, what 's<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>like ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1364"><said who="#Lucy">“ I saw him in Florence , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, hoping that this would pass for a reply .</p>
     <p n="1365"><said who="#Freddy">“ Is he the clever sort , or is he a decent chap ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1366"><said who="#Lucy">“ Ask<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>; it is<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>who brought him here . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1367"><said who="#Cecil">“ He is the clever sort , like myself , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1368"><persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>looked at him doubtfully .</p>
     <p n="1369"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ How well did you know them at the Bertolini ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1370"><said who="#Freddy">“ Oh , very slightly . I mean ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>knew them even less than I did . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1371"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Oh , that reminds me — you never told me what<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>said in her letter . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1372"><said who="#Lucy">“ One thing and another , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, wondering whether she would get through the meal without a lie .<said who="#Lucy">“ Among other things , that an awful friend of hers had been bicycling through Summer Street , wondered if she 'd come up and see us , and mercifully did n't . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1373"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, I do call the way you talk unkind . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1374"><said who="#Lucy">“ She was a novelist , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>craftily . The remark was a happy one , for nothing roused<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>so much as literature in the hands of females . She would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women who ( instead of minding their houses and their children ) seek notoriety by print . Her attitude was : “ If books must be written , let them be written by men ” ; and she developed it at great length , while<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>yawned and<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>played at “ This year , next year , now , never , ” with his plum-stones , and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>artfully fed the flames of her mother 's wrath . But soon the conflagration died down , and the ghosts began to gather in the darkness . There were too many ghosts about . The original ghost — that touch of lips on her cheek — had surely been laid long ago ; it could be nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once . But it had begotten a spectral family — Mr. Harris ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>'s letter ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s memories of violets — and one or other of these was bound to haunt her before<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s very eyes . It was<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>who returned now , and with appalling vividness .</p>
     <p n="1375"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I have been thinking ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, of that letter of<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>'s . How is she ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1376"><said who="#Lucy">“ I tore the thing up . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1377"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Did n't she say how she was ? How does she sound ? Cheerful ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1378"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , yes I suppose so — no — not very cheerful , I suppose . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1379"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Then , depend upon it , it IS the boiler . I know myself how water preys upon one 's mind . I would rather anything else — even a misfortune with the meat . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1380"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>laid his hand over his eyes .</p>
     <p n="1381"><said who="#Freddy">“ So would I , ”</said>asserted<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, backing his mother up — backing up the spirit of her remark rather than the substance .</p>
     <p n="1382"><said who="#Freddy">“ And I have been thinking , ”</said>she added rather nervously ,<said who="#Freddy">“ surely we could squeeze<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>in here next week , and give her a nice holiday while plumbers at Tunbridge Wells finish . I have not seen poor<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>for so long . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1383">It was more than her nerves could stand . And she could not protest violently after her mother 's goodness to her upstairs .</p>
     <p n="1384"><said who="#Freddy">“ Mother , no ! ”</said>she pleaded .<said>“ It 's impossible . We can n't have<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>on the top of the other things ; we 're squeezed to death as it is .<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>'s got a friend coming Tuesday , there 's<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, and you 've promised to take in<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>Beebe because of the diphtheria scare . It simply can n't be done . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1385"><said who="#Freddy">“ Nonsense ! It can . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1386"><said who="#Cecil">“ If<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>sleeps in the bath . Not otherwise . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1387"><said who="#Freddy">“<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>can sleep with you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1388"><said who="#Cecil">“ I wo n't have her . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1389"><said>“ Then , if you 're so selfish ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Floyd">Mr. Floyd</persName>must share a room with<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1390"><said who="#Cecil">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>,<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>,<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, ”</said>moaned<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, again laying his hand over his eyes .</p>
     <p n="1391"><said who="#Lucy">“ It 's impossible , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.<said who="#Lucy">“ I do n't want to make difficulties , but it really is n't fair on the maids to fill up the house so . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1392">Alas !</p>
     <p n="1393"><said who="#Lucy">“ The truth is , dear , you do n't like<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1394"><said who="#Lucy">“ No , I do n't . And no more does<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>. She gets on our nerves . You have n't seen her lately , and do n't realize how tiresome she can be , though so good . So please , mother , do n't worry us this last summer ; but spoil us by not asking her to come . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1395"><said who="#Cecil">“ Hear , hear ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1396"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, with more gravity than usual , and with more feeling than she usually permitted herself , replied :<said who="#Lucy">“ This is n't very kind of you two . You have each other and all these woods to walk in , so full of beautiful things ; and poor<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>has only the water turned off and plumbers . You are young , dears , and however clever young people are , and however many books they read , they will never guess what it feels like to grow old . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1397"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>crumbled his bread .</p>
     <p n="1398"><said who="#Freddy">“ I must say Cousin<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>was very kind to me that year I called on my bike , ”</said>put in<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>.<said who="#Freddy">“ She thanked me for coming till I felt like such a fool , and fussed round no end to get an egg boiled for my tea just right . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1399"><said who="#Cecil">“ I know , dear . She is kind to every one , and yet<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>makes this difficulty when we try to give her some little return . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1400">But<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>hardened her heart . It was no good being kind to<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>. She had tried herself too often and too recently . One might lay up treasure in heaven by the attempt , but one enriched neither<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>nor any one else upon earth . She was reduced to saying :<said who="#Freddy">“ I can n't help it , mother . I do n't like<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>. I admit it 's horrid of me . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1401"><said who="#Cecil">“ From your own account , you told her as much . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1402"><said who="#Freddy">“ Well , she would leave Florence so stupidly . She flurried — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1403">The ghosts were returning ; they filled Italy , they were even usurping the places she had known as a child . The Sacred Lake would never be the same again , and , on Sunday week , something would even happen to Windy Corner . How would she fight against ghosts ? For a moment the visible world faded away , and memories and emotions alone seemed real .</p>
     <p n="1404"><said who="#Cecil">“ I suppose<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>must come , since she boils eggs so well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, who was in rather a happier frame of mind , thanks to the admirable cooking .</p>
     <p n="1405"><said who="#Freddy">“ I did n't mean the egg was WELL boiled , ”</said>corrected<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>,<said who="#Freddy">“ because in point of fact she forgot to take it off , and as a matter of fact I do n't care for eggs . I only meant how jolly kind she seemed . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1406"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>frowned again . Oh , these Honeychurches ! Eggs , boilers , hydrangeas , maids — of such were their lives compact .<said who="#Cecil">“ May me and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>get down from our chairs ? ”</said>he asked , with scarcely veiled insolence .<said who="#Cecil">“ We do n't want no dessert . ”</said></p>

     <head type="chapter">Chapter XIV : How Lucy Faced the External Situation Bravely</head>
     <p n="1407">Of course<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>accepted . And , equally of course , she felt sure that she would prove a nuisance , and begged to be given an inferior spare room — something with no view , anything . Her love to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. And , equally of course ,<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>could come to tennis on the Sunday week .</p>
     <p n="1408"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>faced the situation bravely , though , like most of us , she only faced the situation that encompassed her . She never gazed inwards . If at times strange images rose from the depths , she put them down to nerves . When<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>brought the Emersons to Summer Street , it had upset her nerves .<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>would burnish up past foolishness , and this might upset her nerves . She was nervous at night . When she talked to<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>— they met again almost immediately at the Rectory — his voice moved her deeply , and she wished to remain near him . How dreadful if she really wished to remain near him ! Of course , the wish was due to nerves , which love to play such perverse tricks upon us . Once she had suffered from “ things that came out of nothing and meant she did n't know what . ” Now<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>had explained psychology to her one wet afternoon , and all the troubles of youth in an unknown world could be dismissed .</p>
     <p n="1409">It is obvious enough for the reader to conclude ,<said who="#Lucy">“ She loves young<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>. ”</said>A reader in<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s place would not find it obvious . Life is easy to chronicle , but bewildering to practice , and we welcome “ nerves ” or any other shibboleth that will cloak our personal desire . She loved<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>;<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>made her nervous ; will the reader explain to her that the phrases should have been reversed ?</p>
     <p n="1410">But the external situation — she will face that bravely .</p>
     <p n="1411">The meeting at the Rectory had passed off well enough . Standing between<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>and<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, she had made a few temperate allusions to Italy , and<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>had replied . She was anxious to show that she was not shy , and was glad that he did not seem shy either .</p>
     <p n="1412"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ A nice fellow , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>afterwards “ He will work off his crudities in time . I rather mistrust young men who slip into life gracefully . ”</p>
     <p n="1413"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>said ,<said who="#Lucy">“ He seems in better spirits . He laughs more . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1414"><said who="#the_clergyman">“ Yes , ”</said>replied the clergyman .<said who="#the_clergyman">“ He is waking up . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1415">That was all . But , as the week wore on , more of her defences fell , and she entertained an image that had physical beauty . In spite of the clearest directions ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>contrived to bungle her arrival . She was due at the South-Eastern station at Dorking , whither<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>drove to meet her . She arrived at the London and Brighton station , and had to hire a cab up . No one was at home except<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>and his friend , who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for a solid hour .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>turned up at four o'clock , and these , with little<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>Beebe , made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper lawn for tea .</p>
     <p n="1416"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I shall never forgive myself , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, who kept on rising from her seat , and had to be begged by the united company to remain .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I have upset everything . Bursting in on young people ! But I insist on paying for my cab up . Grant that , at any rate . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1417"><said who="#Lucy">“ Our visitors never do such dreadful things , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, while her brother , in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial , exclaimed in irritable tones :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Just what I 've been trying to convince Cousin<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>of ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, for the last half hour . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1418"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I do not feel myself an ordinary visitor , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, and looked at her frayed glove .</p>
     <p n="1419"><said who="#Lucy">“ All right , if you 'd really rather . Five shillings , and I gave a bob to the driver . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1420"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>looked in her purse . Only sovereigns and pennies . Could any one give her change ?<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>had half a quid and his friend had four half-crowns .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>accepted their moneys and then said :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ But who am I to give the sovereign to ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1421"><said who="#Lucy">“ Let 's leave it all till mother comes back , ”</said>suggested<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1422"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ No , dear ; your mother may take quite a long drive now that she is not hampered with me . We all have our little foibles , and mine is the prompt settling of accounts . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1423">Here<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>'s friend ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Floyd">Mr. Floyd</persName>, made the one remark of his that need be quoted : he offered to toss<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>for<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>'s quid . A solution seemed in sight , and even<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, who had been ostentatiously drinking his tea at the view , felt the eternal attraction of Chance , and turned round .</p>
     <p n="1424">But this did not do , either .</p>
     <p n="1425"><said who="#Cecil">“ Please — please — I know I am a sad spoilsport , but it would make me wretched . I should practically be robbing the one who lost . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1426"><said who="#Cecil">“<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>owes me fifteen shillings , ”</said>interposed<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>.<said who="#Cecil">“ So it will work out right if you give the pound to me . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1427"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Fifteen shillings , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>dubiously .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ How is that ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1428"><said who="#Mr._Vyse">“ Because , do n't you see ,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>paid your cab . Give me the pound , and we shall avoid this deplorable gambling . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1429"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, who was poor at figures , became bewildered and rendered up the sovereign , amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths . For a moment<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>was happy . He was playing at nonsense among his peers . Then he glanced at<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the smiles . In January he would rescue his<persName corresp="#Leonardo">Leonardo</persName>from this stupefying twaddle .</p>
     <p n="1430"><said who="#Beebe">“ But I do n't see that ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>Beebe who had narrowly watched the iniquitous transaction .<said who="#Beebe">“ I do n't see why<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>is to have the quid . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1431"><said who="#Leonardo">“ Because of the fifteen shillings and the five , ”</said>they said solemnly .<said who="#Leonardo">“ Fifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound , you see . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1432"><said who="#Beebe">“ But I do n't see — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1433">They tried to stifle her with cake .</p>
     <p n="1434"><said who="#Beebe">“ No , thank you . I 'm done . I do n't see why —<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, do n't poke me .<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, your brother 's hurting me . Ow ! What about<persName corresp="#Mr._Floyd">Mr. Floyd</persName>'s ten shillings ? Ow ! No , I do n't see and I never shall see why Miss What'shYpppHeNherhYpppHeNname should n't pay that bob for the driver . " ’</said></p>
     <p n="1435"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I had forgotten the driver , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, reddening .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Thank you , dear , for reminding me . A shilling was it ? Can any one give me change for half a crown ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1436"><said who="#Beebe">“ I 'll get it , ”</said>said the young hostess , rising with decision .</p>
     <p n="1437"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, give me that sovereign . No , give me up that sovereign . I 'll get Euphemia to change it , and we 'll start the whole thing again from the beginning . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1438"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>—<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>— what a nuisance I am ! ”</said>protested<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, and followed her across the lawn .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>tripped ahead , simulating hilarity . When they were out of earshot<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>stopped her wails and said quite briskly :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Have you told him about him yet ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1439"><said who="#Lucy">“ No , I have n't , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, and then could have bitten her tongue for understanding so quickly what her cousin meant .<said who="#Lucy">“ Let me see — a sovereign 's worth of silver . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1440">She escaped into the kitchen .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>'s sudden transitions were too uncanny . It sometimes seemed as if she planned every word she spoke or caused to be spoken ; as if all this worry about cabs and change had been a ruse to surprise the soul .</p>
     <p n="1441"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ No , I have n't told<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>or any one , ”</said>she remarked , when she returned .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I promised you I should n't . Here is your money — all shillings , except two half-crowns . Would you count it ? You can settle your debt nicely now . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1442"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>was in the drawing-room , gazing at the photograph of St. John ascending , which had been framed .</p>
     <p n="1443"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ How dreadful ! ”</said>she murmured ,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ how more than dreadful , if<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>should come to hear of it from some other source . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1444"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , no ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, ”</said>said the girl , entering the battle .<said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>is all right , and what other source is there ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1445"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>considered .<said who="#Charlotte">“ For instance , the driver . I saw him looking through the bushes at you , remember he had a violet between his teeth . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1446"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>shuddered a little .<said who="#Lucy">“ We shall get the silly affair on our nerves if we are n't careful . How could a Florentine cab-driver ever get hold of<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1447"><said who="#Charlotte">“ We must think of every possibility . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1448"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , it 's all right . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1449"><said who="#Charlotte">“ Or perhaps old<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>knows . In fact , he is certain to know . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1450"><said who="#Lucy">“ I do n't care if he does . I was grateful to you for your letter , but even if the news does get round , I think I can trust<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>to laugh at it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1451"><said who="#Charlotte">“ To contradict it ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1452"><said who="#Lucy">“ No , to laugh at it . ”</said>But she knew in her heart that she could not trust him , for he desired her untouched .</p>
     <p n="1453"><said who="#Charlotte">“ Very well , dear , you know best . Perhaps gentlemen are different to what they were when I was young . Ladies are certainly different . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1454"><said who="#Lucy">“ Now ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>! ”</said>She struck at her playfully .<said who="#Lucy">“ You kind , anxious thing . What WOULD you have me do ? First you say ‘ Do n't tell ’ ; and then you say , ‘ Tell ’ . Which is it to be ? Quick ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1455"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>sighed “ I am no match for you in conversation , dearest . I blush when I think how I interfered at Florence , and you so well able to look after yourself , and so much cleverer in all ways than I am . You will never forgive me . ”</p>
     <p n="1456"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Shall we go out , then . They will smash all the china if we do n't . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1457">For the air rang with the shrieks of<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>, who was being scalped with a teaspoon .</p>
     <p n="1458"><said who="#Beebe">“ Dear , one moment — we may not have this chance for a chat again . Have you seen the young one yet ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1459"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Yes , I have . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1460"><said who="#Beebe">“ What happened ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1461"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ We met at the Rectory . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1462"><said who="#Beebe">“ What line is he taking up ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1463"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ No line . He talked about Italy , like any other person . It is really all right . What advantage would he get from being a cad , to put it bluntly ? I do wish I could make you see it my way . He really wo n't be any nuisance ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1464"><said who="#Charlotte">“ Once a cad , always a cad . That is my poor opinion . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1465"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>paused .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>said one day — and I thought it so profound — that there are two kinds of cads — the conscious and the subconscious . ”</said>She paused again , to be sure of doing justice to<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s profundity . Through the window she saw<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>himself , turning over the pages of a novel . It was a new one from Smith 's library . Her mother must have returned from the station .</p>
     <p n="1466"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Once a cad , always a cad , ”</said>droned<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1467"><said who="#Cecil">“ What I mean by subconscious is that<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>lost his head . I fell into all those violets , and he was silly and surprised . I do n't think we ought to blame him very much . It makes such a difference when you see a person with beautiful things behind him unexpectedly . It really does ; it makes an enormous difference , and he lost his head : he does n't admire me , or any of that nonsense , one straw .<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>rather likes him , and has asked him up here on Sunday , so you can judge for yourself . He has improved ; he does n't always look as if he 's going to burst into tears . He is a clerk in the General Manager 's office at one of the big railways — not a porter ! and runs down to his father for week-ends . Papa was to do with journalism , but is rheumatic and has retired . There ! Now for the garden . ”</said>She took hold of her guest by the arm .<said who="#Cecil">“ Suppose we do n't talk about this silly Italian business any more . We want you to have a nice restful visit at Windy Corner , with no worriting . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1468"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>thought this rather a good speech . The reader may have detected an unfortunate slip in it . Whether<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>detected the slip one cannot say , for it is impossible to penetrate into the minds of elderly people . She might have spoken further , but they were interrupted by the entrance of her hostess . Explanations took place , and in the midst of them<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>escaped , the images throbbing a little more vividly in her brain .</p>

     <head type="chapter">Chapter XV : The Disaster Within</head>
     <p n="1469">The Sunday after<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>'s arrival was a glorious day , like most of the days of that year . In the Weald , autumn approached , breaking up the green monotony of summer , touching the parks with the grey bloom of mist , the beech-trees with russet , the oak-trees with gold . Up on the heights , battalions of black pines witnessed the change , themselves unchangeable . Either country was spanned by a cloudless sky , and in either arose the tinkle of church bells .</p>
     <p n="1470">The garden of Windy Corners was deserted except for a red book , which lay sunning itself upon the gravel path . From the house came incoherent sounds , as of females preparing for worship .<said who="#Beebe">“ The men say they wo n't go ”</said>— “ Well , I do n't blame them ” —<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>says ,<said who="#Beebe">“ need she go ? ”</said>— “ Tell her , no nonsense ” —<said who="#Beebe">“ Anne ! Mary ! Hook me behind ! ”</said>—<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Dearest<persName corresp="#Lucia">Lucia</persName>, may I trespass upon you for a pin ? ”</said>For<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>had announced that she at all events was one for church .</p>
     <p n="1471">The sun rose higher on its journey , guided , not by<persName corresp="#Phaethon">Phaethon</persName>, but by Apollo , competent , unswerving , divine . Its rays fell on the ladies whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows ; on<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>down at Summer Street as he smiled over a letter from Miss Catharine<persName corresp="#Alan">Alan</persName>; on<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>cleaning his father 's boots ; and lastly , to complete the catalogue of memorable things , on the red book mentioned previously . The ladies move ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>moves ,<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>moves , and movement may engender shadow . But this book lies motionless , to be caressed all the morning by the sun and to raise its covers slightly , as though acknowledging the caress .</p>
     <p n="1472">Presently<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>steps out of the drawing-room window . Her new cerise dress has been a failure , and makes her look tawdry and wan . At her throat is a garnet brooch , on her finger a ring set with rubies — an engagement ring . Her eyes are bent to the Weald . She frowns a little — not in anger , but as a brave child frowns when he is trying not to cry . In all that expanse no human eye is looking at her , and she may frown unrebuked and measure the spaces that yet survive between Apollo and the western hills .</p>
     <p n="1473"><said who="#George_Emerson">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>!<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! What 's that book ? Who 's been taking a book out of the shelf and leaving it about to spoil ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1474"><said who="#Lucy">“ It 's only the library book that<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s been reading . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1475"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ But pick it up , and do n't stand idling there like a flamingo . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1476"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>picked up the book and glanced at the title listlessly , Under a Loggia . She no longer read novels herself , devoting all her spare time to solid literature in the hope of catching<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>up . It was dreadful how little she knew , and even when she thought she knew a thing , like the Italian painters , she found she had forgotten it . Only this morning she had confused Francesco Francia with Piero della Francesca , and<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>had said ,<said who="#Lucy">“ What ! you are n't forgetting your Italy already ? ”</said>And this too had lent anxiety to her eyes when she saluted the dear view and the dear garden in the foreground , and above them , scarcely conceivable elsewhere , the dear sun .</p>
     <p n="1477"><said who="#George_Emerson">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>— have you a sixpence for<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>and a shilling for yourself ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1478">She hastened in to her mother , who was rapidly working herself into a Sunday fluster .</p>
     <p n="1479"><said who="#Cecil">“ It 's a special collection — I forget what for . I do beg , no vulgar clinking in the plate with halfpennies ; see that<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>has a nice bright sixpence . Where is the child ?<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>! That book 's all warped . ( Gracious , how plain you look ! ) Put it under the Atlas to press .<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1480"><said who="#Beebe">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>— ”</said>from the upper regions .</p>
     <p n="1481"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>, do n't be late . Here comes the horse ”</said>— it was always the horse , never the carriage .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Where 's<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>? Run up and hurry her . Why is she so long ? She had nothing to do . She never brings anything but blouses . Poor<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>— How I do detest blouses !<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1482">Paganism is infectious — more infectious than diphtheria or piety — and the Rector 's niece was taken to church protesting . As usual , she did n't see why . Why should n't she sit in the sun with the young men ? The young men , who had now appeared , mocked her with ungenerous words .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>defended orthodoxy , and in the midst of the confusion<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, dressed in the very height of the fashion , came strolling down the stairs .</p>
     <p n="1483"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Dear Marian , I am very sorry , but I have no small change — nothing but sovereigns and half crowns . Could any one give me — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1484"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Yes , easily . Jump in . Gracious me , how smart you look ! What a lovely frock ! You put us all to shame . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1485"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ If I did not wear my best rags and tatters now , when should I wear them ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>reproachfully . She got into the victoria and placed herself with her back to the horse . The necessary roar ensued , and then they drove off .</p>
     <p n="1486"><said who="#Cecil">“ Good-bye ! Be good ! ”</said>called out<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1487"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>bit her lip , for the tone was sneering . On the subject of “ church and so on ” they had had rather an unsatisfactory conversation . He had said that people ought to overhaul themselves , and she did not want to overhaul herself ; she did not know it was done . Honest orthodoxy<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>respected , but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a spiritual crisis ; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright , that might grow heavenward like flowers . All that he said on this subject pained her , though he exuded tolerance from every pore ; somehow the Emersons were different .</p>
     <p n="1488">She saw the Emersons after church . There was a line of carriages down the road , and the<persName corresp="#Freddy">Honeychurch</persName>vehicle happened to be opposite Cissie Villa . To save time , they walked over the green to it , and found father and son smoking in the garden .</p>
     <p n="1489"><said who="#Freddy">“ Introduce me , ”</said>said her mother .<said who="#Freddy">“ Unless the young man considers that he knows me already . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1490">He probably did ; but<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>ignored the Sacred Lake and introduced them formally . Old<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>claimed her with much warmth , and said how glad he was that she was going to be married . She said yes , she was glad too ; and then , as<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>and<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>were lingering behind with<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic , and asked him how he liked his new house .</p>
     <p n="1491"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Very much , ”</said>he replied , but there was a note of offence in his voice ; she had never known him offended before . He added :<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ We find , though , that the Miss Alans were coming , and that we have turned them out . Women mind such a thing . I am very much upset about it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1492"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I believe that there was some misunderstanding , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>uneasily .</p>
     <p n="1493"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Our landlord was told that we should be a different type of person , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further .<said who="#George_Emerson">“ He thought we should be artistic . He is disappointed . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1494"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ And I wonder whether we ought to write to the Miss Alans and offer to give it up . What do you think ? ”</said>He appealed to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1495"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , stop now you have come , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>lightly . She must avoid censuring<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>. For it was on<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>that the little episode turned , though his name was never mentioned .</p>
     <p n="1496"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ So<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>says . He says that the Miss Alans must go to the wall . Yet it does seem so unkind . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1497"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ There is only a certain amount of kindness in the world , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages .</p>
     <p n="1498"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Yes ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ That 's exactly what I say . Why all this twiddling and twaddling over two Miss Alans ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1499"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ There is a certain amount of kindness , just as there is a certain amount of light , ”</said>he continued in measured tones .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand , and it is no good moving from place to place to save things ; because the shadow always follows . Choose a place where you wo n't do harm — yes , choose a place where you wo n't do very much harm , and stand in it for all you are worth , facing the sunshine . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1500"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, I see you 're clever ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1501"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Eh —? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1502"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ I see you 're going to be clever . I hope you did n't go behaving like that to poor<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1503"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>'s eyes laughed , and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>suspected that he and her mother would get on rather well .</p>
     <p n="1504"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ No , I did n't , ”</said>he said .<said who="#George_Emerson">“ He behaved that way to me . It is his philosophy . Only he starts life with it ; and I have tried the Note of Interrogation first . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1505"><said who="#Lucy">“ What DO you mean ? No , never mind what you mean . Do n't explain . He looks forward to seeing you this afternoon . Do you play tennis ? Do you mind tennis on Sunday —? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1506"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>mind tennis on Sunday !<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, after his education , distinguish between Sunday — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1507"><said who="#Lucy">“ Very well ,<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>does n't mind tennis on Sunday . No more do I . That 's settled .<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, if you could come with your son we should be so pleased . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1508">He thanked her , but the walk sounded rather far ; he could only potter about in these days .</p>
     <p n="1509">She turned to<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>:<said who="#Lucy">“ And then he wants to give up his house to the Miss Alans . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1510"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ I know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, and put his arm round his father 's neck . The kindness that<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had always known to exist in him came out suddenly , like sunlight touching a vast landscape — a touch of the morning sun ? She remembered that in all his perversities he had never spoken against affection .</p>
     <p n="1511"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>approached .</p>
     <p n="1512"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ You know our cousin ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>pleasantly .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ You met her with my daughter in Florence . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1513"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Yes , indeed ! ”</said>said the old man , and made as if he would come out of the garden to meet the lady .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>promptly got into the victoria . Thus entrenched , she emitted a formal bow . It was the pension Bertolini again , the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine . It was the old , old battle of the room with the view .</p>
     <p n="1514"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>did not respond to the bow . Like any boy , he blushed and was ashamed ; he knew that the chaperon remembered . He said : “ I — I 'll come up to tennis if I can manage it , ” and went into the house . Perhaps anything that he did would have pleased<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, but his awkwardness went straight to her heart ; men were not gods after all , but as human and as clumsy as girls ; even men might suffer from unexplained desires , and need help . To one of her upbringing , and of her destination , the weakness of men was a truth unfamiliar , but she had surmised it at Florence , when<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>threw her photographs into the River Arno .</p>
     <p n="1515"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, do n't go , ”</said>cried his father , who thought it a great treat for people if his son would talk to them .<said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>has been in such good spirits today , and I am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1516"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>caught her cousin 's eye . Something in its mute appeal made her reckless .<said who="#George_Emerson">“ Yes , ”</said>she said , raising her voice ,<said who="#George_Emerson">“ I do hope he will . ”</said>Then she went to the carriage and murmured ,<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ The old man has n't been told ; I knew it was all right . ”</said><persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>followed her , and they drove away .</p>
     <p n="1517">Satisfactory that<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>had not been told of the Florence escapade ; yet<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had sighted the ramparts of heaven . Satisfactory ; yet surely she greeted it with disproportionate joy . All the way home the horses ’ hoofs sang a tune to her :<said who="#Lucy">“ He has not told , he has not told . ”</said>Her brain expanded the melody :<said who="#Lucy">“ He has not told his father — to whom he tells all things . It was not an exploit . He did not laugh at me when I had gone . ”</said>She raised her hand to her cheek .<said who="#Lucy">“ He does not love me . No . How terrible if he did ! But he has not told . He will not tell . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1518">She longed to shout the words :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ It is all right . It 's a secret between us two for ever .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>will never hear . ”</said>She was even glad that<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>had made her promise secrecy , that last dark evening at Florence , when they had knelt packing in his room . The secret , big or little , was guarded .</p>
     <p n="1519">Only three English people knew of it in the world . Thus she interpreted her joy . She greeted<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>with unusual radiance , because she felt so safe . As he helped her out of the carriage , she said :</p>
     <p n="1520"><said who="#Cecil">“ The Emersons have been so nice .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>has improved enormously . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1521"><said who="#Cecil">“ How are my proteges ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, who took no real interest in them , and had long since forgotten his resolution to bring them to Windy Corner for educational purposes .</p>
     <p n="1522"><said who="#Cecil">“ Proteges ! ”</said>she exclaimed with some warmth . For the only relationship which<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>conceived was feudal : that of protector and protected . He had no glimpse of the comradeship after which the girl 's soul yearned .</p>
     <p n="1523"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ You shall see for yourself how your proteges are .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>is coming up this afternoon . He is a most interesting man to talk to . Only do n't — ”</said>She nearly said ,<said who="#Cecil">“ Do n't protect him . ”</said>But the bell was ringing for lunch , and , as often happened ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>had paid no great attention to her remarks . Charm , not argument , was to be her forte .</p>
     <p n="1524">Lunch was a cheerful meal . Generally<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was depressed at meals . Some one had to be soothed — either<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>or<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>or a Being not visible to the mortal eye — a Being who whispered to her soul :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ It will not last , this cheerfulness . In January you must go to London to entertain the grandchildren of celebrated men . ”</said>But to-day she felt she had received a guarantee . Her mother would always sit there , her brother here . The sun , though it had moved a little since the morning , would never be hidden behind the western hills . After luncheon they asked her to play . She had seen Gluck 's Armide that year , and played from memory the music of the enchanted garden — the music to which Renaud approaches , beneath the light of an eternal dawn , the music that never gains , never wanes , but ripples for ever like the tideless seas of fairyland . Such music is not for the piano , and her audience began to get restive , and<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, sharing the discontent , called out :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Now play us the other garden — the one in Parsifal . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1525">She closed the instrument .</p>
     <p n="1526"><said who="#Cecil">“ Not very dutiful , ”</said>said her mother 's voice .</p>
     <p n="1527">Fearing that she had offended<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, she turned quickly round . There<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>was . He had crept in without interrupting her .</p>
     <p n="1528"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Oh , I had no idea ! ”</said>she exclaimed , getting very red ; and then , without a word of greeting , she reopened the piano .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>should have the Parsifal , and anything else that he liked .</p>
     <p n="1529"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Our performer has changed her mind , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, perhaps implying , she will play the music to<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>.<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>did not know what to do nor even what she wanted to do . She played a few bars of the Flower Maidens ’ song very badly and then she stopped .</p>
     <p n="1530"><said who="#Freddy">“ I vote tennis , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, disgusted at the scrappy entertainment .</p>
     <p n="1531"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Yes , so do I . ”</said>Once more she closed the unfortunate piano .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I vote you have a men 's four . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1532"><said who="#Freddy">“ All right . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1533"><said who="#Cecil">“ Not for me , thank you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>.<said who="#Cecil">“ I will not spoil the set . ”</said>He never realized that it may be an act of kindness in a bad player to make up a fourth .</p>

     <p n="1535"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>corrected him :<said who="#Cecil">“ I am not bad . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1536">One looked down one 's nose at this .<said who="#Cecil">“ Then certainly I wo n't play , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, while<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, under the impression that she was snubbing<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, added :<said who="#Cecil">“ I agree with you ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>. You had much better not play . Much better not . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1537"><persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>, rushing in where<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>feared to tread , announced that she would play .<said who="#Mr._Vyse">“ I shall miss every ball anyway , so what does it matter ? ”</said>But Sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion .</p>
     <p n="1538"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Then it will have to be<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>;<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ you must fall back on<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. There is no other way out of it .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, go and change your frock . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1539"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s Sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature . She kept it without hypocrisy in the morning , and broke it without reluctance in the afternoon . As she changed her frock , she wondered whether<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>was sneering at her ; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything up before she married him .</p>
     <p n="1540"><persName corresp="#Mr._Floyd">Mr. Floyd</persName>was her partner . She liked music , but how much better tennis seemed . How much better to run about in comfortable clothes than to sit at the piano and feel girt under the arms . Once more music appeared to her the employment of a child .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>served , and surprised her by his anxiety to win . She remembered how he had sighed among the tombs at Santa Croce because things would n't fit ; how after the death of that obscure Italian he had leant over the parapet by<persName corresp="#the_Arno">the Arno</persName>and said to her : “ I shall want to live , I tell you , ” He wanted to live now , to win at tennis , to stand for all he was worth in the sun — the sun which had begun to decline and was shining in her eyes ; and he did win .</p>
     <p n="1541">Ah , how beautiful the Weald looked ! The hills stood out above its radiance , as Fiesole stands above the Tuscan Plain , and the South Downs , if one chose , were the mountains of Carrara . She might be forgetting her Italy , but she was noticing more things in her England . One could play a new game with the view , and try to find in its innumerable folds some town or village that would do for Florence . Ah , how beautiful the Weald looked !</p>
     <p n="1542">But now<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>claimed her . He chanced to be in a lucid critical mood , and would not sympathize with exaltation . He had been rather a nuisance all through the tennis , for the novel that he was reading was so bad that he was obliged to read it aloud to others . He would stroll round the precincts of the court and call out :<said who="#Cecil">“ I say , listen to this ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. Three split infinitives . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1543"><said who="#Lucy">“ Dreadful ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, and missed her stroke . When they had finished their set , he still went on reading ; there was some murder scene , and really every one must listen to it .<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mr._Floyd">Mr. Floyd</persName>were obliged to hunt for a lost ball in the laurels , but the other two acquiesced .</p>
     <p n="1544"><said who="#Cecil">“ The scene is laid in Florence . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1545"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ What fun ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>! Read away . Come ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, sit down after all your energy . ”</said>She had “ forgiven ”<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, as she put it , and she made a point of being pleasant to him .</p>
     <p n="1546">He jumped over the net and sat down at her feet asking :<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ You — and are you tired ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1547"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Of course I 'm not ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1548"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Do you mind being beaten ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1549">She was going to answer , “ No , ” when it struck her that she did mind , so she answered ,<said who="#George_Emerson">“ Yes . ”</said>She added merrily ,<said who="#George_Emerson">“ I do n't see you 're such a splendid player , though . The light was behind you , and it was in my eyes . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1550"><said who="#Mr._Floyd">“ I never said I was . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1551"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Why , you did ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1552"><said who="#Mr._Floyd">“ You did n't attend . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1553"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ You said — oh , do n't go in for accuracy at this house . We all exaggerate , and we get very angry with people who do n't . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1554"><said who="#Cecil">“ ‘ The scene is laid in Florence , ’ ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, with an upward note .</p>
     <p n="1555"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>recollected herself .</p>
     <p n="1556"><said who="#Lucy">“ ‘ Sunset . Leonora was speeding — ’ ”</said></p>
     <p n="1557"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>interrupted .<said who="#Cecil">“ Leonora ? Is Leonora the heroine ? Who 's the book by ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1558"><said who="#Lucy">“ Joseph Emery Prank . ‘ Sunset . Leonora speeding across the square . Pray the saints she might not arrive too late . Sunset — the sunset of Italy . Under Orcagna 's Loggia — the Loggia de ’ Lanzi , as we sometimes call it now — ’ ”</said></p>
     <p n="1559"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>burst into laughter .<said who="#Cecil">“ ‘ Joseph Emery Prank ’ indeed ! Why it 's<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>! It 's<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>'s novel , and she 's publishing it under somebody else 's name . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1560"><said who="#Lucy">“ Who may<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>be ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1561"><said who="#Cecil">“ Oh , a dreadful person —<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, you remember<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1562">Excited by her pleasant afternoon , she clapped her hands .</p>
     <p n="1563"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>looked up .<said who="#George_Emerson">“ Of course I do . I saw her the day I arrived at Summer Street . It was she who told me that you lived here . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1564"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Were n't you pleased ? ”</said>She meant “ to see<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>, ” but when he bent down to the grass without replying , it struck her that she could mean something else . She watched his head , which was almost resting against her knee , and she thought that the ears were reddening .<said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ No wonder the novel 's bad , ”</said>she added .<said>“ I never liked<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>. But I suppose one ought to read it as one 's met her . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1565"><said who="#Cecil">“ All modern books are bad , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, who was annoyed at her inattention , and vented his annoyance on literature .<said who="#Cecil">“ Every one writes for money in these days . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1566"><said who="#Miss_Lavish">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>—! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1567"><said who="#Cecil">“ It is so . I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1568"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, this afternoon seemed such a twittering sparrow . The ups and downs in his voice were noticeable , but they did not affect her . She had dwelt amongst melody and movement , and her nerves refused to answer to the clang of his . Leaving him to be annoyed , she gazed at the black head again . She did not want to stroke it , but she saw herself wanting to stroke it ; the sensation was curious .</p>
     <p n="1569"><said who="#Cecil">“ How do you like this view of ours ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1570"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I never notice much difference in views . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1571"><said who="#Cecil">“ What do you mean ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1572"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Because they 're all alike . Because all that matters in them is distance and air . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1573"><said who="#Cecil">“ H 'm ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, uncertain whether the remark was striking or not .</p>
     <p n="1574"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ My father ”</said>— he looked up at her ( and he was a little flushed ) —<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ says that there is only one perfect view — the view of the sky straight over our heads , and that all these views on earth are but bungled copies of it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1575"><said who="#Cecil">“ I expect your father has been reading Dante , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, fingering the novel , which alone permitted him to lead the conversation .</p>
     <p n="1576"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ He told us another day that views are really crowds — crowds of trees and houses and hills — and are bound to resemble each other , like human crowds — and that the power they have over us is sometimes supernatural , for the same reason . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1577"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s lips parted .</p>
     <p n="1578"><said who="#Lucy">“ For a crowd is more than the people who make it up . Something gets added to it — no one knows how — just as something has got added to those hills . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1579">He pointed with his racquet to the South Downs .</p>
     <p n="1580"><said who="#Lucy">“ What a splendid idea ! ”</said>she murmured .<said who="#Lucy">“ I shall enjoy hearing your father talk again . I 'm so sorry he 's not so well . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1581"><said who="#Cecil">“ No , he is n't well . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1582"><said who="#Cecil">“ There 's an absurd account of a view in this book , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>.<said who="#Cecil">“ Also that men fall into two classes — those who forget views and those who remember them , even in small rooms . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1583"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, have you any brothers or sisters ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1584"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ None . Why ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1585"><said who="#Lucy">“ You spoke of ‘ us . ’ ”</said></p>
     <p n="1586"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ My mother , I was meaning . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1587"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>closed the novel with a bang .</p>
     <p n="1588"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>— how you made me jump ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1589"><said who="#Cecil">“ I will inflict Joseph Emery Prank on you no longer . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1590"><said who="#Lucy">“ I can just remember us all three going into the country for the day and seeing as far as Hindhead . It is the first thing that I remember . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1591"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>got up ; the man was ill-bred — he had n't put on his coat after tennis — he did n't do . He would have strolled away if<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had not stopped him .</p>
     <p n="1592"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, do read the thing about the view . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1593"><said who="#Cecil">“ Not while<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>is here to entertain us . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1594"><said who="#Lucy">“ No — read away . I think nothing 's funnier than to hear silly things read out loud . If<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>thinks us frivolous , he can go . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1595">This struck<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>as subtle , and pleased him . It put their visitor in the position of a prig . Somewhat mollified , he sat down again .</p>
     <p n="1596"><said who="#Cecil">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, go and find tennis balls . ”</said>She opened the book .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>must have his reading and anything else that he liked . But her attention wandered to<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>'s mother , who — according to Mr .

     <p n="1597"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Am I really to go ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1598"><said who="#Cecil">“ No , of course not really , ”</said>she answered .</p>

     <p n="1606">Lest<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>should see her face she turned to<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>and saw his face .</p>
     <p n="1607">He read :<said who="#Cecil">“ ‘ There came from his lips no wordy protestation such as formal lovers use . No eloquence was his , nor did he suffer from the lack of it . He simply enfolded her in his manly arms . ’ ”</said></p>

     <p n="1610">She led the way up the garden ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>following her ,<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>last .

     <p n="1613">But<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had developed since the spring . That is to say , she was now better able to stifle the emotions of which the conventions and the world disapprove . Though the danger was greater , she was not shaken by deep sobs . She said to<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, “ I am not coming in to tea — tell mother — I must write some letters , ” and went up to her room . Then she prepared for action . Love felt and returned , love which our bodies exact and our hearts have transfigured , love which is the most real thing that we shall ever meet , reappeared now as the world 's enemy , and she must stifle it .</p>
     <p n="1614">She sent for<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1615">The contest lay not between love and duty . Perhaps there never is such a contest . It lay between the real and the pretended , and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s first aim was to defeat herself . As her brain clouded over , as the memory of the views grew dim and the words of the book died away , she returned to her old shibboleth of nerves . She “ conquered her breakdown . ” Tampering with the truth , she forgot that the truth had ever been . Remembering that she was engaged to<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, she compelled herself to confused remembrances of<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>; he was nothing to her ; he never had been anything ; he had behaved abominably ; she had never encouraged him . The armour of falsehood is subtly wrought out of darkness , and hides a man not only from others , but from his own soul . In a few moments<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was equipped for battle .</p>
     <p n="1616"><said who="#Lucy">“ Something too awful has happened , ”</said>she began , as soon as her cousin arrived .<said who="#Lucy">“ Do you know anything about<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>'s novel ? ”</said></p>

     <p n="1634">Why does any one tell anything ? The question is eternal , and it was not surprising that<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>should only sigh faintly in response .

     <p n="1642"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>could not think . The days of her energy were over . She was a visitor , not a chaperon , and a discredited visitor at that . She stood with clasped hands while the girl worked herself into the necessary rage .</p>

     <p n="1645"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Yes — but it 's no good agreeing . What 's to be DONE . We women go maundering on . What DOES a girl do when she comes across a cad ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1646"><said who="#Lucy">“ I always said he was a cad , dear . Give me credit for that , at all events . From the very first moment — when he said his father was having a bath . ”</said></p>

We 've both made a muddle of it .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>is still down the garden there , and is he to be left unpunished , or is n't he ? I want to know . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1648"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>was absolutely helpless . Her own exposure had unnerved her , and thoughts were colliding painfully in her brain . She moved feebly to the window , and tried to detect the cad 's white flannels among the laurels .</p>
     <p n="1649"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ You were ready enough at the Bertolini when you rushed me off to Rome . Ca n't you speak again to him now ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1650"><said who="#Lucy">“ Willingly would I move heaven and earth — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1651"><said who="#Lucy">“ I want something more definite , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>contemptuously .<said who="#Lucy">“ Will you speak to him ? It is the least you can do , surely , considering it all happened because you broke your word . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1652"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Never again shall<persName corresp="#Eleanor">Eleanor</persName><persName>Lavish</persName>be a friend of mine . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1653">Really ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>was outdoing herself .</p>
     <p n="1654"><said who="#Charlotte">“ Yes or no , please ; yes or no . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1655"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ It is the kind of thing that only a gentleman can settle . ”</said><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>was coming up the garden with a tennis ball in his hand .</p>
     <p n="1656"><said who="#Lucy">“ Very well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, with an angry gesture .<said who="#Lucy">“ No one will help me . I will speak to him myself . ”</said>And immediately she realized that this was what her cousin had intended all along .</p>
     <p n="1657"><said who="#Freddy">“ Hullo ,<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">Emerson</persName>! ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>from below .<said who="#Freddy">“ Found the lost ball ? Good man ! Want any tea ? ”</said>And there was an irruption from the house on to the terrace .</p>
     <p n="1658"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, but that is brave of you ! I admire you — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1659">They had gathered round<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, who beckoned , she felt , over the rubbish , the sloppy thoughts , the furtive yearnings that were beginning to cumber her soul . Her anger faded at the sight of him . Ah ! The Emersons were fine people in their way . She had to subdue a rush in her blood before saying :</p>
     <p n="1660"><said who="#George_Emerson">“<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>has taken him into the dining-room . The others are going down the garden . Come . Let us get this over quickly . Come . I want you in the room , of course . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1661"><said who="#Freddy">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, do you mind doing it ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1662"><said who="#Lucy">“ How can you ask such a ridiculous question ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1663"><said who="#Freddy">“ Poor<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>— ”</said>She stretched out her hand .<said who="#Lucy">“ I seem to bring nothing but misfortune wherever I go . ”</said><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>nodded . She remembered their last evening at Florence — the packing , the candle , the shadow of<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>'s toque on the door . She was not to be trapped by pathos a second time . Eluding her cousin 's caress , she led the way downstairs .</p>
     <p n="1664"><said who="#Freddy">“ Try the jam , ”</said><persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>was saying .<said who="#Freddy">“ The jam 's jolly good . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1665"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, looking big and dishevelled , was pacing up and down the dining-room . As she entered he stopped , and said :</p>
     <p n="1666"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ No — nothing to eat . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1667"><said who="#Lucy">“ You go down to the others , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>;<said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>and I will give<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>all he wants . Where 's mother ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1668"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ She 's started on her Sunday writing . She 's in the drawing-room . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1669"><said who="#Lucy">“ That 's all right . You go away . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1670">He went off singing .</p>
     <p n="1671"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>sat down at the table .<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, who was thoroughly frightened , took up a book and pretended to read .</p>
     <p n="1672">She would not be drawn into an elaborate speech . She just said :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I can n't have it ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>. I cannot even talk to you . Go out of this house , and never come into it again as long as I live here — ”</said>flushing as she spoke and pointing to the door .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I hate a row . Go please . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1673"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ What — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1674"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ No discussion . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1675"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ But I can n't — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1676">She shook her head .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Go , please . I do not want to call in<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1677"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ You do n't mean , ”</said>he said , absolutely ignoring<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>—<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ you do n't mean that you are going to marry that man ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1678">The line was unexpected .</p>
     <p n="1679">She shrugged her shoulders , as if his vulgarity wearied her .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ You are merely ridiculous , ”</said>she said quietly .</p>
     <p n="1680">Then his words rose gravely over hers :<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ You cannot live with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Vyse</persName>. He 's only for an acquaintance . He is for society and cultivated talk . He should know no one intimately , least of all a woman . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1681">It was a new light on<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s character .</p>
     <p n="1682"><said who="#Cecil">“ Have you ever talked to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Vyse</persName>without feeling tired ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1683"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I can scarcely discuss — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1684"><said>“ No , but have you ever ? He is the sort who are all right so long as they keep to things — books , pictures — but kill when they come to people . That 's why I 'll speak out through all this muddle even now . It 's shocking enough to lose you in any case , but generally a man must deny himself joy , and I would have held back if your<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>had been a different person . I would never have let myself go . But I saw him first in the National Gallery , when he winced because my father mispronounced the names of great painters . Then he brings us here , and we find it is to play some silly trick on a kind neighbour . That is the man all over — playing tricks on people , on the most sacred form of life that he can find . Next , I meet you together , and find him protecting and teaching you and your mother to be shocked , when it was for YOU to settle whether you were shocked or no .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>all over again . He dare n't let a woman decide . He 's the type who 's kept Europe back for a thousand years . Every moment of his life he 's forming you , telling you what 's charming or amusing or ladylike , telling you what a man thinks womanly ; and you , you of all women , listen to his voice instead of to your own . So it was at the Rectory , when I met you both again ; so it has been the whole of this afternoon . Therefore — not ‘ therefore I kissed you , ’ because the book made me do that , and I wish to goodness I had more self-control . I 'm not ashamed . I do n't apologize . But it has frightened you , and you may not have noticed that I love you . Or would you have told me to go , and dealt with a tremendous thing so lightly ? But therefore — therefore I settled to fight him . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1685"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>thought of a very good remark .</p>
     <p n="1686"><said who="#Lucy">“ You say<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>wants me to listen to him ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>. Pardon me for suggesting that you have caught the habit . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1687">And he took the shoddy reproof and touched it into immortality . He said :</p>
     <p n="1688"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yes , I have , ”</said>and sank down as if suddenly weary .<said who="#Lucy">“ I 'm the same kind of brute at bottom . This desire to govern a woman — it lies very deep , and men and women must fight it together before they shall enter the garden . But I do love you surely in a better way than he does . ”</said>He thought .<said who="#Lucy">“ Yes — really in a better way . I want you to have your own thoughts even when I hold you in my arms , ”</said>He stretched them towards her .<said who="#Cecil">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, be quick — there 's no time for us to talk now — come to me as you came in the spring , and afterwards I will be gentle and explain . I have cared for you since that man died . I cannot live without you , ‘ No good , ’ I thought ; ‘ she is marrying some one else ’ ; but I meet you again when all the world is glorious water and sun . As you came through the wood I saw that nothing else mattered . I called . I wanted to live and have my chance of joy . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1689"><said who="#Lucy">“ And<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, who kept commendably calm .<said who="#Lucy">“ Does he not matter ? That I love<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>and shall be his wife shortly ? A detail of no importance , I suppose ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1690">But he stretched his arms over the table towards her .</p>
     <p n="1691"><said who="#Lucy">“ May I ask what you intend to gain by this exhibition ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1692">He said :<said who="#Cecil">“ It is our last chance . I shall do all that I can . ”</said>And as if he had done all else , he turned to<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, who sat like some portent against the skies of the evening .<said who="#Cecil">“ You would n't stop us this second time if you understood , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Cecil">“ I have been into the dark , and I am going back into it , unless you will try to understand . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1693">Her long , narrow head drove backwards and forwards , as though demolishing some invisible obstacle . She did not answer .</p>
     <p n="1694"><said who="#Lucy">“ It is being young , ”</said>he said quietly , picking up his racquet from the floor and preparing to go .<said>“ It is being certain that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>cares for me really . It is that love and youth matter intellectually . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1695">In silence the two women watched him . His last remark , they knew , was nonsense , but was he going after it or not ? Would not he , the cad , the charlatan , attempt a more dramatic finish ? No . He was apparently content . He left them , carefully closing the front door ; and when they looked through the hall window , they saw him go up the drive and begin to climb the slopes of withered fern behind the house . Their tongues were loosed , and they burst into stealthy rejoicings .</p>
     <p n="1696"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Lucia">Lucia</persName>— come back here — oh , what an awful man ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1697"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had no reaction — at least , not yet .<said who="#Lucia">“ Well , he amuses me , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Lucia">“ Either I 'm mad , or else he is , and I 'm inclined to think it 's the latter . One more fuss through with you ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>. Many thanks . I think , though , that this is the last . My admirer will hardly trouble me again . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1698">And<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, too , essayed the roguish :</p>
     <p n="1699"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Well , it is n't every one who could boast such a conquest , dearest , is it ? Oh , one ought n't to laugh , really . It might have been very serious . But you were so sensible and brave — so unlike the girls of my day . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1700"><said who="#Lucy">“ Let 's go down to them . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1701">But , once in the open air , she paused . Some emotion — pity , terror , love , but the emotion was strong — seized her , and she was aware of autumn . Summer was ending , and the evening brought her odours of decay , the more pathetic because they were reminiscent of spring . That something or other mattered intellectually ? A leaf , violently agitated , danced past her , while other leaves lay motionless . That the earth was hastening to re-enter darkness , and the shadows of those trees over Windy Corner ?</p>
     <p n="1702"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Hullo ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! There 's still light enough for another set , if you two 'll hurry . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1703"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>has had to go . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1704"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ What a nuisance ! That spoils the four . I say ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, do play , do , there 's a good chap . It 's Floyd 's last day . Do play tennis with us , just this once . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1705"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s voice came :<said who="#Cecil">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, I am no athlete . As you well remarked this very morning , ‘ There are some chaps who are no good for anything but books ’ ; I plead guilty to being such a chap , and will not inflict myself on you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1706">The scales fell from<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s eyes . How had she stood<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>for a moment ? He was absolutely intolerable , and the same evening she broke off her engagement .</p>
    </div>
    <div type="chapter" n="17">
     <head type="chapter">Chapter XVII : Lying to Cecil</head>
     <p n="1707">He was bewildered . He had nothing to say . He was not even angry , but stood , with a glass of whiskey between his hands , trying to think what had led her to such a conclusion .</p>
     <p n="1708">She had chosen the moment before bed , when , in accordance with their bourgeois habit , she always dispensed drinks to the men .<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mr._Floyd">Mr. Floyd</persName>were sure to retire with their glasses , while<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>invariably lingered , sipping at his while she locked up the sideboard .</p>
     <p n="1709"><said who="#Cecil">“ I am very sorry about it , ”</said>she said ;<said who="#Cecil">“ I have carefully thought things over . We are too different . I must ask you to release me , and try to forget that there ever was such a foolish girl . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1710">It was a suitable speech , but she was more angry than sorry , and her voice showed it .</p>
     <p n="1711"><said who="#Cecil">“ Different — how — how — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1712"><said who="#Cecil">“ I have n't had a really good education , for one thing , ”</said>she continued , still on her knees by the sideboard .<said who="#Cecil">“ My Italian trip came too late , and I am forgetting all that I learnt there . I shall never be able to talk to your friends , or behave as a wife of yours should . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1713"><said who="#Mr._Floyd">“ I do n't understand you . You are n't like yourself . You 're tired ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1714"><said who="#Lucy">“ Tired ! ”</said>she retorted , kindling at once .<said who="#Lucy">“ That is exactly like you . You always think women do n't mean what they say . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1715"><said who="#Cecil">“ Well , you sound tired , as if something has worried you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1716"><said who="#Lucy">“ What if I do ? It does n't prevent me from realizing the truth . I can n't marry you , and you will thank me for saying so some day . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1717"><said who="#Cecil">“ You had that bad headache yesterday — All right ”</said>— for she had exclaimed indignantly :<said who="#Cecil">“ I see it 's much more than headaches . But give me a moment 's time . ”</said>He closed his eyes .<said who="#Cecil">“ You must excuse me if I say stupid things , but my brain has gone to pieces . Part of it lives three minutes back , when I was sure that you loved me , and the other part — I find it difficult — I am likely to say the wrong thing . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1718">It struck her that he was not behaving so badly , and her irritation increased . She again desired a struggle , not a discussion . To bring on the crisis , she said :</p>
     <p n="1719"><said who="#Cecil">“ There are days when one sees clearly , and this is one of them . Things must come to a breaking-point some time , and it happens to be to-day . If you want to know , quite a little thing decided me to speak to you — when you would n't play tennis with<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1720"><said who="#Cecil">“ I never do play tennis , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, painfully bewildered ;<said who="#Cecil">“ I never could play . I do n't understand a word you say . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1721"><said who="#Mr._Floyd">“ You can play well enough to make up a four . I thought it abominably selfish of you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1722"><said who="#Cecil">“ No , I can n't — well , never mind the tennis . Why could n't you — could n't you have warned me if you felt anything wrong ? You talked of our wedding at lunch — at least , you let me talk . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1723"><said who="#Lucy">“ I knew you would n't understand , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>quite crossly .<said who="#Lucy">“ I might have known there would have been these dreadful explanations . Of course , it is n't the tennis — that was only the last straw to all I have been feeling for weeks . Surely it was better not to speak until I felt certain . ”</said>She developed this position .<said who="#Lucy">“ Often before I have wondered if I was fitted for your wife — for instance , in London ; and are you fitted to be my husband ? I do n't think so . You do n't like<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, nor my mother . There was always a lot against our engagement ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, but all our relations seemed pleased , and we met so often , and it was no good mentioning it until — well , until all things came to a point . They have to-day . I see clearly . I must speak . That 's all . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1724"><said who="#Cecil">“ I cannot think you were right , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>gently .<said who="#Cecil">“ I cannot tell why , but though all that you say sounds true , I feel that you are not treating me fairly . It 's all too horrible . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1725"><said who="#Lucy">“ What 's the good of a scene ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1726"><said who="#Cecil">“ No good . But surely I have a right to hear a little more . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1727">He put down his glass and opened the window . From where she knelt , jangling her keys , she could see a slit of darkness , and , peering into it , as if it would tell him that “ little more , ” his long , thoughtful face .</p>
     <p n="1728"><said who="#Cecil">“ Do n't open the window ; and you 'd better draw the curtain , too ;<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>or any one might be outside . ”</said>He obeyed .<said who="#Cecil">“ I really think we had better go to bed , if you do n't mind . I shall only say things that will make me unhappy afterwards . As you say it is all too horrible , and it is no good talking . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1729">But to<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, now that he was about to lose her , she seemed each moment more desirable . He looked at her , instead of through her , for the first time since they were engaged . From a<persName corresp="#Leonardo">Leonardo</persName>she had become a living woman , with mysteries and forces of her own , with qualities that even eluded art . His brain recovered from the shock , and , in a burst of genuine devotion , he cried :<said who="#Leonardo">“ But I love you , and I did think you loved me ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1730"><said who="#Cecil">“ I did not , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Cecil">“ I thought I did at first . I am sorry , and ought to have refused you this last time , too . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1731">He began to walk up and down the room , and she grew more and more vexed at his dignified behaviour . She had counted on his being petty . It would have made things easier for her . By a cruel irony she was drawing out all that was finest in his disposition .</p>
     <p n="1732"><said who="#Leonardo">“ You do n't love me , evidently . I dare say you are right not to . But it would hurt a little less if I knew why . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1733"><said who="#Cecil">“ Because ”</said>— a phrase came to her , and she accepted it —<said who="#Cecil">“ you 're the sort who can n't know any one intimately . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1734">A horrified look came into his eyes .</p>
     <p n="1735"><said who="#Leonardo">“ I do n't mean exactly that . But you will question me , though I beg you not to , and I must say something . It is that , more or less . When we were only acquaintances , you let me be myself , but now you 're always protecting me . ”</said>Her voice swelled .<said who="#Leonardo">“ I wo n't be protected . I will choose for myself what is ladylike and right . To shield me is an insult . Ca n't I be trusted to face the truth but I must get it second-hand through you ? A woman 's place ! You despise my mother — I know you do — because she 's conventional and bothers over puddings ; but , oh goodness ! ”</said>— she rose to her feet —<said who="#Leonardo">“ conventional ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, you 're that , for you may understand beautiful things , but you do n't know how to use them ; and you wrap yourself up in art and books and music , and would try to wrap up me . I wo n't be stifled , not by the most glorious music , for people are more glorious , and you hide them from me . That 's why I break off my engagement . You were all right as long as you kept to things , but when you came to people — ”</said>She stopped .</p>
     <p n="1736">There was a pause . Then<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>said with great emotion :</p>
     <p n="1737"><said who="#Cecil">“ It is true . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1738"><said who="#Leonardo">“ True on the whole , ”</said>she corrected , full of some vague shame .</p>
     <p n="1739"><said who="#Cecil">“ True , every word . It is a revelation . It is — I . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1740"><said who="#Leonardo">“ Anyhow , those are my reasons for not being your wife . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1741">He repeated :<said who="#Cecil">“ ‘ The sort that can know no one intimately . ’ It is true . I fell to pieces the very first day we were engaged . I behaved like a cad to Beebe and to your brother . You are even greater than I thought . ”</said>She withdrew a step .<said who="#Cecil">“ I 'm not going to worry you . You are far too good to me . I shall never forget your insight ; and , dear , I only blame you for this : you might have warned me in the early stages , before you felt you would n't marry me , and so have given me a chance to improve . I have never known you till this evening . I have just used you as a peg for my silly notions of what a woman should be . But this evening you are a different person : new thoughts — even a new voice — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1742"><said who="#Leonardo">“ What do you mean by a new voice ? ”</said>she asked , seized with incontrollable anger .</p>
     <p n="1743"><said who="#Cecil">“ I mean that a new person seems speaking through you , ”</said>said he .</p>
     <p n="1744">Then she lost her balance . She cried :<said who="#Leonardo">“ If you think I am in love with some one else , you are very much mistaken . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1745"><said who="#Cecil">“ Of course I do n't think that . You are not that kind ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1746"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , yes , you do think it . It 's your old idea , the idea that has kept Europe back — I mean the idea that women are always thinking of men . If a girl breaks off her engagement , every one says : ‘ Oh , she had some one else in her mind ; she hopes to get some one else . ’ It 's disgusting , brutal ! As if a girl can n't break it off for the sake of freedom . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1747">He answered reverently :<said who="#Cecil">“ I may have said that in the past . I shall never say it again . You have taught me better . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1748">She began to redden , and pretended to examine the windows again .<said who="#Lucy">“ Of course , there is no question of ‘ some one else ’ in this , no ‘ jilting ’ or any such nauseous stupidity . I beg your pardon most humbly if my words suggested that there was . I only meant that there was a force in you that I had n't known of up till now . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1749"><said who="#Leonardo">“ All right ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, that will do . Do n't apologize to me . It was my mistake . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1750"><said who="#Cecil">“ It is a question between ideals , yours and mine — pure abstract ideals , and yours are the nobler . I was bound up in the old vicious notions , and all the time you were splendid and new . ”</said>His voice broke .<said who="#Cecil">“ I must actually thank you for what you have done — for showing me what I really am . Solemnly , I thank you for showing me a true woman . Will you shake hands ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1751"><said who="#Lucy">“ Of course I will , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, twisting up her other hand in the curtains .<said who="#Lucy">“ Good-night ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>. Good-bye . That 's all right . I 'm sorry about it . Thank you very much for your gentleness . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1752"><said who="#Cecil">“ Let me light your candle , shall I ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1753">They went into the hall .</p>
     <p n="1754"><said who="#Cecil">“ Thank you . Good-night again . God bless you ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1755"><said who="#Lucy">“ Good-bye ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1756">She watched him steal up-stairs , while the shadows from three banisters passed over her face like the beat of wings . On the landing he paused strong in his renunciation , and gave her a look of memorable beauty . For all his culture ,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>was an ascetic at heart , and nothing in his love became him like the leaving of it .</p>
     <p n="1757">She could never marry . In the tumult of her soul , that stood firm .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>believed in her ; she must some day believe in herself . She must be one of the women whom she had praised so eloquently , who care for liberty and not for men ; she must forget that<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>loved her , that<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>had been thinking through her and gained her this honourable release , that<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>had gone away into — what was it ?— the darkness .</p>
     <p n="1758">She put out the lamp .</p>
     <p n="1759">It did not do to think , nor , for the matter of that to feel . She gave up trying to understand herself , and the vast armies of the benighted , who follow neither the heart nor the brain , and march to their destiny by catch-words . The armies are full of pleasant and pious folk . But they have yielded to the only enemy that matters — the enemy within . They have sinned against passion and truth , and vain will be their strife after virtue . As the years pass , they are censured . Their pleasantry and their piety show cracks , their wit becomes cynicism , their unselfishness hypocrisy ; they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go . They have sinned against Eros and against Pallas Athene , and not by any heavenly intervention , but by the ordinary course of nature , those allied deities will be avenged .</p>
     <p n="1760"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>entered this army when she pretended to<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>that she did not love him , and pretended to<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>that she loved no one . The night received her , as it had received<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>thirty years before .</p>

     <head type="chapter">Chapter XVIII : Lying to Mr. Beebe , Mrs. Honeychurch , Freddy , and The Servants</head>
     <p n="1761">Windy Corner lay , not on the summit of the ridge , but a few hundred feet down the southern slope , at the springing of one of the great buttresses that supported the hill . On either side of it was a shallow ravine , filled with ferns and pine-trees , and down the ravine on the left ran the highway into the Weald .</p>
     <p n="1762">Whenever<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble dispositions of the earth , and , poised in the middle of them , Windy Corner ,— he laughed . The situation was so glorious , the house so commonplace , not to say impertinent . The late Mr.<persName corresp="#Freddy">Honeychurch</persName>had affected the cube , because it gave him the most accommodation for his money , and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret , shaped like a rhinoceros ’ horn , where she could sit in wet weather and watch the carts going up and down the road . So impertinent — and yet the house “ did , ” for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings honestly . Other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive architects , over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously , yet all these suggested the accidental , the temporary ; while Windy Corner seemed as inevitable as an ugliness of<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>'s own creation . One might laugh at the house , but one never shuddered .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>was bicycling over this Monday afternoon with a piece of gossip . He had heard from the Miss Alans . These admirable ladies , since they could not go to Cissie Villa , had changed their plans . They were going to Greece instead .</p>
     <p n="1763"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Since Florence did my poor sister so much good , ”</said>wrote Miss Catharine ,<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ we do not see why we should not try Athens this winter . Of course , Athens is a plunge , and the doctor has ordered her special digestive bread ; but , after all , we can take that with us , and it is only getting first into a steamer and then into a train . But is there an English Church ? ”</said>And the letter went on to say :<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I do not expect we shall go any further than Athens , but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at Constantinople , we should be so grateful . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1764"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>would enjoy this letter , and the smile with which<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>greeted Windy Corner was partly for her . She would see the fun of it , and some of its beauty , for she must see some beauty . Though she was hopeless about pictures , and though she dressed so unevenly — oh , that cerise frock yesterday at church !— she must see some beauty in life , or she could not play the piano as she did . He had a theory that musicians are incredibly complex , and know far less than other artists what they want and what they are ; that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends ; that their psychology is a modern development , and has not yet been understood . This theory , had he known it , had possibly just been illustrated by facts . Ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only riding over to get some tea , to see his niece , and to observe whether<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies to visit Athens .</p>
     <p n="1765">A carriage was drawn up outside Windy Corner , and just as he caught sight of the house it started , bowled up the drive , and stopped abruptly when it reached the main road . Therefore it must be the horse , who always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him . The door opened obediently , and two men emerged , whom<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>recognized as<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>and<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>. They were an odd couple to go driving ; but he saw a trunk beside the coachman 's legs .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, who wore a bowler , must be going away , while<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>( a cap ) — was seeing him to the station . They walked rapidly , taking the short cuts , and reached the summit while the carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road .</p>
     <p n="1766">They shook hands with the clergyman , but did not speak .</p>
     <p n="1767"><said who="#Freddy">“ So you 're off for a minute ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>? ”</said>he asked .</p>
     <p n="1768"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>said , “ Yes , ” while<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>edged away .</p>
     <p n="1769"><said who="#Freddy">“ I was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends of<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>. ”</said>He quoted from it .<said who="#Freddy">“ Is n't it wonderful ? Is n't it romance ? most certainly they will go to Constantinople . They are taken in a snare that cannot fail . They will end by going round the world . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1770"><persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>listened civilly , and said he was sure that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>would be amused and interested .</p>
     <p n="1771"><said who="#Lucy">“ Is n't Romance capricious ! I never notice it in you young people ; you do nothing but play lawn tennis , and say that romance is dead , while the Miss Alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the terrible thing . ‘ A really comfortable pension at Constantinople ! ’ So they call it out of decency , but in their hearts they want a pension with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland forlorn ! No ordinary view will content the Miss Alans . They want the Pension Keats . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1772"><said who="#Freddy">“ I 'm awfully sorry to interrupt ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>,<said who="#Freddy">“ but have you any matches ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1773"><said who="#Cecil">“ I have , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, and it did not escape<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s notice that he spoke to the boy more kindly .</p>
     <p n="1774"><said who="#Freddy">“ You have never met these Miss Alans , have you ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1775"><said who="#Mr._Vyse">“ Never . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1776"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Then you do n't see the wonder of this Greek visit . I have n't been to Greece myself , and do n't mean to go , and I can n't imagine any of my friends going . It is altogether too big for our little lot . Do n't you think so ? Italy is just about as much as we can manage . Italy is heroic , but Greece is godlike or devilish — I am not sure which , and in either case absolutely out of our suburban focus . All right ,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>— I am not being clever , upon my word I am not — I took the idea from another fellow ; and give me those matches when you 've done with them . ”</said>He lit a cigarette , and went on talking to the two young men .<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I was saying , if our poor little Cockney lives must have a background , let it be Italian . Big enough in all conscience . The ceiling of the Sistine Chapel for me . There the contrast is just as much as I can realize . But not the Parthenon , not the frieze of Phidias at any price ; and here comes the victoria . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1777"><said who="#Cecil">“ You 're quite right , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>.<said who="#Cecil">“ Greece is not for our little lot ”</said>; and he got in .<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>followed , nodding to the clergyman , whom he trusted not to be pulling one 's leg , really . And before they had gone a dozen yards he jumped out , and came running back for<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Vyse</persName>'s match-box , which had not been returned . As he took it , he said :<said who="#Freddy">“ I 'm so glad you only talked about books .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s hard hit .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>wo n't marry him . If you 'd gone on about her , as you did about them , he might have broken down . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1778"><said who="#Mrs._Vyse">“ But when — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1779"><said who="#Freddy">“ Late last night . I must go . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1780"><said who="#Mrs._Vyse">“ Perhaps they wo n't want me down there . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1781"><said who="#Freddy">“ No — go on . Good-bye . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1782"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Thank goodness ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>to himself , and struck the saddle of his bicycle approvingly ,<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ It was the one foolish thing she ever did . Oh , what a glorious riddance ! ”</said>And , after a little thought , he negotiated the slope into Windy Corner , light of heart . The house was again as it ought to be — cut off forever from<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>'s pretentious world .</p>
     <p n="1783">He would find Miss<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>down in the garden .</p>
     <p n="1784">In the drawing-room<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was tinkling at a Mozart Sonata . He hesitated a moment , but went down the garden as requested . There he found a mournful company . It was a blustering day , and the wind had taken and broken the dahlias .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, who looked cross , was tying them up , while<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, unsuitably dressed , impeded her with offers of assistance . At a little distance stood<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>and the “ garden-child , ” a minute importation , each holding either end of a long piece of bass .</p>
     <p n="1785"><said who="#Beebe">“ Oh , how do you do ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>? Gracious what a mess everything is ! Look at my scarlet pompons , and the wind blowing your skirts about , and the ground so hard that not a prop will stick in , and then the carriage having to go out , when I had counted on having Powell , who — give every one their due — does tie up dahlias properly . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1786">Evidently<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>was shattered .</p>
     <p n="1787"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ How do you do ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, with a meaning glance , as though conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn gales .</p>
     <p n="1788"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Here , Lennie , the bass , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>. The garden-child , who did not know what bass was , stood rooted to the path with horror .<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>slipped to her uncle and whispered that every one was very disagreeable to-day , and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings would tear longways instead of across .</p>
     <p n="1789"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Come for a walk with me , ”</said>he told her .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ You have worried them as much as they can stand .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, I only called in aimlessly . I shall take her up to tea at the Beehive Tavern , if I may . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1790"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Oh , must you ? Yes do .— Not the scissors , thank you ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, when both my hands are full already — I 'm perfectly certain that the orange cactus will go before I can get to it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1791"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, who was an adept at relieving situations , invited<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>to accompany them to this mild festivity .</p>
     <p n="1792"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Yes ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, I do n't want you — do go ; there 's nothing to stop about for , either in the house or out of it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1793"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed , but when she had exasperated every one , except<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>, by a refusal , she turned round and exasperated<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>by an acceptance . As they walked up the garden , the orange cactus fell , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s last vision was of the garden-child clasping it like a lover , his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom .</p>
     <p n="1794"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ It is terrible , this havoc among the flowers , ”</said>he remarked .</p>
     <p n="1795"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ It is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a moment , ”</said>enunciated<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1796"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Perhaps we ought to send<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>down to her mother . Or will she come with us ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1797"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I think we had better leave<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>to herself , and to her own pursuits . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1798"><said who="#Beebe">“ They 're angry with<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>because she was late for breakfast , ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>,<said who="#Beebe">“ and Floyd has gone , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>has gone , and<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>wo n't play with me . In fact , Uncle Arthur , the house is not AT ALL what it was yesterday . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1799"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Do n't be a prig , ”</said>said her Uncle Arthur .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Go and put on your boots . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1800">He stepped into the drawing-room , where<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was still attentively pursuing the Sonatas of Mozart . She stopped when he entered .</p>
     <p n="1801"><said who="#Lucy">“ How do you do ?<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>and<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>are coming with me to tea at the Beehive . Would you come too ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1802"><said who="#Beebe">“ I do n't think I will , thank you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1803"><said who="#Lucy">“ No , I did n't suppose you would care to much . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1804"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>turned to the piano and struck a few chords .</p>
     <p n="1805"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ How delicate those Sonatas are ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, though at the bottom of his heart , he thought them silly little things .</p>
     <p n="1806"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>passed into<persName corresp="#Schumann">Schumann</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1807"><said who="#Schumann">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1808"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1809"><said who="#Schumann">“ I met them on the hill . Your brother told me . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1810"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Oh he did ? ”</said>She sounded annoyed .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>felt hurt , for he had thought that she would like him to be told .</p>
     <p n="1811"><said who="#Schumann">“ I need n't say that it will go no further . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1812"><said who="#Lucy">“ Mother ,<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>,<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, playing a note for each person who knew , and then playing a sixth note .</p>
     <p n="1813"><said who="#Freddy">“ If you 'll let me say so , I am very glad , and I am certain that you have done the right thing . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1814"><said who="#Lucy">“ So I hoped other people would think , but they do n't seem to . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1815"><said who="#Freddy">“ I could see that<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>thought it unwise . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1816"><said who="#Lucy">“ So does mother . Mother minds dreadfully . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1817"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I am very sorry for that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>with feeling .</p>
     <p n="1818"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, who hated all changes , did mind , but not nearly as much as her daughter pretended , and only for the minute . It was really a ruse of<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s to justify her despondency — a ruse of which she was not herself conscious , for she was marching in the armies of darkness .</p>
     <p n="1819"><said who="#Lucy">“ And<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>minds . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1820"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Still ,<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>never hit it off with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Vyse</persName>much , did he ? I gathered that he disliked the engagement , and felt it might separate him from you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1821"><said who="#Lucy">“ Boys are so odd . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1822"><persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>could be heard arguing with<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>through the floor . Tea at the Beehive apparently involved a complete change of apparel .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>saw that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>— very properly — did not wish to discuss her action , so after a sincere expression of sympathy , he said ,<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I have had an absurd letter from<persName corresp="#Miss_Alan">Miss Alan</persName>. That was really what brought me over . I thought it might amuse you all . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1823"><said who="#Lucy">“ How delightful ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, in a dull voice .</p>
     <p n="1824">For the sake of something to do , he began to read her the letter . After a few words her eyes grew alert , and soon she interrupted him with “ Going abroad ? When do they start ? ”</p>
     <p n="1825"><said who="#Lucy">“ Next week , I gather . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1826"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Did<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>say whether he was driving straight back ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1827"><said who="#Lucy">“ No , he did n't . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1828"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Because I do hope he wo n't go gossiping . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1829">So she did want to talk about her broken engagement . Always complaisant , he put the letter away . But she , at once exclaimed in a high voice ,<said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , do tell me more about the Miss Alans ! How perfectly splendid of them to go abroad ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1830"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I want them to start from Venice , and go in a cargo steamer down the Illyrian coast ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1831">She laughed heartily .<said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , delightful ! I wish they 'd take me . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1832"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Has Italy filled you with the fever of travel ? Perhaps<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>is right . He says that ‘ Italy is only an euphuism for<persName corresp="#Fate">Fate</persName>. ’ ”</said></p>
     <p n="1833"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , not Italy , but Constantinople . I have always longed to go to Constantinople . Constantinople is practically Asia , is n't it ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1834"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>reminded her that Constantinople was still unlikely , and that the Miss Alans only aimed at Athens ,<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ with Delphi , perhaps , if the roads are safe . ”</said>But this made no difference to her enthusiasm . She had always longed to go to Greece even more , it seemed . He saw , to his surprise , that she was apparently serious .</p>
     <p n="1835"><said who="#Lucy">“ I did n't realize that you and the Miss Alans were still such friends , after Cissie Villa . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1836"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Oh , that 's nothing ; I assure you Cissie Villa 's nothing to me ; I would give anything to go with them . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1837"><said who="#Lucy">“ Would your mother spare you again so soon ? You have scarcely been home three months . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1838"><said who="#Lucy">“ She MUST spare me ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, in growing excitement .<said who="#Lucy">“ I simply MUST go away . I have to . ”</said>She ran her fingers hysterically through her hair .<said who="#Lucy">“ Do n't you see that I HAVE to go away ? I did n't realize at the time — and of course I want to see Constantinople so particularly . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1839"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ You mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1840"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yes , yes . I knew you 'd understand . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1841"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>did not quite understand . Why could not<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>repose in the bosom of her family ?<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>had evidently taken up the dignified line , and was not going to annoy her . Then it struck him that her family itself might be annoying . He hinted this to her , and she accepted the hint eagerly .</p>
     <p n="1842"><said who="#Cecil">“ Yes , of course ; to go to Constantinople until they are used to the idea and everything has calmed down . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1843"><said who="#Cecil">“ I am afraid it has been a bothersome business , ”</said>he said gently .</p>
     <p n="1844"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ No , not at all .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>was very kind indeed ; only — I had better tell you the whole truth , since you have heard a little — it was that he is so masterful . I found that he would n't let me go my own way . He would improve me in places where I can n't be improved .<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>wo n't let a woman decide for herself — in fact , he dare n't . What nonsense I do talk ! but that is the kind of thing . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1845"><said who="#Cecil">“ It is what I gathered from my own observation of<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>; it is what I gather from all that I have known of you . I do sympathize and agree most profoundly . I agree so much that you must let me make one little criticism : Is it worth while rushing off to Greece ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1846"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ But I must go somewhere ! ”</said>she cried .<said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ I have been worrying all the morning , and here comes the very thing . ”</said>She struck her knees with clenched fists , and repeated :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I must ! And the time I shall have with mother , and all the money she spent on me last spring . You all think much too highly of me . I wish you were n't so kind . ”</said>At this moment<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>entered , and her nervousness increased .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I must get away , ever so far . I must know my own mind and where I want to go . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1847"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Come along ; tea , tea , tea , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, and bustled his guests out of the front-door . He hustled them so quickly that he forgot his hat . When he returned for it he heard , to his relief and surprise , the tinkling of a Mozart Sonata .</p>
     <p n="1848"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ She is playing again , ”</said>he said to<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1849"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>can always play , ”</said>was the acid reply .</p>
     <p n="1850"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ One is very thankful that she has such a resource . She is evidently much worried , as , of course , she ought to be . I know all about it . The marriage was so near that it must have been a hard struggle before she could wind herself up to speak . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1851"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>gave a kind of wriggle , and he prepared for a discussion . He had never fathomed<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>. As he had put it to himself at Florence ,<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ she might yet reveal depths of strangeness , if not of meaning . ”</said>But she was so unsympathetic that she must be reliable . He assumed that much , and he had no hesitation in discussing<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>with her .<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>was fortunately collecting ferns .</p>
     <p n="1852">She opened the discussion with :<said who="#Beebe">“ We had much better let the matter drop . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1853"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I wonder . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1854"><said who="#Beebe">“ It is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in Summer Street . It would be DEATH to gossip about<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>'s dismissal at the present moment . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1855"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>raised his eyebrows . Death is a strong word — surely too strong . There was no question of tragedy . He said :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Of course ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>will make the fact public in her own way , and when she chooses .<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>only told me because he knew she would not mind . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1856"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>civilly .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Yet<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>ought not to have told even you . One cannot be too careful . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1857"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Quite so . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1858"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I do implore absolute secrecy . A chance word to a chattering friend , and — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1859"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Exactly . ”</said>He was used to these nervous old maids and to the exaggerated importance that they attach to words . A rector lives in a web of petty secrets , and confidences and warnings , and the wiser he is the less he will regard them . He will change the subject , as did<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, saying cheerfully :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Have you heard from any Bertolini people lately ? I believe you keep up with<persName corresp="#Miss_Lavish">Miss Lavish</persName>. It is odd how we of that pension , who seemed such a fortuitous collection , have been working into one another 's lives . Two , three , four , six of us — no , eight ; I had forgotten the Emersons — have kept more or less in touch . We must really give the Signora a testimonial . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1860">And ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>not favouring the scheme , they walked up the hill in a silence which was only broken by the rector naming some fern . On the summit they paused . The sky had grown wilder since he stood there last hour , giving to the land a tragic greatness that is rare in Surrey . Grey clouds were charging across tissues of white , which stretched and shredded and tore slowly , until through their final layers there gleamed a hint of the disappearing blue . Summer was retreating . The wind roared , the trees groaned , yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast operations in heaven . The weather was breaking up , breaking , broken , and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s eyes rested on Windy Corner , where<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>sat , practising Mozart . No smile came to his lips , and , changing the subject again , he said :<said who="#Lucy">“ We sha n't have rain , but we shall have darkness , so let us hurry on . The darkness last night was appalling . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1861">They reached the Beehive Tavern at about five o'clock . That amiable hostelry possesses a verandah , in which the young and the unwise do dearly love to sit , while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant sanded room , and have tea at a table comfortably .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>saw that<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>would be cold if she sat out , and that<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>would be dull if she sat in , so he proposed a division of forces . They would hand the child her food through the window . Thus he was incidentally enabled to discuss the fortunes of<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1862"><said who="#Lucy">“ I have been thinking ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Lucy">“ and , unless you very much object , I would like to reopen that discussion . ”</said>She bowed .<said who="#Lucy">“ Nothing about the past . I know little and care less about that ; I am absolutely certain that it is to your cousin 's credit . She has acted loftily and rightly , and it is like her gentle modesty to say that we think too highly of her . But the future . Seriously , what do you think of this Greek plan ? ”</said>He pulled out the letter again .<said who="#Lucy">“ I do n't know whether you overheard , but she wants to join the Miss Alans in their mad career . It 's all — I can n't explain — it 's wrong . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1863"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>read the letter in silence , laid it down , seemed to hesitate , and then read it again .</p>
     <p n="1864"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ I can n't see the point of it myself . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1865">To his astonishment , she replied :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ There I cannot agree with you . In it I spy<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s salvation . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1866"><said who="#Lucy">“ Really . Now , why ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1867"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ She wanted to leave Windy Corner . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1868"><said who="#Lucy">“ I know — but it seems so odd , so unlike her , so — I was going to say — selfish . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1869"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ It is natural , surely — after such painful scenes — that she should desire a change . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1870">Here , apparently , was one of those points that the male intellect misses .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>exclaimed :<said who="#Lucy">“ So she says herself , and since another lady agrees with her , I must own that I am partially convinced . Perhaps she must have a change . I have no sisters or — and I do n't understand these things . But why need she go as far as Greece ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1871"><said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ You may well ask that , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, who was evidently interested , and had almost dropped her evasive manner .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ Why Greece ? ( What is it ,<persName corresp="#Beebe">Minnie</persName>dear — jam ? ) Why not Tunbridge Wells ? Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>! I had a long and most unsatisfactory interview with dear<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>this morning . I cannot help her . I will say no more . Perhaps I have already said too much . I am not to talk . I wanted her to spend six months with me at Tunbridge Wells , and she refused . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1872"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>poked at a crumb with his knife .</p>
     <p n="1873"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ But my feelings are of no importance . I know too well that I get on<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s nerves . Our tour was a failure . She wanted to leave Florence , and when we got to Rome she did not want to be in Rome , and all the time I felt that I was spending her mother 's money —. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1874"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Let us keep to the future , though , ”</said>interrupted<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I want your advice . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1875"><said who="#Charlotte">“ Very well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, with a choky abruptness that was new to him , though familiar to<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.<said who="#Charlotte">“ I for one will help her to go to Greece . Will you ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1876"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>considered .</p>
     <p n="1877"><said who="#Charlotte">“ It is absolutely necessary , ”</said>she continued , lowering her veil and whispering through it with a passion , an intensity , that surprised him .<said who="#Charlotte">“ I know — I know . ”</said>The darkness was coming on , and he felt that this odd woman really did know .<said who="#Charlotte">“ She must not stop here a moment , and we must keep quiet till she goes . I trust that the servants know nothing . Afterwards — but I may have said too much already . Only ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>and I are helpless against<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>alone . If you help we may succeed . Otherwise — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1878"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Otherwise —? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1879"><said who="#Charlotte">“ Otherwise , ”</said>she repeated as if the word held finality .</p>
     <p n="1880"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Yes , I will help her , ”</said>said the clergyman , setting his jaw firm .<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Come , let us go back now , and settle the whole thing up . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1881"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>burst into florid gratitude . The tavern sign — a beehive trimmed evenly with bees — creaked in the wind outside as she thanked him .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>did not quite understand the situation ; but then , he did not desire to understand it , nor to jump to the conclusion of “ another man ” that would have attracted a grosser mind . He only felt that<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be delivered , and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form . Its very vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry . His belief in celibacy , so reticent , so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture , now came to the surface and expanded like some delicate flower .<said who="#Lucy">“ They that marry do well , but they that refrain do better . ”</said>So ran his belief , and he never heard that an engagement was broken off but with a slight feeling of pleasure . In the case of<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, the feeling was intensified through dislike of<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>; and he was willing to go further — to place her out of danger until she could confirm her resolution of virginity . The feeling was very subtle and quite undogmatic , and he never imparted it to any other of the characters in this entanglement . Yet it existed , and it alone explains his action subsequently , and his influence on the action of others . The compact that he made with<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>in the tavern , was to help not only<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, but religion also .</p>
     <p n="1882">They hurried home through a world of black and grey . He conversed on indifferent topics : the Emersons ’ need of a housekeeper ; servants ; Italian servants ; novels about Italy ; novels with a purpose ; could literature influence life ? Windy Corner glimmered . In the garden ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, now helped by<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, still wrestled with the lives of her flowers .</p>
     <p n="1883"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ It gets too dark , ”</said>she said hopelessly .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ This comes of putting off . We might have known the weather would break up soon ; and now<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>wants to go to Greece . I do n't know what the world 's coming to . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1884"><said who="#Freddy">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Freddy">“ go to Greece she must . Come up to the house and let 's talk it over . Do you , in the first place , mind her breaking with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Vyse">Vyse</persName>? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1885"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, I 'm thankful — simply thankful . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1886"><said who="#Freddy">“ So am I , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1887"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Good . Now come up to the house . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1888">They conferred in the dining-room for half an hour .</p>
     <p n="1889"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>would never have carried the Greek scheme alone . It was expensive and dramatic — both qualities that her mother loathed . Nor would<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>have succeeded . The honours of the day rested with<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>. By his tact and common sense , and by his influence as a clergyman — for a clergyman who was not a fool influenced<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>greatly — he bent her to their purpose , “ I do n't see why Greece is necessary , ” she said ;<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ but as you do , I suppose it is all right . It must be something I can n't understand .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! Let 's tell her .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1890"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ She is playing the piano , ”</said><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>said . He opened the door , and heard the words of a song :</p>
     <p n="1891"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Look not thou on beauty 's charming . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1892"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I did n't know that<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>sang , too . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1893"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Sit thou still when kings are arming , Taste not when the wine-cup glistens — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1894"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ It 's a song that<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>gave her . How odd girls are ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1895"><said who="#Lucy">“ What 's that ? ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, stopping short .</p>
     <p n="1896"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ All right , dear , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>kindly . She went into the drawing-room , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>heard her kiss<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>and say :<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ I am sorry I was so cross about Greece , but it came on the top of the dahlias . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1897">Rather a hard voice said :<said who="#Lucy">“ Thank you , mother ; that does n't matter a bit . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1898"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ And you are right , too — Greece will be all right ; you can go if the Miss Alans will have you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1899"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , splendid ! Oh , thank you ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1900"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>followed .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>still sat at the piano with her hands over the keys . She was glad , but he had expected greater gladness . Her mother bent over her .<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, to whom she had been singing , reclined on the floor with his head against her , and an unlit pipe between his lips . Oddly enough , the group was beautiful .<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, who loved the art of the past , was reminded of a favourite theme , the Santa Conversazione , in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together about noble things — a theme neither sensual nor sensational , and therefore ignored by the art of to-day . Why should<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>want either to marry or to travel when she had such friends at home ?</p>
     <p n="1901"><said who="#Lucy">“ Taste not when the wine-cup glistens , Speak not when the people listens , ”</said></p>
     <p n="1902">she continued .</p>
     <p n="1903"><said who="#Lucy">“ Here 's<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="1904"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>knows my rude ways . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1905"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ It 's a beautiful song and a wise one , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Go on . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1906"><said who="#Lucy">“ It is n't very good , ”</said>she said listlessly .<said who="#Lucy">“ I forget why — harmony or something . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1907"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I suspected it was unscholarly . It 's so beautiful . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1908"><said who="#Freddy">“ The tune 's right enough , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>,<said who="#Freddy">“ but the words are rotten . Why throw up the sponge ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1909"><said who="#Freddy">“ How stupidly you talk ! ”</said>said his sister . The Santa Conversazione was broken up . After all , there was no reason that<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>should talk about Greece or thank him for persuading her mother , so he said good-bye .</p>
     <p n="1910"><persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch , and with his usual felicity of phrase , said :<said who="#Lucy">“ This has been a day and a half . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1911"><said who="#Freddy">“ Stop thine ear against the singer — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1912"><said who="#Lucy">“ Wait a minute ; she is finishing . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1913"><said who="#Freddy">“ From the red gold keep thy finger ; Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1914"><said who="#Freddy">“ I love weather like this , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1915"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>passed into it .</p>
     <p n="1916">The two main facts were clear . She had behaved splendidly , and he had helped her . He could not expect to master the details of so big a change in a girl 's life . If here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled , he must acquiesce ; she was choosing the better part .</p>
     <p n="1917"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Vacant heart and hand and eye — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1918">Perhaps the song stated “ the better part ” rather too strongly . He half fancied that the soaring accompaniment — which he did not lose in the shout of the gale — really agreed with<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, and was gently criticizing the words that it adorned :</p>
     <p n="1919"><said who="#Freddy">“ Vacant heart and hand and eye Easy live and quiet die . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1920">However , for the fourth time Windy Corner lay poised below him — now as a beacon in the roaring tides of darkness .</p>

     <head type="chapter">Chapter XIX : Lying to Mr. Emerson</head>
     <p n="1921">The Miss Alans were found in their beloved temperance hotel near Bloomsbury — a clean , airless establishment much patronized by provincial England . They always perched there before crossing the great seas , and for a week or two would fidget gently over clothes , guide-books , mackintosh squares , digestive bread , and other Continental necessaries . That there are shops abroad , even in Athens , never occurred to them , for they regarded travel as a species of warfare , only to be undertaken by those who have been fully armed at the Haymarket Stores .<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, they trusted , would take care to equip herself duly . Quinine could now be obtained in tabloids ; paper soap was a great help towards freshening up one 's face in the train .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>promised , a little depressed .</p>
     <p n="1922"><said who="#Lucy">“ But , of course , you know all about these things , and you have<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>to help you . A gentleman is such a stand-by . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1923"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, who had come up to town with her daughter , began to drum nervously upon her card-case .</p>
     <p n="1924"><said who="#Lucy">“ We think it so good of<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>to spare you , ”</said>Miss Catharine continued .<said who="#Lucy">“ It is not every young man who would be so unselfish . But perhaps he will come out and join you later on . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1925"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Or does his work keep him in London ? ”</said>said Miss Teresa , the more acute and less kindly of the two sisters .</p>
     <p n="1926"><said who="#Lucy">“ However , we shall see him when he sees you off . I do so long to see him . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1927"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ No one will see<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>off , ”</said>interposed<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ She does n't like it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1928"><said who="#Lucy">“ No , I hate seeings-off , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="1929"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Really ? How funny ! I should have thought that in this case — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1930"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, you are n't going ? It is such a pleasure to have met you ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1931">They escaped , and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>said with relief :<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ That 's all right . We just got through that time . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1932">But her mother was annoyed .<said who="#Lucy">“ I should be told , dear , that I am unsympathetic . But I cannot see why you did n't tell your friends about<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>and be done with it . There all the time we had to sit fencing , and almost telling lies , and be seen through , too , I dare say , which is most unpleasant . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1933"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had plenty to say in reply . She described the Miss Alans ’ character : they were such gossips , and if one told them , the news would be everywhere in no time .</p>
     <p n="1934"><said who="#Lucy">“ But why should n't it be everywhere in no time ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1935"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Because I settled with<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>not to announce it until I left England . I shall tell them then . It 's much pleasanter . How wet it is ! Let 's turn in here . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1936">“ Here ” was the British Museum .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>refused . If they must take shelter , let it be in a shop .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>felt contemptuous , for she was on the tack of caring for Greek sculpture , and had already borrowed a mythical dictionary from<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>to get up the names of the goddesses and gods .</p>
     <p n="1937"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , well , let it be shop , then . Let 's go to Mudie 's . I 'll buy a guide-book . ”</said></p>

Why this hushing up and tip-toeing ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1939"><said who="#Lucy">“ It 's only for a few days . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1940"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ But why at all ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1941"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was silent . She was drifting away from her mother . It was quite easy to say , “ Because<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George Emerson</persName>has been bothering me , and if he hears I 've given up<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>may begin again ” — quite easy , and it had the incidental advantage of being true . But she could not say it . She disliked confidences , for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that king of terrors — Light . Ever since that last evening at Florence she had deemed it unwise to reveal her soul .</p>
     <p n="1942"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>, too , was silent . She was thinking ,<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ My daughter wo n't answer me ; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than with<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>and me . Any rag , tag , and bobtail apparently does if she can leave her home . ”</said>And as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken long , she burst out with :<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ You 're tired of Windy Corner . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1943">This was perfectly true .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>had hoped to return to Windy Corner when she escaped from<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, but she discovered that her home existed no longer . It might exist for<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>, who still lived and thought straight , but not for one who had deliberately warped the brain . She did not acknowledge that her brain was warped , for the brain itself must assist in that acknowledgment , and she was disordering the very instruments of life . She only felt ,<said who="#Lucy">“ I do not love<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>; I broke off my engagement because I did not love<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>; I must go to Greece because I do not love<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>; it is more important that I should look up gods in the dictionary than that I should help my mother ; every one else is behaving very badly . ”</said>She only felt irritable and petulant , and anxious to do what she was not expected to do , and in this spirit she proceeded with the conversation .</p>
     <p n="1944"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Oh , mother , what rubbish you talk ! Of course I 'm not tired of Windy Corner . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1945"><said who="#Lucy">“ Then why not say so at once , instead of considering half an hour ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1946">She laughed faintly ,<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Half a minute would be nearer . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1947"><said who="#Lucy">“ Perhaps you would like to stay away from your home altogether ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1948"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Hush , mother ! People will hear you ”</said>; for they had entered Mudie 's . She bought Baedeker , and then continued :<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Of course I want to live at home ; but as we are talking about it , I may as well say that I shall want to be away in the future more than I have been . You see , I come into my money next year . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1949">Tears came into her mother 's eyes .</p>
     <p n="1950">Driven by nameless bewilderment , by what is in older people termed “ eccentricity , ”<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>determined to make this point clear .<said who="#Lucy">“ I 've seen the world so little — I felt so out of things in Italy . I have seen so little of life ; one ought to come up to London more — not a cheap ticket like to-day , but to stop . I might even share a flat for a little with some other girl . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1951"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ And mess with typewriters and latch-keys , ”</said>exploded<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ And agitate and scream , and be carried off kicking by the police . And call it a Mission — when no one wants you ! And call it Duty — when it means that you can n't stand your own home ! And call it Work — when thousands of men are starving with the competition as it is ! And then to prepare yourself , find two doddering old ladies , and go abroad with them . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1952"><said who="#Lucy">“ I want more independence , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>lamely ; she knew that she wanted something , and independence is a useful cry ; we can always say that we have not got it . She tried to remember her emotions in Florence : those had been sincere and passionate , and had suggested beauty rather than short skirts and latch-keys . But independence was certainly her cue .</p>
     <p n="1953"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Very well . Take your independence and be gone . Rush up and down and round the world , and come back as thin as a lath with the bad food . Despise the house that your father built and the garden that he planted , and our dear view — and then share a flat with another girl . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1954"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>screwed up her mouth and said :<said who="#Lucy">“ Perhaps I spoke hastily . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1955"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Oh , goodness ! ”</said>her mother flashed .<said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ How you do remind me of<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>Bartlett ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="1956"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>! ”</said>flashed<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>in her turn , pierced at last by a vivid pain .</p>
     <p n="1957"><said who="#Charlotte">“ More every moment . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1958"><said who="#Lucy">“ I do n't know what you mean , mother ;<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>and I are not the very least alike . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1959"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Well , I see the likeness . The same eternal worrying , the same taking back of words . You and<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>trying to divide two apples among three people last night might be sisters . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1960"><said who="#Lucy">“ What rubbish ! And if you dislike<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>so , it 's rather a pity you asked her to stop . I warned you about her ; I begged you , implored you not to , but of course it was not listened to . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1961"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ There you go . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1962"><said who="#Lucy">“ I beg your pardon ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1963"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>again , my dear ; that 's all ; her very words . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1964"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>clenched her teeth .<said who="#Lucy">“ My point is that you ought n't to have asked<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>to stop . I wish you would keep to the point . ”</said>And the conversation died off into a wrangle .</p>
     <p n="1965">She and her mother shopped in silence , spoke little in the train , little again in the carriage , which met them at Dorking Station . It had poured all day and as they ascended through the deep Surrey lanes showers of water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on the hood .<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>complained that the hood was stuffy . Leaning forward , she looked out into the steaming dusk , and watched the carriage-lamp pass like a search-light over mud and leaves , and reveal nothing beautiful .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ The crush when<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>gets in will be abominable , ”</said>she remarked . For they were to pick up<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>at Summer Street , where she had been dropped as the carriage went down , to pay a call on<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s old mother .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ We shall have to sit three a side , because the trees drop , and yet it is n't raining . Oh , for a little air ! ”</said>Then she listened to the horse 's hoofs —<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ He has not told — he has not told . ”</said>That melody was blurred by the soft road .<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ CAN'T we have the hood down ? ”</said>she demanded , and her mother , with sudden tenderness , said :<said who="#Lucy">“ Very well , old lady , stop the horse . ”</said>And the horse was stopped , and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>and Powell wrestled with the hood , and squirted water down<persName corresp="#Mrs._Honeychurch">Mrs. Honeychurch</persName>'s neck . But now that the hood was down , she did see something that she would have missed — there were no lights in the windows of Cissie Villa , and round the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock .</p>
     <p n="1966"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Is that house to let again , Powell ? ”</said>she called .</p>
     <p n="1967"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yes , miss , ”</said>he replied .</p>
     <p n="1968"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ Have they gone ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1969"><said who="#Lucy">“ It is too far out of town for the young gentleman , and his father 's rheumatism has come on , so he can n't stop on alone , so they are trying to let furnished , ”</said>was the answer .</p>
     <p n="1970"><said who="#Mrs._Honeychurch">“ They have gone , then ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1971"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yes , miss , they have gone . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1972"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>sank back . The carriage stopped at the Rectory . She got out to call for<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>. So the Emersons had gone , and all this bother about Greece had been unnecessary . Waste ! That word seemed to sum up the whole of life . Wasted plans , wasted money , wasted love , and she had wounded her mother . Was it possible that she had muddled things away ? Quite possible . Other people had . When the maid opened the door , she was unable to speak , and stared stupidly into the hall .</p>
     <p n="1973"><persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>at once came forward , and after a long preamble asked a great favour : might she go to church ?<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>and his mother had already gone , but she had refused to start until she obtained her hostess 's full sanction , for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a good ten minutes more .</p>
     <p n="1974"><said who="#the_hostess">“ Certainly , ”</said>said the hostess wearily .<said who="#the_hostess">“ I forgot it was Friday . Let 's all go . Powell can go round to the stables . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1975"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>dearest — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1976"><said who="#the_hostess">“ No church for me , thank you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1977">A sigh , and they departed . The church was invisible , but up in the darkness to the left there was a hint of colour . This was a stained window , through which some feeble light was shining , and when the door opened<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>heard<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s voice running through the litany to a minute congregation . Even their church , built upon the slope of the hill so artfully , with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery shingle — even their church had lost its charm ; and the thing one never talked about — religion — was fading like all the other things .</p>
     <p n="1978">She followed the maid into the Rectory .</p>
     <p n="1979">Would she object to sitting in<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s study ? There was only that one fire .</p>
     <p n="1980">She would not object .</p>
     <p n="1981">Some one was there already , for<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>heard the words :<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ A lady to wait , sir . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1982">Old<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>was sitting by the fire , with his foot upon a gout-stool .</p>
     <p n="1983"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, that you should come ! ”</said>he quavered ; and<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>saw an alteration in him since last Sunday .</p>
     <p n="1984">Not a word would come to her lips .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>she had faced , and could have faced again , but she had forgotten how to treat his father .</p>
     <p n="1985"><said>“<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, dear , we are so sorry !<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>is so sorry ! He thought he had a right to try . I cannot blame my boy , and yet I wish he had told me first . He ought not to have tried . I knew nothing about it at all . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1986">If only she could remember how to behave !</p>
     <p n="1987">He held up his hand .<said who="#George_Emerson">“ But you must not scold him . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1988"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>turned her back , and began to look at<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>'s books .</p>
     <p n="1989"><said who="#Lucy">“ I taught him , ”</said>he quavered , “ to trust in love . I said : ‘ When love comes , that is reality . ’ I said : ‘ Passion does not blind . No . Passion is sanity , and the woman you love , she is the only person you will ever really understand . ’ ” He sighed : “ True , everlastingly true , though my day is over , and though there is the result . Poor boy ! He is so sorry ! He said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in ; that whatever you felt you did not mean . Yet ” — his voice gathered strength : he spoke out to make certain —<said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, do you remember Italy ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1990"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>selected a book — a volume of Old Testament commentaries . Holding it up to her eyes , she said :<said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ I have no wish to discuss Italy or any subject connected with your son . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1991"><said who="#Lucy">“ But you do remember it ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1992"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ He has misbehaved himself from the first . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1993"><said who="#Lucy">“ I only was told that he loved you last Sunday . I never could judge behaviour . I — I — suppose he has . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1994">Feeling a little steadier , she put the book back and turned round to him . His face was drooping and swollen , but his eyes , though they were sunken deep , gleamed with a child 's courage .</p>
     <p n="1995"><said who="#Lucy">“ Why , he has behaved abominably , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Lucy">“ I am glad he is sorry . Do you know what he did ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="1996"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Not ‘ abominably , ’ ”</said>was the gentle correction .<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ He only tried when he should not have tried . You have all you want ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>: you are going to marry the man you love . Do not go out of<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>'s life saying he is abominable . ”</said></p>
     <p n="1997"><said who="#Lucy">“ No , of course , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, ashamed at the reference to<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>.<said who="#Lucy">“ ‘ Abominable ’ is much too strong . I am sorry I used it about your son . I think I will go to church , after all . My mother and my cousin have gone . I shall not be so very late — ”</said></p>
     <p n="1998"><said who="#Cecil">“ Especially as he has gone under , ”</said>he said quietly .</p>
     <p n="1999"><said who="#Lucy">“ What was that ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2000"><said who="#Cecil">“ Gone under naturally . ”</said>He beat his palms together in silence ; his head fell on his chest .</p>
     <p n="2001"><said who="#Lucy">“ I do n't understand . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2002"><said who="#Cecil">“ As his mother did . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2003"><said who="#Lucy">“ But ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>— MR. EMERSON — what are you talking about ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2004"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ When I would n't have<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>baptized , ”</said>said he .</p>
     <p n="2005"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>was frightened .</p>
     <p n="2006"><said who="#Lucy">“ And she agreed that baptism was nothing , but he caught that fever when he was twelve and she turned round . She thought it a judgment . ”</said>He shuddered .<said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , horrible , when we had given up that sort of thing and broken away from her parents . Oh , horrible — worst of all — worse than death , when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness , planted your little garden , let in your sunlight , and then the weeds creep in again ! A judgment ! And our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had dropped water on him in church ! Is it possible ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>? Shall we slip back into the darkness for ever ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2007"><said who="#Lucy">“ I do n't know , ”</said>gasped<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.<said who="#Lucy">“ I do n't understand this sort of thing . I was not meant to understand it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2008"><said who="#Cecil">“ But Mr . Eager — he came when I was out , and acted according to his principles . I do n't blame him or any one ... but by the time<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>was well she was ill . He made her think about sin , and she went under thinking about it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2009">It was thus that<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>had murdered his wife in the sight of God .</p>
     <p n="2010"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , how terrible ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, forgetting her own affairs at last .</p>
     <p n="2011"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ He was not baptized , ”</said>said the old man .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I did hold firm . ”</said>And he looked with unwavering eyes at the rows of books , as if — at what cost !— he had won a victory over them .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ My boy shall go back to the earth untouched . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2012">She asked whether young<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>was ill .</p>
     <p n="2013"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ Oh — last Sunday . ”</said>He started into the present .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>last Sunday — no , not ill : just gone under . He is never ill . But he is his mother 's son . Her eyes were his , and she had that forehead that I think so beautiful , and he will not think it worth while to live . It was always touch and go . He will live ; but he will not think it worth while to live . He will never think anything worth while . You remember that church at Florence ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2014"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>did remember , and how she had suggested that<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>should collect postage stamps .</p>
     <p n="2015"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ After you left Florence — horrible . Then we took the house here , and he goes bathing with your brother , and became better . You saw him bathing ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2016"><said who="#Lucy">“ I am so sorry , but it is no good discussing this affair . I am deeply sorry about it . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2017"><said>“ Then there came something about a novel . I did n't follow it at all ; I had to hear so much , and he minded telling me ; he finds me too old . Ah , well , one must have failures .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>comes down to-morrow , and takes me up to his London rooms . He can n't bear to be about here , and I must be where he is . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2018"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, ”</said>cried the girl ,<said who="#Lucy">“ do n't leave at least , not on my account . I am going to Greece . Do n't leave your comfortable house . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2019">It was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ How good every one is ! And look at<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>housing me — came over this morning and heard I was going ! Here I am so comfortable with a fire . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2020"><said who="#Lucy">“ Yes , but you wo n't go back to London . It 's absurd . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2021"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I must be with<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>; I must make him care to live , and down here he can n't . He says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you — I am not justifying him : I am only saying what has happened . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2022"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>”</said>— she took hold of his hand —<said who="#Lucy">“ you must n't . I 've been bother enough to the world by now . I can n't have you moving out of your house when you like it , and perhaps losing money through it — all on my account . You must stop ! I am just going to Greece . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2023"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ All the way to Greece ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2024">Her manner altered .</p>
     <p n="2025"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ To Greece ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2026"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ So you must stop . You wo n't talk about this business , I know . I can trust you both . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2027"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Certainly you can . We either have you in our lives , or leave you to the life that you have chosen . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2028"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I should n't want — ”</said></p>
     <p n="2029"><said>“ I suppose<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>is very angry with<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>? No , it was wrong of<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>to try . We have pushed our beliefs too far . I fancy that we deserve sorrow . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2030">She looked at the books again — black , brown , and that acrid theological blue . They surrounded the visitors on every side ; they were piled on the tables , they pressed against the very ceiling . To<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>who could not see that<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>was profoundly religious , and differed from<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion — it seemed dreadful that the old man should crawl into such a sanctum , when he was unhappy , and be dependent on the bounty of a clergyman .</p>
     <p n="2031">More certain than ever that she was tired , he offered her his chair .</p>
     <p n="2032"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ No , please sit still . I think I will sit in the carriage . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2033"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, you do sound tired . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2034"><said who="#Lucy">“ Not a bit , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, with trembling lips .</p>
     <p n="2035"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ But you are , and there 's a look of<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>about you . And what were you saying about going abroad ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2036">She was silent .</p>
     <p n="2037"><said who="#Lucy">“ Greece ”</said>— and she saw that he was thinking the word over —<said who="#Lucy">“ Greece ; but you were to be married this year , I thought . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2038"><said who="#Lucy">“ Not till January , it was n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, clasping her hands . Would she tell an actual lie when it came to the point ?</p>
     <p n="2039"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I suppose that<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>is going with you . I hope — it is n't because<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>spoke that you are both going ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2040"><said who="#Lucy">“ No . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2041"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I hope that you will enjoy Greece with<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="2042"><said who="#Lucy">“ Thank you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2043">At that moment<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>came back from church . His cassock was covered with rain .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ That 's all right , ”</said>he said kindly .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I counted on you two keeping each other company . It 's pouring again . The entire congregation , which consists of your cousin , your mother , and my mother , stands waiting in the church , till the carriage fetches it . Did Powell go round ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2044"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I think so ; I 'll see . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2045"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ No — of course , I 'll see . How are the Miss Alans ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2046"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Very well , thank you . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2047"><said who="#Lucy">“ Did you tell<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>about Greece ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2048"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I — I did . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2049"><said who="#Lucy">“ Do n't you think it very plucky of her ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, to undertake the two Miss Alans ? Now ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, go back — keep warm . I think three is such a courageous number to go travelling . ”</said>And he hurried off to the stables .</p>
     <p n="2050"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ He is not going , ”</said>she said hoarsely .<said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ I made a slip .<persName corresp="#Mr._Vyse">Mr. Vyse</persName>does stop behind in England . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2051">Somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man . To<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, to<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>, she would have lied again ; but he seemed so near the end of things , so dignified in his approach to the gulf , of which he gave one account , and the books that surrounded him another , so mild to the rough paths that he had traversed , that the true chivalry — not the worn-out chivalry of sex , but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the old — awoke in her , and , at whatever risk , she told him that<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>was not her companion to Greece . And she spoke so seriously that the risk became a certainty , and he , lifting his eyes , said :<said who="#Cecil">“ You are leaving him ? You are leaving the man you love ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2052"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ I — I had to . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2053"><said who="#Cecil">“ Why ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>, why ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2054">Terror came over her , and she lied again . She made the long , convincing speech that she had made to<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, and intended to make to the world when she announced that her engagement was no more . He heard her in silence , and then said : “ My dear , I am worried about you . It seems to me ” — dreamily ; she was not alarmed —<said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ that you are in a muddle . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2055">She shook her head .</p>
     <p n="2056"><said who="#Cecil">“ Take an old man 's word ; there 's nothing worse than a muddle in all the world . It is easy to face Death and<persName corresp="#Fate">Fate</persName>, and the things that sound so dreadful . It is on my muddles that I look back with horror — on the things that I might have avoided . We can help one another but little . I used to think I could teach young people the whole of life , but I know better now , and all my teaching of<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>has come down to this : beware of muddle . Do you remember in that church , when you pretended to be annoyed with me and were n't ? Do you remember before , when you refused the room with the view ? Those were muddles — little , but ominous — and I am fearing that you are in one now . ”</said>She was silent .<said who="#Cecil">“ Do n't trust me ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>. Though life is very glorious , it is difficult . ”</said>She was still silent .<said who="#Cecil">“ ‘ Life ’ wrote a friend of mine , ‘ is a public performance on the violin , in which you must learn the instrument as you go along . ’ I think he puts it well . Man has to pick up the use of his functions as he goes along — especially the function of Love . ”</said>Then he burst out excitedly ;<said who="#Lucy">“ That 's it ; that 's what I mean . You love<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>! ”</said>And after his long preamble , the three words burst against<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>like waves from the open sea .</p>
     <p n="2057"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ But you do , ”</said>he went on , not waiting for contradiction .<said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ You love the boy body and soul , plainly , directly , as he loves you , and no other word expresses it . You wo n't marry the other man for his sake . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2058"><said who="#Lucy">“ How dare you ! ”</said>gasped<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, with the roaring of waters in her ears .<said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , how like a man !— I mean , to suppose that a woman is always thinking about a man . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2059"><said who="#Cecil">“ But you are . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2060">She summoned physical disgust .</p>
     <p n="2061"><said who="#Lucy">“ You 're shocked , but I mean to shock you . It 's the only hope at times . I can reach you no other way . You must marry , or your life will be wasted . You have gone too far to retreat . I have no time for the tenderness , and the comradeship , and the poetry , and the things that really matter , and for which you marry . I know that , with<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, you will find them , and that you love him . Then be his wife . He is already part of you . Though you fly to Greece , and never see him again , or forget his very name ,<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>will work in your thoughts till you die . It is n't possible to love and to part . You will wish that it was . You can transmute love , ignore it , muddle it , but you can never pull it out of you . I know by experience that the poets are right : love is eternal . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2062"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>began to cry with anger , and though her anger passed away soon , her tears remained .</p>
     <p n="2063"><said>“ I only wish poets would say this , too : love is of the body ; not the body , but of the body . Ah ! the misery that would be saved if we confessed that ! Ah ! for a little directness to liberate the soul ! Your soul , dear<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! I hate the word now , because of all the cant with which superstition has wrapped it round . But we have souls . I cannot say how they came nor whither they go , but we have them , and I see you ruining yours . I cannot bear it . It is again the darkness creeping in ; it is hell . ”</said>Then he checked himself .<said who="#Lucy">“ What nonsense I have talked — how abstract and remote ! And I have made you cry ! Dear girl , forgive my prosiness ; marry my boy . When I think what life is , and how seldom love is answered by love — Marry him ; it is one of the moments for which the world was made . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2064">She could not understand him ; the words were indeed remote . Yet as he spoke the darkness was withdrawn , veil after veil , and she saw to the bottom of her soul .</p>
     <p n="2065"><said who="#Cecil">“ Then ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>— ”</said></p>
     <p n="2066"><said who="#Lucy">“ You 've frightened me , ”</said>she moaned .<said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>—<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>— the ticket 's bought — everything . ”</said>She fell sobbing into the chair .<said who="#Lucy">“ I 'm caught in the tangle . I must suffer and grow old away from him . I cannot break the whole of life for his sake . They trusted me . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2067">A carriage drew up at the front-door .</p>
     <p n="2068"><said who="#Lucy">“ Give<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>my love — once only . Tell him ‘ muddle . ’ ”</said>Then she arranged her veil , while the tears poured over her cheeks inside .</p>
     <p n="2069"><said who="#Cecil">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>— ”</said></p>
     <p n="2070"><said who="#Lucy">“ No — they are in the hall — oh , please not ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>— they trust me — ”</said></p>
     <p n="2071"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ But why should they , when you have deceived them ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2072"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>opened the door , saying :<said who="#Lucy">“ Here 's my mother . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2073"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ You 're not worthy of their trust . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2074"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ What 's that ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>sharply .</p>
     <p n="2075"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I was saying , why should you trust her when she deceived you ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2076"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ One minute , mother . ”</said>He came in and shut the door .</p>
     <p n="2077"><said who="#Lucy">“ I do n't follow you ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>. To whom do you refer ? Trust whom ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2078"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ I mean she has pretended to you that she did not love<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>. They have loved one another all along . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2079"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>looked at the sobbing girl . He was very quiet , and his white face , with its ruddy whiskers , seemed suddenly inhuman . A long black column , he stood and awaited her reply .</p>
     <p n="2080"><said who="#Lucy">“ I shall never marry him , ”</said>quavered<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>.</p>
     <p n="2081">A look of contempt came over him , and he said ,<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Why not ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2082"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>— I have misled you — I have misled myself — ”</said></p>
     <p n="2083"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Oh , rubbish ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>! ”</said></p>
     <p n="2084"><said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ It is not rubbish ! ”</said>said the old man hotly .<said who="#Miss_Honeychurch">“ It 's the part of people that you do n't understand . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2085"><persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>laid his hand on the old man 's shoulder pleasantly .</p>
     <p n="2086"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>!<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! ”</said>called voices from the carriage .</p>
     <p n="2087"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>, could you help me ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2088">He looked amazed at the request , and said in a low , stern voice :<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ I am more grieved than I can possibly express . It is lamentable , lamentable — incredible . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2089"><said who="#Lucy">“ What 's wrong with the boy ? ”</said>fired up the other again .</p>
     <p n="2090"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Nothing ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>, except that he no longer interests me . Marry<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>,<persName corresp="#Miss_Honeychurch">Miss Honeychurch</persName>. He will do admirably . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2091">He walked out and left them . They heard him guiding his mother up-stairs .</p>
     <p n="2092"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>! ”</said>the voices called .</p>
     <p n="2093">She turned to<persName corresp="#Mr._Emerson">Mr. Emerson</persName>in despair . But his face revived her . It was the face of a saint who understood .</p>
     <p n="2094"><said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Now it is all dark . Now Beauty and Passion seem never to have existed . I know . But remember the mountains over Florence and the view . Ah , dear , if I were<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, and gave you one kiss , it would make you brave . You have to go cold into a battle that needs warmth , out into the muddle that you have made yourself ; and your mother and all your friends will despise you , oh , my darling , and rightly , if it is ever right to despise .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>still dark , all the tussle and the misery without a word from him . Am I justified ? ”</said>Into his own eyes tears came .<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ Yes , for we fight for more than Love or Pleasure ; there is Truth . Truth counts , Truth does count . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2095"><said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ You kiss me , ”</said>said the girl .<said who="#Mr._Emerson">“ You kiss me . I will try . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2096">He gave her a sense of deities reconciled , a feeling that , in gaining the man she loved , she would gain something for the whole world . Throughout the squalor of her homeward drive — she spoke at once — his salutation remained . He had robbed the body of its taint , the world 's taunts of their sting ; he had shown her the holiness of direct desire . She “ never exactly understood , ” she would say in after years ,<said who="#Mr._Beebe">“ how he managed to strengthen her . It was as if he had made her see the whole of everything at once . ”</said></p>

     <p n="2097">The Miss Alans did go to Greece , but they went by themselves . They alone of this little company will double Malea and plough the waters of the Saronic gulf . They alone will visit Athens and Delphi , and either shrine of intellectual song — that upon the Acropolis , encircled by blue seas ; that under Parnassus , where the eagles build and the bronze charioteer drives undismayed towards infinity . Trembling , anxious , cumbered with much digestive bread , they did proceed to Constantinople , they did go round the world . The rest of us must be contented with a fair , but a less arduous , goal . Italiam petimus : we return to the Pension Bertolini .</p>
     <p n="2098"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>said it was his old room .</p>
     <p n="2099"><said who="#Lucy">“ No , it is n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>;<said who="#Lucy">“ because it is the room I had , and I had your father 's room . I forget why ;<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>made me , for some reason . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2100">He knelt on the tiled floor , and laid his face in her lap .</p>
     <p n="2101"><said who="#Lucy">“<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, you baby , get up . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2102"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Why should n't I be a baby ? ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>.</p>
     <p n="2103">Unable to answer this question , she put down his sock , which she was trying to mend , and gazed out through the window . It was evening and again the spring .</p>
     <p n="2104"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , bother<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, ”</said>she said thoughtfully .<said who="#Lucy">“ What can such people be made of ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2105"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Same stuff as parsons are made of . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2106"><said who="#Lucy">“ Nonsense ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="2107"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Quite right . It is nonsense . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2108"><said who="#Lucy">“ Now you get up off the cold floor , or you 'll be starting rheumatism next , and you stop laughing and being so silly . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2109"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Why should n't I laugh ? ”</said>he asked , pinning her with his elbows , and advancing his face to hers .<said who="#George_Emerson">“ What 's there to cry at ? Kiss me here . ”</said>He indicated the spot where a kiss would be welcome .</p>
     <p n="2110">He was a boy after all . When it came to the point , it was she who remembered the past , she into whose soul the iron had entered , she who knew whose room this had been last year . It endeared him to her strangely that he should be sometimes wrong .</p>
     <p n="2111"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Any letters ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
     <p n="2112"><said who="#Lucy">“ Just a line from<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>. ”</said></p>
     <p n="2113"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Now kiss me here ; then here . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2114">Then , threatened again with rheumatism , he strolled to the window , opened it ( as the English will ) , and leant out . There was the parapet , there the river , there to the left the beginnings of the hills . The cab-driver , who at once saluted him with the hiss of a serpent , might be that very<persName corresp="#Phaethon">Phaethon</persName>who had set this happiness in motion twelve months ago . A passion of gratitude — all feelings grow to passions in the South — came over the husband , and he blessed the people and the things who had taken so much trouble about a young fool . He had helped himself , it is true , but how stupidly !</p>
     <p n="2115">All the fighting that mattered had been done by others — by Italy , by his father , by his wife .</p>
     <p n="2116"><said who="#Phaethon">“<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, you come and look at the cypresses ; and the church , whatever its name is , still shows . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2117"><said who="#Lucy">“ San Miniato . I 'll just finish your sock . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2118"><said who="#Phaethon">“ Signorino , domani faremo uno giro , ”</said>called the cabman , with engaging certainty .</p>
     <p n="2119"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>told him that he was mistaken ; they had no money to throw away on driving .</p>
     <p n="2120">And the people who had not meant to help — the Miss Lavishes , the Cecils , the Miss Bartletts ! Ever prone to magnify<persName corresp="#Fate">Fate</persName>,<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>counted up the forces that had swept him into this contentment .</p>
     <p n="2121"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Anything good in<persName corresp="#Freddy">Freddy</persName>'s letter ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2122"><said who="#Fate">“ Not yet . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2123">His own content was absolute , but hers held bitterness : the Honeychurches had not forgiven them ; they were disgusted at her past hypocrisy ; she had alienated Windy Corner , perhaps for ever .</p>
     <p n="2124"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ What does he say ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2125"><said who="#Fate">“ Silly boy ! He thinks he 's being dignified . He knew we should go off in the spring — he has known it for six months — that if mother would n't give her consent we should take the thing into our own hands . They had fair warning , and now he calls it an elopement . Ridiculous boy — ”</said></p>
     <p n="2126"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Signorino , domani faremo uno giro — ”</said></p>
     <p n="2127"><said who="#Fate">“ But it will all come right in the end . He has to build us both up from the beginning again . I wish , though , that<persName corresp="#Cecil">Cecil</persName>had not turned so cynical about women . He has , for the second time , quite altered . Why will men have theories about women ? I have n't any about men . I wish , too , that<persName corresp="#Mr._Beebe">Mr. Beebe</persName>— ”</said></p>
     <p n="2128"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ You may well wish that . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2129"><said who="#Fate">“ He will never forgive us — I mean , he will never be interested in us again . I wish that he did not influence them so much at Windy Corner . I wish he had n't — But if we act the truth , the people who really love us are sure to come back to us in the long run . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2130"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Perhaps . ”</said>Then he said more gently :<said who="#George_Emerson">“ Well , I acted the truth — the only thing I did do — and you came back to me . So possibly you know . ”</said>He turned back into the room .<said who="#George_Emerson">“ Nonsense with that sock . ”</said>He carried her to the window , so that she , too , saw all the view . They sank upon their knees , invisible from the road , they hoped , and began to whisper one another 's names . Ah ! it was worth while ; it was the great joy that they had expected , and countless little joys of which they had never dreamt . They were silent .</p>
     <p n="2131"><said who="#Fate">“ Signorino , domani faremo — ”</said></p>
     <p n="2132"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Oh , bother that man ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="2133">But<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>remembered the vendor of photographs and said ,<said who="#Fate">“ No , do n't be rude to him . ”</said>Then with a catching of her breath , she murmured :<said who="#Fate">“ Mr . Eager and<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>, dreadful frozen<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>. How cruel she would be to a man like that ! ”</said></p>
     <p n="2134"><said who="#Lucy">“ Look at the lights going over the bridge . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2135"><said who="#Fate">“ But this room reminds me of<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>. How horrible to grow old in<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>'s way ! To think that evening at the rectory that she should n't have heard your father was in the house . For she would have stopped me going in , and he was the only person alive who could have made me see sense . You could n't have made me . When I am very happy ”</said>— she kissed him —<said who="#Fate">“ I remember on how little it all hangs . If<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>had only known , she would have stopped me going in , and I should have gone to silly Greece , and become different for ever . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2136"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ But she did know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>;<said who="#George_Emerson">“ she did see my father , surely . He said so . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2137"><said who="#Lucy">“ Oh , no , she did n't see him . She was upstairs with old Mrs. Beebe , do n't you remember , and then went straight to the church . She said so . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2138"><persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>was obstinate again .<said who="#George_Emerson">“ My father , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#George_Emerson">“ saw her , and I prefer his word . He was dozing by the study fire , and he opened his eyes , and there was<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>. A few minutes before you came in . She was turning to go as he woke up . He did n't speak to her . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2139">Then they spoke of other things — the desultory talk of those who have been fighting to reach one another , and whose reward is to rest quietly in each other 's arms . It was long ere they returned to<persName corresp="#Miss_Bartlett">Miss Bartlett</persName>, but when they did her behaviour seemed more interesting .<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>, who disliked any darkness , said :<said who="#Miss_Bartlett">“ It 's clear that she knew . Then , why did she risk the meeting ? She knew he was there , and yet she went to church . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2140">They tried to piece the thing together .</p>
     <p n="2141">As they talked , an incredible solution came into<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>'s mind . She rejected it , and said :<said who="#Lucy">“ How like<persName corresp="#Charlotte">Charlotte</persName>to undo her work by a feeble muddle at the last moment . ”</said>But something in the dying evening , in the roar of the river , in their very embrace warned them that her words fell short of life , and<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>whispered :<said who="#Lucy">“ Or did she mean it ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2142"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Mean what ? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2143"><said who="#Lucy">“ Signorino , domani faremo uno giro — ”</said></p>
     <p n="2144"><persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>bent forward and said with gentleness :<said who="#George_Emerson">“ Lascia , prego , lascia . Siamo sposati . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2145"><said who="#Lucy">“ Scusi tanto , signora , ”</said>he replied in tones as gentle and whipped up his horse .</p>
     <p n="2146"><said who="#George_Emerson">“ Buona sera — e grazie . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2147"><said who="#Lucy">“ Niente . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2148">The cabman drove away singing .</p>
     <p n="2149"><said who="#Lucy">“ Mean what ,<persName corresp="#George_Emerson">George</persName>? ”</said></p>
     <p n="2150">He whispered :<said who="#George_Emerson">“ Is it this ? Is this possible ? I 'll put a marvel to you . That your cousin has always hoped . That from the very first moment we met , she hoped , far down in her mind , that we should be like this — of course , very far down . That she fought us on the surface , and yet she hoped . I can n't explain her any other way . Can you ? Look how she kept me alive in you all the summer ; how she gave you no peace ; how month after month she became more eccentric and unreliable . The sight of us haunted her — or she could n't have described us as she did to her friend . There are details — it burnt . I read the book afterwards . She is not frozen ,<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, she is not withered up all through . She tore us apart twice , but in the rectory that evening she was given one more chance to make us happy . We can never make friends with her or thank her . But I do believe that , far down in her heart , far below all speech and behaviour , she is glad . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2151"><said who="#Lucy">“ It is impossible , ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Lucy">Lucy</persName>, and then , remembering the experiences of her own heart , she said :<said who="#Lucy">“ No — it is just possible . ”</said></p>
     <p n="2152">Youth enwrapped them ; the song of<persName corresp="#Phaethon">Phaethon</persName>announced passion requited , love attained . But they were conscious of a love more mysterious than this . The song died away ; they heard the river , bearing down the snows of winter into the Mediterranean .</p>
