   <div type="chapter" n="1">
    <p n="1">The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time as “ The Styles Case ” has now somewhat subsided . Nevertheless , in view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it , I have been asked , both by my friend<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>and the family themselves , to write an account of the whole story . This , we trust , will effectually silence the sensational rumours which still persist .</p>
    <p n="2">I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair .</p>
    <p n="3">I had been invalided home from the Front ; and , after spending some months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home , was given a month 's sick leave . Having no near relations or friends , I was trying to make up my mind what to do , when I ran across<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>. I had seen very little of him for some years . Indeed , I had never known him particularly well . He was a good fifteen years my senior , for one thing , though he hardly looked his forty-five years . As a boy , though , I had often stayed at Styles , his mother 's place in Essex .</p>
    <p n="4">We had a good yarn about old times , and it ended in his inviting me down to Styles to spend my leave there .</p>
    <p n="5"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ The mater will be delighted to see you again — after all those years , ”</said>he added .</p>
    <p n="6"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Your mother keeps well ? ”</said>I asked .</p>
    <p n="7"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Oh , yes . I suppose you know that she has married again ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="8">I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>, who had married<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s father when he was a widower with two sons , had been a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her . She certainly could not be a day less than seventy now . I recalled her as an energetic , autocratic personality , somewhat inclined to charitable and social notoriety , with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady Bountiful . She was a most generous woman , and possessed a considerable fortune of her own .</p>
    <p n="9">Their country-place , Styles Court , had been purchased by<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>early in their married life . He had been completely under his wife 's ascendancy , so much so that , on dying , he left the place to her for her lifetime , as well as the larger part of his income ; an arrangement that was distinctly unfair to his two sons . Their step-mother , however , had always been most generous to them ; indeed , they were so young at the time of their father 's remarriage that they always thought of her as their own mother .</p>
    <p n="10"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>, the younger , had been a delicate youth . He had qualified as a doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine , and lived at home while pursuing literary ambitions ; though his verses never had any marked success .</p>
    <p n="11"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>practiced for some time as a barrister , but had finally settled down to the more congenial life of a country squire . He had married two years ago , and had taken his wife to live at Styles , though I entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother to increase his allowance , which would have enabled him to have a home of his own .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>, however , was a lady who liked to make her own plans , and expected other people to fall in with them , and in this case she certainly had the whip hand , namely : the purse strings .</p>
    <p n="12"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>noticed my surprise at the news of his mother 's remarriage and smiled rather ruefully .</p>
    <p n="13"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Rotten little bounder too ! ”</said>he said savagely .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I can tell you ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>, it 's making life jolly difficult for us . As for<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>— you remember<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="14"><said who="#Hastings">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="15"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Oh , I suppose she was after your time . She 's the mater 's factotum , companion , Jack of all trades ! A great sport — old<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>! Not precisely young and beautiful , but as game as they make them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="16"><said who="#Hastings">“ You were going to say ——? ”</said></p>
    <p n="17"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Oh , this fellow ! He turned up from nowhere , on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>'s , though she did n't seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship . The fellow is an absolute outsider , anyone can see that . He 's got a great black beard , and wears patent leather boots in all weathers ! But the mater cottoned to him at once , took him on as secretary — you know how she 's always running a hundred societies ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="18">I nodded .</p>
    <p n="19"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Well , of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands . No doubt the fellow was very useful to her . But you could have knocked us all down with a feather when , three months ago , she suddenly announced that she and<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>were engaged ! The fellow must be at least twenty years younger than she is ! It 's simply bare-faced fortune hunting ; but there you are — she is her own mistress , and she 's married him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="20"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ It must be a difficult situation for you all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="21"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Difficult ! It 's damnable ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="22">Thus it came about that , three days later , I descended from the train at Styles St. Mary , an absurd little station , with no apparent reason for existence , perched up in the midst of green fields and country lanes .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>was waiting on the platform , and piloted me out to the car .</p>
    <p n="23"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Got a drop or two of petrol still , you see , ”</said>he remarked .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Mainly owing to the mater 's activities . ”</said></p>
    <p n="24">The village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the little station , and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it . It was a still , warm day in early July . As one looked out over the flat Essex country , lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun , it seemed almost impossible to believe that , not so very far away , a great war was running its appointed course . I felt I had suddenly strayed into another world . As we turned in at the lodge gates ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>said :</p>
    <p n="25"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I 'm afraid you 'll find it very quiet down here ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="26"><said who="#Hastings">“ My dear fellow , that 's just what I want . ”</said></p>
    <p n="27"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Oh , it 's pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life . I drill with the volunteers twice a week , and lend a hand at the farms . My wife works regularly ‘ on the land ’ . She is up at five every morning to milk , and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime . It 's a jolly good life taking it all round — if it were n't for that fellow<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>! ”</said>He checked the car suddenly , and glanced at his watch .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I wonder if we 've time to pick up<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>. No , she 'll have started from the hospital by now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="28"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>! That 's not your wife ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="29"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No ,<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>is a protegee of my mother 's , the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers , who married a rascally solicitor . He came a cropper , and the girl was left an orphan and penniless . My mother came to the rescue , and<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>has been with us nearly two years now . She works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster , seven miles away . ”</said></p>
    <p n="30">As he spoke the last words , we drew up in front of the fine old house . A lady in a stout tweed skirt , who was bending over a flower bed , straightened herself at our approach .</p>
    <p n="31"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Hullo ,<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>, here 's our wounded hero !<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>—<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="32"><persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>shook hands with a hearty , almost painful , grip . I had an impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face . She was a pleasant-looking woman of about forty , with a deep voice , almost manly in its stentorian tones , and had a large sensible square body , with feet to match — these last encased in good thick boots . Her conversation , I soon found , was couched in the telegraphic style .</p>
    <p n="33"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Weeds grow like house afire . Ca n't keep even with ‘ em . Shall press you in . Better be careful . ”</said></p>
    <p n="34"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I 'm sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful , ”</said>I responded .</p>
    <p n="35"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Do n't say it . Never does . Wish you had n't later . ”</said></p>
    <p n="36"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ You 're a cynic ,<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, laughing .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Where 's tea to-day — inside or out ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="37"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Out . Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house . ”</said></p>
    <p n="38"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Come on then , you 've done enough gardening for to-day . ‘ The labourer is worthy of his hire ’ , you know . Come and be refreshed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="39"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, drawing off her gardening gloves ,<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ I 'm inclined to agree with you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="40">She led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade of a large sycamore .</p>
    <p n="41">A figure rose from one of the basket chairs , and came a few steps to meet us .</p>
    <p n="42"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ My wife ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.</p>
    <p n="43">I shall never forget my first sight of<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>. Her tall , slender form , outlined against the bright light ; the vivid sense of slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eyes of hers , remarkable eyes , different from any other woman 's that I have ever known ; the intense power of stillness she possessed , which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilised body — all these things are burnt into my memory . I shall never forget them .</p>
    <p n="44">She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice , and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I had accepted<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s invitation .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>gave me some tea , and her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughly fascinating woman . An appreciative listener is always stimulating , and I described , in a humorous manner , certain incidents of my Convalescent Home , in a way which , I flatter myself , greatly amused my hostess .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, of course , good fellow though he is , could hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist .</p>
    <p n="45">At that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French window near at hand :</p>
    <p n="46"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Then you 'll write to the Princess after tea ,<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>? I 'll write to Lady Tadminster for the second day , myself . Or shall we wait until we hear from the Princess ? In case of a refusal , Lady Tadminster might open it the first day , and Mrs. Crosbie the second . Then there 's the Duchess — about the school fete . ”</said></p>
    <p n="47">There was the murmur of a man 's voice , and then<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s rose in reply :</p>
    <p n="48"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Yes , certainly . After tea will do quite well . You are so thoughtful ,<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>dear . ”</said></p>
    <p n="49">The French window swung open a little wider , and a handsome white-haired old lady , with a somewhat masterful cast of features , stepped out of it on to the lawn . A man followed her , a suggestion of deference in his manner .</p>
    <p n="50"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>greeted me with effusion .</p>
    <p n="51"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Why , if it is n't too delightful to see you again ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>, after all these years .<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>, darling ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>— my husband . ”</said></p>
    <p n="52">I looked with some curiosity at “<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>darling ” . He certainly struck a rather alien note . I did not wonder at<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>objecting to his beard . It was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen . He wore gold-rimmed pince-nez , and had a curious impassivity of feature . It struck me that he might look natural on a stage , but was strangely out of place in real life . His voice was rather deep and unctuous . He placed a wooden hand in mine and said :</p>
    <p n="53"><said who="#Alfred">“ This is a pleasure ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>. ”</said>Then , turning to his wife :<said who="#Alfred">“<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>dearest , I think that cushion is a little damp . ”</said></p>
    <p n="54">She beamed fondly on him , as he substituted another with every demonstration of the tenderest care . Strange infatuation of an otherwise sensible woman !</p>
    <p n="55">With the presence of<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, a sense of constraint and veiled hostility seemed to settle down upon the company .<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, in particular , took no pains to conceal her feelings .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>, however , seemed to notice nothing unusual . Her volubility , which I remembered of old , had lost nothing in the intervening years , and she poured out a steady flood of conversation , mainly on the subject of the forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place shortly . Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of days or dates . His watchful and attentive manner never varied . From the very first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him , and I flatter myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd .</p>
    <p n="56">Presently<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>turned to give some instructions about letters to<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>, and her husband addressed me in his painstaking voice :</p>
    <p n="57"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Is soldiering your regular profession ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="58"><said who="#Mr._Hastings">“ No , before the war I was in Lloyd 's . ”</said></p>
    <p n="59"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ And you will return there after it is over ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="60"><said who="#Mr._Hastings">“ Perhaps . Either that or a fresh start altogether . ”</said></p>
    <p n="61"><persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>leant forward .</p>
    <p n="62"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ What would you really choose as a profession , if you could just consult your inclination ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="63"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Well , that depends . ”</said></p>
    <p n="64"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ No secret hobby ? ”</said>she asked .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Tell me — you 're drawn to something ? Every one is — usually something absurd . ”</said></p>
    <p n="65"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ You 'll laugh at me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="66">She smiled .</p>
    <p n="67"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Perhaps . ”</said></p>
    <p n="68"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Well , I 've always had a secret hankering to be a detective ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="69"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ The real thing — Scotland Yard ? Or Sherlock Holmes ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="70"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Oh , Sherlock Holmes by all means . But really , seriously , I am awfully drawn to it . I came across a man in Belgium once , a very famous detective , and he quite inflamed me . He was a marvellous little fellow . He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method . My system is based on his — though of course I have progressed rather further . He was a funny little man , a great dandy , but wonderfully clever . ”</said></p>
    <p n="71"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Like a good detective story myself , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>.<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Lots of nonsense written , though . Criminal discovered in last chapter . Every one dumbfounded . Real crime — you 'd know at once . ”</said></p>
    <p n="72"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes , ”</said>I argued .</p>
    <p n="73"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Do n't mean the police , but the people that are right in it . The family . You could n't really hoodwink them . They 'd know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="74"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Then , ”</said>I said , much amused ,<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ you think that if you were mixed up in a crime , say a murder , you 'd be able to spot the murderer right off ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="75"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Of course I should . Might n't be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers . But I 'm certain I 'd know . I 'd feel it in my fingertips if he came near me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="76"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ It might be a ‘ she , ’ ”</said>I suggested .</p>
    <p n="77"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Might . But murder 's a violent crime . Associate it more with a man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="78"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Not in a case of poisoning . ”</said><persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>'s clear voice startled me .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>was saying yesterday that , owing to the general ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession , there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected . ”</said></p>
    <p n="79"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Why ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>, what a gruesome conversation ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ It makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave . Oh , there 's<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="80">A young girl in V. A. D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn .</p>
    <p n="81"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Why ,<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>, you are late to-day . This is<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>— Miss Murdoch . ”</said></p>
    <p n="82"><persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature , full of life and vigour . She tossed off her little V. A. D. cap , and I admired the great loose waves of her auburn hair , and the smallness and whiteness of the hand she held out to claim her tea . With dark eyes and eyelashes she would have been a beauty .</p>
    <p n="83">She flung herself down on the ground beside<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, and as I handed her a plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me .</p>
    <p n="84"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Sit down here on the grass , do . It 's ever so much nicer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="85">I dropped down obediently .</p>
    <p n="86"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ You work at Tadminster , do n't you , Miss Murdoch ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="87">She nodded .</p>
    <p n="88"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ For my sins . ”</said></p>
    <p n="89"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Do they bully you , then ? ”</said>I asked , smiling .</p>
    <p n="90"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I should like to see them ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>with dignity .</p>
    <p n="91"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I have got a cousin who is nursing , ”</said>I remarked .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ And she is terrified of ‘ Sisters ’ . ”</said></p>
    <p n="92"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I do n't wonder . Sisters are , you know ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>. They simp — ly are ! You 've no idea ! But I 'm not a nurse , thank heaven , I work in the dispensary . ”</said></p>
    <p n="93"><said who="#Mr._Hastings">“ How many people do you poison ? ”</said>I asked , smiling .</p>
    <p n="94"><persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>smiled too .</p>
    <p n="95"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Oh , hundreds ! ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="96"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>, ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>,<said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ do you think you could write a few notes for me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="97"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Certainly , Aunt<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="98">She jumped up promptly , and something in her manner reminded me that her position was a dependent one , and that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>, kind as she might be in the main , did not allow her to forget it .</p>
    <p n="99">My hostess turned to me .</p>
    <p n="100"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>will show you your room . Supper is at half-past seven . We have given up late dinner for some time now . Lady Tadminster , our Member 's wife — she was the late Lord Abbotsbury 's daughter — does the same . She agrees with me that one must set an example of economy . We are quite a war household ; nothing is wasted here — every scrap of waste paper , even , is saved and sent away in sacks . ”</said></p>
    <p n="101">I expressed my appreciation , and<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>took me into the house and up the broad staircase , which forked right and left half-way to different wings of the building . My room was in the left wing , and looked out over the park .</p>
    <p n="102"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>left me , and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking slowly across the grass arm in arm with<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>Murdoch . I heard<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>call “<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>” impatiently , and the girl started and ran back to the house . At the same moment , a man stepped out from the shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction . He looked about forty , very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face . Some violent emotion seemed to be mastering him . He looked up at my window as he passed , and I recognized him , though he had changed much in the fifteen years that had elapsed since we last met . It was<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s younger brother ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence Cavendish</persName>. I wondered what it was that had brought that singular expression to his face .</p>
    <p n="103">Then I dismissed him from my mind , and returned to the contemplation of my own affairs .</p>
    <p n="104">The evening passed pleasantly enough ; and I dreamed that night of that enigmatical woman ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>.</p>
    <p n="105">The next morning dawned bright and sunny , and I was full of the anticipation of a delightful visit .</p>
    <p n="106">I did not see<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>until lunch-time , when she volunteered to take me for a walk , and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the woods , returning to the house about five .</p>
    <p n="107">As we entered the large hall ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>beckoned us both into the smoking-room . I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had occurred . We followed him in , and he shut the door after us .</p>
    <p n="108"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Look here ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>, there 's the deuce of a mess .<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>'s had a row with<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>, and she 's off . ”</said></p>
    <p n="109"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>? Off ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="110"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>nodded gloomily .</p>
    <p n="111"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes ; you see she went to the mater , and — Oh , here 's<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>herself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="112"><persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>entered . Her lips were set grimly together , and she carried a small suit-case . She looked excited and determined , and slightly on the defensive .</p>
    <p n="113"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ At any rate , ”</said>she burst out ,<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ I 've spoken my mind ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="114"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ My dear Evelyn , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>,<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ this can n't be true ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="115"><persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>nodded grimly .</p>
    <p n="116"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ True enough ! Afraid I said some things to<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>she wo n't forget or forgive in a hurry . Do n't mind if they 've only sunk in a bit . Probably water off a duck 's back , though . I said right out : ‘ You 're an old woman ,<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>, and there 's no fool like an old fool . The man 's twenty years younger than you , and do n't you fool yourself as to what he married you for . Money ! Well , do n't let him have too much of it . Farmer Raikes has got a very pretty young wife . Just ask your<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>how much time he spends over there . ’ She was very angry . Natural ! I went on , ‘ I 'm going to warn you , whether you like it or not . That man would as soon murder you in your bed as look at you . He 's a bad lot . You can say what you like to me , but remember what I 've told you . He 's a bad lot ! ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="117"><said who="#Emily">“ What did she say ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="118"><persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>made an extremely expressive grimace .</p>
    <p n="119"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ ‘ Darling<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>’ — ‘ dearest<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>’ — ‘ wicked calumnies ’ — ‘ wicked lies ’ — ‘ wicked woman ’ — to accuse her ‘ dear husband ’ ! The sooner I left her house the better . So I 'm off . ”</said></p>
    <p n="120"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ But not now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="121"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ This minute ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="122">For a moment we sat and stared at her . Finally<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>, finding his persuasions of no avail , went off to look up the trains . His wife followed him , murmuring something about persuading<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>to think better of it .</p>
    <p n="123">As she left the room ,<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>'s face changed . She leant towards me eagerly .</p>
    <p n="124"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>, you 're honest . I can trust you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="125">I was a little startled . She laid her hand on my arm , and sank her voice to a whisper .</p>
    <p n="126"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Look after her ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>. My poor<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>. They 're a lot of sharks — all of them . Oh , I know what I 'm talking about . There is n't one of them that 's not hard up and trying to get money out of her . I 've protected her as much as I could . Now I 'm out of the way , they 'll impose upon her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="127"><said who="#Mr._Hastings">“ Of course ,<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Mr._Hastings">“ I 'll do everything I can , but I 'm sure you 're excited and overwrought . ”</said></p>
    <p n="128">She interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger .</p>
    <p n="129"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Young man , trust me . I 've lived in the world rather longer than you have . All I ask you is to keep your eyes open . You 'll see what I mean . ”</said></p>
    <p n="130">The throb of the motor came through the open window , and<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>rose and moved to the door .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s voice sounded outside . With her hand on the handle , she turned her head over her shoulder , and beckoned to me .</p>
    <p n="131"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Above all ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>, watch that devil — her husband ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="132">There was no time for more .<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>was swallowed up in an eager chorus of protests and good-byes . The Inglethorps did not appear .</p>
    <p n="133">As the motor drove away ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>suddenly detached herself from the group , and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall bearded man who had been evidently making for the house . The colour rose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him .</p>
    <p n="134"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Who is that ? ”</said>I asked sharply , for instinctively I distrusted the man .</p>
    <p n="135"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ That 's<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>shortly .</p>
    <p n="136"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ And who is<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="137"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ He 's staying in the village doing a rest cure , after a bad nervous breakdown . He 's a London specialist ; a very clever man — one of the greatest living experts on poisons , I believe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="138"><said who="#Cynthia">“ And he 's a great friend of<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>'s , ”</said>put in<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>, the irrepressible .</p>
    <p n="139"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>frowned and changed the subject .</p>
    <p n="140"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Come for a stroll ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>. This has been a most rotten business . She always had a rough tongue , but there is no stauncher friend in England than<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="141">He took the path through the plantation , and we walked down to the village through the woods which bordered one side of the estate .</p>
    <p n="142">As we passed through one of the gates on our way home again , a pretty young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and smiled .</p>
    <p n="143"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ That 's a pretty girl , ”</said>I remarked appreciatively .</p>
    <p n="144"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s face hardened .</p>
    <p n="145"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ That is<persName>Mrs. Raikes</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="146"><said who="#Cynthia">“ The one that<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>—— ”</said></p>
    <p n="147"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Exactly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, with rather unnecessary abruptness .</p>
    <p n="148">I thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house , and that vivid wicked little face that had just smiled into ours , and a vague chill of foreboding crept over me . I brushed it aside .</p>
    <p n="149"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Styles is really a glorious old place , ”</said>I said to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.</p>
    <p n="150">He nodded rather gloomily .</p>
    <p n="151"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes , it 's a fine property . It 'll be mine some day — should be mine now by rights , if my father had only made a decent will . And then I should n't be so damned hard up as I am now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="152"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Hard up , are you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="153"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>, I do n't mind telling you that I 'm at my wit 's end for money . ”</said></p>
    <p n="154"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Could n't your brother help you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="155">“<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>? He 's gone through every penny he ever had , publishing rotten verses in fancy bindings . No , we 're an impecunious lot . My mother 's always been awfully good to us , I must say . That is , up to now . Since her marriage , of course —— ” he broke off , frowning .</p>
    <p n="156">For the first time I felt that , with<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>, something indefinable had gone from the atmosphere . Her presence had spelt security . Now that security was removed — and the air seemed rife with suspicion . The sinister face of<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>recurred to me unpleasantly . A vague suspicion of every one and everything filled my mind . Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="2">
    <p n="157">I had arrived at Styles on the 5th of July . I come now to the events of the 16th and 17th of that month . For the convenience of the reader I will recapitulate the incidents of those days in as exact a manner as possible . They were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of long and tedious cross-examinations .</p>
    <p n="158">I received a letter from<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>a couple of days after her departure , telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in Middlingham , a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away , and begging me to let her know if<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>should show any wish to be reconciled .</p>
    <p n="159">The only fly in the ointment of my peaceful days was<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>'s extraordinary , and , for my part , unaccountable preference for the society of<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>. What she saw in the man I cannot imagine , but she was always asking him up to the house , and often went off for long expeditions with him . I must confess that I was quite unable to see his attraction .</p>
    <p n="160">The 16th of July fell on a Monday . It was a day of turmoil . The famous bazaar had taken place on Saturday , and an entertainment , in connection with the same charity , at which<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>was to recite a War poem , was to be held that night . We were all busy during the morning arranging and decorating the Hall in the village where it was to take place . We had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the garden . I noticed that<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s manner was somewhat unusual . He seemed very excited and restless .</p>
    <p n="161">After tea ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>went to lie down to rest before her efforts in the evening and I challenged<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>to a single at tennis .</p>
    <p n="162">About a quarter to seven ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>called us that we should be late as supper was early that night . We had rather a scramble to get ready in time ; and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at the door .</p>
    <p n="163">The entertainment was a great success ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s recitation receiving tremendous applause . There were also some tableaux in which<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>took part . She did not return with us , having been asked to a supper party , and to remain the night with some friends who had been acting with her in the tableaux .</p>
    <p n="164">The following morning ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>stayed in bed to breakfast , as she was rather overtired ; but she appeared in her briskest mood about 12. 30 , and swept<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>and myself off to a luncheon party .</p>
    <p n="165"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Such a charming invitation from Mrs. Rolleston . Lady Tadminster 's sister , you know . The Rollestons came over with the Conqueror — one of our oldest families . ”</said></p>
    <p n="166"><persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>.</p>
    <p n="167">We had a pleasant luncheon , and as we drove away<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>suggested that we should return by Tadminster , which was barely a mile out of our way , and pay a visit to<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>in her dispensary .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>replied that this was an excellent idea , but as she had several letters to write she would drop us there , and we could come back with<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>in the pony-trap .</p>
    <p n="168">We were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter , until<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>appeared to vouch for us , looking very cool and sweet in her long white overall . She took us up to her sanctum , and introduced us to her fellow dispenser , a rather awe-inspiring individual , whom<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>cheerily addressed as “ Nibs . ”</p>
    <p n="169"><said who="#Cynthia">“ What a lot of bottles ! ”</said>I exclaimed , as my eye travelled round the small room .<said who="#Cynthia">“ Do you really know what 's in them all ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="170"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Say something original , ”</said>groaned<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>.<said who="#Cynthia">“ Every single person who comes up here says that . We are really thinking of bestowing a prize on the first individual who does not say : ‘ What a lot of bottles ! ’ And I know the next thing you 're going to say is : ‘ How many people have you poisoned ? ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="171">I pleaded guilty with a laugh .</p>
    <p n="172"><said who="#Cynthia">“ If you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison some one by mistake , you would n't joke about it . Come on , let 's have tea . We 've got all sorts of secret stories in that cupboard . No ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>— that 's the poison cupboard . The big cupboard — that 's right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="173">We had a very cheery tea , and assisted<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>to wash up afterwards . We had just put away the last tea-spoon when a knock came at the door . The countenances of<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>and Nibs were suddenly petrified into a stern and forbidding expression .</p>
    <p n="174"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Come in , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>, in a sharp professional tone .</p>
    <p n="175">A young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which she proffered to Nibs , who waved her towards<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>with the somewhat enigmatical remark :</p>
    <p n="176"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I 'm not really here to-day . ”</said></p>
    <p n="177"><persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge .</p>
    <p n="178"><said who="#Cynthia">“ This should have been sent up this morning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="179"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Sister is very sorry . She forgot . ”</said></p>
    <p n="180"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Sister should read the rules outside the door . ”</said></p>
    <p n="181">I gathered from the little nurse 's expression that there was not the least likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to the dreaded “ Sister ” .</p>
    <p n="182"><said who="#Cynthia">“ So now it can n't be done until to-morrow , ”</said>finished<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>.</p>
    <p n="183"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Do n't you think you could possibly let us have it to-night ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="184"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>graciously ,<said who="#Cynthia">“ we are very busy , but if we have time it shall be done . ”</said></p>
    <p n="185">The little nurse withdrew , and<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>promptly took a jar from the shelf , refilled the bottle , and placed it on the table outside the door .</p>
    <p n="186">I laughed .</p>
    <p n="187"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Discipline must be maintained ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="188"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Exactly . Come out on our little balcony . You can see all the outside wards there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="189">I followed<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>and her friend and they pointed out the different wards to me .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>remained behind , but after a few moments<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>called to him over her shoulder to come and join us . Then she looked at her watch .</p>
    <p n="190"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Nothing more to do , Nibs ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="191"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="192"><said who="#Cynthia">“ All right . Then we can lock up and go . ”</said></p>
    <p n="193">I had seen<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>in quite a different light that afternoon . Compared to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know . He was the opposite of his brother in almost every respect , being unusually shy and reserved . Yet he had a certain charm of manner , and I fancied that , if one really knew him well , one could have a deep affection for him . I had always fancied that his manner to<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>was rather constrained , and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him . But they were both gay enough this afternoon , and chatted together like a couple of children .</p>
    <p n="194">As we drove through the village , I remembered that I wanted some stamps , so accordingly we pulled up at the post office .</p>
    <p n="195">As I came out again , I cannoned into a little man who was just entering . I drew aside and apologised , when suddenly , with a loud exclamation , he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly .</p>
    <p n="196"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Mon ami<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ It is indeed mon ami<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="197"><said who="#Cynthia">“<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>! ”</said>I exclaimed .</p>
    <p n="198">I turned to the pony-trap .</p>
    <p n="199"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ This is a very pleasant meeting for me , Miss<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>. This is my old friend ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>, whom I have not seen for years . ”</said></p>
    <p n="200"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Oh , we know<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>gaily .<said who="#Cynthia">“ But I had no idea he was a friend of yours . ”</said></p>
    <p n="201"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , indeed , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>seriously .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I know<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>. It is by the charity of that good<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>that I am here . ”</said>Then , as I looked at him inquiringly :<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , my friend , she had kindly extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who , alas , are refugees from their native land . We Belgians will always remember her with gratitude . ”</said></p>
    <p n="202"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>was an extraordinary looking little man . He was hardly more than five feet , four inches , but carried himself with great dignity . His head was exactly the shape of an egg , and he always perched it a little on one side . His moustache was very stiff and military . The neatness of his attire was almost incredible . I believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound . Yet this quaint dandyfied little man who , I was sorry to see , now limped badly , had been in his time one of the most celebrated members of the Belgian police . As a detective , his flair had been extraordinary , and he had achieved triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling cases of the day .</p>
    <p n="203">He pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow Belgians , and I promised to go and see him at an early date . Then he raised his hat with a flourish to<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>, and we drove away .</p>
    <p n="204"><said who="#Cynthia">“ He 's a dear little man , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>.<said who="#Cynthia">“ I 'd no idea you knew him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="205"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You 've been entertaining a celebrity unawares , ”</said>I replied .</p>
    <p n="206">And , for the rest of the way home , I recited to them the various exploits and triumphs of<persName corresp="#Hercule_Poirot">Hercule Poirot</persName>.</p>
    <p n="207">We arrived back in a very cheerful mood . As we entered the hall ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>came out of her boudoir . She looked flushed and upset .</p>
    <p n="208"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Oh , it 's you , ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="209"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Is there anything the matter , Aunt<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>.</p>
    <p n="210"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Certainly not , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>sharply .<said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ What should there be ? ”</said>Then catching sight of<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, the parlourmaid , going into the dining-room , she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir .</p>
    <p n="211"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Yes , m 'm . ”</said>The old servant hesitated , then added diffidently :<said who="#Dorcas">“ Do n't you think , m 'm , you 'd better get to bed ? You 're looking very tired . ”</said></p>
    <p n="212"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Perhaps you 're right ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>— yes — no — not now . I 've some letters I must finish by post-time . Have you lighted the fire in my room as I told you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="213"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Yes , m 'm . ”</said></p>
    <p n="214"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Then I 'll go to bed directly after supper . ”</said></p>
    <p n="215">She went into the boudoir again , and<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>stared after her .</p>
    <p n="216"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Goodness gracious ! I wonder what 's up ? ”</said>she said to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>.</p>
    <p n="217">He did not seem to have heard her , for without a word he turned on his heel and went out of the house .</p>
    <p n="218">I suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and ,<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>agreeing , I ran upstairs to fetch my racquet .</p>
    <p n="219"><persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>was coming down the stairs . It may have been my fancy , but she , too , was looking odd and disturbed .</p>
    <p n="220"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Had a good walk with<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>? ”</said>I asked , trying to appear as indifferent as I could .</p>
    <p n="221"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I did n't go , ”</said>she replied abruptly .<said who="#Cynthia">“ Where is<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="222"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ In the boudoir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="223">Her hand clenched itself on the banisters , then she seemed to nerve herself for some encounter , and went rapidly past me down the stairs across the hall to the boudoir , the door of which she shut behind her .</p>
    <p n="224">As I ran out to the tennis court a few moments later , I had to pass the open boudoir window , and was unable to help overhearing the following scrap of dialogue .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>was saying in the voice of a woman desperately controlling herself :</p>
    <p n="225"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Then you wo n't show it to me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="226">To which<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>replied :</p>
    <p n="227"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>, it has nothing to do with that matter . ”</said></p>
    <p n="228"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Then show it to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="229"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ I tell you it is not what you imagine . It does not concern you in the least . ”</said></p>
    <p n="230">To which<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>replied , with a rising bitterness :</p>
    <p n="231"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Of course , I might have known you would shield him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="232"><persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>was waiting for me , and greeted me eagerly with :</p>
    <p n="233"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I say ! There 's been the most awful row ! I 've got it all out of<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="234"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ What kind of a row ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="235"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Between Aunt<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>and him . I do hope she 's found him out at last ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="236"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Was<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>there , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="237"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Of course not . She ‘ happened to be near the door ’ . It was a real old bust-up . I do wish I knew what it was all about . ”</said></p>
    <p n="238">I thought of<persName>Mrs. Raikes</persName>'s gipsy face , and<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>'s warnings , but wisely decided to hold my peace , whilst<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>exhausted every possible hypothesis , and cheerfully hoped ,<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Aunt<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>will send him away , and will never speak to him again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="239">I was anxious to get hold of<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, but he was nowhere to be seen . Evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon . I tried to forget the few words I had overheard ; but , do what I would , I could not dismiss them altogether from my mind . What was<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>'s concern in the matter ?</p>
    <p n="240"><persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>was in the drawing-room when I came down to supper . His face was impassive as ever , and the strange unreality of the man struck me afresh .</p>
    <p n="241"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>came down last . She still looked agitated , and during the meal there was a somewhat constrained silence .<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>was unusually quiet . As a rule , he surrounded his wife with little attentions , placing a cushion at her back , and altogether playing the part of the devoted husband . Immediately after supper ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>retired to her boudoir again .</p>
    <p n="242"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Send my coffee in here ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>, ”</said>she called .<said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ I 've just five minutes to catch the post . ”</said></p>
    <p n="243"><persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>and I went and sat by the open window in the drawing-room .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>brought our coffee to us . She seemed excited .</p>
    <p n="244"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Do you young people want lights , or do you enjoy the twilight ? ”</said>she asked .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Will you take<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>her coffee ,<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>? I will pour it out . ”</said></p>
    <p n="245"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ Do not trouble ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>.<said who="#Inglethorp">“ I will take it to<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>. ”</said>He poured it out , and went out of the room carrying it carefully .</p>
    <p n="246"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>followed him , and<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>sat down by us .</p>
    <p n="247">We three sat for some time in silence . It was a glorious night , hot and still .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>fanned herself gently with a palm leaf .</p>
    <p n="248"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ It 's almost too hot , ”</said>she murmured .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ We shall have a thunderstorm . ”</said></p>
    <p n="249">Alas , that these harmonious moments can never endure ! My paradise was rudely shattered by the sound of a well known , and heartily disliked , voice in the hall .</p>
    <p n="250"><said who="#Cynthia">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>.<said who="#Cynthia">“ What a funny time to come . ”</said></p>
    <p n="251">I glanced jealously at<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>, but she seemed quite undisturbed , the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary .</p>
    <p n="252">In a few moments ,<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>had ushered the doctor in , the latter laughing , and protesting that he was in no fit state for a drawing-room . In truth , he presented a sorry spectacle , being literally plastered with mud .</p>
    <p n="253"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ What have you been doing , doctor ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>.</p>
    <p n="254"><said who="#the_doctor">“ I must make my apologies , ”</said>said the doctor .<said who="#the_doctor">“ I did not really mean to come in , but<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>insisted . ”</said></p>
    <p n="255"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Well ,<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>, you are in a plight , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, strolling in from the hall .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Have some coffee , and tell us what you have been up to . ”</said></p>
    <p n="256"><said who="#Bauerstein">“ Thank you , I will . ”</said>He laughed rather ruefully , as he described how he had discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place , and in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing , and slipped ignominiously into a neighbouring pond .</p>
    <p n="257"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ The sun soon dried me off , ”</said>he added ,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ but I 'm afraid my appearance is very disreputable . ”</said></p>
    <p n="258">At this juncture ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>called to<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>from the hall , and the girl ran out .</p>
    <p n="259"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Just carry up my despatch-case , will you , dear ? I 'm going to bed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="260">The door into the hall was a wide one . I had risen when<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>did ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>was close by me . There were therefore three witnesses who could swear that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>was carrying her coffee , as yet untasted , in her hand .</p>
    <p n="261">My evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>. It seemed to me the man would never go . He rose at last , however , and I breathed a sigh of relief .</p>
    <p n="262"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ I 'll walk down to the village with you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>.<said who="#Inglethorp">“ I must see our agent over those estate accounts . ”</said>He turned to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.<said who="#Inglethorp">“ No one need sit up . I will take the latch-key . ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="3">
    <p n="263">To make this part of my story clear , I append the following plan of the first floor of Styles . The servants ’ rooms are reached through the door B . They have no communication with the right wing , where the Inglethorps ’ rooms were situated .</p>
    <p n="264">It seemed to be the middle of the night when I was awakened by<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence Cavendish</persName>. He had a candle in his hand , and the agitation of his face told me at once that something was seriously wrong .</p>
    <p n="265"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What 's the matter ? ”</said>I asked , sitting up in bed , and trying to collect my scattered thoughts .</p>
    <p n="266"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ We are afraid my mother is very ill. She seems to be having some kind of fit . Unfortunately she has locked herself in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="267"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I 'll come at once . ”</said></p>
    <p n="268">I sprang out of bed ; and , pulling on a dressing-gown , followed<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>along the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house .</p>
    <p n="269"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>joined us , and one or two of the servants were standing round in a state of awe-stricken excitement .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>turned to his brother .</p>
    <p n="270"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What do you think we had better do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="271">Never , I thought , had his indecision of character been more apparent .</p>
    <p n="272"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>rattled the handle of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s door violently , but with no effect . It was obviously locked or bolted on the inside . The whole household was aroused by now . The most alarming sounds were audible from the interior of the room . Clearly something must be done .</p>
    <p n="273"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Try going through<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>'s room , sir , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>.<said who="#Dorcas">“ Oh , the poor mistress ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="274">Suddenly I realized that<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>was not with us — that he alone had given no sign of his presence .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>opened the door of his room . It was pitch dark , but<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>was following with the candle , and by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in , and that there was no sign of the room having been occupied .</p>
    <p n="275">We went straight to the connecting door . That , too , was locked or bolted on the inside . What was to be done ?</p>
    <p n="276"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Oh , dear , sir , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, wringing her hands ,<said who="#Dorcas">“ what ever shall we do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="277"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ We must try and break the door in , I suppose . It 'll be a tough job , though . Here , let one of the maids go down and wake Baily and tell him to go for<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>at once . Now then , we 'll have a try at the door . Half a moment , though , is n't there a door into Miss<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>'s rooms ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="278"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Yes , sir , but that 's always bolted . It 's never been undone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="279"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Well , we might just see . ”</said></p>
    <p n="280">He ran rapidly down the corridor to<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>'s room .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>was there , shaking the girl — who must have been an unusually sound sleeper — and trying to wake her .</p>
    <p n="281">In a moment or two he was back .</p>
    <p n="282"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ No good . That 's bolted too . We must break in the door . I think this one is a shade less solid than the one in the passage . ”</said></p>
    <p n="283">We strained and heaved together . The framework of the door was solid , and for a long time it resisted our efforts , but at last we felt it give beneath our weight , and finally , with a resounding crash , it was burst open .</p>
    <p n="284">We stumbled in together ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>still holding his candle .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>was lying on the bed , her whole form agitated by violent convulsions , in one of which she must have overturned the table beside her . As we entered , however , her limbs relaxed , and she fell back upon the pillows .</p>
    <p n="285"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>strode across the room , and lit the gas . Turning to<persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>, one of the housemaids , he sent her downstairs to the dining-room for brandy . Then he went across to his mother whilst I unbolted the door that gave on the corridor .</p>
    <p n="286">I turned to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>, to suggest that I had better leave them now that there was no further need of my services , but the words were frozen on my lips . Never have I seen such a ghastly look on any man 's face . He was white as chalk , the candle he held in his shaking hand was sputtering onto the carpet , and his eyes , petrified with terror , or some such kindred emotion , stared fixedly over my head at a point on the further wall . It was as though he had seen something that turned him to stone . I instinctively followed the direction of his eyes , but I could see nothing unusual . The still feebly flickering ashes in the grate , and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece , were surely harmless enough .</p>
    <p n="287">The violence of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s attack seemed to be passing . She was able to speak in short gasps .</p>
    <p n="288"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Better now — very sudden — stupid of me — to lock myself in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="289">A shadow fell on the bed and , looking up , I saw<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>standing near the door with her arm around<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>. She seemed to be supporting the girl , who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself . Her face was heavily flushed , and she yawned repeatedly .</p>
    <p n="290"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Poor<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>is quite frightened , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>in a low clear voice . She herself , I noticed , was dressed in her white land smock . Then it must be later than I thought . I saw that a faint streak of daylight was showing through the curtains of the windows , and that the clock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five o'clock .</p>
    <p n="291">A strangled cry from the bed startled me . A fresh access of pain seized the unfortunate old lady . The convulsions were of a violence terrible to behold . Everything was confusion . We thronged round her , powerless to help or alleviate . A final convulsion lifted her from the bed , until she appeared to rest upon her head and her heels , with her body arched in an extraordinary manner . In vain<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>and<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>tried to administer more brandy . The moments flew . Again the body arched itself in that peculiar fashion .</p>
    <p n="292">At that moment ,<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>pushed his way authoritatively into the room . For one instant he stopped dead , staring at the figure on the bed , and , at the same instant ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>cried out in a strangled voice , her eyes fixed on the doctor :</p>
    <p n="293">“<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>—<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>—— ” Then she fell back motionless on the pillows .</p>
    <p n="294">With a stride , the doctor reached the bed , and seizing her arms worked them energetically , applying what I knew to be artificial respiration . He issued a few short sharp orders to the servants . An imperious wave of his hand drove us all to the door . We watched him , fascinated , though I think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late , and that nothing could be done now . I could see by the expression on his face that he himself had little hope .</p>
    <p n="295">Finally he abandoned his task , shaking his head gravely . At that moment , we heard footsteps outside , and<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s own doctor , a portly , fussy little man , came bustling in .</p>
    <p n="296">In a few words<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>explained how he had happened to be passing the lodge gates as the car came out , and had run up to the house as fast as he could , whilst the car went on to fetch<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>. With a faint gesture of the hand , he indicated the figure on the bed .</p>
    <p n="297"><said who="#Dr._Wilkins">“ Ve — ry sad . Ve — ry sad , ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>.<said who="#Dr._Wilkins">“ Poor dear lady . Always did far too much — far too much — against my advice . I warned her . Her heart was far from strong . ‘ Take it easy , ’ I said to her , ‘ Take — it — easy ’ . But no — her zeal for good works was too great . Nature rebelled . Na — ture — re — belled . ”</said></p>
    <p n="298"><persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>, I noticed , was watching the local doctor narrowly . He still kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke .</p>
    <p n="299"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ The convulsions were of a peculiar violence ,<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>. I am sorry you were not here in time to witness them . They were quite — tetanic in character . ”</said></p>
    <p n="300"><said who="#Dr._Wilkins">“ Ah ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>wisely .</p>
    <p n="301"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ I should like to speak to you in private , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>. He turned to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.<said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ You do not object ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="302"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Certainly not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="303">We all trooped out into the corridor , leaving the two doctors alone , and I heard the key turned in the lock behind us .</p>
    <p n="304">We went slowly down the stairs . I was violently excited . I have a certain talent for deduction , and<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>'s manner had started a flock of wild surmises in my mind .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>laid her hand upon my arm .</p>
    <p n="305"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ What is it ? Why did<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>seem so — peculiar ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="306">I looked at her .</p>
    <p n="307"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Do you know what I think ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="308"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ What ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="309"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Listen ! ”</said>I looked round , the others were out of earshot . I lowered my voice to a whisper .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I believe she has been poisoned ! I 'm certain<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>suspects it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="310"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ What ? ”</said>She shrank against the wall , the pupils of her eyes dilating wildly . Then , with a sudden cry that startled me , she cried out :<said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ No , no — not that — not that ! ”</said>And breaking from me , fled up the stairs . I followed her , afraid that she was going to faint . I found her leaning against the bannisters , deadly pale . She waved me away impatiently .</p>
    <p n="311"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ No , no — leave me . I 'd rather be alone . Let me just be quiet for a minute or two . Go down to the others . ”</said></p>
    <p n="312">I obeyed her reluctantly .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>and<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>were in the dining-room . I joined them . We were all silent , but I suppose I voiced the thoughts of us all when I at last broke it by saying :</p>
    <p n="313"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Where is<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="314"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>shook his head .</p>
    <p n="315"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ He 's not in the house . ”</said></p>
    <p n="316">Our eyes met . Where was<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>? His absence was strange and inexplicable . I remembered<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s dying words . What lay beneath them ? What more could she have told us , if she had had time ?</p>
    <p n="317">At last we heard the doctors descending the stairs .<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>was looking important and excited , and trying to conceal an inward exultation under a manner of decorous calm .<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>remained in the background , his grave bearded face unchanged .<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>was the spokesman for the two . He addressed himself to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>:</p>
    <p n="318"><said who="#Dr._Wilkins">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>, I should like your consent to a postmortem . ”</said></p>
    <p n="319"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Is that necessary ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>gravely . A spasm of pain crossed his face .</p>
    <p n="320"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ Absolutely , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>.</p>
    <p n="321"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ You mean by that ——? ”</said></p>
    <p n="322"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ That neither<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>nor myself could give a death certificate under the circumstances . ”</said></p>
    <p n="323"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>bent his head .</p>
    <p n="324"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ In that case , I have no alternative but to agree . ”</said></p>
    <p n="325"><said who="#Dr._Wilkins">“ Thank you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>briskly .<said who="#Dr._Wilkins">“ We propose that it should take place to-morrow night — or rather to-night . ”</said>And he glanced at the daylight .<said who="#Dr._Wilkins">“ Under the circumstances , I am afraid an inquest can hardly be avoided — these formalities are necessary , but I beg that you wo n't distress yourselves . ”</said></p>
    <p n="326">There was a pause , and then<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>drew two keys from his pocket , and handed them to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.</p>
    <p n="327"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ These are the keys of the two rooms . I have locked them and , in my opinion , they would be better kept locked for the present . ”</said></p>
    <p n="328">The doctors then departed .</p>
    <p n="329">I had been turning over an idea in my head , and I felt that the moment had now come to broach it . Yet I was a little chary of doing so .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, I knew , had a horror of any kind of publicity , and was an easygoing optimist , who preferred never to meet trouble half-way . It might be difficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>, on the other hand , being less conventional , and having more imagination , I felt I might count upon as an ally . There was no doubt that the moment had come for me to take the lead .</p>
    <p n="330"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ I am going to ask you something . ”</said></p>
    <p n="331"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Well ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="332"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ You remember my speaking of my friend<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>? The Belgian who is here ? He has been a most famous detective . ”</said></p>
    <p n="333"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="334"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ I want you to let me call him in — to investigate this matter . ”</said></p>
    <p n="335"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What — now ? Before the post-mortem ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="336"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ Yes , time is an advantage if — if — there has been foul play . ”</said></p>
    <p n="337"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Rubbish ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>angrily .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ In my opinion the whole thing is a mare 's nest of<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>'s !<persName>Wilkins</persName>had n't an idea of such a thing , until<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>put it into his head . But , like all specialists ,<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>'s got a bee in his bonnet . Poisons are his hobby , so of course he sees them everywhere . ”</said></p>
    <p n="338">I confess that I was surprised by<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>'s attitude . He was so seldom vehement about anything .</p>
    <p n="339"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>hesitated .</p>
    <p n="340"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ I can n't feel as you do ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>, ”</said>he said at last .<said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ I 'm inclined to give<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>a free hand , though I should prefer to wait a bit . We do n't want any unnecessary scandal . ”</said></p>
    <p n="341"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No , no , ”</said>I cried eagerly ,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ you need have no fear of that .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>is discretion itself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="342"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ Very well , then , have it your own way . I leave it in your hands . Though , if it is as we suspect , it seems a clear enough case . God forgive me if I am wronging him ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="343">I looked at my watch . It was six o'clock . I determined to lose no time .</p>
    <p n="344">Five minutes ’ delay , however , I allowed myself . I spent it in ransacking the library until I discovered a medical book which gave a description of strychnine poisoning .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="4">
    <p n="345">The house which the Belgians occupied in the village was quite close to the park gates . One could save time by taking a narrow path through the long grass , which cut off the detours of the winding drive . So I , accordingly , went that way . I had nearly reached the lodge , when my attention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me . It was<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>. Where had he been ? How did he intend to explain his absence ?</p>
    <p n="346">He accosted me eagerly .</p>
    <p n="347"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ My God ! This is terrible ! My poor wife ! I have only just heard . ”</said></p>
    <p n="348"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ Where have you been ? ”</said>I asked .</p>
    <p n="349"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ Denby kept me late last night . It was one o'clock before we 'd finished . Then I found that I 'd forgotten the latch-key after all . I did n't want to arouse the household , so Denby gave me a bed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="350"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ How did you hear the news ? ”</said>I asked .</p>
    <p n="351"><said who="#Inglethorp">“<persName>Wilkins</persName>knocked Denby up to tell him . My poor<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>! She was so self-sacrificing — such a noble character . She over-taxed her strength . ”</said></p>
    <p n="352">A wave of revulsion swept over me . What a consummate hypocrite the man was !</p>
    <p n="353"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ I must hurry on , ”</said>I said , thankful that he did not ask me whither I was bound .</p>
    <p n="354">In a few minutes I was knocking at the door of Leastways Cottage .</p>
    <p n="355">Getting no answer , I repeated my summons impatiently . A window above me was cautiously opened , and<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>himself looked out .</p>
    <p n="356">He gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me . In a few brief words , I explained the tragedy that had occurred , and that I wanted his help .</p>
    <p n="357"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Wait , my friend , I will let you in , and you shall recount to me the affair whilst I dress . ”</said></p>
    <p n="358">In a few moments he had unbarred the door , and I followed him up to his room . There he installed me in a chair , and I related the whole story , keeping back nothing , and omitting no circumstance , however insignificant , whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet .</p>
    <p n="359">I told him of my awakening , of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s dying words , of her husband 's absence , of the quarrel the day before , of the scrap of conversation between<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>and her mother-in-law that I had overheard , of the former quarrel between<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>and<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>, and of the latter 's innuendoes .</p>
    <p n="360">I was hardly as clear as I could wish . I repeated myself several times , and occasionally had to go back to some detail that I had forgotten .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>smiled kindly on me .</p>
    <p n="361"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ The mind is confused ? Is it not so ? Take time , mon ami . You are agitated ; you are excited — it is but natural . Presently , when we are calmer , we will arrange the facts , neatly , each in his proper place . We will examine — and reject . Those of importance we will put on one side ; those of no importance , pouf ! ”</said>— he screwed up his cherub-like face , and puffed comically enough —<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ blow them away ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="362"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ That 's all very well , ”</said>I objected ,<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ but how are you going to decide what is important , and what is n't ? That always seems the difficulty to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="363"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shook his head energetically . He was now arranging his moustache with exquisite care .</p>
    <p n="364"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Not so . Voyons ! One fact leads to another — so we continue . Does the next fit in with that ? A merveille ! Good ! We can proceed . This next little fact — no ! Ah , that is curious ! There is something missing — a link in the chain that is not there . We examine . We search . And that little curious fact , that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally , we put it here ! ”</said>He made an extravagant gesture with his hand .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It is significant ! It is tremendous ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="365"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Y — es — ”</said></p>
    <p n="366"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that I quailed before it .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Beware ! Peril to the detective who says : ‘ It is so small — it does not matter . It will not agree . I will forget it . ’ That way lies confusion ! Everything matters . ”</said></p>
    <p n="367"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ I know . You always told me that . That 's why I have gone into all the details of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="368"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And I am pleased with you . You have a good memory , and you have given me the facts faithfully . Of the order in which you present them , I say nothing — truly , it is deplorable ! But I make allowances — you are upset . To that I attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of paramount importance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="369"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ What is that ? ”</said>I asked .</p>
    <p n="370"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You have not told me if<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>ate well last night . ”</said></p>
    <p n="371">I stared at him . Surely the war had affected the little man 's brain . He was carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on , and seemed wholly engrossed in the task .</p>
    <p n="372"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do n't remember , ”</said>I said .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And , anyway , I do n't see —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="373"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ You do not see ? But it is of the first importance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="374"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I can n't see why , ”</said>I said , rather nettled .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ As far as I can remember , she did n't eat much . She was obviously upset , and it had taken her appetite away . That was only natural . ”</said></p>
    <p n="375"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>thoughtfully ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ it was only natural . ”</said></p>
    <p n="376">He opened a drawer , and took out a small despatch-case , then turned to me .</p>
    <p n="377"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Now I am ready . We will proceed to the chateau , and study matters on the spot . Excuse me , mon ami , you dressed in haste , and your tie is on one side . Permit me . ”</said>With a deft gesture , he rearranged it .</p>
    <p n="378"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Ca y est ! Now , shall we start ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="379">We hurried up the village , and turned in at the lodge gates .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>stopped for a moment , and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse of park , still glittering with morning dew .</p>
    <p n="380"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ So beautiful , so beautiful , and yet , the poor family , plunged in sorrow , prostrated with grief . ”</said></p>
    <p n="381">He looked at me keenly as he spoke , and I was aware that I reddened under his prolonged gaze .</p>
    <p n="382">Was the family prostrated by grief ? Was the sorrow at<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s death so great ? I realized that there was an emotional lack in the atmosphere . The dead woman had not the gift of commanding love . Her death was a shock and a distress , but she would not be passionately regretted .</p>
    <p n="383"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>seemed to follow my thoughts . He nodded his head gravely .</p>
    <p n="384"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , you are right , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ it is not as though there was a blood tie . She has been kind and generous to these Cavendishes , but she was not their own mother . Blood tells — always remember that — blood tells . ”</said></p>
    <p n="385"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>ate well last night ? I have been turning it over in my mind , but I can n't see how it has anything to do with the matter ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="386">He was silent for a minute or two as we walked along , but finally he said :</p>
    <p n="387"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do not mind telling you — though , as you know , it is not my habit to explain until the end is reached . The present contention is that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>died of strychnine poisoning , presumably administered in her coffee . ”</said></p>
    <p n="388"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Yes ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="389"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , what time was the coffee served ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="390"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ About eight o'clock . ”</said></p>
    <p n="391"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Therefore she drank it between then and half-past eight — certainly not much later . Well , strychnine is a fairly rapid poison . Its effects would be felt very soon , probably in about an hour . Yet , in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s case , the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five o'clock the next morning : nine hours ! But a heavy meal , taken at about the same time as the poison , might retard its effects , though hardly to that extent . Still , it is a possibility to be taken into account . But , according to you , she ate very little for supper , and yet the symptoms do not develop until early the next morning ! Now that is a curious circumstance , my friend . Something may arise at the autopsy to explain it . In the meantime , remember it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="392">As we neared the house ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>came out and met us . His face looked weary and haggard .</p>
    <p n="393"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ This is a very dreadful business ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>, ”</said>he said .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>has explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="394"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I comprehend perfectly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="395"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ You see , it is only suspicion so far . We have nothing to go upon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="396"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Precisely . It is a matter of precaution only . ”</said></p>
    <p n="397"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>turned to me , taking out his cigarette-case , and lighting a cigarette as he did so .</p>
    <p n="398"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ You know that fellow<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>is back ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="399"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes . I met him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="400"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>flung the match into an adjacent flower bed , a proceeding which was too much for<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s feelings . He retrieved it , and buried it neatly .</p>
    <p n="401"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ It 's jolly difficult to know how to treat him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="402"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That difficulty will not exist long , ”</said>pronounced<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>quietly .</p>
    <p n="403"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>looked puzzled , not quite understanding the portent of this cryptic saying . He handed the two keys which<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>had given him to me .</p>
    <p n="404"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ Show<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>everything he wants to see . ”</said></p>
    <p n="405"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ The rooms are locked ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.</p>
    <p n="406"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>considered it advisable . ”</said></p>
    <p n="407"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded thoughtfully .</p>
    <p n="408"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Then he is very sure . Well , that simplifies matters for us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="409">We went up together to the room of the tragedy . For convenience I append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in it .</p>
    <p n="410"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>locked the door on the inside , and proceeded to a minute inspection of the room . He darted from one object to the other with the agility of a grasshopper . I remained by the door , fearing to obliterate any clues .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, however , did not seem grateful to me for my forbearance .</p>
    <p n="411"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What have you , my friend , ”</said>he cried ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ that you remain there like — how do you say it ?— ah , yes , the stuck pig ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="412">I explained that I was afraid of obliterating any foot-marks .</p>
    <p n="413"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Foot-marks ? But what an idea ! There has already been practically an army in the room ! What foot-marks are we likely to find ? No , come here and aid me in my search . I will put down my little case until I need it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="414">He did so , on the round table by the window , but it was an ill-advised proceeding ; for , the top of it being loose , it tilted up , and precipitated the despatch-case on the floor .</p>
    <p n="415"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Eh voila une table ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah , my friend , one may live in a big house and yet have no comfort . ”</said></p>
    <p n="416">After which piece of moralizing , he resumed his search .</p>
    <p n="417">A small purple despatch-case , with a key in the lock , on the writing-table , engaged his attention for some time . He took out the key from the lock , and passed it to me to inspect . I saw nothing peculiar , however . It was an ordinary key of the Yale type , with a bit of twisted wire through the handle .</p>
    <p n="418">Next , he examined the framework of the door we had broken in , assuring himself that the bolt had really been shot . Then he went to the door opposite leading into<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>'s room . That door was also bolted , as I had stated . However , he went to the length of unbolting it , and opening and shutting it several times ; this he did with the utmost precaution against making any noise . Suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed to rivet his attention . He examined it carefully , and then , nimbly whipping out a pair of small forceps from his case , he drew out some minute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope .</p>
    <p n="419">On the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small saucepan on it . A small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the saucepan , and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood near it .</p>
    <p n="420">I wondered how I could have been so unobservant as to overlook this . Here was a clue worth having .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>delicately dipped his finger into liquid , and tasted it gingerly . He made a grimace .</p>
    <p n="421"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Coco — with — I think — rum in it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="422">He passed on to the debris on the floor , where the table by the bed had been overturned . A reading-lamp , some books , matches , a bunch of keys , and the crushed fragments of a coffee-cup lay scattered about .</p>
    <p n="423"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah , this is curious , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.</p>
    <p n="424"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I must confess that I see nothing particularly curious about it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="425"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You do not ? Observe the lamp — the chimney is broken in two places ; they lie there as they fell . But see , the coffee-cup is absolutely smashed to powder . ”</said></p>
    <p n="426"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Well , ”</said>I said wearily ,<said who="#Cynthia">“ I suppose some one must have stepped on it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="427"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Exactly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, in an odd voice .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Some one stepped on it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="428">He rose from his knees , and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece , where he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments , and straightening them — a trick of his when he was agitated .</p>
    <p n="429"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Mon ami , ”</said>he said , turning to me ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ somebody stepped on that cup , grinding it to powder , and the reason they did so was either because it contained strychnine or — which is far more serious — because it did not contain strychnine ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="430">I made no reply . I was bewildered , but I knew that it was no good asking him to explain . In a moment or two he roused himself , and went on with his investigations . He picked up the bunch of keys from the floor , and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one , very bright and shining , which he tried in the lock of the purple despatch-case . It fitted , and he opened the box , but after a moment 's hesitation , closed and relocked it , and slipped the bunch of keys , as well as the key that had originally stood in the lock , into his own pocket .</p>
    <p n="431"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I have no authority to go through these papers . But it should be done — at once ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="432">He then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the wash-stand . Crossing the room to the left-hand window , a round stain , hardly visible on the dark brown carpet , seemed to interest him particularly . He went down on his knees , examining it minutely — even going so far as to smell it .</p>
    <p n="433">Finally , he poured a few drops of the coco into a test tube , sealing it up carefully . His next proceeding was to take out a little notebook .</p>
    <p n="434"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ We have found in this room , ”</said>he said , writing busily ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ six points of interest . Shall I enumerate them , or will you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="435"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Oh , you , ”</said>I replied hastily .</p>
    <p n="436"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Very well , then . One , a coffee-cup that has been ground into powder ; two , a despatch-case with a key in the lock ; three , a stain on the floor . ”</said></p>
    <p n="437"><said who="#Cynthia">“ That may have been done some time ago , ”</said>I interrupted .</p>
    <p n="438"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee . Four , a fragment of some dark green fabric — only a thread or two , but recognizable . ”</said></p>
    <p n="439"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Ah ! ”</said>I cried .<said who="#Cynthia">“ That was what you sealed up in the envelope . ”</said></p>
    <p n="440"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes . It may turn out to be a piece of one of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s own dresses , and quite unimportant . We shall see . Five , this ! ”</said>With a dramatic gesture , he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the floor by the writing-table .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It must have been done since yesterday , otherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with blotting-paper and a hot iron . One of my best hats once — but that is not to the point . ”</said></p>
    <p n="441"><said who="#Cynthia">“ It was very likely done last night . We were very agitated . Or perhaps<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>herself dropped her candle . ”</said></p>
    <p n="442"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You brought only one candle into the room ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="443"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Yes .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence Cavendish</persName>was carrying it . But he was very upset . He seemed to see something over here ”</said>— I indicated the mantelpiece —<said who="#Cynthia">“ that absolutely paralysed him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="444"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That is interesting , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>quickly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , it is suggestive ”</said>— his eye sweeping the whole length of the wall —<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ but it was not his candle that made this great patch , for you perceive that this is white grease ; whereas<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>'s candle , which is still on the dressing-table , is pink . On the other hand ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>had no candlestick in the room , only a reading-lamp . ”</said></p>
    <p n="445"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Then , ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Cynthia">“ what do you deduce ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="446">To which my friend only made a rather irritating reply , urging me to use my own natural faculties .</p>
    <p n="447"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And the sixth point ? ”</said>I asked .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I suppose it is the sample of coco . ”</said></p>
    <p n="448"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>thoughtfully .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I might have included that in the six , but I did not . No , the sixth point I will keep to myself for the present . ”</said></p>
    <p n="449">He looked quickly round the room .<said who="#Cynthia">“ There is nothing more to be done here , I think , unless ”</said>— he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes in the grate .<said who="#Cynthia">“ The fire burns — and it destroys . But by chance — there might be — let us see ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="450">Deftly , on hands and knees , he began to sort the ashes from the grate into the fender , handling them with the greatest caution . Suddenly , he gave a faint exclamation .</p>
    <p n="451"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ The forceps ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="452">I quickly handed them to him , and with skill he extracted a small piece of half charred paper .</p>
    <p n="453"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ There , mon ami ! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What do you think of that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="454">I scrutinized the fragment . This is an exact reproduction of it :—</p>
    <p n="455">I was puzzled . It was unusually thick , quite unlike ordinary notepaper . Suddenly an idea struck me .</p>
    <p n="456"><said who="#Cynthia">“<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>! ”</said>I cried .<said who="#Cynthia">“ This is a fragment of a will ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="457"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Exactly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="458">I looked up at him sharply .</p>
    <p n="459"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You are not surprised ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="460"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , ”</said>he said gravely ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I expected it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="461">I relinquished the piece of paper , and watched him put it away in his case , with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything . My brain was in a whirl . What was this complication of a will ? Who had destroyed it ? The person who had left the candle grease on the floor ? Obviously . But how had anyone gained admission ? All the doors had been bolted on the inside .</p>
    <p n="462"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Now , my friend , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>briskly ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ we will go . I should like to ask a few questions of the parlourmaid —<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, her name is , is it not ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="463">We passed through<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>'s room , and<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>delayed long enough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it . We went out through that door , locking both it and that of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s room as before .</p>
    <p n="464">I took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see , and went myself in search of<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>.</p>
    <p n="465">When I returned with her , however , the boudoir was empty .</p>
    <p n="466"><said who="#Dorcas">“<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, ”</said>I cried ,<said who="#Dorcas">“ where are you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="467"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I am here , my friend . ”</said></p>
    <p n="468">He had stepped outside the French window , and was standing , apparently lost in admiration , before the various shaped flower beds .</p>
    <p n="469"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Admirable ! ”</said>he murmured .<said who="#Dorcas">“ Admirable ! What symmetry ! Observe that crescent ; and those diamonds — their neatness rejoices the eye . The spacing of the plants , also , is perfect . It has been recently done ; is it not so ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="470"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Yes , I believe they were at it yesterday afternoon . But come in —<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>is here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="471"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Eh bien , eh bien ! Do not grudge me a moment 's satisfaction of the eye . ”</said></p>
    <p n="472"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Yes , but this affair is more important . ”</said></p>
    <p n="473"><said who="#Dorcas">“ And how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal importance ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="474">I shrugged my shoulders . There was really no arguing with him if he chose to take that line .</p>
    <p n="475"><said>“ You do not agree ? But such things have been . Well , we will come in and interview the brave<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="476"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>was standing in the boudoir , her hands folded in front of her , and her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap . She was the very model and picture of a good old-fashioned servant .</p>
    <p n="477">In her attitude towards<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, she was inclined to be suspicious , but he soon broke down her defences . He drew forward a chair .</p>
    <p n="478"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Pray be seated , mademoiselle . ”</said></p>
    <p n="479"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Thank you , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="480"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You have been with your mistress many years , is it not so ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="481"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Ten years , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="482"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That is a long time , and very faithful service . You were much attached to her , were you not ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="483"><said who="#Dorcas">“ She was a very good mistress to me , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="484"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Then you will not object to answering a few questions . I put them to you with<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>'s full approval . ”</said></p>
    <p n="485"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Oh , certainly , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="486"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Then I will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday afternoon . Your mistress had a quarrel ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="487">“ Yes , sir . But I do n't know that I ought —— ”<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>hesitated .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>looked at her keenly .</p>
    <p n="488"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ My good<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, it is necessary that I should know every detail of that quarrel as fully as possible . Do not think that you are betraying your mistress 's secrets . Your mistress lies dead , and it is necessary that we should know all — if we are to avenge her . Nothing can bring her back to life , but we do hope , if there has been foul play , to bring the murderer to justice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="489"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Amen to that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>fiercely .<said who="#Dorcas">“ And , naming no names , there 's one in this house that none of us could ever abide ! And an ill day it was when first he darkened the threshold . ”</said></p>
    <p n="490"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>waited for her indignation to subside , and then , resuming his business-like tone , he asked :</p>
    <p n="491"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Now , as to this quarrel ? What is the first you heard of it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="492"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Well , sir , I happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="493"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What time was that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="494"><said who="#Dorcas">“ I could n't say exactly , sir , but it was n't tea-time by a long way . Perhaps four o'clock — or it may have been a bit later . Well , sir , as I said , I happened to be passing along , when I heard voices very loud and angry in here . I did n't exactly mean to listen , but — well , there it is . I stopped . The door was shut , but the mistress was speaking very sharp and clear , and I heard what she said quite plainly . ‘ You have lied to me , and deceived me , ’ she said . I did n't hear what<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>replied . He spoke a good bit lower than she did — but she answered : ‘ How dare you ? I have kept you and clothed you and fed you ! You owe everything to me ! And this is how you repay me ! By bringing disgrace upon our name ! ’ Again I did n't hear what he said , but she went on : ‘ Nothing that you can say will make any difference . I see my duty clearly . My mind is made up . You need not think that any fear of publicity , or scandal between husband and wife will deter me . ’ Then I thought I heard them coming out , so I went off quickly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="495"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You are sure it was<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>'s voice you heard ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="496"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Oh , yes , sir , whose else 's could it be ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="497"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , what happened next ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="498"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Later , I came back to the hall ; but it was all quiet . At five o'clock ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of tea — nothing to eat — to the boudoir . She was looking dreadful — so white and upset . ‘<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, ’ she says , ‘ I 've had a great shock . ’ ‘ I 'm sorry for that , m 'm , ’ I says . ‘ You 'll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea , m 'm . ’ She had something in her hand . I do n't know if it was a letter , or just a piece of paper , but it had writing on it , and she kept staring at it , almost as if she could n't believe what was written there . She whispered to herself , as though she had forgotten I was there : ‘ These few words — and everything 's changed . ’ And then she says to me : ‘ Never trust a man ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, they 're not worth it ! ’ I hurried off , and got her a good strong cup of tea , and she thanked me , and said she 'd feel better when she 'd drunk it . ‘ I do n't know what to do , ’ she says . ‘ Scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>. I 'd rather hush it up if I could . ’<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>came in just then , so she did n't say any more . ”</said></p>
    <p n="499"><said who="#Dorcas">“ She still had the letter , or whatever it was , in her hand ? ”</said><said who="#Dorcas">“ Yes , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="500"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What would she be likely to do with it afterwards ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="501"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Well , I do n't know , sir , I expect she would lock it up in that purple case of hers . ”</said></p>
    <p n="502"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Is that where she usually kept important papers ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="503"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Yes , sir . She brought it down with her every morning , and took it up every night . ”</said></p>
    <p n="504"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ When did she lose the key of it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="505"><said who="#Dorcas">“ She missed it yesterday at lunch-time , sir , and told me to look carefully for it . She was very much put out about it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="506"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But she had a duplicate key ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="507"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Oh , yes , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="508"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>was looking very curiously at him and , to tell the truth , so was I . What was all this about a lost key ?<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>smiled .</p>
    <p n="509"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Never mind ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, it is my business to know things . Is this the key that was lost ? ”</said>He drew from his pocket the key that he had found in the lock of the despatch-case upstairs .</p>
    <p n="510"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>'s eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head .</p>
    <p n="511"><said who="#Dorcas">“ That 's it , sir , right enough . But where did you find it ? I looked everywhere for it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="512"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah , but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was to-day . Now , to pass to another subject , had your mistress a dark green dress in her wardrobe ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="513"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>was rather startled by the unexpected question .</p>
    <p n="514"><said who="#Dorcas">“ No , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="515"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Are you quite sure ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="516"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Oh , yes , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="517"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Has anyone else in the house got a green dress ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="518"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>reflected .</p>
    <p n="519"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Miss<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>has a green evening dress . ”</said></p>
    <p n="520"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Light or dark green ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="521"><said who="#Dorcas">“ A light green , sir ; a sort of chiffon , they call it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="522"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah , that is not what I want . And nobody else has anything green ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="523"><said who="#Dorcas">“ No , sir — not that I know of . ”</said></p>
    <p n="524"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or otherwise . He merely remarked :</p>
    <p n="525"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Good , we will leave that and pass on . Have you any reason to believe that your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="526"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Not last night , sir , I know she did n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="527"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Why do you know so positively ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="528"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Because the box was empty . She took the last one two days ago , and she did n't have any more made up . ”</said></p>
    <p n="529"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You are quite sure of that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="530"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Positive , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="531"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Then that is cleared up ! By the way , your mistress did n't ask you to sign any paper yesterday ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="532"><said who="#Dorcas">“ To sign a paper ? No , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="533"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ When<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>and Mr.<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>came in yesterday evening , they found your mistress busy writing letters . I suppose you can give me no idea to whom these letters were addressed ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="534"><said who="#Dorcas">“ I 'm afraid I could n't , sir . I was out in the evening . Perhaps<persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>could tell you , though she 's a careless girl . Never cleared the coffee-cups away last night . That 's what happens when I 'm not here to look after things . ”</said></p>
    <p n="535"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>lifted his hand .</p>
    <p n="536"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Since they have been left ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, leave them a little longer , I pray you . I should like to examine them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="537"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Very well , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="538"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What time did you go out last evening ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="539"><said who="#Dorcas">“ About six o'clock , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="540"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Thank you ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, that is all I have to ask you . ”</said>He rose and strolled to the window .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I have been admiring these flower beds . How many gardeners are employed here , by the way ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="541"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Only three now , sir . Five , we had , before the war , when it was kept as a gentleman 's place should be . I wish you could have seen it then , sir . A fair sight it was . But now there 's only old<persName corresp="#Manning">Manning</persName>, and young William , and a new-fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such-like . Ah , these are dreadful times ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="542"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ The good times will come again ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>. At least , we hope so . Now , will you send<persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>to me here ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="543"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="544"><said who="#Dorcas">“ How did you know that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>took sleeping powders ? ”</said>I asked , in lively curiosity , as<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>left the room .<said who="#Dorcas">“ And about the lost key and the duplicate ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="545"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ One thing at a time . As to the sleeping powders , I knew by this . ”</said>He suddenly produced a small cardboard box , such as chemists use for powders .</p>
    <p n="546"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Where did you find it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="547"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ In the wash-stand drawer in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s bedroom . It was Number Six of my catalogue . ”</said></p>
    <p n="548"><said who="#Dorcas">“ But I suppose , as the last powder was taken two days ago , it is not of much importance ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="549"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Probably not , but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar about this box ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="550">I examined it closely .</p>
    <p n="551"><said who="#Dorcas">“ No , I can n't say that I do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="552"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Look at the label . ”</said></p>
    <p n="553">I read the label carefully :<said who="#Dorcas">“ ‘ One powder to be taken at bedtime , if required .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>. ’ No , I see nothing unusual . ”</said></p>
    <p n="554"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Not the fact that there is no chemist 's name ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="555"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Ah ! ”</said>I exclaimed .<said who="#Dorcas">“ To be sure , that is odd ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="556"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that , without his printed name ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="557"><said who="#Dorcas">“ No , I can n't say that I have . ”</said></p>
    <p n="558">I was becoming quite excited , but<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>damped my ardour by remarking :</p>
    <p n="559"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yet the explanation is quite simple . So do not intrigue yourself , my friend . ”</said></p>
    <p n="560">An audible creaking proclaimed the approach of<persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>, so I had no time to reply .</p>
    <p n="561"><persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>was a fine , strapping girl , and was evidently labouring under intense excitement , mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the tragedy .</p>
    <p n="562"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>came to the point at once , with a business-like briskness .</p>
    <p n="563"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I sent for you ,<persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>, because I thought you might be able to tell me something about the letters<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>wrote last night . How many were there ? And can you tell me any of the names and addresses ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="564"><persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>considered .</p>
    <p n="565"><said who="#Annie">“ There were four letters , sir . One was to<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, and one was to<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>, the lawyer , and the other two I do n't think I remember , sir — oh , yes , one was to Ross 's , the caterers in Tadminster . The other one , I do n't remember . ”</said></p>
    <p n="566"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Think , ”</said>urged<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.</p>
    <p n="567"><persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>racked her brains in vain .</p>
    <p n="568"><said who="#Annie">“ I 'm sorry , sir , but it 's clean gone . I do n't think I can have noticed it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="569"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It does not matter , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, not betraying any sign of disappointment .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Now I want to ask you about something else . There is a saucepan in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s room with some coco in it . Did she have that every night ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="570"><said who="#Annie">“ Yes , sir , it was put in her room every evening , and she warmed it up in the night — whenever she fancied it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="571"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What was it ? Plain coco ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="572"><said who="#Annie">“ Yes , sir , made with milk , with a teaspoonful of sugar , and two teaspoonfuls of rum in it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="573"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Who took it to her room ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="574"><said who="#Annie">“ I did , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="575"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Always ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="576"><said who="#Annie">“ Yes , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="577"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ At what time ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="578"><said who="#Annie">“ When I went to draw the curtains , as a rule , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="579"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="580"><said who="#Annie">“ No , sir , you see there 's not much room on the gas stove , so Cook used to make it early , before putting the vegetables on for supper . Then I used to bring it up , and put it on the table by the swing door , and take it into her room later . ”</said></p>
    <p n="581"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ The swing door is in the left wing , is it not ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="582"><said who="#Annie">“ Yes , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="583"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And the table , is it on this side of the door , or on the farther — servants ’ side ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="584"><said who="#Annie">“ It 's this side , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="585"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What time did you bring it up last night ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="586"><said who="#Annie">“ About quarter-past seven , I should say , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="587"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And when did you take it into<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s room ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="588"><said who="#Annie">“ When I went to shut up , sir . About eight o'clock .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>came up to bed before I 'd finished . ”</said></p>
    <p n="589"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Then , between 7. 15 and 8 o'clock , the coco was standing on the table in the left wing ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="590"><said who="#Annie">“ Yes , sir . ”</said><persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>had been growing redder and redder in the face , and now she blurted out unexpectedly :</p>
    <p n="591"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And if there was salt in it , sir , it was n't me . I never took the salt near it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="592"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What makes you think there was salt in it ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.</p>
    <p n="593"><said who="#Annie">“ Seeing it on the tray , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="594"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You saw some salt on the tray ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="595"><said who="#Annie">“ Yes . Coarse kitchen salt , it looked . I never noticed it when I took the tray up , but when I came to take it into the mistress 's room I saw it at once , and I suppose I ought to have taken it down again , and asked Cook to make some fresh . But I was in a hurry , because<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>was out , and I thought maybe the coco itself was all right , and the salt had only gone on the tray . So I dusted it off with my apron , and took it in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="596">I had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement . Unknown to herself ,<persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>had provided us with an important piece of evidence . How she would have gaped if she had realized that her “ coarse kitchen salt ” was strychnine , one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind . I marvelled at<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s calm . His self-control was astonishing . I awaited his next question with impatience , but it disappointed me .</p>
    <p n="597"><said who="#Annie">“ When you went into<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s room , was the door leading into Miss<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>'s room bolted ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="598"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Oh ! Yes , sir ; it always was . It had never been opened . ”</said></p>
    <p n="599"><said who="#Annie">“ And the door into<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>'s room ? Did you notice if that was bolted too ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="600"><persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>hesitated .</p>
    <p n="601"><said who="#Annie">“ I could n't rightly say , sir ; it was shut but I could n't say whether it was bolted or not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="602"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ When you finally left the room , did<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>bolt the door after you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="603"><said who="#Annie">“ No , sir , not then , but I expect she did later . She usually did lock it at night . The door into the passage , that is . ”</said></p>
    <p n="604"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room yesterday ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="605"><said who="#Annie">“ Candle grease ? Oh , no , sir .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>did n't have a candle , only a reading-lamp . ”</said></p>
    <p n="606"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Then , if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor , you think you would have been sure to have seen it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="607"><said who="#Annie">“ Yes , sir , and I would have taken it out with a piece of blotting-paper and a hot iron . ”</said></p>
    <p n="608">Then<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>repeated the question he had put to<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>:</p>
    <p n="609"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Did your mistress ever have a green dress ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="610"><said who="#Dorcas">“ No , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="611"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Nor a mantle , nor a cape , nor a — how do you call it ?— a sports coat ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="612"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Not green , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="613"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Nor anyone else in the house ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="614"><persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>reflected .</p>
    <p n="615"><said who="#Annie">“ No , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="616"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You are sure of that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="617"><said who="#Annie">“ Quite sure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="618"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Bien ! That is all I want to know . Thank you very much . ”</said></p>
    <p n="619">With a nervous giggle ,<persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>took herself creakingly out of the room . My pent-up excitement burst forth .</p>
    <p n="620"><said who="#Annie">“<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, ”</said>I cried ,<said who="#Annie">“ I congratulate you ! This is a great discovery . ”</said></p>
    <p n="621"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What is a great discovery ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="622"><said who="#Annie">“ Why , that it was the coco and not the coffee that was poisoned . That explains everything ! Of course it did not take effect until the early morning , since the coco was only drunk in the middle of the night . ”</said></p>
    <p n="623"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ So you think that the coco — mark well what I say ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>, the coco — contained strychnine ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="624"><said who="#Hastings">“ Of course ! That salt on the tray , what else could it have been ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="625"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It might have been salt , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>placidly .</p>
    <p n="626">I shrugged my shoulders . If he was going to take the matter that way , it was no good arguing with him . The idea crossed my mind , not for the first time , that poor old<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>was growing old . Privately I thought it lucky that he had associated with him some one of a more receptive type of mind .</p>
    <p n="627"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes .</p>
    <p n="628"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You are not pleased with me , mon ami ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="629"><said who="#Annie">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, ”</said>I said coldly ,<said who="#Annie">“ it is not for me to dictate to you . You have a right to your own opinion , just as I have to mine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="630"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ A most admirable sentiment , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, rising briskly to his feet .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Now I have finished with this room . By the way , whose is the smaller desk in the corner ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="631"><said who="#Annie">“<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>'s . ”</said></p>
    <p n="632"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah ! ”</said>He tried the roll top tentatively .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Locked . But perhaps one of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s keys would open it . ”</said>He tried several , twisting and turning them with a practiced hand , and finally uttering an ejaculation of satisfaction .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Voila ! It is not the key , but it will open it at a pinch . ”</said>He slid back the roll top , and ran a rapid eye over the neatly filed papers . To my surprise , he did not examine them , merely remarking approvingly as he relocked the desk :<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Decidedly , he is a man of method , this<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="633">A “ man of method ” was , in<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s estimation , the highest praise that could be bestowed on any individual .</p>
    <p n="634">I felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on disconnectedly :</p>
    <p n="635"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ There were no stamps in his desk , but there might have been , eh , mon ami ? There might have been ? Yes ”</said>— his eyes wandered round the room —<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ this boudoir has nothing more to tell us . It did not yield much . Only this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="636">He pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket , and tossed it over to me . It was rather a curious document . A plain , dirty looking old envelope with a few words scrawled across it , apparently at random . The following is a facsimile of it .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="5">
    <p n="637"><said>“ In the waste-paper basket . You recognise the handwriting ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="638"><said>“ Yes , it is<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s . But what does it mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="639"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shrugged his shoulders .</p>
    <p n="640"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I cannot say — but it is suggestive . ”</said></p>
    <p n="641">A wild idea flashed across me . Was it possible that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s mind was deranged ? Had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal possession ? And , if that were so , was it not also possible that she might have taken her own life ?</p>
    <p n="642">I was about to expound these theories to<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, when his own words distracted me .</p>
    <p n="643"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Come , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ now to examine the coffee-cups ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="644"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>! What on earth is the good of that , now that we know about the coco ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="645"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Oh , la la ! That miserable coco ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>flippantly .</p>
    <p n="646">He laughed with apparent enjoyment , raising his arms to heaven in mock despair , in what I could not but consider the worst possible taste .</p>
    <p n="647"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And , anyway , ”</said>I said , with increasing coldness ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ as<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>took her coffee upstairs with her , I do not see what you expect to find , unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of strychnine on the coffee tray ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="648"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>was sobered at once .</p>
    <p n="649"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Come , come , my friend , ”</said>he said , slipping his arms through mine .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ne vous fachez pas ! Allow me to interest myself in my coffee-cups , and I will respect your coco . There ! Is it a bargain ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="650">He was so quaintly humorous that I was forced to laugh ; and we went together to the drawing-room , where the coffee-cups and tray remained undisturbed as we had left them .</p>
    <p n="651"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>made me recapitulate the scene of the night before , listening very carefully , and verifying the position of the various cups .</p>
    <p n="652"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ So<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>stood by the tray — and poured out . Yes . Then she came across to the window where you sat with<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>. Yes . Here are the three cups . And the cup on the mantel-piece , half drunk , that would be<persName corresp="#Mr._Lawrence_Cavendish">Mr. Lawrence Cavendish</persName>'s . And the one on the tray ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="653"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>'s . I saw him put it down there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="654"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Good . One , two , three , four , five — but where , then , is the cup of<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="655"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ He does not take coffee . ”</said></p>
    <p n="656"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Then all are accounted for . One moment , my friend . ”</said></p>
    <p n="657">With infinite care , he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup , sealing them up in separate test tubes , tasting each in turn as he did so . His physiognomy underwent a curious change . An expression gathered there that I can only describe as half puzzled , and half relieved .</p>
    <p n="658"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Bien ! ”</said>he said at last .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It is evident ! I had an idea — but clearly I was mistaken . Yes , altogether I was mistaken . Yet it is strange . But no matter ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="659">And , with a characteristic shrug , he dismissed whatever it was that was worrying him from his mind . I could have told him from the beginning that this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind alley , but I restrained my tongue . After all , though he was old ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>had been a great man in his day .</p>
    <p n="660"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Breakfast is ready , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>, coming in from the hall .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ You will breakfast with us ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="661"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>acquiesced . I observed<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>. Already he was almost restored to his normal self . The shock of the events of the last night had upset him temporarily , but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal . He was a man of very little imagination , in sharp contrast with his brother , who had , perhaps , too much .</p>
    <p n="662">Ever since the early hours of the morning ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>had been hard at work , sending telegrams — one of the first had gone to<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>— writing notices for the papers , and generally occupying himself with the melancholy duties that a death entails .</p>
    <p n="663"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ May I ask how things are proceeding ? ”</said>he said .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Do your investigations point to my mother having died a natural death — or — or must we prepare ourselves for the worst ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="664"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I think ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>gravely ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ that you would do well not to buoy yourself up with any false hopes . Can you tell me the views of the other members of the family ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="665"><said who="#Mr._Cavendish">“ My brother<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>is convinced that we are making a fuss over nothing . He says that everything points to its being a simple case of heart failure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="666"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ He does , does he ? That is very interesting — very interesting , ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>softly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="667">A faint cloud passed over<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s face .</p>
    <p n="668"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I have not the least idea what my wife 's views on the subject are . ”</said></p>
    <p n="669">The answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>broke the rather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort :</p>
    <p n="670"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I told you , did n't I , that<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>has returned ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="671"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>bent his head .</p>
    <p n="672"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It 's an awkward position for all of us . Of course one has to treat him as usual — but , hang it all , one 's gorge does rise at sitting down to eat with a possible murderer ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="673"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded sympathetically .</p>
    <p n="674"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I quite understand . It is a very difficult situation for you ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>. I would like to ask you one question .<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>'s reason for not returning last night was , I believe , that he had forgotten the latch-key . Is not that so ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="675"><said who="#Mr._Cavendish">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="676"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I suppose you are quite sure that the latch-key was forgotten — that he did not take it after all ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="677"><said who="#Mr._Cavendish">“ I have no idea . I never thought of looking . We always keep it in the hall drawer . I 'll go and see if it 's there now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="678"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>held up his hand with a faint smile .</p>
    <p n="679"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , no ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>, it is too late now . I am certain that you would find it . If<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>did take it , he has had ample time to replace it by now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="680"><said who="#Mr._Cavendish">“ But do you think —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="681"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I think nothing . If anyone had chanced to look this morning before his return , and seen it there , it would have been a valuable point in his favour . That is all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="682"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>looked perplexed .</p>
    <p n="683"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Do not worry , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>smoothly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I assure you that you need not let it trouble you . Since you are so kind , let us go and have some breakfast . ”</said></p>
    <p n="684">Every one was assembled in the dining-room . Under the circumstances , we were naturally not a cheerful party . The reaction after a shock is always trying , and I think we were all suffering from it . Decorum and good breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as usual , yet I could not help wondering if this self-control were really a matter of great difficulty . There were no red eyes , no signs of secretly indulged grief . I felt that I was right in my opinion that<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>was the person most affected by the personal side of the tragedy .</p>
    <p n="685">I pass over<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>, who acted the bereaved widower in a manner that I felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy . Did he know that we suspected him , I wondered . Surely he could not be unaware of the fact , conceal it as we would . Did he feel some secret stirring of fear , or was he confident that his crime would go unpunished ? Surely the suspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked man .</p>
    <p n="686">But did every one suspect him ? What about<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>? I watched her as she sat at the head of the table , graceful , composed , enigmatic . In her soft grey frock , with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her slender hands , she looked very beautiful . When she chose , however , her face could be sphinx-like in its inscrutability . She was very silent , hardly opening her lips , and yet in some queer way I felt that the great strength of her personality was dominating us all .</p>
    <p n="687">And little<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>? Did she suspect ? She looked very tired and ill , I thought . The heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked . I asked her if she were feeling ill , and she answered frankly :</p>
    <p n="688"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Yes , I 've got the most beastly headache . ”</said></p>
    <p n="689"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Have another cup of coffee , mademoiselle ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>solicitously .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It will revive you . It is unparalleled for the mal de tete . ”</said>He jumped up and took her cup .</p>
    <p n="690"><said who="#Cynthia">“ No sugar , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>, watching him , as he picked up the sugar-tongs .</p>
    <p n="691"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No sugar ? You abandon it in the war-time , eh ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="692"><said who="#Cynthia">“ No , I never take it in coffee . ”</said></p>
    <p n="693"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Sacre ! ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>to himself , as he brought back the replenished cup .</p>
    <p n="694">Only I heard him , and glancing up curiously at the little man I saw that his face was working with suppressed excitement , and his eyes were as green as a cat 's . He had heard or seen something that had affected him strongly — but what was it ? I do not usually label myself as dense , but I must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted my attention .</p>
    <p n="695">In another moment , the door opened and<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>appeared .</p>
    <p n="696"><said who="#Dorcas">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>to see you , sir , ”</said>she said to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.</p>
    <p n="697">I remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>had written the night before .</p>
    <p n="698"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>rose immediately .</p>
    <p n="699"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Show him into my study . ”</said>Then he turned to us .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ My mother 's lawyer , ”</said>he explained . And in a lower voice :<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ He is also<persName>Coroner</persName>— you understand . Perhaps you would like to come with me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="700">We acquiesced and followed him out of the room .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>strode on ahead and I took the opportunity of whispering to<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>:</p>
    <p n="701"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ There will be an inquest then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="702"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded absently . He seemed absorbed in thought ; so much so that my curiosity was aroused .</p>
    <p n="703"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What is it ? You are not attending to what I say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="704"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ It is true , my friend . I am much worried . ”</said></p>
    <p n="705"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="706"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Because<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>does not take sugar in her coffee . ”</said></p>
    <p n="707"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What ? You cannot be serious ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="708"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ But I am most serious . Ah , there is something there that I do not understand . My instinct was right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="709"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What instinct ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="710"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ The instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee-cups . Chut ! no more now ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="711">We followed<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>into his study , and he closed the door behind us .</p>
    <p n="712"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>was a pleasant man of middle-age , with keen eyes , and the typical lawyer 's mouth .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>introduced us both , and explained the reason of our presence .</p>
    <p n="713"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ You will understand ,<persName>Wells</persName>, ”</said>he added ,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ that this is all strictly private . We are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for investigation of any kind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="714"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ Quite so , quite so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>soothingly .<said who="#Mr._Wells">“ I wish we could have spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest , but of course it 's quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor 's certificate . ”</said></p>
    <p n="715"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes , I suppose so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="716"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ Clever man ,<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>. Great authority on toxicology , I believe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="717"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Indeed , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>with a certain stiffness in his manner . Then he added rather hesitatingly :<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Shall we have to appear as witnesses — all of us , I mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="718"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ You , of course — and ah — er — Mr .— er —<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="719">A slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner :</p>
    <p n="720"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Any other evidence will be simply confirmatory , a mere matter of form . ”</said></p>
    <p n="721"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ I see . ”</said></p>
    <p n="722">A faint expression of relief swept over<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s face . It puzzled me , for I saw no occasion for it .</p>
    <p n="723"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ If you know of nothing to the contrary , ”</said>pursued<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>,<said who="#Mr._Wells">“ I had thought of Friday . That will give us plenty of time for the doctor 's report . The post-mortem is to take place to-night , I believe ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="724"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="725"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ Then that arrangement will suit you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="726"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Perfectly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="727"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ I need not tell you , my dear<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Cavendish</persName>, how distressed I am at this most tragic affair . ”</said></p>
    <p n="728"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Can you give us no help in solving it , monsieur ? ”</said>interposed<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, speaking for the first time since we had entered the room .</p>
    <p n="729"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ I ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="730"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , we heard that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>wrote to you last night . You should have received the letter this morning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="731"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ I did , but it contains no information . It is merely a note asking me to call upon her this morning , as she wanted my advice on a matter of great importance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="732"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ She gave you no hint as to what that matter might be ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="733"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ Unfortunately , no . ”</said></p>
    <p n="734"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ That is a pity , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.</p>
    <p n="735"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ A great pity , ”</said>agreed<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>gravely .</p>
    <p n="736">There was silence .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>remained lost in thought for a few minutes . Finally he turned to the lawyer again .</p>
    <p n="737"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>, there is one thing I should like to ask you — that is , if it is not against professional etiquette . In the event of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s death , who would inherit her money ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="738">The lawyer hesitated a moment , and then replied :</p>
    <p n="739"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ The knowledge will be public property very soon , so if<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>does not object —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="740"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Not at all , ”</said>interpolated<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.</p>
    <p n="741"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do not see any reason why I should not answer your question . By her last will , dated August of last year , after various unimportant legacies to servants , etc ., she gave her entire fortune to her stepson , Mr.<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="742"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Was not that — pardon the question ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>— rather unfair to her other stepson ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Lawrence_Cavendish">Mr. Lawrence Cavendish</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="743"><said who="#Mr._Lawrence_Cavendish">“ No , I do not think so . You see , under the terms of their father 's will , while<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>inherited the property ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>, at his stepmother 's death , would come into a considerable sum of money .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>left her money to her elder stepson , knowing that he would have to keep up Styles . It was , to my mind , a very fair and equitable distribution . ”</said></p>
    <p n="744"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded thoughtfully .</p>
    <p n="745"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I see . But I am right in saying , am I not , that by your English law that will was automatically revoked when<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>remarried ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="746"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>bowed his head .</p>
    <p n="747"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ As I was about to proceed ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>, that document is now null and void . ”</said></p>
    <p n="748"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Hein ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>. He reflected for a moment , and then asked :<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Was<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>herself aware of that fact ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="749"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ I do not know . She may have been . ”</said></p>
    <p n="750"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ She was , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>unexpectedly .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ We were discussing the matter of wills being revoked by marriage only yesterday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="751"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah ! One more question ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>. You say ‘ her last will . ’ Had<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>, then , made several former wills ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="752"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ On an average , she made a new will at least once a year , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>imperturbably .<said who="#Mr._Wells">“ She was given to changing her mind as to her testamentary dispositions , now benefiting one , now another member of her family . ”</said></p>
    <p n="753"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Suppose , ”</said>suggested<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ that , unknown to you , she had made a new will in favour of some one who was not , in any sense of the word , a member of the family — we will say<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, for instance — would you be surprised ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="754"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ Not in the least . ”</said></p>
    <p n="755"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>seemed to have exhausted his questions .</p>
    <p n="756">I drew close to him , while<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>and the lawyer were debating the question of going through<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s papers .</p>
    <p n="757"><said>“ Do you think<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>made a will leaving all her money to<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>? ”</said>I asked in a low voice , with some curiosity .</p>
    <p n="758"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>smiled .</p>
    <p n="759"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="760"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Then why did you ask ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="761"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Hush ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="762"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>had turned to<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.</p>
    <p n="763"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Will you come with us ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>? We are going through my mother 's papers .<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>is quite willing to leave it entirely to<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>and myself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="764"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Which simplifies matters very much , ”</said>murmured the lawyer . “ As technically , of course , he was entitled —— ” He did not finish the sentence .</p>
    <p n="765"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ We will look through the desk in the boudoir first , ”</said>explained<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ and go up to her bedroom afterwards . She kept her most important papers in a purple despatch-case , which we must look through carefully . ”</said></p>
    <p n="766"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , ”</said>said the lawyer ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ it is quite possible that there may be a later will than the one in my possession . ”</said></p>
    <p n="767"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ There is a later will . ”</said>It was<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>who spoke .</p>
    <p n="768"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What ? ”</said><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>and the lawyer looked at him startled .</p>
    <p n="769"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Or , rather , ”</said>pursued my friend imperturbably ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ there was one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="770"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What do you mean — there was one ? Where is it now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="771"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Burnt ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="772"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Burnt ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="773"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Yes . See here . ”</said>He took out the charred fragment we had found in the grate in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s room , and handed it to the lawyer with a brief explanation of when and where he had found it .</p>
    <p n="774"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ But possibly this is an old will ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="775"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ I do not think so . In fact I am almost certain that it was made no earlier than yesterday afternoon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="776"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What ? ”</said><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Impossible ! ”</said>broke simultaneously from both men .</p>
    <p n="777"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>turned to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.</p>
    <p n="778"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ If you will allow me to send for your gardener , I will prove it to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="779"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Oh , of course — but I do n't see —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="780"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>raised his hand .</p>
    <p n="781"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Do as I ask you . Afterwards you shall question as much as you please . ”</said></p>
    <p n="782"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Very well . ”</said>He rang the bell .</p>
    <p n="783"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>answered it in due course .</p>
    <p n="784"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, will you tell<persName corresp="#Manning">Manning</persName>to come round and speak to me here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="785"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Yes , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="786"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>withdrew .</p>
    <p n="787">We waited in a tense silence .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>alone seemed perfectly at his ease , and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase .</p>
    <p n="788">The clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the approach of<persName corresp="#Manning">Manning</persName>.<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>looked questioningly at<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>. The latter nodded .</p>
    <p n="789"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Come inside ,<persName corresp="#Manning">Manning</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I want to speak to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="790"><persName corresp="#Manning">Manning</persName>came slowly and hesitatingly through the French window , and stood as near it as he could . He held his cap in his hands , twisting it very carefully round and round . His back was much bent , though he was probably not as old as he looked , but his eyes were sharp and intelligent , and belied his slow and rather cautious speech .</p>
    <p n="791"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Manning">Manning</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ this gentleman will put some questions to you which I want you to answer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="792"><said who="#Manning">“ Yes sir , ”</said>mumbled<persName corresp="#Manning">Manning</persName>.</p>
    <p n="793"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>stepped forward briskly .<persName corresp="#Manning">Manning</persName>'s eye swept over him with a faint contempt .</p>
    <p n="794"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the house yesterday afternoon , were you not ,<persName corresp="#Manning">Manning</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="795"><said who="#Manning">“ Yes , sir , me and Willum . ”</said></p>
    <p n="796"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>came to the window and called you , did she not ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="797"><said who="#Manning">“ Yes , sir , she did . ”</said></p>
    <p n="798"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="799"><said who="#Manning">“ Well , sir , nothing much . She just told Willum to go on his bicycle down to the village , and bring back a form of will , or such-like — I do n't know what exactly — she wrote it down for him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="800"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="801"><said who="#Manning">“ Well , he did , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="802"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And what happened next ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="803"><said who="#Manning">“ We went on with the begonias , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="804"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Did not<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>call you again ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="805"><said who="#Manning">“ Yes , sir , both me and Willum , she called . ”</said></p>
    <p n="806"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="807"><said who="#Manning">“ She made us come right in , and sign our names at the bottom of a long paper — under where she 'd signed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="808"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Did you see anything of what was written above her signature ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>sharply .</p>
    <p n="809"><said who="#Manning">“ No , sir , there was a bit of blotting paper over that part . ”</said></p>
    <p n="810"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And you signed where she told you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="811"><said who="#Manning">“ Yes , sir , first me and then Willum . ”</said></p>
    <p n="812"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What did she do with it afterwards ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="813"><said who="#Manning">“ Well , sir , she slipped it into a long envelope , and put it inside a sort of purple box that was standing on the desk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="814"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What time was it when she first called you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="815"><said who="#Manning">“ About four , I should say , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="816"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Not earlier ? Could n't it have been about half-past three ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="817"><said who="#Manning">“ No , I should n't say so , sir . It would be more likely to be a bit after four — not before it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="818"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Thank you ,<persName corresp="#Manning">Manning</persName>, that will do , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>pleasantly .</p>
    <p n="819">The gardener glanced at his master , who nodded , whereupon<persName corresp="#Manning">Manning</persName>lifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble , and backed cautiously out of the window .</p>
    <p n="820">We all looked at each other .</p>
    <p n="821"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Good heavens ! ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What an extraordinary coincidence . ”</said></p>
    <p n="822"><said who="#Manning">“ How — a coincidence ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="823"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ That my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="824"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>cleared his throat and remarked drily :</p>
    <p n="825"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ Are you so sure it is a coincidence ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Cavendish</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="826"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What do you mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="827"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ Your mother , you tell me , had a violent quarrel with — some one yesterday afternoon —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="828"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What do you mean ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>again . There was a tremor in his voice , and he had gone very pale .</p>
    <p n="829"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ In consequence of that quarrel , your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will . The contents of that will we shall never know . She told no one of its provisions . This morning , no doubt , she would have consulted me on the subject — but she had no chance . The will disappears , and she takes its secret with her to her grave .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Cavendish</persName>, I much fear there is no coincidence there .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>, I am sure you agree with me that the facts are very suggestive . ”</said></p>
    <p n="830"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Suggestive , or not , ”</said>interrupted<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ we are most grateful to<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>for elucidating the matter .

    <p n="831"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>smiled and answered :</p>
    <p n="832"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ A scribbled over old envelope , and a freshly planted bed of begonias . ”</said></p>
    <p n="833"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, I think , would have pressed his questions further , but at that moment the loud purr of a motor was audible , and we all turned to the window as it swept past .</p>
    <p n="834"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Excuse me ,<persName>Wells</persName>. ”</said>He went hurriedly out into the hall .</p>
    <p n="835"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>looked inquiringly at me .</p>
    <p n="836"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, ”</said>I explained .</p>
    <p n="837"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Ah , I am glad she has come . There is a woman with a head and a heart too ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>. Though the good God gave her no beauty ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="838">I followed<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s example , and went out into the hall , where<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass of veils that enveloped her head . As her eyes fell on me , a sudden pang of guilt shot through me . This was the woman who had warned me so earnestly , and to whose warning I had , alas , paid no heed ! How soon , and how contemptuously , I had dismissed it from my mind . Now that she had been proved justified in so tragic a manner , I felt ashamed . She had known<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>only too well . I wondered whether , if she had remained at Styles , the tragedy would have taken place , or would the man have feared her watchful eyes ?</p>
    <p n="839">I was relieved when she shook me by the hand , with her well remembered painful grip . The eyes that met mine were sad , but not reproachful ; that she had been crying bitterly , I could tell by the redness of her eyelids , but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness .</p>
    <p n="840"><said who="#Alfred_Inglethorp">“ Started the moment I got the wire . Just come off night duty . Hired car . Quickest way to get here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="841"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Have you had anything to eat this morning ,<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.</p>
    <p n="842"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="843"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I thought not . Come along , breakfast 's not cleared away yet , and they 'll make you some fresh tea . ”</said>He turned to me .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Look after her ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>, will you ?<persName>Wells</persName>is waiting for me . Oh , here 's<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>. He 's helping us , you know ,<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="844"><persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>shook hands with<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, but glanced suspiciously over her shoulder at<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.</p>
    <p n="845"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What do you mean — helping us ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="846"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Helping us to investigate . ”</said></p>
    <p n="847"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Nothing to investigate . Have they taken him to prison yet ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="848"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Taken who to prison ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="849"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Who ?<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>, of course ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="850"><said who="#Alfred_Inglethorp">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>, do be careful .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>is of the opinion that my mother died from heart seizure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="851"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ More fool ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>! ”</said>retorted<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>.<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Of course<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>murdered poor<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>— as I always told you he would . ”</said></p>
    <p n="852"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>, do n't shout so . Whatever we may think or suspect , it is better to say as little as possible for the present . The inquest is n't until Friday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="853"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Not until fiddlesticks ! ”</said>The snort<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>gave was truly magnificent .<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ You 're all off your heads . The man will be out of the country by then . If he 's any sense , he wo n't stay here tamely and wait to be hanged . ”</said></p>
    <p n="854"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>looked at her helplessly .</p>
    <p n="855"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I know what it is , ”</said>she accused him ,<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ you 've been listening to the doctors . Never should . What do they know ? Nothing at all — or just enough to make them dangerous . I ought to know — my own father was a doctor . That little<persName>Wilkins</persName>is about the greatest fool that even I have ever seen . Heart seizure ! Sort of thing he would say . Anyone with any sense could see at once that her husband had poisoned her . I always said he 'd murder her in her bed , poor soul . Now he 's done it . And all you can do is to murmur silly things about ‘ heart seizure ’ and ‘ inquest on Friday . ’ You ought to be ashamed of yourself ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="856"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What do you want me to do ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, unable to help a faint smile .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Dash it all ,<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>, I can n't haul him down to the local police station by the scruff of his neck . ”</said></p>
    <p n="857"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Well , you might do something . Find out how he did it . He 's a crafty beggar . Dare say he soaked fly papers . Ask Cook if she 's missed any . ”</said></p>
    <p n="858">It occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>and<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>under the same roof , and keep the peace between them , was likely to prove a Herculean task , and I did not envy<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>. I could see by the expression of his face that he fully appreciated the difficulty of the position . For the moment , he sought refuge in retreat , and left the room precipitately .</p>
    <p n="859"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>brought in fresh tea . As she left the room ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>came over from the window where he had been standing , and sat down facing<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>.</p>
    <p n="860"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Mademoiselle , ”</said>he said gravely ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I want to ask you something . ”</said></p>
    <p n="861"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Ask away , ”</said>said the lady , eyeing him with some disfavour .</p>
    <p n="862"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I want to be able to count upon your help . ”</said></p>
    <p n="863"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ I 'll help you to hang<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>with pleasure , ”</said>she replied gruffly .<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Hanging 's too good for him . Ought to be drawn and quartered , like in good old times . ”</said></p>
    <p n="864"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ We are at one then , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ for I , too , want to hang the criminal . ”</said></p>
    <p n="865"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="866"><said who="#Alfred_Inglethorp">“ Him , or another . ”</said></p>
    <p n="867"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ No question of another . Poor<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>was never murdered until he came along . I do n't say she was n't surrounded by sharks — she was . But it was only her purse they were after . Her life was safe enough . But along comes Mr.<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>— and within two months — hey presto ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="868"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Believe me ,<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>very earnestly ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ if<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>is the man , he shall not escape me . On my honour , I will hang him as high as Haman ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="869"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ That 's better , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>more enthusiastically .</p>
    <p n="870"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But I must ask you to trust me . Now your help may be very valuable to me . I will tell you why . Because , in all this house of mourning , yours are the only eyes that have wept . ”</said></p>
    <p n="871"><persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>blinked , and a new note crept into the gruffness of her voice .</p>
    <p n="872"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ If you mean that I was fond of her — yes , I was . You know ,<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>was a selfish old woman in her way . She was very generous , but she always wanted a return . She never let people forget what she had done for them — and , that way she missed love . Do n't think she ever realized it , though , or felt the lack of it . Hope not , anyway . I was on a different footing . I took my stand from the first . ‘ So many pounds a year I 'm worth to you . Well and good . But not a penny piece besides — not a pair of gloves , nor a theatre ticket . ’ She did n't understand — was very offended sometimes . Said I was foolishly proud . It was n't that — but I could n't explain . Anyway , I kept my self-respect . And so , out of the whole bunch , I was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of her . I watched over her . I guarded her from the lot of them , and then a glib-tongued scoundrel comes along , and pooh ! all my years of devotion go for nothing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="873"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded sympathetically .</p>
    <p n="874"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I understand , mademoiselle , I understand all you feel . It is most natural . You think that we are lukewarm — that we lack fire and energy — but trust me , it is not so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="875"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>stuck his head in at this juncture , and invited us both to come up to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s room , as he and<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>had finished looking through the desk in the boudoir .</p>
    <p n="876">As we went up the stairs ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>looked back to the dining-room door , and lowered his voice confidentially :</p>
    <p n="877"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Look here , what 's going to happen when these two meet ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="878">I shook my head helplessly .</p>
    <p n="879"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I 've told<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>to keep them apart if she can . ”</said></p>
    <p n="880"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ Will she be able to do so ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="881"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ The Lord only knows . There 's one thing ,<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>himself wo n't be too keen on meeting her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="882"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ You 've got the keys still , have n't you ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>? ”</said>I asked , as we reached the door of the locked room .</p>
    <p n="883">Taking the keys from<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>unlocked it , and we all passed in . The lawyer went straight to the desk , and<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>followed him .</p>
    <p n="884"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ My mother kept most of her important papers in this despatch-case , I believe , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="885"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>drew out the small bunch of keys .</p>
    <p n="886"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Permit me . I locked it , out of precaution , this morning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="887"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ But it 's not locked now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="888"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Impossible ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="889"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ See . ”</said>And<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>lifted the lid as he spoke .</p>
    <p n="890"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Milles tonnerres ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, dumfounded .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And I — who have both the keys in my pocket ! ”</said>He flung himself upon the case . Suddenly he stiffened .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ En voila une affaire ! This lock has been forced . ”</said></p>
    <p n="891"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="892"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>laid down the case again .</p>
    <p n="893"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But who forced it ? Why should they ? When ? But the door was locked ? ”</said>These exclamations burst from us disjointedly .</p>
    <p n="894"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>answered them categorically — almost mechanically .</p>
    <p n="895"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Who ? That is the question . Why ? Ah , if I only knew . When ? Since I was here an hour ago . As to the door being locked , it is a very ordinary lock . Probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="896">We stared at one another blankly .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>had walked over to the mantel-piece . He was outwardly calm , but I noticed his hands , which from long force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on the mantel-piece , were shaking violently .</p>
    <p n="897"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ See here , it was like this , ”</said>he said at last .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ There was something in that case — some piece of evidence , slight in itself perhaps , but still enough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime . It was vital to him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its significance appreciated . Therefore , he took the risk , the great risk , of coming in here . Finding the case locked , he was obliged to force it , thus betraying his presence . For him to take that risk , it must have been something of great importance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="898"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ But what was it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="899"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, with a gesture of anger .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That , I do not know ! A document of some kind , without doubt , possibly the scrap of paper<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>saw in her hand yesterday afternoon . And I — ”</said>his anger burst forth freely —<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ miserable animal that I am ! I guessed nothing ! I have behaved like an imbecile ! I should never have left that case here . I should have carried it away with me . Ah , triple pig ! And now it is gone . It is destroyed — but is it destroyed ? Is there not yet a chance — we must leave no stone unturned — ”</said></p>
    <p n="900">He rushed like a madman from the room , and I followed him as soon as I had sufficiently recovered my wits . But , by the time I had reached the top of the stairs , he was out of sight .</p>
    <p n="901"><persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>was standing where the staircase branched , staring down into the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared .</p>
    <p n="902"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ What has happened to your extraordinary little friend ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>? He has just rushed past me like a mad bull . ”</said></p>
    <p n="903"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ He 's rather upset about something , ”</said>I remarked feebly . I really did not know how much<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>would wish me to disclose . As I saw a faint smile gather on<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>'s expressive mouth , I endeavoured to try and turn the conversation by saying :<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ They have n't met yet , have they ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="904"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Who ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="905"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>and<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="906">She looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner .</p>
    <p n="907"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="908"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , do n't you ? ”</said>I said , rather taken aback .</p>
    <p n="909"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ No . ”</said>She was smiling in her quiet way .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I should like to see a good flare up . It would clear the air . At present we are all thinking so much , and saying so little . ”</said></p>
    <p n="910"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>does n't think so , ”</said>I remarked .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ He 's anxious to keep them apart . ”</said></p>
    <p n="911"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="912">Something in her tone fired me , and I blurted out :</p>
    <p n="913"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Old<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s an awfully good sort . ”</said></p>
    <p n="914">She studied me curiously for a minute or two , and then said , to my great surprise :</p>
    <p n="915"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ You are loyal to your friend . I like you for that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="916"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Are n't you my friend too ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="917"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I am a very bad friend . ”</said></p>
    <p n="918"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Why do you say that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="919"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Because it is true . I am charming to my friends one day , and forget all about them the next . ”</said></p>
    <p n="920">I do n't know what impelled me , but I was nettled , and I said foolishly and not in the best of taste :</p>
    <p n="921"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Yet you seem to be invariably charming to<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="922">Instantly I regretted my words . Her face stiffened . I had the impression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real woman . Without a word , she turned and went swiftly up the stairs , whilst I stood like an idiot gaping after her .</p>
    <p n="923">I was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below . I could hear<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shouting and expounding . I was vexed to think that my diplomacy had been in vain . The little man appeared to be taking the whole house into his confidence , a proceeding of which I , for one , doubted the wisdom . Once again I could not help regretting that my friend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement . I stepped briskly down the stairs . The sight of me calmed<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>almost immediately . I drew him aside .</p>
    <p n="924"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ My dear fellow , ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ is this wise ? Surely you do n't want the whole house to know of this occurrence ? You are actually playing into the criminal 's hands . ”</said></p>
    <p n="925"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ You think so ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="926"><said who="#Hastings">“ I am sure of it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="927"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Well , well , my friend , I will be guided by you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="928"><said who="#Hastings">“ Good . Although , unfortunately , it is a little too late now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="929"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Sure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="930">He looked so crestfallen and abashed that I felt quite sorry , though I still thought my rebuke a just and wise one .</p>
    <p n="931"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , ”</said>he said at last ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ let us go , mon ami . ”</said></p>
    <p n="932"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ You have finished here ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="933"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ For the moment , yes . You will walk back with me to the village ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="934"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Willingly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="935">He picked up his little suit-case , and we went out through the open window in the drawing-room .<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>Murdoch was just coming in , and<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>stood aside to let her pass .</p>
    <p n="936"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Excuse me , mademoiselle , one minute . ”</said></p>
    <p n="937"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Yes ? ”</said>she turned inquiringly .</p>
    <p n="938"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Did you ever make up<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s medicines ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="939">A slight flush rose in her face , as she answered rather constrainedly :</p>
    <p n="940"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="941"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Only her powders ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="942">The flush deepened as<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>replied :</p>
    <p n="943"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Oh , yes , I did make up some sleeping powders for her once . ”</said></p>
    <p n="944"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ These ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="945"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>produced the empty box which had contained powders .</p>
    <p n="946">She nodded .</p>
    <p n="947"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Can you tell me what they were ? Sulphonal ? Veronal ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="948"><said who="#Cynthia">“ No , they were bromide powders . ”</said></p>
    <p n="949"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah ! Thank you , mademoiselle ; good morning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="950">As we walked briskly away from the house , I glanced at him more than once . I had often before noticed that , if anything excited him , his eyes turned green like a cat 's . They were shining like emeralds now .</p>
    <p n="951"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ My friend , ”</said>he broke out at last ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I have a little idea , a very strange , and probably utterly impossible idea . And yet — it fits in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="952">I shrugged my shoulders . I privately thought that<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>was rather too much given to these fantastic ideas . In this case , surely , the truth was only too plain and apparent .</p>
    <p n="953"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ So that is the explanation of the blank label on the box , ”</said>I remarked .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Very simple , as you said . I really wonder that I did not think of it myself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="954"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>did not appear to be listening to me .</p>
    <p n="955"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ They have made one more discovery , la-bas , ”</said>he observed , jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of Styles .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>told me as we were going upstairs . ”</said></p>
    <p n="956"><said who="#Cynthia">“ What was it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="957"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Locked up in the desk in the boudoir , they found a will of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s , dated before her marriage , leaving her fortune to<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>. It must have been made just at the time they were engaged . It came quite as a surprise to<persName>Wells</persName>— and to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>also . It was written on one of those printed will forms , and witnessed by two of the servants — not<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="958"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Did<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>know of it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="959"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ He says not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="960"><said who="#Cynthia">“ One might take that with a grain of salt , ”</said>I remarked sceptically .<said who="#Cynthia">“ All these wills are very confusing . Tell me , how did those scribbled words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday afternoon ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="961"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>smiled .</p>
    <p n="962"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Mon ami , have you ever , when writing a letter , been arrested by the fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="963"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Yes , often . I suppose every one has . ”</said></p>
    <p n="964"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Exactly . And have you not , in such a case , tried the word once or twice on the edge of the blotting-paper , or a spare scrap of paper , to see if it looked right ? Well , that is what<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>did . You will notice that the word ‘ possessed ’ is spelt first with one ‘ s ’ and subsequently with two — correctly . To make sure , she had further tried it in a sentence , thus : ‘ I am possessed . ’ Now , what did that tell me ? It told me that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>had been writing the word ‘ possessed ’ that afternoon , and , having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh in my mind , the possibility of a will — ( a document almost certain to contain that word ) — occurred to me at once . This possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance . In the general confusion , the boudoir had not been swept that morning , and near the desk were several traces of brown mould and earth . The weather had been perfectly fine for some days , and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit .</said></p>
    <p n="965"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I strolled to the window , and saw at once that the begonia beds had been newly planted . The mould in the beds was exactly similar to that on the floor of the boudoir , and also I learnt from you that they had been planted yesterday afternoon . I was now sure that one , or possibly both of the gardeners — for there were two sets of footprints in the bed — had entered the boudoir , for if<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>had merely wished to speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window , and they would not have come into the room at all . I was now quite convinced that she had made a fresh will , and had called the two gardeners in to witness her signature . Events proved that I was right in my supposition . ”</said></p>
    <p n="966"><said who="#Cynthia">“ That was very ingenious , ”</said>I could not help admitting .<said who="#Cynthia">“ I must confess that the conclusions I drew from those few scribbled words were quite erroneous . ”</said></p>
    <p n="967">He smiled .</p>
    <p n="968"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You gave too much rein to your imagination . Imagination is a good servant , and a bad master . The simplest explanation is always the most likely . ”</said></p>
    <p n="969"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Another point — how did you know that the key of the despatch-case had been lost ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="970"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I did not know it . It was a guess that turned out to be correct . You observed that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle . That suggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy key-ring . Now , if it had been lost and recovered ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>would at once have replaced it on her bunch ; but on her bunch I found what was obviously the duplicate key , very new and bright , which led me to the hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the lock of the despatch-case . ”</said></p>
    <p n="971"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Yes , ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Cynthia">“<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>, without doubt . ”</said></p>
    <p n="972"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>looked at me curiously .</p>
    <p n="973"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You are very sure of his guilt ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="974"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Well , naturally . Every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more clearly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="975"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ On the contrary , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>quietly ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ there are several points in his favour . ”</said></p>
    <p n="976"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Oh , come now ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="977"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="978"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I see only one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="979"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="980"><said who="#Cynthia">“ That he was not in the house last night . ”</said></p>
    <p n="981"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ ‘ Bad shot ! ’ as you English say ! You have chosen the one point that to my mind tells against him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="982"><said who="#Cynthia">“ How is that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="983"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Because if<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>knew that his wife would be poisoned last night , he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house . His excuse was an obviously trumped up one . That leaves us two possibilities : either he knew what was going to happen or he had a reason of his own for his absence . ”</said></p>
    <p n="984"><said who="#Cynthia">“ And that reason ? ”</said>I asked sceptically .</p>
    <p n="985"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shrugged his shoulders .</p>
    <p n="986"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ How should I know ? Discreditable , without doubt . This<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, I should say , is somewhat of a scoundrel — but that does not of necessity make him a murderer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="987">I shook my head , unconvinced .</p>
    <p n="988"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ We do not agree , eh ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , let us leave it . Time will show which of us is right . Now let us turn to other aspects of the case . What do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom were bolted on the inside ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="989">“ Well —— ” I considered .<said who="#Cynthia">“ One must look at it logically . ”</said></p>
    <p n="990"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ True . ”</said></p>
    <p n="991"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I should put it this way . The doors were bolted — our own eyes have told us that — yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor , and the destruction of the will , prove that during the night some one entered the room . You agree so far ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="992"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Perfectly . Put with admirable clearness . Proceed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="993"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Well , ”</said>I said , encouraged ,<said who="#Cynthia">“ as the person who entered did not do so by the window , nor by miraculous means , it follows that the door must have been opened from inside by<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>herself . That strengthens the conviction that the person in question was her husband . She would naturally open the door to her own husband . ”</said></p>
    <p n="994"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shook his head .</p>
    <p n="995"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Why should she ? She had bolted the door leading into his room — a most unusual proceeding on her part — she had had a most violent quarrel with him that very afternoon . No , he was the last person she would admit . ”</said></p>
    <p n="996"><said who="#Cynthia">“ But you agree with me that the door must have been opened by<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>herself ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="997"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ There is another possibility . She may have forgotten to bolt the door into the passage when she went to bed , and have got up later , towards morning , and bolted it then . ”</said></p>
    <p n="998"><said who="#Cynthia">“<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, is that seriously your opinion ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="999"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , I do not say it is so , but it might be . Now , to turn to another feature , what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard between<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>and her mother-in-law ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1000"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I had forgotten that , ”</said>I said thoughtfully .<said who="#Cynthia">“ That is as enigmatical as ever . It seems incredible that a woman like<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>, proud and reticent to the last degree , should interfere so violently in what was certainly not her affair . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1001"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Precisely . It was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1002"><said who="#Cynthia">“ It is certainly curious , ”</said>I agreed .<said who="#Cynthia">“ Still , it is unimportant , and need not be taken into account . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1003">A groan burst from<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1004"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What have I always told you ? Everything must be taken into account . If the fact will not fit the theory — let the theory go . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1005"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Well , we shall see , ”</said>I said , nettled .</p>
    <p n="1006"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , we shall see . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1007">We had reached Leastways Cottage , and<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>ushered me upstairs to his own room . He offered me one of the tiny Russian cigarettes he himself occasionally smoked . I was amused to notice that he stowed away the used matches most carefully in a little china pot . My momentary annoyance vanished .</p>
    <p n="1008"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which commanded a view of the village street . The fresh air blew in warm and pleasant . It was going to be a hot day .</p>
    <p n="1009">Suddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing down the street at a great pace . It was the expression on his face that was extraordinary — a curious mingling of terror and agitation .</p>
    <p n="1010"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Look ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>! ”</said>I said .</p>
    <p n="1011">He leant forward .</p>
    <p n="1012"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Tiens ! ”</said>he said .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It is<persName corresp="#Mr._Mace">Mr. Mace</persName>, from the chemist 's shop . He is coming here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1013">The young man came to a halt before Leastways Cottage , and , after hesitating a moment , pounded vigorously at the door .</p>
    <p n="1014"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ A little minute , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>from the window .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I come . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1015">Motioning to me to follow him , he ran swiftly down the stairs and opened the door .<persName corresp="#Mr._Mace">Mr. Mace</persName>began at once .</p>
    <p n="1016"><said who="#Mr._Mace">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Poirot">Mr. Poirot</persName>, I 'm sorry for the inconvenience , but I heard that you 'd just come back from the Hall ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1017"><said who="#Mr._Poirot">“ Yes , we have . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1018">The young man moistened his dry lips . His face was working curiously .</p>
    <p n="1019"><said who="#Mr._Mace">“ It 's all over the village about old<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>dying so suddenly . They do say — ”</said>he lowered his voice cautiously —<said who="#Mr._Mace">“ that it 's poison ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1020"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s face remained quite impassive .</p>
    <p n="1021"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Only the doctors can tell us that ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Mace">Mr. Mace</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1022">“ Yes , exactly — of course —— ” The young man hesitated , and then his agitation was too much for him . He clutched<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>by the arm , and sank his voice to a whisper :<said who="#Mr._Mace">“ Just tell me this ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Poirot">Mr. Poirot</persName>, it is n't — it is n't strychnine , is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1023">I hardly heard what<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>replied . Something evidently of a non-committal nature . The young man departed , and as he closed the door<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s eyes met mine .</p>
    <p n="1024"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , ”</said>he said , nodding gravely .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ He will have evidence to give at the inquest . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1025">We went slowly upstairs again . I was opening my lips , when<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>stopped me with a gesture of his hand .</p>
    <p n="1026"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Not now , not now , mon ami . I have need of reflection . My mind is in some disorder — which is not well . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1027">For about ten minutes he sat in dead silence , perfectly still , except for several expressive motions of his eyebrows , and all the time his eyes grew steadily greener . At last he heaved a deep sigh .</p>
    <p n="1028"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It is well . The bad moment has passed . Now all is arranged and classified . One must never permit confusion . The case is not clear yet — no . For it is of the most complicated ! It puzzles me . Me ,<persName corresp="#Hercule_Poirot">Hercule Poirot</persName>! There are two facts of significance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1029"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ And what are they ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1030"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ The first is the state of the weather yesterday . That is very important . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1031"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ But it was a glorious day ! ”</said>I interrupted .<said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, you 're pulling my leg ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1032"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Not at all . The thermometer registered 80 degrees in the shade . Do not forget that , my friend . It is the key to the whole riddle ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1033"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ And the second point ? ”</said>I asked .</p>
    <p n="1034"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ The important fact that Monsieur<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>wears very peculiar clothes , has a black beard , and uses glasses . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1035"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, I cannot believe you are serious . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1036"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I am absolutely serious , my friend . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1037"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ But this is childish ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1038"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , it is very momentous . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1039"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ And supposing<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>'s jury returns a verdict of Wilful Murder against<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>. What becomes of your theories , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1040"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ They would not be shaken because twelve stupid men had happened to make a mistake ! But that will not occur . For one thing , a country jury is not anxious to take responsibility upon itself , and<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>stands practically in the position of local squire . Also , ”</said>he added placidly ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I should not allow it ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1041"><said who="#Mr._Mace">“ You would not allow it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1042"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1043">I looked at the extraordinary little man , divided between annoyance and amusement . He was so tremendously sure of himself . As though he read my thoughts , he nodded gently .</p>
    <p n="1044"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Oh , yes , mon ami , I would do what I say . ”</said>He got up and laid his hand on my shoulder . His physiognomy underwent a complete change . Tears came into his eyes .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ In all this , you see , I think of that poor<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>who is dead . She was not extravagantly loved — no . But she was very good to us Belgians — I owe her a debt . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1045">I endeavoured to interrupt , but<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>swept on .</p>
    <p n="1046"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Let me tell you this ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>. She would never forgive me if I let<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>, her husband , be arrested now — when a word from me could save him ! ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="6">
    <p n="1047">In the interval before the inquest ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>was unfailing in his activity . Twice he was closeted with<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>. He also took long walks into the country . I rather resented his not taking me into his confidence , the more so as I could not in the least guess what he was driving at .</p>
    <p n="1048">It occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at Raikes 's farm ; so , finding him out when I called at Leastways Cottage on Wednesday evening , I walked over there by the fields , hoping to meet him . But there was no sign of him , and I hesitated to go right up to the farm itself . As I walked away , I met an aged rustic , who leered at me cunningly .</p>
    <p n="1049"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ You 'm from the Hall , bai n't you ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="1050"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes . I 'm looking for a friend of mine whom I thought might have walked this way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1051"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ A little chap ? As waves his hands when he talks ? One of them Belgies from the village ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1052"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , ”</said>I said eagerly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ He has been here , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1053"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ Oh , ay , he 's been here , right enough . More'n once too . Friend of yours , is he ? Ah , you gentlemen from the Hall — you'n a pretty lot ! ”</said>And he leered more jocosely than ever .</p>
    <p n="1054"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Why , do the gentlemen from the Hall come here often ? ”</said>I asked , as carelessly as I could .</p>
    <p n="1055">He winked at me knowingly .</p>
    <p n="1056"><said who="#Mr._Wells">“ One does , mister . Naming no names , mind . And a very liberal gentleman too ! Oh , thank you , sir , I 'm sure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1057">I walked on sharply .<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>had been right then , and I experienced a sharp twinge of disgust , as I thought of<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>'s liberality with another woman 's money . Had that piquant gipsy face been at the bottom of the crime , or was it the baser mainspring of money ? Probably a judicious mixture of both .</p>
    <p n="1058">On one point ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>seemed to have a curious obsession . He once or twice observed to me that he thought<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>must have made an error in fixing the time of the quarrel . He suggested to her repeatedly that it was 4. 30 , and not 4 o'clock when she had heard the voices .</p>
    <p n="1059">But<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>was unshaken . Quite an hour , or even more , had elapsed between the time when she had heard the voices and 5 o'clock , when she had taken tea to her mistress .</p>
    <p n="1060">The inquest was held on Friday at the Stylites Arms in the village .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>and I sat together , not being required to give evidence .</p>
    <p n="1061">The preliminaries were gone through . The jury viewed the body , and<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>gave evidence of identification .</p>
    <p n="1062">Further questioned , he described his awakening in the early hours of the morning , and the circumstances of his mother 's death .</p>
    <p n="1063">The medical evidence was next taken . There was a breathless hush , and every eye was fixed on the famous London specialist , who was known to be one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of toxicology .</p>
    <p n="1064">In a few brief words , he summed up the result of the post-mortem . Shorn of its medical phraseology and technicalities , it amounted to the fact that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>had met her death as the result of strychnine poisoning . Judging from the quantity recovered , she must have taken not less than three-quarters of a grain of strychnine , but probably one grain or slightly over .</p>
    <p n="1065"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1066"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ I should consider it very unlikely . Strychnine is not used for domestic purposes , as some poisons are , and there are restrictions placed on its sale . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1067"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison was administered ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1068"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1069"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ You arrived at Styles before<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>, I believe ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1070"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ That is so . The motor met me just outside the lodge gates , and I hurried there as fast as I could . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1071"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Will you relate to us exactly what happened next ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1072"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ I entered<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s room . She was at that moment in a typical tetanic convulsion . She turned towards me , and gasped out : ‘<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>—<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>—— ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="1073"><said who="#Alfred">“ Could the strychnine have been administered in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s after-dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1074"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Possibly , but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action . The symptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed . It is retarded under certain conditions , none of which , however , appear to have been present in this case . I presume<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>took the coffee after dinner about eight o'clock , whereas the symptoms did not manifest themselves until the early hours of the morning , which , on the face of it , points to the drug having been taken much later in the evening . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1075"><said who="#Alfred">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>was in the habit of drinking a cup of coco in the middle of the night . Could the strychnine have been administered in that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1076"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ No , I myself took a sample of the coco remaining in the saucepan and had it analysed . There was no strychnine present . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1077">I heard<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>chuckle softly beside me .</p>
    <p n="1078"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ How did you know ? ”</said>I whispered .</p>
    <p n="1079"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Listen . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1080"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I should say ”</said>— the doctor was continuing —<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ that I would have been considerably surprised at any other result . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1081"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1082"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste . It can be detected in a solution of 1 in 70 , 000 , and can only be disguised by some strongly flavoured substance . Coco would be quite powerless to mask it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1083">One of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee .</p>
    <p n="1084"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No . Coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover the taste of strychnine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1085"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the coffee , but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1086"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , but , the cup being completely smashed , there is no possibility of analyzing its contents . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1087">This concluded<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>'s evidence .<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>corroborated it on all points . Sounded as to the possibility of suicide , he repudiated it utterly . The deceased , he said , suffered from a weak heart , but otherwise enjoyed perfect health , and was of a cheerful and well-balanced disposition . She would be one of the last people to take her own life .</p>
    <p n="1088"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence Cavendish</persName>was next called . His evidence was quite unimportant , being a mere repetition of that of his brother . Just as he was about to step down , he paused , and said rather hesitatingly :</p>
    <p n="1089"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I should like to make a suggestion if I may ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1090">He glanced deprecatingly at<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>, who replied briskly :</p>
    <p n="1091"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Certainly ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>, we are here to arrive at the truth of this matter , and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1092"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ It is just an idea of mine , ”</said>explained<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>.<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Of course I may be quite wrong , but it still seems to me that my mother 's death might be accounted for by natural means . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1093"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ How do you make that out ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1094"><said who="#Mr._Cavendish">“ My mother , at the time of her death , and for some time before it , was taking a tonic containing strychnine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1095"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Ah ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1096">The jury looked up , interested .</p>
    <p n="1097"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ I believe , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>,<said who="#the_Coroner">“ that there have been cases where the cumulative effect of a drug , administered for some time , has ended by causing death . Also , is it not possible that she may have taken an overdose of her medicine by accident ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1098"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ This is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at the time of her death . We are much obliged to you ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1099"><persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>was recalled and ridiculed the idea .</p>
    <p n="1100"><said who="#Dr._Wilkins">“ What<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>suggests is quite impossible . Any doctor would tell you the same . Strychnine is , in a certain sense , a cumulative poison , but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in this way . There would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms which would at once have attracted my attention . The whole thing is absurd . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1101"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ And the second suggestion ? That<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>may have inadvertently taken an overdose ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1102"><said who="#Dr._Wilkins">“ Three , or even four doses , would not have resulted in death .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a time , as she dealt with Coot 's , the Cash Chemists in Tadminster . She would have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the amount of strychnine found at the post-mortem . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1103"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any way instrumental in causing her death ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1104"><said who="#Dr._Wilkins">“ Certainly . The supposition is ridiculous . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1105">The same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the chemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error .</p>
    <p n="1106"><said who="#the_doctor">“ That , of course , is always possible , ”</said>replied the doctor .</p>
    <p n="1107">But<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, who was the next witness called , dispelled even that possibility . The medicine had not been newly made up . On the contrary ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>had taken the last dose on the day of her death .</p>
    <p n="1108">So the question of the tonic was finally abandoned , and<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>proceeded with his task . Having elicited from<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>how she had been awakened by the violent ringing of her mistress 's bell , and had subsequently roused the household , he passed to the subject of the quarrel on the preceding afternoon .</p>
    <p n="1109"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>'s evidence on this point was substantially what<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>and I had already heard , so I will not repeat it here .</p>
    <p n="1110">The next witness was<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>. She stood very upright , and spoke in a low , clear , and perfectly composed voice . In answer to<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>'s question , she told how , her alarm clock having aroused her at 4. 30 as usual , she was dressing , when she was startled by the sound of something heavy falling .</p>
    <p n="1111"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ That would have been the table by the bed ? ”</said>commented<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1112"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ I opened my door , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>,<said who="#the_Coroner">“ and listened . In a few minutes a bell rang violently .<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>came running down and woke my husband , and we all went to my mother-in-law 's room , but it was locked —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1113"><persName corresp="#the_Coroner">The Coroner</persName>interrupted her .</p>
    <p n="1114"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ I really do not think we need trouble you further on that point . We know all that can be known of the subsequent happenings . But I should be obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the day before . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1115"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1116">There was a faint insolence in her voice . She raised her hand and adjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck , turning her head a little as she did so . And quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind :<said who="#the_Coroner">“ She is gaining time ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1117"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Yes . I understand , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>deliberately ,<said who="#the_Coroner">“ that you were sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the boudoir . That is so , is it not ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1118">This was news to me and glancing sideways at<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, I fancied that it was news to him as well .</p>
    <p n="1119">There was the faintest pause , the mere hesitation of a moment , before she answered :</p>
    <p n="1120"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Yes , that is so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1121"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And the boudoir window was open , was it not ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1122">Surely her face grew a little paler as she answered :</p>
    <p n="1123"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1124"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside , especially as they were raised in anger . In fact , they would be more audible where you were than in the hall . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1125"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Possibly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1126"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1127"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ I really do not remember hearing anything . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1128"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Do you mean to say you did not hear voices ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1129"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Oh , yes , I heard the voices , but I did not hear what they said . ”</said>A faint spot of colour came into her cheek .<said who="#the_Coroner">“ I am not in the habit of listening to private conversations . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1130"><persName corresp="#the_Coroner">The Coroner</persName>persisted .</p>
    <p n="1131"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ And you remember nothing at all ? Nothing ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>? Not one stray word or phrase to make you realize that it was a private conversation ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1132">She paused , and seemed to reflect , still outwardly as calm as ever .</p>
    <p n="1133"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Yes ; I remember .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>said something — I do not remember exactly what — about causing scandal between husband and wife . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1134"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Ah ! ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>leant back satisfied .<said who="#the_Coroner">“ That corresponds with what<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>heard . But excuse me ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>, although you realized it was a private conversation , you did not move away ? You remained where you were ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1135">I caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them . I felt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the little lawyer , with his insinuations , into pieces , but she replied quietly enough :</p>
    <p n="1136"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ No . I was very comfortable where I was . I fixed my mind on my book . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1137"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And that is all you can tell us ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1138"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ That is all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1139">The examination was over , though I doubted if<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>was entirely satisfied with it . I think he suspected that<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>could tell more if she chose .</p>
    <p n="1140">Amy Hill , shop assistant , was next called , and deposed to having sold a will form on the afternoon of the 17th to William Earl , under-gardener at Styles .</p>
    <p n="1141">William Earl and<persName corresp="#Manning">Manning</persName>succeeded her , and testified to witnessing a document .<persName corresp="#Manning">Manning</persName>fixed the time at about 4. 30 , William was of the opinion that it was rather earlier .</p>
    <p n="1142"><persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>Murdoch came next . She had , however , little to tell . She had known nothing of the tragedy , until awakened by<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1143"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ You did not hear the table fall ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1144"><said who="#Cynthia">“ No . I was fast asleep . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1145"><persName corresp="#the_Coroner">The Coroner</persName>smiled .</p>
    <p n="1146"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ A good conscience makes a sound sleeper , ”</said>he observed .<said who="#the_Coroner">“ Thank you , Miss Murdoch , that is all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1147"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1148"><persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>produced the letter written to her by<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>on the evening of the 17th .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>and I had , of course already seen it . It added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy . The following is a facsimile :</p>
    <p n="1149">STYLES COURT ESSEX hand written note : July 17th My dear Evelyn</p>
    <p n="1150">Can we not bury the hachet ? I have found it hard to forgive the things you said</p>
    <p n="1151">against my dear husband but I am an old woman &amp; very fond of you</p>
    <p n="1152">Yours affectionately ,</p>
    <p n="1153"><persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>Inglethorpe</p>
    <p n="1154">It was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively .</p>
    <p n="1155"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ I fear it does not help us much , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>, with a sigh .<said who="#the_Coroner">“ There is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1156"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Plain as a pikestaff to me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>shortly .<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ It shows clearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she 'd been made a fool of ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1157"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ It says nothing of the kind in the letter , ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>pointed out .</p>
    <p n="1158"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ No , because<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>never could bear to put herself in the wrong . But I know her . She wanted me back . But she was n't going to own that I 'd been right . She went round about . Most people do . Do n't believe in it myself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1159"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>smiled faintly . So , I noticed , did several of the jury .<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>was obviously quite a public character .</p>
    <p n="1160"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Anyway , all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time , ”</said>continued the lady , glancing up and down the jury disparagingly .<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Talk — talk — talk ! When all the time we know perfectly well —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1161"><persName corresp="#the_Coroner">The Coroner</persName>interrupted her in an agony of apprehension :</p>
    <p n="1162"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Thank you ,<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, that is all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1163">I fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied .</p>
    <p n="1164">Then came the sensation of the day .<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">The Coroner</persName>called Albert<persName>Mace</persName>, chemist 's assistant .</p>
    <p n="1165">It was our agitated young man of the pale face . In answer to<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>'s questions , he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist , but had only recently come to this particular shop , as the assistant formerly there had just been called up for the army .</p>
    <p n="1166">These preliminaries completed ,<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>proceeded to business .</p>
    <p n="1167"><said who="#the_Coroner">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Mace">Mr. Mace</persName>, have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1168"><said who="#Mr._Mace">“ Yes , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1169"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ When was this ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1170"><said who="#Mr._Mace">“ Last Monday night . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1171"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Monday ? Not Tuesday ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1172"><said who="#Mr._Mace">“ No , sir , Monday , the 16th . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1173"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Will you tell us to whom you sold it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1174">You could have heard a pin drop .</p>
    <p n="1175"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Yes , sir . It was to<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1176">Every eye turned simultaneously to where<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>was sitting , impassive and wooden . He started slightly , as the damning words fell from the young man 's lips . I half thought he was going to rise from his chair , but he remained seated , although a remarkably well acted expression of astonishment rose on his face .</p>
    <p n="1177"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ You are sure of what you say ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>sternly .</p>
    <p n="1178"><said who="#Alfred_Inglethorp">“ Quite sure , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1179"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the counter ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1180">The wretched young man wilted visibly under<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>'s frown .</p>
    <p n="1181"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Oh , no , sir — of course not . But , seeing it was<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>of the Hall , I thought there was no harm in it . He said it was to poison a dog . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1182">Inwardly I sympathized . It was only human nature to endeavour to please “ The Hall ” — especially when it might result in custom being transferred from Coot 's to the local establishment .</p>
    <p n="1183"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1184"><said who="#Alfred_Inglethorp">“ Yes , sir ,<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>did so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1185"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Have you got the book here ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1186"><said who="#Alfred_Inglethorp">“ Yes , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1187">It was produced ; and , with a few words of stern censure ,<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>dismissed the wretched<persName corresp="#Mr._Mace">Mr. Mace</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1188">Then , amidst a breathless silence ,<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>was called . Did he realize , I wondered , how closely the halter was being drawn around his neck ?</p>
    <p n="1189"><persName corresp="#the_Coroner">The Coroner</persName>went straight to the point .</p>
    <p n="1190"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ On Monday evening last , did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of poisoning a dog ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1191"><persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>replied with perfect calmness :</p>
    <p n="1192"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ No , I did not . There is no dog at Styles , except an outdoor sheepdog , which is in perfect health . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1193"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ You deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from Albert<persName>Mace</persName>on Monday last ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1194"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ I do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1195"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Do you also deny this ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1196"><persName corresp="#the_Coroner">The Coroner</persName>handed him the register in which his signature was inscribed .</p>
    <p n="1197"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Certainly I do . The hand-writing is quite different from mine . I will show you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1198">He took an old envelope out of his pocket , and wrote his name on it , handing it to the jury . It was certainly utterly dissimilar .</p>
    <p n="1199"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Then what is your explanation of<persName corresp="#Mr._Mace">Mr. Mace</persName>'s statement ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1200"><persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>replied imperturbably :</p>
    <p n="1201"><said who="#Alfred_Inglethorp">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Mace">Mr. Mace</persName>must have been mistaken . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1202"><persName corresp="#the_Coroner">The Coroner</persName>hesitated for a moment , and then said :</p>
    <p n="1203"><said who="#the_Coroner">“<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, as a mere matter of form , would you mind telling us where you were on the evening of Monday , July 16th ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1204"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ Really — I can n't remember . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1205"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ That is absurd ,<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>sharply .<said who="#the_Coroner">“ Think again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1206"><persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>shook his head .</p>
    <p n="1207"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ I cannot tell you . I have an idea that I was out walking . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1208"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ In what direction ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1209"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ I really can n't remember . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1210"><persName corresp="#the_Coroner">The Coroner</persName>'s face grew graver .</p>
    <p n="1211"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Were you in company with anyone ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1212"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1213"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Did you meet anyone on your walk ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1214"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1215"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ That is a pity , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>dryly .<said who="#the_Coroner">“ I am to take it then that you decline to say where you were at the time that<persName corresp="#Mr._Mace">Mr. Mace</persName>positively recognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1216"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ If you like to take it that way , yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1217"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ Be careful ,<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1218"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>was fidgeting nervously .</p>
    <p n="1219"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Sacre ! ”</said>he murmured .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Does this imbecile of a man want to be arrested ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1220"><persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>was indeed creating a bad impression . His futile denials would not have convinced a child .<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">The Coroner</persName>, however , passed briskly to the next point , and<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>drew a deep breath of relief .</p>
    <p n="1221"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You had a discussion with your wife on Tuesday afternoon ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1222"><said who="#Alfred_Inglethorp">“ Pardon me , ”</said>interrupted<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>,<said who="#Alfred_Inglethorp">“ you have been misinformed . I had no quarrel with my dear wife . The whole story is absolutely untrue . I was absent from the house the entire afternoon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1223"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Have you anyone who can testify to that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1224"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ You have my word , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>haughtily .</p>
    <p n="1225"><persName corresp="#the_Coroner">The Coroner</persName>did not trouble to reply .</p>
    <p n="1226"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ There are two witnesses who will swear to having heard your disagreement with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1227"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ Those witnesses were mistaken . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1228">I was puzzled . The man spoke with such quiet assurance that I was staggered . I looked at<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>. There was an expression of exultation on his face which I could not understand . Was he at last convinced of<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>'s guilt ?</p>
    <p n="1229"><said who="#the_Coroner">“<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>,<said who="#the_Coroner">“ you have heard your wife 's dying words repeated here . Can you explain them in any way ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1230"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ Certainly I can . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1231"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ You can ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1232"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ It seems to me very simple . The room was dimly lighted .<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>is much of my height and build , and , like me , wears a beard . In the dim light , and suffering as she was , my poor wife mistook him for me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1233"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah ! ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>to himself .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But it is an idea , that ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1234"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ You think it is true ? ”</said>I whispered .</p>
    <p n="1235"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do not say that . But it is truly an ingenious supposition . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1236"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ You read my wife 's last words as an accusation ”</said>—<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>was continuing —<said who="#Inglethorp">“ they were , on the contrary , an appeal to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1237"><persName corresp="#the_Coroner">The Coroner</persName>reflected a moment , then he said :</p>
    <p n="1238"><said who="#the_Coroner">“ I believe ,<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, that you yourself poured out the coffee , and took it to your wife that evening ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1239"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ I poured it out , yes . But I did not take it to her . I meant to do so , but I was told that a friend was at the hall door , so I laid down the coffee on the hall table . When I came through the hall again a few minutes later , it was gone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1240">This statement might , or might not , be true , but it did not seem to me to improve matters much for<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>. In any case , he had had ample time to introduce the poison .</p>
    <p n="1241">At that point ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nudged me gently , indicating two men who were sitting together near the door . One was a little , sharp , dark , ferret-faced man , the other was tall and fair .</p>
    <p n="1242">I questioned<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>mutely . He put his lips to my ear .</p>
    <p n="1243"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Do you know who that little man is ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1244">I shook my head .</p>
    <p n="1245"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That is Detective Inspector James<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>of Scotland Yard — Jimmy<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>. The other man is from Scotland Yard too . Things are moving quickly , my friend . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1246">I stared at the two men intently . There was certainly nothing of the policeman about them . I should never have suspected them of being official personages .</p>
    <p n="1247">I was still staring , when I was startled and recalled by the verdict being given :</p>
    <p n="1248"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Wilful Murder against some person or persons unknown . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="7">
    <p n="1249">As we came out of the Stylites Arms ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>drew me aside by a gentle pressure of the arm . I understood his object . He was waiting for the Scotland Yard men .</p>
    <p n="1250">In a few moments , they emerged , and<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>at once stepped forward , and accosted the shorter of the two .</p>
    <p n="1251"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I fear you do not remember me , Inspector<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1252"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Why , if it is n't<persName corresp="#Mr._Poirot">Mr. Poirot</persName>! ”</said>cried the Inspector . He turned to the other man .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You 've heard me speak of<persName corresp="#Mr._Poirot">Mr. Poirot</persName>? It was in 1904 he and I worked together — the Abercrombie forgery case — you remember , he was run down in Brussels . Ah , those were great days , moosier . Then , do you remember ‘ Baron ’ Altara ? There was a pretty rogue for you ! He eluded the clutches of half the police in Europe . But we nailed him in Antwerp — thanks to<persName corresp="#Mr._Poirot">Mr. Poirot</persName>here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1253">As these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in , I drew nearer , and was introduced to Detective-Inspector<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>, who , in his turn , introduced us both to his companion , Superintendent<persName corresp="#Summerhaye">Summerhaye</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1254"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I need hardly ask what you are doing here , gentlemen , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1255"><persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>closed one eye knowingly .</p>
    <p n="1256"><said who="#Japp">“ No , indeed . Pretty clear case I should say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1257">But<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>answered gravely :</p>
    <p n="1258"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ There I differ from you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1259"><said who="#Summerhaye">“ Oh , come ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Summerhaye">Summerhaye</persName>, opening his lips for the first time .<said who="#Summerhaye">“ Surely the whole thing is clear as daylight . The man 's caught red-handed . How he could be such a fool beats me ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1260">But<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>was looking attentively at<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1261"><said who="#Japp">“ Hold your fire ,<persName corresp="#Summerhaye">Summerhaye</persName>, ”</said>he remarked jocularly .<said who="#Japp">“ Me and Moosier here have met before — and there 's no man 's judgment I 'd sooner take than his . If I 'm not greatly mistaken , he 's got something up his sleeve . Is n't that so , moosier ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1262"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>smiled .</p>
    <p n="1263"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I have drawn certain conclusions — yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1264"><persName corresp="#Summerhaye">Summerhaye</persName>was still looking rather sceptical , but<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>continued his scrutiny of<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1265"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It 's this way , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ so far , we 've only seen the case from the outside . That 's where the Yard 's at a disadvantage in a case of this kind , where the murder 's only out , so to speak , after the inquest . A lot depends on being on the spot first thing , and that 's where<persName corresp="#Mr._Poirot">Mr. Poirot</persName>'s had the start of us . We should n't have been here as soon as this even , if it had n't been for the fact that there was a smart doctor on the spot , who gave us the tip through<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>. But you 've been on the spot from the first , and you may have picked up some little hints . From the evidence at the inquest ,<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>murdered his wife as sure as I stand here , and if anyone but you hinted the contrary I 'd laugh in his face . I must say I was surprised the jury did n't bring it in Wilful Murder against him right off . I think they would have , if it had n't been for<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>— he seemed to be holding them back . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1266"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Perhaps , though , you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket now , ”</said>suggested<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1267">A kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>'s expressive countenance .</p>
    <p n="1268"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Perhaps I have , and perhaps I have n't , ”</said>he remarked dryly .</p>
    <p n="1269"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>looked at him thoughtfully .</p>
    <p n="1270"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I am very anxious , Messieurs , that he should not be arrested . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1271"><said who="#Summerhaye">“ I dare say , ”</said>observed<persName corresp="#Summerhaye">Summerhaye</persName>sarcastically .</p>
    <p n="1272"><persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>was regarding<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>with comical perplexity .</p>
    <p n="1273"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ca n't you go a little further ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Poirot">Mr. Poirot</persName>? A wink 's as good as a nod — from you . You 've been on the spot — and the Yard does n't want to make any mistakes , you know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1274"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded gravely .</p>
    <p n="1275"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That is exactly what I thought . Well , I will tell you this . Use your warrant : Arrest<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>. But it will bring you no kudos — the case against him will be dismissed at once ! Comme ca ! ”</said>And he snapped his fingers expressively .</p>
    <p n="1276"><persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>'s face grew grave , though<persName corresp="#Summerhaye">Summerhaye</persName>gave an incredulous snort .</p>
    <p n="1277">As for me , I was literally dumb with astonishment . I could only conclude that<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>was mad .</p>
    <p n="1278"><persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>had taken out a handkerchief , and was gently dabbing his brow .</p>
    <p n="1279"><said who="#Japp">“ I dare n't do it ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Poirot">Mr. Poirot</persName>. I 'd take your word , but there 's others over me who 'll be asking what the devil I mean by it . Ca n't you give me a little more to go on ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1280"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>reflected a moment .</p>
    <p n="1281"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It can be done , ”</said>he said at last .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I admit I do not wish it . It forces my hand . I would have preferred to work in the dark just for the present , but what you say is very just — the word of a Belgian policeman , whose day is past , is not enough ! And<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>must not be arrested . That I have sworn , as my friend<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>here knows . See , then , my good<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>, you go at once to Styles ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1282"><said who="#Japp">“ Well , in about half an hour . We 're seeing<persName corresp="#the_Coroner">the Coroner</persName>and the doctor first . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1283"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Good . Call for me in passing — the last house in the village . I will go with you . At Styles ,<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>will give you , or if he refuses — as is probable — I will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the case against him could not possibly be sustained . Is that a bargain ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1284"><said who="#Japp">“ That 's a bargain , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>heartily .<said who="#Japp">“ And , on behalf of the Yard , I 'm much obliged to you , though I 'm bound to confess I can n't at present see the faintest possible loop-hole in the evidence , but you always were a marvel ! So long , then , moosier . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1285">The two detectives strode away ,<persName corresp="#Summerhaye">Summerhaye</persName>with an incredulous grin on his face .</p>
    <p n="1286"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , my friend , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, before I could get in a word ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ what do you think ? Mon Dieu ! I had some warm moments in that court ; I did not figure to myself that the man would be so pig-headed as to refuse to say anything at all . Decidedly , it was the policy of an imbecile . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1287"><said who="#Summerhaye">“ H 'm ! There are other explanations besides that of imbecility , ”</said>I remarked .<said who="#Summerhaye">“ For , if the case against him is true , how could he defend himself except by silence ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1288"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Why , in a thousand ingenious ways , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ See ; say that it is I who have committed this murder , I can think of seven most plausible stories ! Far more convincing than<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>'s stony denials ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1289">I could not help laughing .</p>
    <p n="1290"><said>“ My dear<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, I am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy ! But , seriously , in spite of what I heard you say to the detectives , you surely cannot still believe in the possibility of<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>'s innocence ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1291"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Why not now as much as before ? Nothing has changed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1292"><said who="#Summerhaye">“ But the evidence is so conclusive . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1293"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , too conclusive . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1294">We turned in at the gate of Leastways Cottage , and proceeded up the now familiar stairs .</p>
    <p n="1295"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , yes , too conclusive , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, almost to himself .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Real evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory . It has to be examined — sifted . But here the whole thing is cut and dried . No , my friend , this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured — so cleverly that it has defeated its own ends . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1296"><said who="#Summerhaye">“ How do you make that out ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1297"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Because , so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible , it was very hard to disprove . But , in his anxiety , the criminal has drawn the net so closely that one cut will set<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>free . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1298">I was silent . And in a minute or two ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>continued :</p>
    <p n="1299"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Let us look at the matter like this . Here is a man , let us say , who sets out to poison his wife . He has lived by his wits as the saying goes . Presumably , therefore , he has some wits . He is not altogether a fool . Well , how does he set about it ? He goes boldly to the village chemist 's and purchases strychnine under his own name , with a trumped up story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd . He does not employ the poison that night . No , he waits until he has had a violent quarrel with her , of which the whole household is cognisant , and which naturally directs their suspicions upon him . He prepares no defence — no shadow of an alibi , yet he knows the chemist 's assistant must necessarily come forward with the facts . Bah ! do not ask me to believe that any man could be so idiotic ! Only a lunatic , who wished to commit suicide by causing himself to be hanged , would act so ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1300"><said who="#Summerhaye">“ Still — I do not see — ”</said>I began .</p>
    <p n="1301"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Neither do I see . I tell you , mon ami , it puzzles me . Me —<persName corresp="#Hercule_Poirot">Hercule Poirot</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1302"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ But if you believe him innocent , how do you explain his buying the strychnine ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1303"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Very simply . He did not buy it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1304"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ But<persName>Mace</persName>recognized him ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1305"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I beg your pardon , he saw a man with a black beard like<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>'s , and wearing glasses like<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, and dressed in<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>'s rather noticeable clothes . He could not recognize a man whom he had probably only seen in the distance , since , you remember , he himself had only been in the village a fortnight , and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>dealt principally with Coot 's in Tadminster . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1306"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ Then you think —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1307"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Mon ami , do you remember the two points I laid stress upon ? Leave the first one for the moment , what was the second ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1308"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ The important fact that<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>wears peculiar clothes , has a black beard , and uses glasses , ”</said>I quoted .</p>
    <p n="1309"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Exactly . Now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>or<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence Cavendish</persName>. Would it be easy ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1310"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ No , ”</said>I said thoughtfully .<said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ Of course an actor —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1311">But<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>cut me short ruthlessly .</p>
    <p n="1312"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And why would it not be easy ? I will tell you , my friend : Because they are both clean-shaven men . To make up successfully as one of these two in broad daylight , it would need an actor of genius , and a certain initial facial resemblance . But in the case of<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>, all that is changed . His clothes , his beard , the glasses which hide his eyes — those are the salient points about his personal appearance . Now , what is the first instinct of the criminal ? To divert suspicion from himself , is it not so ? And how can he best do that ? By throwing it on some one else . In this instance , there was a man ready to his hand . Everybody was predisposed to believe in<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>'s guilt . It was a foregone conclusion that he would be suspected ; but , to make it a sure thing there must be tangible proof — such as the actual buying of the poison , and that , with a man of the peculiar appearance of<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, was not difficult . Remember , this young<persName>Mace</persName>had never actually spoken to<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>. How should he doubt that the man in his clothes , with his beard and his glasses , was not<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1313"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It may be so , ”</said>I said , fascinated by<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s eloquence .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But , if that was the case , why does he not say where he was at six o'clock on Monday evening ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1314"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah , why indeed ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, calming down .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ If he were arrested , he probably would speak , but I do not want it to come to that . I must make him see the gravity of his position . There is , of course , something discreditable behind his silence . If he did not murder his wife , he is , nevertheless , a scoundrel , and has something of his own to conceal , quite apart from the murder . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1315"><said who="#Summerhaye">“ What can it be ? ”</said>I mused , won over to<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s views for the moment , although still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction was the correct one .</p>
    <p n="1316"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Can you not guess ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, smiling .</p>
    <p n="1317"><said who="#Summerhaye">“ No , can you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1318"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Oh , yes , I had a little idea sometime ago — and it has turned out to be correct . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1319"><said who="#Summerhaye">“ You never told me , ”</said>I said reproachfully .</p>
    <p n="1320"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>spread out his hands apologetically .</p>
    <p n="1321"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Pardon me , mon ami , you were not precisely sympathique . ”</said>He turned to me earnestly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Tell me — you see now that he must not be arrested ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1322"><said who="#Alfred_Inglethorp">“ Perhaps , ”</said>I said doubtfully , for I was really quite indifferent to the fate of<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>, and thought that a good fright would do him no harm .</p>
    <p n="1323"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, who was watching me intently , gave a sigh .</p>
    <p n="1324"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Come , my friend , ”</said>he said , changing the subject ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ apart from<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, how did the evidence at the inquest strike you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1325"><said who="#Alfred_Inglethorp">“ Oh , pretty much what I expected . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1326"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Did nothing strike you as peculiar about it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1327">My thoughts flew to<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>, and I hedged :</p>
    <p n="1328"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ In what way ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1329"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Well ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Lawrence_Cavendish">Mr. Lawrence Cavendish</persName>'s evidence for instance ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1330">I was relieved .</p>
    <p n="1331"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>! No , I do n't think so . He 's always a nervous chap . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1332"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ His suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally by means of the tonic she was taking , that did not strike you as strange — hein ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1333"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , I can n't say it did . The doctors ridiculed it of course . But it was quite a natural suggestion for a layman to make . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1334"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ But<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>is not a layman . You told me yourself that he had started by studying medicine , and that he had taken his degree . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1335"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , that 's true . I never thought of that . ”</said>I was rather startled .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It is odd . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1336"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded .</p>
    <p n="1337"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ From the first , his behaviour has been peculiar . Of all the household , he alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine poisoning , and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold strenuously the theory of death from natural causes . If it had been Monsieur<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, I could have understood it . He has no technical knowledge , and is by nature unimaginative . But<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>— no ! And now , to-day , he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have known was ridiculous . There is food for thought in this , mon ami ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1338"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ It 's very confusing , ”</said>I agreed .</p>
    <p n="1339"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Then there is<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>, ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That 's another who is not telling all she knows ! What do you make of her attitude ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1340"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I do n't know what to make of it . It seems inconceivable that she should be shielding<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>. Yet that is what it looks like . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1341"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded reflectively .</p>
    <p n="1342"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , it is queer . One thing is certain , she overheard a good deal more of that ‘ private conversation ’ than she was willing to admit . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1343"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ And yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to eavesdrop ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1344"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Exactly . One thing her evidence has shown me . I made a mistake .<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>was quite right . The quarrel did take place earlier in the afternoon , about four o'clock , as she said . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1345">I looked at him curiously . I had never understood his insistence on that point .</p>
    <p n="1346"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , a good deal that was peculiar came out to-day , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>, now , what was he doing up and dressed at that hour in the morning ? It is astonishing to me that no one commented on the fact . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1347"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ He has insomnia , I believe , ”</said>I said doubtfully .</p>
    <p n="1348"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Which is a very good , or a very bad explanation , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It covers everything , and explains nothing . I shall keep my eye on our clever<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1349"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Any more faults to find with the evidence ? ”</said>I inquired satirically .</p>
    <p n="1350"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Mon ami , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>gravely ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ when you find that people are not telling you the truth — look out ! Now , unless I am much mistaken , at the inquest to-day only one — at most , two persons were speaking the truth without reservation or subterfuge . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1351"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Oh , come now ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>! I wo n't cite<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>, or<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>. But there 's<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>— and<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, surely they were speaking the truth ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1352"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Both of them , my friend ? One , I grant you , but both ——! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1353">His words gave me an unpleasant shock .<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>'s evidence , unimportant as it was , had been given in such a downright straightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her sincerity . Still , I had a great respect for<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s sagacity — except on the occasions when he was what I described to myself as “ foolishly pig-headed . ”</p>
    <p n="1354"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Do you really think so ? ”</said>I asked .<said>“<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>had always seemed to me so essentially honest — almost uncomfortably so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1355"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>gave me a curious look , which I could not quite fathom . He seemed to speak , and then checked himself .</p>
    <p n="1356"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Miss Murdoch too , ”</said>I continued ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ there 's nothing untruthful about her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1357"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ No . But it was strange that she never heard a sound , sleeping next door ; whereas<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>, in the other wing of the building , distinctly heard the table fall . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1358"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , she 's young . And she sleeps soundly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1359"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Ah , yes , indeed ! She must be a famous sleeper , that one ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1360">I did not quite like the tone of his voice , but at that moment a smart knock reached our ears , and looking out of the window we perceived the two detectives waiting for us below .</p>
    <p n="1361"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>seized his hat , gave a ferocious twist to his moustache , and , carefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve , motioned me to precede him down the stairs ; there we joined the detectives and set out for Styles .</p>
    <p n="1362">I think the appearance of the two Scotland Yard men was rather a shock — especially to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, though of course after the verdict , he had realized that it was only a matter of time . Still , the presence of the detectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could have done .</p>
    <p n="1363"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>had conferred with<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>in a low tone on the way up , and it was the latter functionary who requested that the household , with the exception of the servants , should be assembled together in the drawing-room . I realized the significance of this . It was up to<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>to make his boast good .</p>
    <p n="1364">Personally , I was not sanguine .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>might have excellent reasons for his belief in<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>'s innocence , but a man of the type of<persName corresp="#Summerhaye">Summerhaye</persName>would require tangible proofs , and these I doubted if<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>could supply .</p>
    <p n="1365">Before very long we had all trooped into the drawing-room , the door of which<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>closed .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>politely set chairs for every one . The Scotland Yard men were the cynosure of all eyes . I think that for the first time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream , but a tangible reality . We had read of such things — now we ourselves were actors in the drama . To-morrow the daily papers , all over England , would blazon out the news in staring headlines :</p>
    <p n="1366"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ MYSTERIOUS TRAGEDY IN ESSEX ”</said></p>
    <p n="1367"><said who="#Japp">“ WEALTHY LADY POISONED ”</said></p>
    <p n="1368">There would be pictures of Styles , snap-shots of “ The family leaving the Inquest ” — the village photographer had not been idle ! All the things that one had read a hundred times — things that happen to other people , not to oneself . And now , in this house , a murder had been committed . In front of us were “ the detectives in charge of the case . ” The well-known glib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>opened the proceedings .</p>
    <p n="1369">I think every one was a little surprised that it should be he and not one of the official detectives who took the initiative .</p>
    <p n="1370"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Mesdames and messieurs , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, bowing as though he were a celebrity about to deliver a lecture ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I have asked you to come here all together , for a certain object . That object , it concerns Mr.<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1371"><persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>was sitting a little by himself — I think , unconsciously , every one had drawn his chair slightly away from him — and he gave a faint start as<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>pronounced his name .</p>
    <p n="1372"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, addressing him directly ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ a very dark shadow is resting on this house — the shadow of murder . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1373"><persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>shook his head sadly .</p>
    <p n="1374"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ My poor wife , ”</said>he murmured .<said who="#Inglethorp">“ Poor<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>! It is terrible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1375"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do not think , monsieur , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>pointedly ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ that you quite realize how terrible it may be — for you . ”</said>And as<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>did not appear to understand , he added :<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, you are standing in very grave danger . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1376">The two detectives fidgeted . I saw the official caution “ Anything you say will be used in evidence against you , ” actually hovering on<persName corresp="#Summerhaye">Summerhaye</persName>'s lips .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>went on .</p>
    <p n="1377"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Do you understand now , monsieur ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1378"><said who="#Summerhaye">“ No ; What do you mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1379"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I mean , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>deliberately ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ that you are suspected of poisoning your wife . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1380">A little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking .</p>
    <p n="1381"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ Good heavens ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>, starting up .<said who="#Inglethorp">“ What a monstrous idea ! I — poison my dearest<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1382"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do not think ”</said>—<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>watched him narrowly —<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ that you quite realize the unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest .<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, knowing what I have now told you , do you still refuse to say where you were at six o'clock on Monday afternoon ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1383">With a groan ,<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>sank down again and buried his face in his hands .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>approached and stood over him .</p>
    <p n="1384"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Speak ! ”</said>he cried menacingly .</p>
    <p n="1385">With an effort ,<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>raised his face from his hands . Then , slowly and deliberately , he shook his head .</p>
    <p n="1386"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ You will not speak ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1387"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No . I do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me of what you say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1388"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded thoughtfully , like a man whose mind is made up .</p>
    <p n="1389"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Soit ! ”</said>he said .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Then I must speak for you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1390"><persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>sprang up again .</p>
    <p n="1391">“ You ? How can you speak ? You do not know —— ” he broke off abruptly .</p>
    <p n="1392"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>turned to face us .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Mesdames and messieurs ! I speak ! Listen ! I ,<persName corresp="#Hercule_Poirot">Hercule Poirot</persName>, affirm that the man who entered the chemist 's shop , and purchased strychnine at six o'clock on Monday last was not<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, for at six o'clock on that day<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>was escorting<persName>Mrs. Raikes</persName>back to her home from a neighbouring farm . I can produce no less than five witnesses to swear to having seen them together , either at six or just after and , as you may know , the Abbey Farm ,<persName>Mrs. Raikes</persName>'s home , is at least two and a half miles distant from the village . There is absolutely no question as to the alibi ! ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="8">
    <p n="1393">There was a moment 's stupefied silence .<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>, who was the least surprised of any of us , was the first to speak .</p>
    <p n="1394"><said who="#Japp">“ My word , ”</said>he cried ,<said who="#Japp">“ you 're the goods ! And no mistake ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Poirot">Mr. Poirot</persName>! These witnesses of yours are all right , I suppose ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1395"><said who="#Mr._Poirot">“ Voila ! I have prepared a list of them — names and addresses . You must see them , of course . But you will find it all right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1396"><said who="#Japp">“ I 'm sure of that . ”</said><persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>lowered his voice .<said who="#Japp">“ I 'm much obliged to you . A pretty mare 's nest arresting him would have been . ”</said>He turned to<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>.<said who="#Japp">“ But , if you 'll excuse me , sir , why could n't you say all this at the inquest ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1397"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I will tell you why , ”</said>interrupted<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ There was a certain rumour —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1398"><said who="#Alfred_Inglethorp">“ A most malicious and utterly untrue one , ”</said>interrupted<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>in an agitated voice .</p>
    <p n="1399"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>was anxious to have no scandal revived just at present . Am I right ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1400"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ Quite right . ”</said><persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>nodded .<said who="#Inglethorp">“ With my poor<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>not yet buried , can you wonder I was anxious that no more lying rumours should be started . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1401"><said who="#Japp">“ Between you and me , sir , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>,<said who="#Japp">“ I 'd sooner have any amount of rumours than be arrested for murder . And I venture to think your poor lady would have felt the same . And , if it had n't been for<persName corresp="#Mr._Poirot">Mr. Poirot</persName>here , arrested you would have been , as sure as eggs is eggs ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1402"><said who="#Inglethorp">“ I was foolish , no doubt , ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>.<said who="#Inglethorp">“ But you do not know , inspector , how I have been persecuted and maligned . ”</said>And he shot a baleful glance at<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1403"><said who="#Japp">“ Now , sir , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>, turning briskly to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>,<said who="#Japp">“ I should like to see the lady 's bedroom , please , and after that I 'll have a little chat with the servants . Do n't you bother about anything .<persName corresp="#Mr._Poirot">Mr. Poirot</persName>, here , will show me the way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1404">As they all went out of the room ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>turned and made me a sign to follow him upstairs . There he caught me by the arm , and drew me aside .</p>
    <p n="1405"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Quick , go to the other wing . Stand there — just this side of the baize door . Do not move till I come . ”</said>Then , turning rapidly , he rejoined the two detectives .</p>
    <p n="1406">I followed his instructions , taking up my position by the baize door , and wondering what on earth lay behind the request . Why was I to stand in this particular spot on guard ? I looked thoughtfully down the corridor in front of me . An idea struck me . With the exception of<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>Murdoch 's , every one 's room was in this left wing . Had that anything to do with it ? Was I to report who came or went ? I stood faithfully at my post . The minutes passed . Nobody came . Nothing happened .</p>
    <p n="1407">It must have been quite twenty minutes before<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>rejoined me .</p>
    <p n="1408"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You have not stirred ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1409"><said who="#Cynthia">“ No , I 've stuck here like a rock . Nothing 's happened . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1410"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah ! ”</said>Was he pleased , or disappointed ?<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You 've seen nothing at all ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1411"><said who="#Cynthia">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1412"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But you have probably heard something ? A big bump — eh , mon ami ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1413"><said who="#Cynthia">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1414"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Is it possible ? Ah , but I am vexed with myself ! I am not usually clumsy . I made but a slight gesture ”</said>— I know<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s gestures —<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ with the left hand , and over went the table by the bed ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1415">He looked so childishly vexed and crest-fallen that I hastened to console him .</p>
    <p n="1416"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Never mind , old chap . What does it matter ? Your triumph downstairs excited you . I can tell you , that was a surprise to us all . There must be more in this affair of<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>'s with<persName>Mrs. Raikes</persName>than we thought , to make him hold his tongue so persistently . What are you going to do now ? Where are the Scotland Yard fellows ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1417"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Gone down to interview the servants . I showed them all our exhibits . I am disappointed in<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>. He has no method ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1418"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Hullo ! ”</said>I said , looking out of the window .<said who="#Cynthia">“ Here 's<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>. I believe you 're right about that man ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>. I do n't like him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1419"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ He is clever , ”</said>observed<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>meditatively .</p>
    <p n="1420"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Oh , clever as the devil ! I must say I was overjoyed to see him in the plight he was in on Tuesday . You never saw such a spectacle ! ”</said>And I described the doctor 's adventure .<said who="#Cynthia">“ He looked a regular scarecrow ! Plastered with mud from head to foot . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1421"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You saw him , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1422"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Yes . Of course , he did n't want to come in — it was just after dinner — but<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>insisted . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1423"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>caught me violently by the shoulders .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Was<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>here on Tuesday evening ? Here ? And you never told me ? Why did you not tell me ? Why ? Why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1424">He appeared to be in an absolute frenzy .</p>
    <p n="1425"><said>“ My dear<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, ”</said>I expostulated ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I never thought it would interest you . I did n't know it was of any importance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1426"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Importance ? It is of the first importance ! So<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>was here on Tuesday night — the night of the murder .<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>, do you not see ? That alters everything — everything ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1427">I had never seen him so upset . Loosening his hold of me , he mechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks , still murmuring to himself :<said who="#Hastings">“ Yes , that alters everything — everything . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1428">Suddenly he seemed to come to a decision .</p>
    <p n="1429"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Allons ! ”</said>he said .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ We must act at once . Where is<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1430"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>was in the smoking-room .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>went straight to him .</p>
    <p n="1431"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>, I have some important business in Tadminster . A new clue . May I take your motor ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1432"><said who="#Mr._Cavendish">“ Why , of course . Do you mean at once ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1433"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ If you please . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1434"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>rang the bell , and ordered round the car . In another ten minutes , we were racing down the park and along the high road to Tadminster .</p>
    <p n="1435"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Now ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, ”</said>I remarked resignedly ,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ perhaps you will tell me what all this is about ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1436"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , mon ami , a good deal you can guess for yourself . Of course you realize that , now<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>is out of it , the whole position is greatly changed . We are face to face with an entirely new problem . We know now that there is one person who did not buy the poison . We have cleared away the manufactured clues . Now for the real ones . I have ascertained that anyone in the household , with the exception of<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>, who was playing tennis with you , could have personated<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>on Monday evening . In the same way , we have his statement that he put the coffee down in the hall . No one took much notice of that at the inquest — but now it has a very different significance . We must find out who did take that coffee to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>eventually , or who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there . From your account , there are only two people whom we can positively say did not go near the coffee —<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1437"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Yes , that is so . ”</said>I felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>could certainly not rest under suspicion .</p>
    <p n="1438"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ In clearing<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>, ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>,<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I have been obliged to show my hand sooner than I intended . As long as I might be thought to be pursuing him , the criminal would be off his guard . Now , he will be doubly careful . Yes — doubly careful . ”</said>He turned to me abruptly .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Tell me ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>, you yourself — have you no suspicions of anybody ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1439">I hesitated . To tell the truth , an idea , wild and extravagant in itself , had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain . I had rejected it as absurd , nevertheless it persisted .</p>
    <p n="1440"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You could n't call it a suspicion , ”</said>I murmured .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It 's so utterly foolish . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1441"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Come now , ”</said>urged<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>encouragingly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Do not fear . Speak your mind . You should always pay attention to your instincts . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1442"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Well then , ”</said>I blurted out ,<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ it 's absurd — but I suspect<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>of not telling all she knows ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1443"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1444"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes — you 'll laugh at me —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1445"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Not at all . Why should I ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1446"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I can n't help feeling , ”</said>I continued blunderingly ;<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ that we 've rather left her out of the possible suspects , simply on the strength of her having been away from the place . But , after all , she was only fifteen miles away . A car would do it in half an hour . Can we say positively that she was away from Styles on the night of the murder ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1447"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , my friend , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>unexpectedly ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ we can . One of my first actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1448"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Well ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1449"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , I learnt that<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>had been on afternoon duty on Tuesday , and that — a convoy coming in unexpectedly — she had kindly offered to remain on night duty , which offer was gratefully accepted . That disposes of that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1450"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Oh ! ”</said>I said , rather nonplussed .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Really , ”</said>I continued ,<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ it 's her extraordinary vehemence against<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>that started me off suspecting her . I can n't help feeling she 'd do anything against him . And I had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the will . She might have burnt the new one , mistaking it for the earlier one in his favour . She is so terribly bitter against him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1451"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You consider her vehemence unnatural ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1452"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Y — es . She is so very violent . I wondered really whether she is quite sane on that point . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1453"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shook his head energetically .</p>
    <p n="1454"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , no , you are on a wrong tack there . There is nothing weak-minded or degenerate about<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>. She is an excellent specimen of well-balanced English beef and brawn . She is sanity itself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1455"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Yet her hatred of<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>seems almost a mania . My idea was — a very ridiculous one , no doubt — that she had intended to poison him — and that , in some way ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>got hold of it by mistake . But I do n't at all see how it could have been done . The whole thing is absurd and ridiculous to the last degree . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1456"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Still you are right in one thing . It is always wise to suspect everybody until you can prove logically , and to your own satisfaction , that they are innocent . Now , what reasons are there against<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>'s having deliberately poisoned<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1457"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Why , she was devoted to her ! ”</said>I exclaimed .</p>
    <p n="1458"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Tcha ! Tcha ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>irritably .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You argue like a child . If<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>were capable of poisoning the old lady , she would be quite equally capable of simulating devotion . No , we must look elsewhere . You are perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>is too violent to be natural ; but you are quite wrong in the deduction you draw from it . I have drawn my own deductions , which I believe to be correct , but I will not speak of them at present . ”</said>He paused a minute , then went on .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Now , to my way of thinking , there is one insuperable objection to<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>'s being the murderess . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1459"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ And that is ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1460"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That in no possible way could<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s death benefit<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>. Now there is no murder without a motive . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1461">I reflected .</p>
    <p n="1462"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Could not<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>have made a will in her favour ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shook his head .</p>
    <p n="1463"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ But you yourself suggested that possibility to<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1464"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>smiled .</p>
    <p n="1465"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That was for a reason . I did not want to mention the name of the person who was actually in my mind .<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>occupied very much the same position , so I used her name instead . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1466"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Still ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>might have done so . Why , that will , made on the afternoon of her death may —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1467">But<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s shake of the head was so energetic that I stopped .</p>
    <p n="1468"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , my friend . I have certain little ideas of my own about that will . But I can tell you this much — it was not in<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>'s favour . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1469">I accepted his assurance , though I did not really see how he could be so positive about the matter .</p>
    <p n="1470"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , ”</said>I said , with a sigh ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ we will acquit<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, then . It is partly your fault that I ever came to suspect her . It was what you said about her evidence at the inquest that set me off . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1471"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>looked puzzled .</p>
    <p n="1472"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What did I say about her evidence at the inquest ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1473"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Do n't you remember ? When I cited her and<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>as being above suspicion ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1474"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Oh — ah — yes . ”</said>He seemed a little confused , but recovered himself .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ By the way ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>, there is something I want you to do for me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1475"><said who="#Hastings">“ Certainly . What is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1476">“ Next time you happen to be alone with<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence Cavendish</persName>, I want you to say this to him . ‘ I have a message for you , from<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>. He says :<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Find the extra coffee-cup , and you can rest in peace ! " ’ Nothing more . Nothing less . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1477"><said who="#Hastings">“ ‘ Find the extra coffee-cup , and you can rest in peace . ’ Is that right ? ”</said>I asked , much mystified .</p>
    <p n="1478"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Excellent . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1479"><said who="#Hastings">“ But what does it mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1480"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah , that I will leave you to find out . You have access to the facts . Just say that to him , and see what he says . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1481"><said who="#Hastings">“ Very well — but it 's all extremely mysterious . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1482">We were running into Tadminster now , and<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>directed the car to the “ Analytical Chemist . ”</p>
    <p n="1483"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>hopped down briskly , and went inside . In a few minutes he was back again .</p>
    <p n="1484"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ There , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That is all my business . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1485"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What were you doing there ? ”</said>I asked , in lively curiosity .</p>
    <p n="1486"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I left something to be analysed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1487"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes , but what ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1488"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ The sample of coco I took from the saucepan in the bedroom . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1489"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ But that has already been tested ! ”</said>I cried , stupefied .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>had it tested , and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there being strychnine in it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1490"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I know<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>had it tested , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>quietly .</p>
    <p n="1491"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Well , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1492"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , I have a fancy for having it analysed again , that is all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1493">And not another word on the subject could I drag out of him .</p>
    <p n="1494">This proceeding of<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s , in respect of the coco , puzzled me intensely . I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it . However , my confidence in him , which at one time had rather waned , was fully restored since his belief in<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>'s innocence had been so triumphantly vindicated .</p>
    <p n="1495">The funeral of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>took place the following day , and on Monday , as I came down to a late breakfast ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>drew me aside , and informed me that<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>was leaving that morning , to take up his quarters at the Stylites Arms until he should have completed his plans .</p>
    <p n="1496"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And really it 's a great relief to think he 's going ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>, ”</said>continued my honest friend .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It was bad enough before , when we thought he 'd done it , but I 'm hanged if it is n't worse now , when we all feel guilty for having been so down on the fellow . The fact is , we 've treated him abominably . Of course , things did look black against him . I do n't see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we did . Still , there it is , we were in the wrong , and now there 's a beastly feeling that one ought to make amends ; which is difficult , when one does n't like the fellow a bit better than one did before . The whole thing 's damned awkward ! And I 'm thankful he 's had the tact to take himself off . It 's a good thing Styles was n't the mater 's to leave to him . Could n't bear to think of the fellow lording it here . He 's welcome to her money . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1497"><said who="#Hastings">“ You 'll be able to keep up the place all right ? ”</said>I asked .</p>
    <p n="1498"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Oh , yes . There are the death duties , of course , but half my father 's money goes with the place , and<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>will stay with us for the present , so there is his share as well . We shall be pinched at first , of course , because , as I once told you , I am in a bit of a hole financially myself . Still , the Johnnies will wait now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1499">In the general relief at<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>'s approaching departure , we had the most genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy .<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>, whose young spirits were naturally buoyant , was looking quite her pretty self again , and we all , with the exception of<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>, who seemed unalterably gloomy and nervous , were quietly cheerful , at the opening of a new and hopeful future .</p>
    <p n="1500">The papers , of course , had been full of the tragedy . Glaring headlines , sandwiched biographies of every member of the household , subtle innuendoes , the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue . Nothing was spared us . It was a slack time . The war was momentarily inactive , and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in fashionable life : “ The Mysterious Affair at Styles ” was the topic of the moment .</p>
    <p n="1501">Naturally it was very annoying for the Cavendishes . The house was constantly besieged by reporters , who were consistently denied admission , but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds , where they lay in wait with cameras , for any unwary members of the household . We all lived in a blast of publicity . The Scotland Yard men came and went , examining , questioning , lynx-eyed and reserved of tongue . Towards what end they were working , we did not know . Had they any clue , or would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crimes ?</p>
    <p n="1502">After breakfast ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>came up to me rather mysteriously , and asked if she might have a few words with me .</p>
    <p n="1503"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Certainly . What is it ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1504"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Well , it 's just this , sir . You 'll be seeing the Belgian gentleman to-day perhaps ? ”</said>I nodded .<said who="#Dorcas">“ Well , sir , you know how he asked me so particular if the mistress , or anyone else , had a green dress ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1505"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes , yes . You have found one ? ”</said>My interest was aroused .</p>
    <p n="1506"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No , not that , sir . But since then I 've remembered what the young gentlemen ”</said>—<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>and<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>were still the “ young gentlemen ” to<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>—<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ call the ‘ dressing-up box . ’ It 's up in the front attic , sir . A great chest , full of old clothes and fancy dresses , and what not . And it came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst them . So , if you 'd tell the Belgian gentleman —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1507"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I will tell him ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, ”</said>I promised .</p>
    <p n="1508"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Thank you very much , sir . A very nice gentleman he is , sir . And quite a different class from them two detectives from London , what goes prying about , and asking questions . I do n't hold with foreigners as a rule , but from what the newspapers say I make out as how these brave Belges is n't the ordinary run of foreigners , and certainly he 's a most polite spoken gentleman . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1509">Dear old<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>! As she stood there , with her honest face upturned to mine , I thought what a fine specimen she was of the old-fashioned servant that is so fast dying out .</p>
    <p n="1510">I thought I might as well go down to the village at once , and look up<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>; but I met him half-way , coming up to the house , and at once gave him<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>'s message .</p>
    <p n="1511"><said>“ Ah , the brave<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>! We will look at the chest , although — but no matter — we will examine it all the same . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1512">We entered the house by one of the windows . There was no one in the hall , and we went straight up to the attic .</p>
    <p n="1513">Sure enough , there was the chest , a fine old piece , all studded with brass nails , and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of garment .</p>
    <p n="1514"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony . There were one or two green fabrics of varying shades ; but<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shook his head over them all . He seemed somewhat apathetic in the search , as though he expected no great results from it . Suddenly he gave an exclamation .</p>
    <p n="1515"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1516"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Look ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1517">The chest was nearly empty , and there , reposing right at the bottom , was a magnificent black beard .</p>
    <p n="1518"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Oho ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Oho ! ”</said>He turned it over in his hands , examining it closely .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ New , ”</said>he remarked .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , quite new . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1519">After a moment 's hesitation , he replaced it in the chest , heaped all the other things on top of it as before , and made his way briskly downstairs . He went straight to the pantry , where we found<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>busily polishing her silver .</p>
    <p n="1520"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>wished her good morning with Gallic politeness , and went on :</p>
    <p n="1521"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ We have been looking through that chest ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>. I am much obliged to you for mentioning it . There is , indeed , a fine collection there . Are they often used , may I ask ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1522"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , sir , not very often nowadays , though from time to time we do have what the young gentlemen call ‘ a dress-up night . ’ And very funny it is sometimes , sir . Mr.<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>, he 's wonderful . Most comic ! I shall never forget the night he came down as the Char of Persia , I think he called it — a sort of Eastern King it was . He had the big paper knife in his hand , and ‘ Mind ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, ’ he says , ‘ you 'll have to be very respectful . This is my specially sharpened scimitar , and it 's off with your head if I 'm at all displeased with you ! ’ Miss<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>, she was what they call an Apache , or some such name — a Frenchified sort of cut-throat , I take it to be . A real sight she looked . You 'd never have believed a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into such a ruffian . Nobody would have known her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1523"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ These evenings must have been great fun , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>genially .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I suppose Mr.<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs , when he was Shah of Persia ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1524"><said who="#Dorcas">“ He did have a beard , sir , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, smiling .<said who="#Dorcas">“ And well I know it , for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with ! And I 'm sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance . I did n't know as there was a beard up there at all . It must have been got quite lately , I think . There was a red wig , I know , but nothing else in the way of hair . Burnt corks they use mostly — though ‘ tis messy getting it off again . Miss<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>was a nigger once , and , oh , the trouble she had . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1525"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ So<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>knows nothing about that black beard , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>thoughtfully , as we walked out into the hall again .</p>
    <p n="1526"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Do you think it is the one ? ”</said>I whispered eagerly .</p>
    <p n="1527"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded .</p>
    <p n="1528"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do . You notice it had been trimmed ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1529"><said who="#Dorcas">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1530"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes . It was cut exactly the shape of<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>'s , and I found one or two snipped hairs .<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>, this affair is very deep . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1531"><said who="#Hastings">“ Who put it in the chest , I wonder ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1532"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Some one with a good deal of intelligence , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>dryly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You realize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its presence would not be remarked ? Yes , he is intelligent . But we must be more intelligent . We must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us of being intelligent at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1533">I acquiesced .</p>
    <p n="1534"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ There , mon ami , you will be of great assistance to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1535">I was pleased with the compliment . There had been times when I hardly thought that<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>appreciated me at my true worth .</p>
    <p n="1536"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , ”</said>he continued , staring at me thoughtfully ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ you will be invaluable . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1537">This was naturally gratifying , but<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s next words were not so welcome .</p>
    <p n="1538"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I must have an ally in the house , ”</said>he observed reflectively .</p>
    <p n="1539"><said who="#Dorcas">“ You have me , ”</said>I protested .</p>
    <p n="1540"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ True , but you are not sufficient . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1541">I was hurt , and showed it .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>hurried to explain himself .</p>
    <p n="1542"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You do not quite take my meaning . You are known to be working with me . I want somebody who is not associated with us in any way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1543"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Oh , I see . How about<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1544"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , I think not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1545"><said who="#Dorcas">“ The dear fellow is n't perhaps very bright , ”</said>I said thoughtfully .</p>
    <p n="1546"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Here comes<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>suddenly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ She is the very person . But I am in her black books , since I cleared<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>. Still , we can but try . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1547">With a nod that was barely civil ,<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>assented to<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s request for a few minutes ’ conversation .</p>
    <p n="1548">We went into the little morning-room , and<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>closed the door .</p>
    <p n="1549"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Well ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>impatiently ,<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ what is it ? Out with it . I 'm busy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1550"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Do you remember , mademoiselle , that I once asked you to help me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1551"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes , I do . ”</said>The lady nodded .<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ And I told you I 'd help you with pleasure — to hang<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1552"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>studied her seriously .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, I will ask you one question . I beg of you to reply to it truthfully . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1555"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ What do you mean ? ”</said>she asked sharply .<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ You need n't think your pretty explanations influence me in the slightest . I 'll admit that it was n't he who bought strychnine at the chemist 's shop . What of that ? I dare say he soaked fly paper , as I told you at the beginning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1556"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That is arsenic — not strychnine , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>mildly .</p>
    <p n="1557"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ What does that matter ? Arsenic would put poor<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>out of the way just as well as strychnine . If I 'm convinced he did it , it does n't matter a jot to me how he did it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1558"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Exactly . If you are convinced he did it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>quietly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I will put my question in another form .

    <p n="1562"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, do you remember a conversation that took place on the day of my friend 's arrival here ? He repeated it to me , and there is a sentence of yours that has impressed me very much . Do you remember affirming that if a crime had been committed , and anyone you loved had been murdered , you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the criminal was , even if you were quite unable to prove it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1563"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes , I remember saying that . I believe it too . I suppose you think it nonsense ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1564"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Not at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1565"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ And yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1566"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>curtly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Because your instinct is not against<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1567"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ What ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1568"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No . You wish to believe he committed the crime . You believe him capable of committing it . But your instinct tells you he did not commit it . It tells you more — shall I go on ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1569">She was staring at him , fascinated , and made a slight affirmative movement of the hand .</p>
    <p n="1570"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Shall I tell you why you have been so vehement against<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>? It is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe . It is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct , which tells you another name —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1571"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ No , no , no ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>wildly , flinging up her hands .<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Do n't say it !

    <p n="1581"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You will watch ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1582"><persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>bowed her head .</p>

    <p n="1586"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Come now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1587"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ It could be hushed up . ”</said></p>

And she is on the side of Justice ! Let the cost be what it may . ”</said>And with these words , she walked firmly out of the room .</p>
    <p n="1593"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ There , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, looking after her ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ goes a very valuable ally .

    <p n="1594">I did not reply .</p>

    <p n="1597"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Really ? Is that so , mon ami ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1598"><said who="#Emily">“ Yes . Enlighten me , will you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1599"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>studied me attentively for a moment or two . Then , to my intense surprise , he shook his head decidedly .</p>
    <p n="1600"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , my friend . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1601"><said who="#Emily">“ Oh , look here , why not ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1602"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Two is enough for a secret . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1603"><said who="#Emily">“ Well , I think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1604"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I am not keeping back facts . Every fact that I know is in your possession . You can draw your own deductions from them . This time it is a question of ideas . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1605"><said who="#Emily">“ Still , it would be interesting to know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1606"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>looked at me very earnestly , and again shook his head .</p>
    <p n="1607"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You see , ”</said>he said sadly ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ you have no instincts . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1608"><said who="#Emily">“ It was intelligence you were requiring just now , ”</said>I pointed out .</p>
    <p n="1609"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ The two often go together , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>enigmatically .</p>
    <p n="1610">The remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that I did not even take the trouble to answer it .

    <p n="1611">There are times when it is one 's duty to assert oneself .</p>

    <p n="1612">I HAD had no opportunity as yet of passing on<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s message to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>. But now , as I strolled out on the lawn , still nursing a grudge against my friend 's high-handedness , I saw<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>on the croquet lawn , aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about , with a still more ancient mallet .</p>
    <p n="1613">It struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message . Otherwise ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>himself might relieve me of it . It was true that I did not quite gather its purport , but I flattered myself that by<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>'s reply , and perhaps a little skillful cross-examination on my part , I should soon perceive its significance . Accordingly I accosted him .</p>
    <p n="1614"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I 've been looking for you , ”</said>I remarked untruthfully .</p>
    <p n="1615"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Have you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1616"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes . The truth is , I 've got a message for you — from<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1617"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1618"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ He told me to wait until I was alone with you , ”</said>I said , dropping my voice significantly , and watching him intently out of the corner of my eye . I have always been rather good at what is called , I believe , creating an atmosphere .</p>
    <p n="1619"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1620">There was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face . Had he any idea of what I was about to say ?</p>
    <p n="1621"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ This is the message . ”</said>I dropped my voice still lower .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ ‘ Find the extra coffee-cup , and you can rest in peace . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="1622"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What on earth does he mean ? ”</said><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>stared at me in quite unaffected astonishment .</p>
    <p n="1623"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Do n't you know ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1624"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Not in the least . Do you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1625">I was compelled to shake my head .</p>
    <p n="1626"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What extra coffee-cup ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1627"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do n't know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1628"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ He 'd better ask<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, or one of the maids , if he wants to know about coffee-cups . It 's their business , not mine . I do n't know anything about the coffee-cups , except that we 've got some that are never used , which are a perfect dream ! Old Worcester . You 're not a connoisseur , are you ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1629">I shook my head .</p>
    <p n="1630"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ You miss a lot . A really perfect bit of old china — it 's pure delight to handle it , or even to look at it . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1632"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Tell him I do n't know what he 's talking about . It 's double Dutch to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1633"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ All right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1634">I was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me back .</p>

    <p n="1636"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ ‘ Find the extra coffee-cup , and you can rest in peace . ’ Are you sure you do n't know what it means ? ”</said>I asked him earnestly .</p>

    <p n="1638"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No , ”</said>he said musingly ,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I do n't . I — I wish I did . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1639">The boom of the gong sounded from the house , and we went in together .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>had been asked by<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>to remain to lunch , and was already seated at the table .</p>
    <p n="1640">By tacit consent , all mention of the tragedy was barred . We conversed on the war , and other outside topics . But after the cheese and biscuits had been handed round , and<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>had left the room ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>suddenly leant forward to<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1641"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Pardon me , madame , for recalling unpleasant memories , but I have a little idea ”</said>—<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s “ little ideas ” were becoming a perfect byword —<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ and would like to ask one or two questions . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1644"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Certainly it was bolted , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>, rather surprised .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I said so at the inquest . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1645"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Bolted ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1646"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Yes . ”</said>She looked perplexed .</p>
    <p n="1647"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I mean , ”</said>explained<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ you are sure it was bolted , and not merely locked ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1648"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Oh , I see what you mean . No , I do n't know . I said bolted , meaning that it was fastened , and I could not open it , but I believe all the doors were found bolted on the inside . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1649"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Still , as far as you are concerned , the door might equally well have been locked ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1650"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Oh , yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1651"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You yourself did not happen to notice , madame , when you entered<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s room , whether that door was bolted or not ? ”</said></p>

    <p n="1655"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ But I did , ”</said>interrupted<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>suddenly .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I happened to notice that it was bolted . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1656"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah , that settles it . ”</said>And<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>looked crestfallen .</p>
    <p n="1657">I could not help rejoicing that , for once , one of his “ little ideas ” had come to naught .</p>
    <p n="1658">After lunch<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>begged me to accompany him home . I consented rather stiffly .</p>
    <p n="1659"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You are annoyed , is it not so ? ”</said>he asked anxiously , as we walked through the park .</p>
    <p n="1660"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Not at all , ”</said>I said coldly .</p>
    <p n="1661"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That is well . That lifts a great load from my mind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1662">This was not quite what I had intended . I had hoped that he would have observed the stiffness of my manner . Still , the fervour of his words went towards the appeasing of my just displeasure . I thawed .</p>
    <p n="1663"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I gave<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>your message , ”</said>I said .</p>
    <p n="1664"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ And what did he say ? He was entirely puzzled ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1665"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes . I am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1666">I had expected<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>to be disappointed ; but , to my surprise , he replied that that was as he had thought , and that he was very glad . My pride forbade me to ask any questions .</p>
    <p n="1667"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>switched off on another tack .</p>
    <p n="1668"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>was not at lunch to-day ? How was that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1669"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ She is at the hospital again . She resumed work to-day . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1670"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah , she is an industrious little demoiselle . And pretty too . She is like pictures I have seen in Italy . I would rather like to see that dispensary of hers . Do you think she would show it to me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1671"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I am sure she would be delighted . It 's an interesting little place . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1672"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Does she go there every day ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1673"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ She has all Wednesdays off , and comes back to lunch on Saturdays . Those are her only times off . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1674"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I will remember . Women are doing great work nowadays , and<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>is clever — oh , yes , she has brains , that little one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1675"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes . I believe she has passed quite a stiff exam . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1676"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Without doubt . After all , it is very responsible work . I suppose they have very strong poisons there ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1677"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes , she showed them to us . They are kept locked up in a little cupboard . I believe they have to be very careful . They always take out the key before leaving the room . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1678"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Indeed . It is near the window , this cupboard ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1679"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No , right the other side of the room . Why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1680"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shrugged his shoulders .</p>
    <p n="1681"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I wondered . That is all . Will you come in ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1682">We had reached the cottage .</p>
    <p n="1683"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No . I think I 'll be getting back . I shall go round the long way through the woods . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1684">The woods round Styles were very beautiful . After the walk across the open park , it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades . There was hardly a breath of wind , the very chirp of the birds was faint and subdued . I strolled on a little way , and finally flung myself down at the foot of a grand old beech-tree . My thoughts of mankind were kindly and charitable . I even forgave<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>for his absurd secrecy . In fact , I was at peace with the world . Then I yawned .</p>
    <p n="1685">I thought about the crime , and it struck me as being very unreal and far off .</p>
    <p n="1686">I yawned again .</p>
    <p n="1687">Probably , I thought , it really never happened . Of course , it was all a bad dream . The truth of the matter was that it was<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>who had murdered<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>with a croquet mallet . But it was absurd of<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>to make such a fuss about it , and to go shouting out :<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I tell you I wo n't have it ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1688">I woke up with a start .</p>
    <p n="1689">At once I realized that I was in a very awkward predicament . For , about twelve feet away from me ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>were standing facing each other , and they were evidently quarrelling . And , quite as evidently , they were unaware of my vicinity , for before I could move or speak<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream .</p>
    <p n="1690"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I tell you ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>, I wo n't have it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1691"><persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>'s voice came , cool and liquid :</p>
    <p n="1692"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Have you any right to criticize my actions ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1693"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ It will be the talk of the village ! My mother was only buried on Saturday , and here you are gadding about with the fellow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1694"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Oh , ”</said>she shrugged her shoulders ,<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ if it is only village gossip that you mind ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1695"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ But it is n't . I 've had enough of the fellow hanging about . He 's a Polish Jew , anyway . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1696"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ A tinge of Jewish blood is not a bad thing . It leavens the ”</said>— she looked at him —<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ stolid stupidity of the ordinary Englishman . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1697">Fire in her eyes , ice in her voice . I did not wonder that the blood rose to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s face in a crimson tide .</p>
    <p n="1698"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1699"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Well ? ”</said>Her tone did not change .</p>
    <p n="1700">The pleading died out of his voice .</p>
    <p n="1701"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Am I to understand that you will continue to see<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>against my express wishes ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1702"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ If I choose . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1703"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ You defy me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1704"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No , but I deny your right to criticize my actions . Have you no friends of whom I should disapprove ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1705"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>fell back a pace . The colour ebbed slowly from his face .</p>
    <p n="1706"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What do you mean ? ”</said>he said , in an unsteady voice .</p>
    <p n="1707"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ You see ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>quietly .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ You do see , do n't you , that you have no right to dictate to me as to the choice of my friends ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1708"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>glanced at her pleadingly , a stricken look on his face .</p>
    <p n="1709"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No right ? Have I no right ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>? ”</said>he said unsteadily . He stretched out his hands .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>—— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1710">For a moment , I thought she wavered . A softer expression came over her face , then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away .</p>
    <p n="1711"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ None ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1712">She was walking away when<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>sprang after her , and caught her by the arm .</p>
    <p n="1713"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>”</said>— his voice was very quiet now —<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ are you in love with this fellow<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1714">She hesitated , and suddenly there swept across her face a strange expression , old as the hills , yet with something eternally young about it . So might some Egyptian sphinx have smiled .</p>
    <p n="1715">She freed herself quietly from his arm , and spoke over her shoulder .</p>
    <p n="1716"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Perhaps , ”</said>she said ; and then swiftly passed out of the little glade , leaving<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>standing there as though he had been turned to stone .</p>
    <p n="1717">Rather ostentatiously , I stepped forward , crackling some dead branches with my feet as I did so .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>turned . Luckily , he took it for granted that I had only just come upon the scene .</p>
    <p n="1718"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Hullo ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>. Have you seen the little fellow safely back to his cottage ? Quaint little chap ! Is he any good , though , really ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1719"><said who="#Hastings">“ He was considered one of the finest detectives of his day . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1720"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Oh , well , I suppose there must be something in it , then . What a rotten world it is , though ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1721"><said who="#Hastings">“ You find it so ? ”</said>I asked .</p>
    <p n="1722"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Good Lord , yes ! There 's this terrible business to start with . Scotland Yard men in and out of the house like a jack-in-the-box ! Never know where they wo n't turn up next . Screaming headlines in every paper in the country — damn all journalists , I say ! Do you know there was a whole crowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning . Sort of Madame Tussaud 's chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing . Pretty thick , is n't it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1723"><said who="#Hastings">“ Cheer up ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>! ”</said>I said soothingly .<said who="#Hastings">“ It can n't last for ever . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1724"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Ca n't it , though ? It can last long enough for us never to be able to hold up our heads again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1725"><said who="#Hastings">“ No , no , you 're getting morbid on the subject . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1726"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Enough to make a man morbid , to be stalked by beastly journalists and stared at by gaping moon-faced idiots , wherever he goes ! But there 's worse than that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1727"><said who="#Hastings">“ What ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1728"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>lowered his voice :</p>
    <p n="1729"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Have you ever thought ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>— it 's a nightmare to me — who did it ? I can n't help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident . Because — because — who could have done it ? Now<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>'s out of the way , there 's no one else ; no one , I mean , except — one of us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1730">Yes , indeed , that was nightmare enough for any man ! One of us ? Yes , surely it must be so , unless —— -</p>
    <p n="1731">A new idea suggested itself to my mind . Rapidly , I considered it . The light increased .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s mysterious doings , his hints — they all fitted in . Fool that I was not to have thought of this possibility before , and what a relief for us all .</p>
    <p n="1732"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ it is n't one of us . How could it be ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1733"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I know , but , still , who else is there ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1734"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ca n't you guess ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1735"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1736">I looked cautiously round , and lowered my voice .</p>
    <p n="1737"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>! ”</said>I whispered .</p>
    <p n="1738"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ Impossible ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1739"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Not at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1740"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ But what earthly interest could he have in my mother 's death ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1741"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That I do n't see , ”</said>I confessed ,<said>“ but I 'll tell you this :<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>thinks so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1742"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>? Does he ? How do you know ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1743">I told him of<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s intense excitement on hearing that<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>had been at Styles on the fatal night , and added :</p>
    <p n="1744"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ He said twice : ‘ That alters everything . ’ And I 've been thinking . You know<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>said he had put down the coffee in the hall ? Well , it was just then that<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>arrived . Is n't it possible that , as<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>brought him through the hall , the doctor dropped something into the coffee in passing ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1745"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ H 'm , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ It would have been very risky . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1746"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ Yes , but it was possible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1747"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ And then , how could he know it was her coffee ? No , old fellow , I do n't think that will wash . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1748">But I had remembered something else .</p>
    <p n="1749"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You 're quite right . That was n't how it was done . Listen . ”</said>And I then told him of the coco sample which<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>had taken to be analysed .</p>
    <p n="1750"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>interrupted just as I had done .</p>
    <p n="1751"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ But , look here ,<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>had had it analysed already ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1752"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes , yes , that 's the point . I did n't see it either until now . Do n't you understand ?<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>had it analysed — that 's just it ! If<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>'s the murderer , nothing could be simpler than for him to substitute some ordinary coco for his sample , and send that to be tested . And of course they would find no strychnine ! But no one would dream of suspecting<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>, or think of taking another sample — except<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, ”</said>I added , with belated recognition .</p>
    <p n="1753"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , but what about the bitter taste that coco wo n't disguise ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1754"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Well , we 've only his word for that . And there are other possibilities . He 's admittedly one of the world 's greatest toxicologists —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1755"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ One of the world 's greatest what ? Say it again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1756"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ He knows more about poisons than almost anybody , ”</said>I explained .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Well , my idea is , that perhaps he 's found some way of making strychnine tasteless . Or it may not have been strychnine at all , but some obscure drug no one has ever heard of , which produces much the same symptoms . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1757"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ H 'm , yes , that might be , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ But look here , how could he have got at the coco ? That was n't downstairs ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1758"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , it was n't , ”</said>I admitted reluctantly .</p>
    <p n="1759">And then , suddenly , a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind . I hoped and prayed it would not occur to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>also . I glanced sideways at him . He was frowning perplexedly , and I drew a deep breath of relief , for the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this : that<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>might have had an accomplice .</p>
    <p n="1760">Yet surely it could not be ! Surely no woman as beautiful as<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>could be a murderess . Yet beautiful women had been known to poison .</p>
    <p n="1761">And suddenly I remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of my arrival , and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a woman 's weapon . How agitated she had been on that fatal Tuesday evening ! Had<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>discovered something between her and<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>, and threatened to tell her husband ? Was it to stop that denunciation that the crime had been committed ?</p>
    <p n="1762">Then I remembered that enigmatical conversation between<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>and<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>. Was this what they had meant ? Was this the monstrous possibility that Evelyn had tried not to believe ?</p>
    <p n="1763">Yes , it all fitted in .</p>
    <p n="1764">No wonder<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>had suggested “ hushing it up . ” Now I understood that unfinished sentence of hers : “<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>herself —— ” And in my heart I agreed with her . Would not<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>have preferred to go unavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name of<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Cavendish</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1765"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ There 's another thing , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>suddenly , and the unexpected sound of his voice made me start guiltily .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Something which makes me doubt if what you say can be true . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1766"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ What 's that ? ”</said>I asked , thankful that he had gone away from the subject of how the poison could have been introduced into the coco .</p>
    <p n="1767"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Why , the fact that<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>demanded a post-mortem . He need n't have done so . Little<persName>Wilkins</persName>would have been quite content to let it go at heart disease . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1768"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Yes , ”</said>I said doubtfully .<said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ But we do n't know . Perhaps he thought it safer in the long run . Some one might have talked afterwards . Then the Home Office might have ordered exhumation . The whole thing would have come out , then , and he would have been in an awkward position , for no one would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been deceived into calling it heart disease . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1769"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes , that 's possible , ”</said>admitted<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>.<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Still , ”</said>he added ,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I 'm blest if I can see what his motive could have been . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1770">I trembled .</p>
    <p n="1771"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Look here , ”</said>I said ,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I may be altogether wrong . And , remember , all this is in confidence . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1772"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Oh , of course — that goes without saying . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1773">We had walked , as we talked , and now we passed through the little gate into the garden . Voices rose near at hand , for tea was spread out under the sycamore-tree , as it had been on the day of my arrival .</p>
    <p n="1774"><persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>was back from the hospital , and I placed my chair beside her , and told her of<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s wish to visit the dispensary .</p>
    <p n="1775"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Of course ! I 'd love him to see it . He 'd better come to tea there one day . I must fix it up with him . He 's such a dear little man ! But he is funny . He made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day , and put it in again , because he said it was n't straight . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1776">I laughed .</p>
    <p n="1777"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It 's quite a mania with him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1778"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Yes , is n't it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1779">We were silent for a minute or two , and then , glancing in the direction of<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>, and dropping her voice ,<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>said :</p>
    <p n="1780"><said who="#Cynthia">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1781"><said who="#Mr._Hastings">“ Yes ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1782"><said who="#Cynthia">“ After tea , I want to talk to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1783">Her glance at<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>had set me thinking . I fancied that between these two there existed very little sympathy . For the first time , it occurred to me to wonder about the girl 's future .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>had made no provisions of any kind for her , but I imagined that<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>would probably insist on her making her home with them — at any rate until the end of the war .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, I knew , was very fond of her , and would be sorry to let her go .</p>
    <p n="1784"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, who had gone into the house , now reappeared . His good-natured face wore an unaccustomed frown of anger .</p>
    <p n="1785"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Confound those detectives ! I can n't think what they 're after ! They 've been in every room in the house — turning things inside out , and upside down . It really is too bad ! I suppose they took advantage of our all being out . I shall go for that fellow<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>, when I next see him ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1786"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Lot of Paul Prys , ”</said>grunted<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1787"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>opined that they had to make a show of doing something .</p>
    <p n="1788"><persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>said nothing .</p>
    <p n="1789">After tea , I invited<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>to come for a walk , and we sauntered off into the woods together .</p>
    <p n="1790"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Well ? ”</said>I inquired , as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by the leafy screen .</p>
    <p n="1791">With a sigh ,<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>flung herself down , and tossed off her hat . The sunlight , piercing through the branches , turned the auburn of her hair to quivering gold .</p>
    <p n="1792"><said who="#Cynthia">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>— you are always so kind , and you know such a lot . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1793">It struck me at this moment that<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>was really a very charming girl ! Much more charming than<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>, who never said things of that kind .</p>
    <p n="1794"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Well ? ”</said>I asked benignantly , as she hesitated .</p>
    <p n="1795"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I want to ask your advice . What shall I do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1796"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1797"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Yes . You see , Aunt<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>always told me I should be provided for . I suppose she forgot , or did n't think she was likely to die — anyway , I am not provided for ! And I do n't know what to do . Do you think I ought to go away from here at once ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1798"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Good heavens , no ! They do n't want to part with you , I 'm sure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1799"><persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>hesitated a moment , plucking up the grass with her tiny hands . Then she said :<said who="#Cynthia">“<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>does . She hates me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1800"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Hates you ? ”</said>I cried , astonished .</p>
    <p n="1801"><persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>nodded .</p>
    <p n="1802"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Yes . I do n't know why , but she can n't bear me ; and he can n't , either . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1803"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ There I know you 're wrong , ”</said>I said warmly .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ On the contrary ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>is very fond of you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1804"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Oh , yes —<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>. I meant<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>. Not , of course , that I care whether<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>hates me or not . Still , it 's rather horrid when no one loves you , is n't it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1805"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ But they do ,<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>dear , ”</said>I said earnestly .<said who="#Cynthia">“ I 'm sure you are mistaken . Look , there is<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>— and<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1806"><persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>nodded rather gloomily .<said who="#Cynthia">“ Yes ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>likes me , I think , and of course<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>, for all her gruff ways , would n't be unkind to a fly . But<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>never speaks to me if he can help it , and<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>can hardly bring herself to be civil to me . She wants<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evie</persName>to stay on , is begging her to , but she does n't want me , and — and — I do n't know what to do . ”</said>Suddenly the poor child burst out crying .</p>
    <p n="1807">I do n't know what possessed me . Her beauty , perhaps , as she sat there , with the sunlight glinting down on her head ; perhaps the sense of relief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no connection with the tragedy ; perhaps honest pity for her youth and loneliness . Anyway , I leant forward , and taking her little hand , I said awkwardly :</p>
    <p n="1808"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Marry me ,<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1809">Unwittingly , I had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears . She sat up at once , drew her hand away , and said , with some asperity :</p>
    <p n="1810"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Do n't be silly ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1811">I was a little annoyed .</p>
    <p n="1812"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I 'm not being silly . I am asking you to do me the honour of becoming my wife . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1813">To my intense surprise ,<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>burst out laughing , and called me a “ funny dear . ”</p>
    <p n="1814"><said who="#Cynthia">“ It 's perfectly sweet of you , ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Cynthia">“ but you know you do n't want to ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1815"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Yes , I do . I 've got — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1816"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Never mind what you 've got . You do n't really want to — and I do n't either . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1817"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Well , of course , that settles it , ”</said>I said stiffly .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ But I do n't see anything to laugh at . There 's nothing funny about a proposal . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1818"><said who="#Cynthia">“ No , indeed , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>.<said who="#Cynthia">“ Somebody might accept you next time . Good-bye , you 've cheered me up very much . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1819">And , with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment , she vanished through the trees .</p>
    <p n="1820">Thinking over the interview , it struck me as being profoundly unsatisfactory .</p>
    <p n="1821">It occurred to me suddenly that I would go down to the village , and look up<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>. Somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow . At the same time , it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might have as to his being suspected . I remembered how<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>had relied on my diplomacy . Accordingly , I went to the little house with the “ Apartments ” card inserted in the window , where I knew he lodged , and tapped on the door .</p>
    <p n="1822">An old woman came and opened it .</p>
    <p n="1823"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Good afternoon , ”</said>I said pleasantly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Is<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>in ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1824">She stared at me .</p>
    <p n="1825"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Have n't you heard ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1826"><said who="#Bauerstein">“ Heard what ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1827"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ About him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1828"><said who="#Bauerstein">“ What about him ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1829"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ He 's took . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1830"><said who="#Bauerstein">“ Took ? Dead ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1831"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , took by the perlice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1832"><said who="#Bauerstein">“ By the police ! ”</said>I gasped .<said who="#Bauerstein">“ Do you mean they 've arrested him ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1833"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , that 's it , and — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1834">I waited to hear no more , but tore up the village to find<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="10">
    <p n="1835">To my extreme annoyance ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>was not in , and the old Belgian who answered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to London .</p>
    <p n="1836">I was dumbfounded . What on earth could<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>be doing in London ! Was it a sudden decision on his part , or had he already made up his mind when he parted from me a few hours earlier ?</p>
    <p n="1837">I retraced my steps to Styles in some annoyance . With<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>away , I was uncertain how to act . Had he foreseen this arrest ? Had he not , in all probability , been the cause of it ? Those questions I could not resolve . But in the meantime what was I to do ? Should I announce the arrest openly at Styles , or not ? Though I did not acknowledge it to myself , the thought of<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>was weighing on me . Would it not be a terrible shock to her ? For the moment , I set aside utterly any suspicions of her . She could not be implicated — otherwise I should have heard some hint of it .</p>
    <p n="1838">Of course , there was no possibility of being able permanently to conceal<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>'s arrest from her . It would be announced in every newspaper on the morrow . Still , I shrank from blurting it out . If only<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>had been accessible , I could have asked his advice . What possessed him to go posting off to London in this unaccountable way ?</p>
    <p n="1839">In spite of myself , my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably heightened . I would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor , had not<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>put it into my head . Yes , decidedly , the little man was clever .</p>
    <p n="1840">After some reflecting , I decided to take<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>into my confidence , and leave him to make the matter public or not , as he thought fit .</p>
    <p n="1841">He gave vent to a prodigious whistle , as I imparted the news .</p>
    <p n="1842"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Great Scot ! You were right , then . I could n't believe it at the time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1843"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , it is astonishing until you get used to the idea , and see how it makes everything fit in . Now , what are we to do ? Of course , it will be generally known to-morrow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1844"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>reflected .</p>
    <p n="1845"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Never mind , ”</said>he said at last ,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ we wo n't say anything at present . There is no need . As you say , it will be known soon enough . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1846">But to my intense surprise , on getting down early the next morning , and eagerly opening the newspapers , there was not a word about the arrest ! There was a column of mere padding about “ The Styles Poisoning Case , ” but nothing further . It was rather inexplicable , but I supposed that , for some reason or other ,<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>wished to keep it out of the papers . It worried me just a little , for it suggested the possibility that there might be further arrests to come .</p>
    <p n="1847">After breakfast , I decided to go down to the village , and see if<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>had returned yet ; but , before I could start , a well-known face blocked one of the windows , and the well-known voice said :</p>
    <p n="1848"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Bon jour , mon ami ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1849"><said who="#Japp">“<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, ”</said>I exclaimed , with relief , and seizing him by both hands , I dragged him into the room .<said who="#Japp">“ I was never so glad to see anyone . Listen , I have said nothing to anybody but<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>. Is that right ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1850"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ My friend , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do not know what you are talking about . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1851"><said who="#Japp">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>'s arrest , of course , ”</said>I answered impatiently .</p>
    <p n="1852"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Is<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>arrested , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1853"><said who="#Japp">“ Did you not know it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1854"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Not the least in the world . ”</said>But , pausing a moment , he added :<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Still , it does not surprise me . After all , we are only four miles from the coast . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1855"><said who="#Japp">“ The coast ? ”</said>I asked , puzzled .<said who="#Japp">“ What has that got to do with it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1856"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shrugged his shoulders .</p>
    <p n="1857"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Surely , it is obvious ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1858"><said who="#Japp">“ Not to me . No doubt I am very dense , but I cannot see what the proximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1859"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Nothing at all , of course , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, smiling .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But we were speaking of the arrest of<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1860"><said who="#Japp">“ Well , he is arrested for the murder of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>—— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1861"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, in apparently lively astonishment .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>arrested for the murder of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1862"><said who="#Japp">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1863"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Impossible ! That would be too good a farce ! Who told you that , my friend ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1864"><said who="#Japp">“ Well , no one exactly told me , ”</said>I confessed .<said who="#Japp">“ But he is arrested . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1865"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Oh , yes , very likely . But for espionage , mon ami . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1866"><said who="#Japp">“ Espionage ? ”</said>I gasped .</p>
    <p n="1867"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Precisely . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1868"><said who="#Japp">“ Not for poisoning<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1869"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Not unless our friend<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>has taken leave of his senses , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>placidly .</p>
    <p n="1870"><said who="#Japp">“ But — but I thought you thought so too ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1871"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>gave me one look , which conveyed a wondering pity , and his full sense of the utter absurdity of such an idea .</p>
    <p n="1872"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Do you mean to say , ”</said>I asked , slowly adapting myself to the new idea ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ that<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>is a spy ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1873"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded .</p>
    <p n="1874"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Have you never suspected it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1875"><said who="#Japp">“ It never entered my head . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1876"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It did not strike you as peculiar that a famous London doctor should bury himself in a little village like this , and should be in the habit of walking about at all hours of the night , fully dressed ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1877"><said who="#Japp">“ No , ”</said>I confessed ,<said who="#Japp">“ I never thought of such a thing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1878"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ He is , of course , a German by birth , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>thoughtfully ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ though he has practiced so long in this country that nobody thinks of him as anything but an Englishman . He was naturalized about fifteen years ago . A very clever man — a Jew , of course . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1879"><said who="#Japp">“ The blackguard ! ”</said>I cried indignantly .</p>
    <p n="1880"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Not at all . He is , on the contrary , a patriot . Think what he stands to lose . I admire the man myself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1881">But I could not look at it in<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s philosophical way .</p>
    <p n="1882"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And this is the man with whom<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>has been wandering about all over the country ! ”</said>I cried indignantly .</p>
    <p n="1883"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes . I should fancy he had found her very useful , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ So long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together , any other vagaries of the doctor 's passed unobserved . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1884"><said who="#Japp">“ Then you think he never really cared for her ? ”</said>I asked eagerly — rather too eagerly , perhaps , under the circumstances .</p>
    <p n="1885"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That , of course , I cannot say , but — shall I tell you my own private opinion ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1886"><said who="#Hastings">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1887"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , it is this : that<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>does not care , and never has cared one little jot about<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1888"><said who="#Hastings">“ Do you really think so ? ”</said>I could not disguise my pleasure .</p>
    <p n="1889"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I am quite sure of it . And I will tell you why . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1890"><said who="#Hastings">“ Yes ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1891"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Because she cares for some one else , mon ami . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1892"><said who="#Hastings">“ Oh ! ”</said>What did he mean ? In spite of myself , an agreeable warmth spread over me . I am not a vain man where women are concerned , but I remembered certain evidences , too lightly thought of at the time , perhaps , but which certainly seemed to indicate ——</p>
    <p n="1893">My pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>. She glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in the room , and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper . This she handed to<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, murmuring as she did so the cryptic words :</p>
    <p n="1894"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ On top of the wardrobe . ”</said>Then she hurriedly left the room .</p>
    <p n="1895"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly , and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction . He spread it out on the table .</p>
    <p n="1896"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Come here ,<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>. Now tell me , what is that initial — J. or L .? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1897">It was a medium sized sheet of paper , rather dusty , as though it had lain by for some time . But it was the label that was attracting<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s attention . At the top , it bore the printed stamp of Messrs.<persName>Parkson</persName>'s , the well-known theatrical costumiers , and it was addressed to “ — ( the debatable initial )<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Cavendish</persName>, Esq ., Styles Court , Styles St. Mary , Essex . ”</p>
    <p n="1898">“ It might be T ., or it might be L ., ” I said , after studying the thing for a minute or two .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ It certainly is n't a J . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1899"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Good , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, folding up the paper again .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I , also , am of your way of thinking . It is an L ., depend upon it ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1900"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Where did it come from ? ”</said>I asked curiously .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Is it important ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1901"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Moderately so . It confirms a surmise of mine . Having deduced its existence , I set<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>to search for it , and , as you see , she has been successful . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1902"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What did she mean by ‘ On the top of the wardrobe ’ ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1903"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ She meant , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>promptly ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ that she found it on top of a wardrobe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1904"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ A funny place for a piece of brown paper , ”</said>I mused .</p>
    <p n="1905"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Not at all . The top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown paper and cardboard boxes . I have kept them there myself . Neatly arranged , there is nothing to offend the eye . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1906"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, ”</said>I asked earnestly ,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ have you made up your mind about this crime ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1907"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes — that is to say , I believe I know how it was committed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1908"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Ah ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1909">“ Unfortunately , I have no proof beyond my surmise , unless —— ” With sudden energy , he caught me by the arm , and whirled me down the hall , calling out in French in his excitement :<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Mademoiselle<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, Mademoiselle<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, un moment , s'il vous plait ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1910"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, quite flurried by the noise , came hurrying out of the pantry .</p>
    <p n="1911"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ My good<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, I have an idea — a little idea — if it should prove justified , what magnificent chance ! Tell me , on Monday , not Tuesday ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, but Monday , the day before the tragedy , did anything go wrong with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s bell ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1912"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>looked very surprised .</p>
    <p n="1913"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Yes , sir , now you mention it , it did ; though I do n't know how you came to hear of it . A mouse , or some such , must have nibbled the wire through . The man came and put it right on Tuesday morning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1914">With a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>led the way back to the morning-room .</p>
    <p n="1915"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ See you , one should not ask for outside proof — no , reason should be enough . But the flesh is weak , it is consolation to find that one is on the right track . Ah , my friend , I am like a giant refreshed . I run ! I leap ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1916">And , in very truth , run and leap he did , gambolling wildly down the stretch of lawn outside the long window .</p>
    <p n="1917"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ What is your remarkable little friend doing ? ”</said>asked a voice behind me , and I turned to find<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>at my elbow . She smiled , and so did I .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ What is it all about ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1918"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Really , I can n't tell you . He asked<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>some question about a bell , and appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as you see ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1919"><persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>laughed .</p>
    <p n="1920"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ How ridiculous ! He 's going out of the gate . Is n't he coming back to-day ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1921"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do n't know . I 've given up trying to guess what he 'll do next . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1922"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Is he quite mad ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1923"><said who="#Mr._Hastings">“ I honestly do n't know . Sometimes , I feel sure he is as mad as a hatter ; and then , just as he is at his maddest , I find there is method in his madness . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1924"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I see . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1925">In spite of her laugh ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>was looking thoughtful this morning . She seemed grave , almost sad .</p>
    <p n="1926">It occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on the subject of<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>. I began rather tactfully , I thought , but I had not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively .</p>
    <p n="1927"><said>“ You are an excellent advocate , I have no doubt ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>, but in this case your talents are quite thrown away .<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>will run no risk of encountering any unkindness from me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1928">I began to stammer feebly that I hoped she had n't thought — But again she stopped me , and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>, and her troubles , out of my mind .</p>
    <p n="1929"><said who="#Cynthia">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>, ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Cynthia">“ do you think I and my husband are happy together ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1930">I was considerably taken aback , and murmured something about it 's not being my business to think anything of the sort .</p>
    <p n="1931"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Well , ”</said>she said quietly ,<said who="#Cynthia">“ whether it is your business or not , I will tell you that we are not happy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1932">I said nothing , for I saw that she had not finished .</p>
    <p n="1933">She began slowly , walking up and down the room , her head a little bent , and that slim , supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked . She stopped suddenly , and looked up at me .</p>
    <p n="1934"><said who="#Cynthia">“ You do n't know anything about me , do you ? ”</said>she asked .<said who="#Cynthia">“ Where I come from , who I was before I married<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>— anything , in fact ? Well , I will tell you . I will make a father confessor of you . You are kind , I think — yes , I am sure you are kind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1935">Somehow , I was not quite as elated as I might have been . I remembered that<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>had begun her confidences in much the same way . Besides , a father confessor should be elderly , it is not at all the role for a young man .</p>
    <p n="1936"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ My father was English , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>,<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ but my mother was a Russian . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1937"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Ah , ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Cynthia">“ now I understand — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1938"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Understand what ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1939"><said who="#Cynthia">“ A hint of something foreign — different — that there has always been about you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1940"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ My mother was very beautiful , I believe . I do n't know , because I never saw her . She died when I was quite a little child . I believe there was some tragedy connected with her death — she took an overdose of some sleeping draught by mistake . However that may be , my father was broken-hearted . Shortly afterwards , he went into the Consular Service . Everywhere he went , I went with him . When I was twenty-three , I had been nearly all over the world . It was a splendid life — I loved it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1941">There was a smile on her face , and her head was thrown back . She seemed living in the memory of those old glad days .</p>
    <p n="1942"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Then my father died . He left me very badly off . I had to go and live with some old aunts in Yorkshire . ”</said>She shuddered .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ You will understand me when I say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as I had been . The narrowness , the deadly monotony of it , almost drove me mad . ”</said>She paused a minute , and added in a different tone :<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ And then I met<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1943"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Yes ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1944"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ You can imagine that , from my aunts ’ point of view , it was a very good match for me . But I can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed with me . No , he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable monotony of my life . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1945">I said nothing , and after a moment , she went on :</p>
    <p n="1946"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Do n't misunderstand me . I was quite honest with him . I told him , what was true , that I liked him very much , that I hoped to come to like him more , but that I was not in any way what the world calls ‘ in love ’ with him . He declared that that satisfied him , and so — we were married . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1947">She waited a long time , a little frown had gathered on her forehead . She seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past days .</p>
    <p n="1948"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I think — I am sure — he cared for me at first . But I suppose we were not well matched . Almost at once , we drifted apart . He — it is not a pleasing thing for my pride , but it is the truth — tired of me very soon . ”</said>I must have made some murmur of dissent , for she went on quickly :<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Oh , yes , he did ! Not that it matters now — now that we 've come to the parting of the ways . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1949"><said who="#Cynthia">“ What do you mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1950">She answered quietly :</p>
    <p n="1951"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I mean that I am not going to remain at Styles . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1952"><said who="#Cynthia">“ You and<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>are not going to live here ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1953"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>may live here , but I shall not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1954"><said who="#Cynthia">“ You are going to leave him ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1955"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1956"><said who="#Cynthia">“ But why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1957">She paused a long time , and said at last :</p>
    <p n="1958"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Perhaps — because I want to be — free ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1959">And , as she spoke , I had a sudden vision of broad spaces , virgin tracts of forests , untrodden lands — and a realization of what freedom would mean to such a nature as<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>. I seemed to see her for a moment as she was , a proud wild creature , as untamed by civilization as some shy bird of the hills . A little cry broke from her lips :</p>
    <p n="1960"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ You do n't know , you do n't know , how this hateful place has been prison to me ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1961"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I understand , ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Cynthia">“ but — but do n't do anything rash . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1962"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Oh , rash ! ”</said>Her voice mocked at my prudence .</p>
    <p n="1963">Then suddenly I said a thing I could have bitten out my tongue for :</p>
    <p n="1964"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ You know that<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>has been arrested ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1965">An instant coldness passed like a mask over her face , blotting out all expression .</p>
    <p n="1966"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>was so kind as to break that to me this morning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1967"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Well , what do you think ? ”</said>I asked feebly .</p>
    <p n="1968"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Of what ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1969"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Of the arrest ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1970"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ What should I think ? Apparently he is a German spy ; so the gardener had told<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1971">Her face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless . Did she care , or did she not ?</p>
    <p n="1972">She moved away a step or two , and fingered one of the flower vases .</p>
    <p n="1973"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ These are quite dead . I must do them again . Would you mind moving — thank you ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>. ”</said>And she walked quietly past me out of the window , with a cool little nod of dismissal .</p>
    <p n="1974">No , surely she could not care for<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>. No woman could act her part with that icy unconcern .</p>
    <p n="1975"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>did not make his appearance the following morning , and there was no sign of the Scotland Yard men .</p>
    <p n="1976">But , at lunch-time , there arrived a new piece of evidence — or rather lack of evidence . We had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter , which<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>had written on the evening preceding her death . Our efforts having been in vain , we had abandoned the matter , hoping that it might turn up of itself one day . And this is just what did happen , in the shape of a communication , which arrived by the second post from a firm of French music publishers , acknowledging<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s cheque , and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series of Russian folksongs . So the last hope of solving the mystery , by means of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s correspondence on the fatal evening , had to be abandoned .</p>
    <p n="1977">Just before tea , I strolled down to tell<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>of the new disappointment , but found , to my annoyance , that he was once more out .</p>
    <p n="1978"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Gone to London again ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1979"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Oh , no , monsieur , he has but taken the train to Tadminster . ‘ To see a young lady 's dispensary , ’ he said . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1980"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Silly ass ! ”</said>I ejaculated .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I told him Wednesday was the one day she was n't there ! Well , tell him to look us up to-morrow morning , will you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1981"><said who="#Mrs._Inglethorp">“ Certainly , monsieur . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1982">But , on the following day , no sign of<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>. I was getting angry . He was really treating us in the most cavalier fashion .</p>
    <p n="1983">After lunch ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>drew me aside , and asked if I was going down to see him .</p>
    <p n="1984"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No , I do n't think I shall . He can come up here if he wants to see us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1985"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Oh ! ”</said><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>looked indeterminate . Something unusually nervous and excited in his manner roused my curiosity .</p>
    <p n="1986"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What is it ? ”</said>I asked .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I could go if there 's anything special . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1987"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ It 's nothing much , but — well , if you are going , will you tell him — ”</said>he dropped his voice to a whisper —<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I think I 've found the extra coffee-cup ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1988">I had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s , but now my curiosity was aroused afresh .</p>
    <p n="1989"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>would say no more , so I decided that I would descend from my high horse , and once more seek out<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>at Leastways Cottage .</p>
    <p n="1990">This time I was received with a smile .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>was within . Would I mount ? I mounted accordingly .</p>
    <p n="1991"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>was sitting by the table , his head buried in his hands . He sprang up at my entrance .</p>
    <p n="1992"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What is it ? ”</said>I asked solicitously .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You are not ill , I trust ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1993"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No , no , not ill . But I decide an affair of great moment . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1994"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Whether to catch the criminal or not ? ”</said>I asked facetiously .</p>
    <p n="1995">But , to my great surprise ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded gravely .</p>
    <p n="1996"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ ‘ To speak or not to speak , ’ as your so great Shakespeare says , ‘ that is the question . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="1997">I did not trouble to correct the quotation .</p>
    <p n="1998"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ You are not serious ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1999"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I am of the most serious . For the most serious of all things hangs in the balance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2000"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ And that is ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2001"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ A woman 's happiness , mon ami , ”</said>he said gravely .</p>
    <p n="2002">I did not quite know what to say .</p>
    <p n="2003"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ The moment has come , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>thoughtfully ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ and I do not know what to do . For , see you , it is a big stake for which I play . No one but I ,<persName corresp="#Hercule_Poirot">Hercule Poirot</persName>, would attempt it ! ”</said>And he tapped himself proudly on the breast .</p>
    <p n="2004">After pausing a few minutes respectfully , so as not to spoil his effect , I gave him<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>'s message .</p>
    <p n="2005"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Aha ! ”</said>he cried .<said>“ So he has found the extra coffee-cup . That is good . He has more intelligence than would appear , this long-faced<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>of yours ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2006">I did not myself think very highly of<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>'s intelligence ; but I forebore to contradict<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, and gently took him to task for forgetting my instructions as to which were<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>'s days off .</p>
    <p n="2007"><said who="#Cynthia">“ It is true . I have the head of a sieve . However , the other young lady was most kind . She was sorry for my disappointment , and showed me everything in the kindest way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2008"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Oh , well , that 's all right , then , and you must go to tea with<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>another day . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2009">I told him about the letter .</p>
    <p n="2010"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I am sorry for that , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I always had hopes of that letter . But no , it was not to be . This affair must all be unravelled from within . ”</said>He tapped his forehead .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ These little grey cells . It is ‘ up to them ’ — as you say over here . ”</said>Then , suddenly , he asked :<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Are you a judge of finger-marks , my friend ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2011"><said who="#Cynthia">“ No , ”</said>I said , rather surprised ,<said who="#Cynthia">“ I know that there are no two finger-marks alike , but that 's as far as my science goes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2012"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Exactly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2013">He unlocked a little drawer , and took out some photographs which he laid on the table .</p>
    <p n="2014"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I have numbered them , 1 , 2 , 3 . Will you describe them to me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2015">I studied the proofs attentively .</p>
    <p n="2016"><said who="#Cynthia">“ All greatly magnified , I see . No . 1 , I should say , are a man 's finger-prints ; thumb and first finger . No . 2 are a lady 's ; they are much smaller , and quite different in every way . No . 3 ”</said>— I paused for some time —<said who="#Cynthia">“ there seem to be a lot of confused finger-marks , but here , very distinctly , are No . 1 's . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2017"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Overlapping the others ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2018"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2019"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You recognize them beyond fail ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2020"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Oh , yes ; they are identical . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2021"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded , and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up again .</p>
    <p n="2022"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I suppose , ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ that as usual , you are not going to explain ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2023"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ On the contrary . No . 1 were the finger-prints of<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>. No . 2 were those of<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>. They are not important . I merely obtained them for comparison . No . 3 is a little more complicated . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2024"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Yes ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2025"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It is , as you see , highly magnified . You may have noticed a sort of blur extending all across the picture . I will not describe to you the special apparatus , dusting powder , etc ., which I used . It is a well-known process to the police , and by means of it you can obtain a photograph of the finger-prints of any object in a very short space of time . Well , my friend , you have seen the finger-marks — it remains to tell you the particular object on which they had been left . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2026"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Go on — I am really excited . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2027"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Eh bien ! Photo No . 3 represents the highly magnified surface of a tiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster — which sounds like the house that Jack built ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2028"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Good heavens ! ”</said>I exclaimed .<said who="#Cynthia">“ But what were<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence Cavendish</persName>'s finger-marks doing on it ? He never went near the poison cupboard the day we were there ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2029"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Oh , yes , he did ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2030"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Impossible ! We were all together the whole time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2031"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shook his head .</p>
    <p n="2032"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , my friend , there was a moment when you were not all together . There was a moment when you could not have been all together , or it would not have been necessary to call to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>to come and join you on the balcony . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2033"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I 'd forgotten that , ”</said>I admitted .<said who="#Cynthia">“ But it was only for a moment . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2034"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Long enough . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2035"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Long enough for what ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2036"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s smile became rather enigmatical .</p>
    <p n="2037"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a very natural interest and curiosity . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2038">Our eyes met .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s were pleasantly vague . He got up and hummed a little tune . I watched him suspiciously .</p>
    <p n="2039"><said who="#Cynthia">“<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Cynthia">“ what was in this particular little bottle ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2040"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>looked out of the window .</p>
    <p n="2041"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Hydro-chloride of strychnine , ”</said>he said , over his shoulder , continuing to hum .</p>
    <p n="2042"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Good heavens ! ”</said>I said it quite quietly . I was not surprised . I had expected that answer .</p>
    <p n="2043"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ They use the pure hydro-chloride of strychnine very little — only occasionally for pills . It is the official solution , Liq . Strychnine Hydro-clor . that is used in most medicines . That is why the finger-marks have remained undisturbed since then . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2044"><said who="#Cynthia">“ How did you manage to take this photograph ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2045"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I dropped my hat from the balcony , ”</said>explained<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>simply .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Visitors were not permitted below at that hour , so , in spite of my many apologies ,<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>'s colleague had to go down and fetch it for me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2046"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Then you knew what you were going to find ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2047"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , not at all . I merely realized that it was possible , from your story , for<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>to go to the poison cupboard . The possibility had to be confirmed , or eliminated . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2048"><said who="#Cynthia">“<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Cynthia">“ your gaiety does not deceive me . This is a very important discovery . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2049"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do not know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But one thing does strike me . No doubt it has struck you too . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2050"><said who="#Cynthia">“ What is that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2051"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Why , that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case . This is the third time we run up against it . There was strychnine in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s tonic . There is the strychnine sold across the counter at Styles St. Mary by<persName>Mace</persName>. Now we have more strychnine , handled by one of the household . It is confusing ; and , as you know , I do not like confusion . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2052">Before I could reply , one of the other Belgians opened the door and stuck his head in .</p>
    <p n="2053"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ There is a lady below , asking for Mr<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2054"><said who="#Cynthia">“ A lady ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2055">I jumped up .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>followed me down the narrow stairs .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>was standing in the doorway .</p>
    <p n="2056"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I have been visiting an old woman in the village , ”</said>she explained ,<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ and as<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>told me you were with<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>I thought I would call for you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2057"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Alas , madame , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I thought you had come to honour me with a visit ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2058"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I will some day , if you ask me , ”</said>she promised him , smiling .</p>
    <p n="2059"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That is well . If you should need a father confessor , madame ”</said>— she started ever so slightly —<said>“ remember , Papa<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>is always at your service . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2060">She stared at him for a few minutes , as though seeking to read some deeper meaning into his words . Then she turned abruptly away .</p>
    <p n="2061"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Come , will you not walk back with us too ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2062"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Enchanted , madame . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2063">All the way to Styles ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>talked fast and feverishly . It struck me that in some way she was nervous of<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s eyes .</p>
    <p n="2064">The weather had broken , and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its shrewishness .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>shivered a little , and buttoned her black sports coat closer . The wind through the trees made a mournful noise , like some great giant sighing .</p>
    <p n="2065">We walked up to the great door of Styles , and at once the knowledge came to us that something was wrong .</p>
    <p n="2066"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>came running out to meet us . She was crying and wringing her hands . I was aware of other servants huddled together in the background , all eyes and ears .</p>
    <p n="2067"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Oh , m'am ! Oh , m'am ! I do n't know how to tell you — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2068"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ What is it ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>? ”</said>I asked impatiently .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Tell us at once . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2069"><said who="#Dorcas">“ It 's those wicked detectives . They 've arrested him — they 've arrested<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2070"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Arrested<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>? ”</said>I gasped .</p>
    <p n="2071">I saw a strange look come into<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>'s eyes .</p>
    <p n="2072"><said who="#Dorcas">“ No , sir . Not Mr.<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>— Mr.<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2073">Behind me , with a wild cry ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>fell heavily against me , and as I turned to catch her I met the quiet triumph in<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s eyes .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="11">
    <p n="2074">The trial of<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>for the murder of his stepmother took place two months later .</p>
    <p n="2075">Of the intervening weeks I will say little , but my admiration and sympathy went out unfeignedly to<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>. She ranged herself passionately on her husband 's side , scorning the mere idea of his guilt , and fought for him tooth and nail .</p>
    <p n="2076">I expressed my admiration to<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, and he nodded thoughtfully .</p>
    <p n="2077"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes , she is of those women who show at their best in adversity . It brings out all that is sweetest and truest in them . Her pride and her jealousy have — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2078"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Jealousy ? ”</said>I queried .</p>
    <p n="2079"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes . Have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman ? As I was saying , her pride and jealousy have been laid aside . She thinks of nothing but her husband , and the terrible fate that is hanging over him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2080">He spoke very feelingly , and I looked at him earnestly , remembering that last afternoon , when he had been deliberating whether or not to speak . With his tenderness for “ a woman 's happiness , ” I felt glad that the decision had been taken out of his hands .</p>
    <p n="2081"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Even now , ”</said>I said ,<said>“ I can hardly believe it . You see , up to the very last minute , I thought it was<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2082"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>grinned .</p>
    <p n="2083"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I know you did . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2084"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>! My old friend<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2085"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Every murderer is probably somebody 's old friend , ”</said>observed<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>philosophically .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You cannot mix up sentiment and reason . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2086"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I must say I think you might have given me a hint . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2087"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Perhaps , mon ami , I did not do so , just because he was your old friend . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2088">I was rather disconcerted by this , remembering how I had busily passed on to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>what I believed to be<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s views concerning<persName corresp="#Bauerstein">Bauerstein</persName>. He , by the way , had been acquitted of the charge brought against him . Nevertheless , although he had been too clever for them this time , and the charge of espionage could not be brought home to him , his wings were pretty well clipped for the future .</p>
    <p n="2089">I asked<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>whether he thought<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>would be condemned . To my intense surprise , he replied that , on the contrary , he was extremely likely to be acquitted .</p>
    <p n="2090"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ But ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>— ”</said>I protested .</p>
    <p n="2091"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Oh , my friend , have I not said to you all along that I have no proofs . It is one thing to know that a man is guilty , it is quite another matter to prove him so . And , in this case , there is terribly little evidence . That is the whole trouble . I ,<persName corresp="#Hercule_Poirot">Hercule Poirot</persName>, know , but I lack the last link in my chain . And unless I can find that missing link — ”</said>He shook his head gravely .</p>
    <p n="2092"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ When did you first suspect<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>? ”</said>I asked , after a minute or two .</p>
    <p n="2093"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Did you not suspect him at all ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2094"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ No , indeed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2095"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>and her mother-in-law , and her subsequent lack of frankness at the inquest ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2096"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2097"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Did you not put two and two together , and reflect that if it was not<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>who was quarrelling with his wife — and you remember , he strenuously denied it at the inquest — it must be either<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>or<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>. Now , if it was<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>'s conduct was just as inexplicable . But if , on the other hand , it was<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, the whole thing was explained quite naturally . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2098"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ So , ”</said>I cried , a light breaking in upon me ,<said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ it was<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>who quarrelled with his mother that afternoon ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2099"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Exactly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2100"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ And you have known this all along ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2101"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Certainly .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>'s behaviour could only be explained that way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2102"><said who="#Hercule_Poirot">“ And yet you say he may be acquitted ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2103"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shrugged his shoulders .</p>
    <p n="2104"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Certainly I do . At the police court proceedings , we shall hear the case for the prosecution , but in all probability his solicitors will advise him to reserve his defence . That will be sprung upon us at the trial . And — ah , by the way , I have a word of caution to give you , my friend . I must not appear in the case . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2105"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2106"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No . Officially , I have nothing to do with it . Until I have found that last link in my chain , I must remain behind the scenes .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>must think I am working for her husband , not against him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2107"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I say , that 's playing it a bit low down , ”</said>I protested .</p>
    <p n="2108"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Not at all . We have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man , and we must use any means in our power — otherwise he will slip through our fingers . That is why I have been careful to remain in the background . All the discoveries have been made by<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>will take all the credit . If I am called upon to give evidence at all ”</said>— he smiled broadly —<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ it will probably be as a witness for the defence . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2109">I could hardly believe my ears .</p>
    <p n="2110"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It is quite en regle , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Strangely enough , I can give evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2111"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Which one ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2112"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ The one that relates to the destruction of the will .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>did not destroy that will . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2113"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>was a true prophet . I will not go into the details of the police court proceedings , as it involves many tiresome repetitions . I will merely state baldly that<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>reserved his defence , and was duly committed for trial .</p>
    <p n="2114">September found us all in London .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>took a house in Kensington ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>being included in the family party .</p>
    <p n="2115">I myself had been given a job at the War Office , so was able to see them continually .</p>
    <p n="2116">As the weeks went by , the state of<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>'s nerves grew worse and worse . That “ last link ” he talked about was still lacking . Privately , I hoped it might remain so , for what happiness could there be for<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>, if<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>were not acquitted ?</p>
    <p n="2117">On September 15th<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>appeared in the dock at the Old Bailey , charged with “ The Wilful Murder of<persName corresp="#Emily">Emily</persName>Agnes<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>, ” and pleaded “ Not Guilty . ”</p>
    <p n="2118"><persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>Heavywether , the famous K. C ., had been engaged to defend him .</p>
    <p n="2119"><persName corresp="#Mr._Philips">Mr. Philips</persName>, K. C ., opened the case for the Crown .</p>
    <p n="2120">The murder , he said , was a most premeditated and cold-blooded one . It was neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and trusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother . Ever since his boyhood , she had supported him . He and his wife had lived at Styles Court in every luxury , surrounded by her care and attention . She had been their kind and generous benefactress .</p>
    <p n="2121">He proposed to call witnesses to show how the prisoner , a profligate and spendthrift , had been at the end of his financial tether , and had also been carrying on an intrigue with a certain<persName>Mrs. Raikes</persName>, a neighbouring farmer 's wife . This having come to his stepmother 's ears , she taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death , and a quarrel ensued , part of which was overheard . On the previous day , the prisoner had purchased strychnine at the village chemist 's shop , wearing a disguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon another man — to wit ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s husband , of whom he had been bitterly jealous . Luckily for<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, he had been able to produce an unimpeachable alibi .</p>
    <p n="2122">On the afternoon of July 17th , continued Counsel , immediately after the quarrel with her son ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>made a new will . This will was found destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning , but evidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in favour of her husband . Deceased had already made a will in his favour before her marriage , but — and<persName corresp="#Mr._Philips">Mr. Philips</persName>wagged an expressive forefinger — the prisoner was not aware of that . What had induced the deceased to make a fresh will , with the old one still extant , he could not say . She was an old lady , and might possibly have forgotten the former one ; or — this seemed to him more likely — she may have had an idea that it was revoked by her marriage , as there had been some conversation on the subject . Ladies were not always very well versed in legal knowledge . She had , about a year before , executed a will in favour of the prisoner . He would call evidence to show that it was the prisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal night . Later in the evening , he had sought admission to her room , on which occasion , no doubt , he found an opportunity of destroying the will which , as far as he knew , would render the one in his favour valid .</p>
    <p n="2123">The prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery , in his room , by Detective Inspector<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>— a most brilliant officer — of the identical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village chemist 's to the supposed<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>on the day before the murder . It would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts constituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner 's guilt .</p>
    <p n="2124">And , subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide , was quite unthinkable ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Philips">Mr. Philips</persName>sat down and wiped his forehead .</p>
    <p n="2125">The first witnesses for the prosecution were mostly those who had been called at the inquest , the medical evidence being again taken first .</p>
    <p n="2126"><persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>Heavywether , who was famous all over England for the unscrupulous manner in which he bullied witnesses , only asked two questions .</p>
    <p n="2127"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ I take it ,<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>, that strychnine , as a drug , acts quickly ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2128"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2129"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ And that you are unable to account for the delay in this case ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2130"><said who="#Dr._Bauerstein">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2131"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Thank you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2132"><persName corresp="#Mr._Mace">Mr. Mace</persName>identified the phial handed him by Counsel as that sold by him to “<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>. ” Pressed , he admitted that he only knew<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>by sight . He had never spoken to him . The witness was not cross-examined .</p>
    <p n="2133"><persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>was called , and denied having purchased the poison . He also denied having quarrelled with his wife . Various witnesses testified to the accuracy of these statements .</p>
    <p n="2134">The gardeners ’ evidence , as to the witnessing of the will was taken , and then<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>was called .</p>
    <p n="2135"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, faithful to her “ young gentlemen , ” denied strenuously that it could have been<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s voice she heard , and resolutely declared , in the teeth of everything , that it was<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>who had been in the boudoir with her mistress . A rather wistful smile passed across the face of the prisoner in the dock . He knew only too well how useless her gallant defiance was , since it was not the object of the defence to deny this point .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>, of course , could not be called upon to give evidence against her husband .</p>
    <p n="2136">After various questions on other matters ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Philips">Mr. Philips</persName>asked :</p>
    <p n="2137"><said who="#Mr._Philips">“ In the month of June last , do you remember a parcel arriving for<persName corresp="#Mr._Lawrence_Cavendish">Mr. Lawrence Cavendish</persName>from<persName>Parkson</persName>'s ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2138"><persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>shook her head .</p>
    <p n="2139"><said who="#Dorcas">“ I do n't remember , sir . It may have done , but Mr.<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>was away from home part of June . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2140"><said who="#Mr._Philips">“ In the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away , what would be done with it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2141"><said who="#Dorcas">“ It would either be put in his room or sent on after him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2142"><said who="#Mr._Philips">“ By you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2143"><said who="#Dorcas">“ No , sir , I should leave it on the hall table . It would be<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>who would attend to anything like that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2144"><persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>was called and , after being examined on other points , was questioned as to the parcel .</p>
    <p n="2145"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Do n't remember . Lots of parcels come . Ca n't remember one special one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2146"><said who="#Dorcas">“ You do not know if it was sent after<persName corresp="#Mr._Lawrence_Cavendish">Mr. Lawrence Cavendish</persName>to Wales , or whether it was put in his room ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2147"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Do n't think it was sent after him . Should have remembered it if it was . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2148"><said who="#Dorcas">“ Supposing a parcel arrived addressed to<persName corresp="#Mr._Lawrence_Cavendish">Mr. Lawrence Cavendish</persName>, and afterwards it disappeared , should you remark its absence ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2149"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ No , do n't think so . I should think some one had taken charge of it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2150"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I believe ,<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, that it was you who found this sheet of brown paper ? ”</said>He held up the same dusty piece which<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>and I had examined in the morning-room at Styles .</p>
    <p n="2151"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes , I did . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2152"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ How did you come to look for it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2153"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ The Belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search for it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2154"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Where did you eventually discover it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2155"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ On the top of — of — a wardrobe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2156"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ On top of the prisoner 's wardrobe ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2157"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ I — I believe so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2158"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Did you not find it yourself ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2159"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2160"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Then you must know where you found it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2161"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes , it was on the prisoner 's wardrobe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2162"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That is better . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2163">An assistant from<persName>Parkson</persName>'s , Theatrical Costumiers , testified that on June 29th , they had supplied a black beard to Mr. L.<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Cavendish</persName>, as requested . It was ordered by letter , and a postal order was enclosed . No , they had not kept the letter . All transactions were entered in their books . They had sent the beard , as directed , to “ L.<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Cavendish</persName>, Esq ., Styles Court . ”</p>
    <p n="2164"><persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>Heavywether rose ponderously .</p>
    <p n="2165"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Where was the letter written from ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2166"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ From Styles Court . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2167"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ The same address to which you sent the parcel ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2168"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2169"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ And the letter came from there ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2170"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2171">Like a beast of prey , Heavywether fell upon him :</p>
    <p n="2172"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ How do you know ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2173"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I — I do n't understand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2174"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ How do you know that letter came from Styles ? Did you notice the postmark ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2175"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No — but — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2176"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Ah , you did not notice the postmark ! And yet you affirm so confidently that it came from Styles . It might , in fact , have been any postmark ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2177"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Y — es . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2178"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ In fact , the letter , though written on stamped notepaper , might have been posted from anywhere ? From Wales , for instance ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2179">The witness admitted that such might be the case , and<persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>signified that he was satisfied .</p>
    <p n="2180">Elizabeth<persName>Wells</persName>, second housemaid at Styles , stated that after she had gone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door , instead of leaving it on the latch as<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>had requested . She had accordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error . Hearing a slight noise in the West wing , she had peeped along the passage , and had seen Mr.<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>knocking at<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s door .</p>
    <p n="2181"><persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>Heavywether made short work of her , and under his unmerciful bullying she contradicted herself hopelessly , and<persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>sat down again with a satisfied smile on his face .</p>
    <p n="2182">With the evidence of<persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>, as to the candle grease on the floor , and as to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir , the proceedings were adjourned until the following day .</p>
    <p n="2183">As we went home ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>spoke bitterly against the prosecuting counsel .</p>
    <p n="2184"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ That hateful man ! What a net he has drawn around my poor<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>! How he twisted every little fact until he made it seem what it was n't ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2185"><said who="#Annie">“ Well , ”</said>I said consolingly ,<said who="#Annie">“ it will be the other way about to-morrow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2186"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Yes , ”</said>she said meditatively ; then suddenly dropped her voice .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Hastings">Mr. Hastings</persName>, you do not think — surely it could not have been<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>— Oh , no , that could not be ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2187">But I myself was puzzled , and as soon as I was alone with<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>I asked him what he thought<persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>was driving at .</p>
    <p n="2188"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>appreciatively .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ He is a clever man , that<persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2189"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Do you think he believes<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>guilty ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2190"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do not think he believes or cares anything ! No , what he is trying for is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are divided in their opinion as to which brother did it . He is endeavouring to make out that there is quite as much evidence against<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>as against<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>— and I am not at all sure that he will not succeed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2191">Detective-inspector<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>was the first witness called when the trial was reopened , and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly . After relating the earlier events , he proceeded :</p>
    <p n="2192"><said who="#Japp">“ Acting on information received , Superintendent<persName corresp="#Summerhaye">Summerhaye</persName>and myself searched the prisoner 's room , during his temporary absence from the house . In his chest of drawers , hidden beneath some underclothing , we found : first , a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez similar to those worn by<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>”</said>— these were exhibited —<said who="#Japp">“ secondly , this phial . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2193">The phial was that already recognized by the chemist 's assistant , a tiny bottle of blue glass , containing a few grains of a white crystalline powder , and labelled :<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Strychnine Hydrochloride . POISON . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2194">A fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police court proceedings was a long , almost new piece of blotting-paper . It had been found in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s cheque book , and on being reversed at a mirror , showed clearly the words : “ . . . erything of which I die possessed I leave to my beloved husband<persName corresp="#Alfred">Alfred</persName>Ing ... ” This placed beyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of the deceased lady 's husband .<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>then produced the charred fragment of paper recovered from the grate , and this , with the discovery of the beard in the attic , completed his evidence .</p>
    <p n="2195">But<persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>'s cross-examination was yet to come .</p>
    <p n="2196"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ What day was it when you searched the prisoner 's room ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2197"><said who="#Japp">“ Tuesday , the 24th of July . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2198"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Exactly a week after the tragedy ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2199"><said who="#Japp">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2200"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ You found these two objects , you say , in the chest of drawers . Was the drawer unlocked ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2201"><said who="#Japp">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2202"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Does it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a crime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone to find ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2203"><said who="#Japp">“ He might have stowed them there in a hurry . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2204"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ But you have just said it was a whole week since the crime . He would have had ample time to remove them and destroy them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2205"><said who="#Japp">“ Perhaps . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2206"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ There is no perhaps about it . Would he , or would he not have had plenty of time to remove and destroy them ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2207"><said who="#Japp">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2208"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy or light ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2209"><said who="#Japp">“ Heavyish . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2210"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ In other words , it was winter underclothing . Obviously , the prisoner would not be likely to go to that drawer ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2211"><said who="#Japp">“ Perhaps not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2212"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Kindly answer my question . Would the prisoner , in the hottest week of a hot summer , be likely to go to a drawer containing winter underclothing . Yes , or no ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2213"><said who="#Japp">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2214"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ In that case , is it not possible that the articles in question might have been put there by a third person , and that the prisoner was quite unaware of their presence ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2215"><said who="#Japp">“ I should not think it likely . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2216"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ But it is possible ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2217"><said who="#Japp">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2218"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ That is all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2219">More evidence followed . Evidence as to the financial difficulties in which the prisoner had found himself at the end of July . Evidence as to his intrigue with<persName>Mrs. Raikes</persName>— poor<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>, that must have been bitter hearing for a woman of her pride .<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>had been right in her facts , though her animosity against<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>had caused her to jump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned .</p>
    <p n="2220"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence Cavendish</persName>was then put into the box . In a low voice , in answer to<persName corresp="#Mr._Philips">Mr. Philips</persName>’ questions , he denied having ordered anything from<persName>Parkson</persName>'s in June . In fact , on June 29th , he had been staying away , in Wales .</p>
    <p n="2221">Instantly ,<persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>'s chin was shooting pugnaciously forward .</p>
    <p n="2222"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ You deny having ordered a black beard from<persName>Parkson</persName>'s on June 29th ? ”</said></p>

    <p n="2224"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Ah ! In the event of anything happening to your brother , who will inherit Styles Court ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2225">The brutality of the question called a flush to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>'s pale face . The judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation , and the prisoner in the dock leant forward angrily .</p>
    <p n="2226">Heavywether cared nothing for his client 's anger .</p>
    <p n="2227"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Answer my question , if you please . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2228"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I suppose , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>quietly ,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ that I should . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2229"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ What do you mean by you ‘ suppose ’ ? Your brother has no children . You would inherit it , would n't you ? ”</said></p>

    <p n="2231"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Ah , that 's better , ”</said>said Heavywether , with ferocious geniality .<said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ And you 'd inherit a good slice of money too , would n't you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2232"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Really ,<persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>, ”</said>protested the judge ,<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ these questions are not relevant . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2233"><persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>bowed , and having shot his arrow proceeded .</p>

    <p n="2235"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2236"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Did you — while you happened to be alone for a few seconds — unlock the poison cupboard , and examine some of the bottles ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2237"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I — I — may have done so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2238"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ I put it to you that you did do so ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2239"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2240"><persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>fairly shot the next question at him .</p>
    <p n="2241"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Did you examine one bottle in particular ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2242"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No , I do not think so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2243"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Be careful ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>. I am referring to a little bottle of Hydro-chloride of Strychnine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2244"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>was turning a sickly greenish colour .</p>
    <p n="2245"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ N — o — I am sure I did n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2246"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable impress of your finger-prints on it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2247">The bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition .</p>
    <p n="2248"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I — I suppose I must have taken up the bottle . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2249"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ I suppose so too ! Did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2250"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Certainly not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2251"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Then why did you take it up ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2252"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I once studied to be a doctor . Such things naturally interest me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2253"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Ah ! So poisons ‘ naturally interest ’ you , do they ? Still , you waited to be alone before gratifying that ‘ interest ’ of yours ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2254"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ That was pure chance . If the others had been there , I should have done just the same . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2255"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ Still , as it happens , the others were not there ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2256"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No , but —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="2257"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ In fact , during the whole afternoon , you were only alone for a couple of minutes , and it happened — I say , it happened — to be during those two minutes that you displayed your ‘ natural interest ’ in Hydro-chloride of Strychnine ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2258"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>stammered pitiably .</p>
    <p n="2259"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I — I —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="2260">With a satisfied and expressive countenance ,<persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>observed :</p>
    <p n="2261"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ I have nothing more to ask you ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cavendish">Mr. Cavendish</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2262">This bit of cross-examination had caused great excitement in court . The heads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid together , and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily threatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate silence .</p>
    <p n="2263">There was little more evidence . The hand-writing experts were called upon for their opinion of the signature of “<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>” in the chemist 's poison register . They all declared unanimously that it was certainly not his hand-writing , and gave it as their view that it might be that of the prisoner disguised . Cross-examined , they admitted that it might be the prisoner 's hand-writing cleverly counterfeited .</p>
    <p n="2264"><persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>Heavywether 's speech in opening the case for the defence was not a long one , but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic manner . Never , he said , in the course of his long experience , had he known a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence . Not only was it entirely circumstantial , but the greater part of it was practically unproved . Let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it impartially . The strychnine had been found in a drawer in the prisoner 's room . That drawer was an unlocked one , as he had pointed out , and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was the prisoner who had concealed the poison there . It was , in fact , a wicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix the crime on the prisoner . The prosecution had been unable to produce a shred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the prisoner who ordered the black beard from<persName>Parkson</persName>'s . The quarrel which had taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely admitted , but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly exaggerated .</p>
    <p n="2265">His learned friend —<persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>nodded carelessly at<persName corresp="#Mr._Philips">Mr. Philips</persName>— had stated that if the prisoner were an innocent man , he would have come forward at the inquest to explain that it was he , and not<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, who had been the participator in the quarrel . He thought the facts had been misrepresented . What had actually occurred was this . The prisoner , returning to the house on Tuesday evening , had been authoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between Mr. and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>. No suspicion had entered the prisoner 's head that anyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>. He naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two quarrels .</p>
    <p n="2266">The prosecution averred that on Monday , July 16th , the prisoner had entered the chemist 's shop in the village , disguised as<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>. The prisoner , on the contrary , was at that time at a lonely spot called Marston 's Spinney , where he had been summoned by an anonymous note , couched in blackmailing terms , and threatening to reveal certain matters to his wife unless he complied with its demands . The prisoner had , accordingly , gone to the appointed spot , and after waiting there vainly for half an hour had returned home . Unfortunately , he had met with no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of his story , but luckily he had kept the note , and it would be produced as evidence .</p>
    <p n="2267">As for the statement relating to the destruction of the will , the prisoner had formerly practiced at the Bar , and was perfectly well aware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically revoked by his stepmother 's remarriage . He would call evidence to show who did destroy the will , and it was possible that that might open up quite a new view of the case .</p>
    <p n="2268">Finally , he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against other people besides<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>. He would direct their attention to the fact that the evidence against<persName corresp="#Mr._Lawrence_Cavendish">Mr. Lawrence Cavendish</persName>was quite as strong , if not stronger than that against his brother .</p>
    <p n="2269">He would now call the prisoner .</p>
    <p n="2270"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>acquitted himself well in the witness-box . Under<persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>'s skilful handling , he told his tale credibly and well . The anonymous note received by him was produced , and handed to the jury to examine . The readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties , and the disagreement with his stepmother , lent value to his denials .</p>
    <p n="2271">At the close of his examination , he paused , and said :</p>
    <p n="2272"><said>“ I should like to make one thing clear . I utterly reject and disapprove of<persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>Heavywether 's insinuations against my brother . My brother , I am convinced , had no more to do with the crime than I have . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2273"><persName corresp="#Ernest_Heavywether">Sir Ernest</persName>merely smiled , and noted with a sharp eye that<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s protest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury .</p>
    <p n="2274">Then the cross-examination began .</p>
    <p n="2275"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I understand you to say that it never entered your head that the witnesses at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for that of<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>. Is not that very surprising ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2276"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ No , I do n't think so . I was told there had been a quarrel between my mother and<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, and it never occurred to me that such was not really the case . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2277"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Not when the servant<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>repeated certain fragments of the conversation — fragments which you must have recognized ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2278"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ I did not recognize them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2279"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Your memory must be unusually short ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2280"><said who="#Ernest_Heavywether">“ No , but we were both angry , and , I think , said more than we meant . I paid very little attention to my mother 's actual words . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2281"><persName corresp="#Mr._Philips">Mr. Philips</persName>’ incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill . He passed on to the subject of the note .</p>
    <p n="2282"><said who="#Mr._Philips">“ You have produced this note very opportunely . Tell me , is there nothing familiar about the hand-writing of it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2283"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Not that I know of . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2284"><said who="#Mr._Philips">“ Do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own hand-writing — carelessly disguised ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2285"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No , I do not think so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2286"><said who="#Mr._Philips">“ I put it to you that it is your own hand-writing ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2287"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2288"><said who="#Mr._Philips">“ I put it to you that , anxious to prove an alibi , you conceived the idea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment , and wrote this note yourself in order to bear out your statement ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2289"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2290"><said who="#Mr._Philips">“ Is it not a fact that , at the time you claim to have been waiting about at a solitary and unfrequented spot , you were really in the chemist 's shop in Styles St. Mary , where you purchased strychnine in the name of<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2291"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No , that is a lie . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2292"><said who="#Mr._Philips">“ I put it to you that , wearing a suit of<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>'s clothes , with a black beard trimmed to resemble his , you were there — and signed the register in his name ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2293"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ That is absolutely untrue . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2294"><said who="#Mr._Philips">“ Then I will leave the remarkable similarity of hand-writing between the note , the register , and your own , to the consideration of the jury , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Philips">Mr. Philips</persName>, and sat down with the air of a man who has done his duty , but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate perjury .</p>
    <p n="2295">After this , as it was growing late , the case was adjourned till Monday .</p>
    <p n="2296"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, I noticed , was looking profoundly discouraged . He had that little frown between the eyes that I knew so well .</p>
    <p n="2297"><said who="#Mr._Philips">“ What is it ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>? ”</said>I inquired .</p>
    <p n="2298"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah , mon ami , things are going badly , badly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2299">In spite of myself , my heart gave a leap of relief . Evidently there was a likelihood of<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>being acquitted .</p>
    <p n="2300">When we reached the house , my little friend waved aside<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>'s offer of tea .</p>
    <p n="2301"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ No , I thank you , madame . I will mount to my room . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2302">I followed him . Still frowning , he went across to the desk and took out a small pack of patience cards . Then he drew up a chair to the table , and , to my utter amazement , began solemnly to build card houses !</p>
    <p n="2303">My jaw dropped involuntarily , and he said at once :</p>
    <p n="2304"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ No , mon ami , I am not in my second childhood ! I steady my nerves , that is all . This employment requires precision of the fingers . With precision of the fingers goes precision of the brain . And never have I needed that more than now ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2305"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What is the trouble ? ”</said>I asked .</p>
    <p n="2306">With a great thump on the table ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>demolished his carefully built up edifice .</p>
    <p n="2307"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It is this , mon ami ! That I can build card houses seven stories high , but I cannot ”</said>— thump — “ find ” — thump —<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ that last link of which I spoke to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2308">I could not quite tell what to say , so I held my peace , and he began slowly building up the cards again , speaking in jerks as he did so .</p>
    <p n="2309"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It is done — so ! By placing — one card — on another — with mathematical — precision ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2310">I watched the card house rising under his hands , story by story . He never hesitated or faltered . It was really almost like a conjuring trick .</p>
    <p n="2311"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What a steady hand you 've got , ”</said>I remarked .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I believe I 've only seen your hand shake once . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2312"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ On an occasion when I was enraged , without doubt , ”</said>observed<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, with great placidity .</p>
    <p n="2313"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Yes indeed ! You were in a towering rage . Do you remember ? It was when you discovered that the lock of the despatch-case in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s bedroom had been forced . You stood by the mantel-piece , twiddling the things on it in your usual fashion , and your hand shook like a leaf ! I must say —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="2314">But I stopped suddenly . For<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, uttering a hoarse and inarticulate cry , again annihilated his masterpiece of cards , and putting his hands over his eyes swayed backwards and forwards , apparently suffering the keenest agony .</p>
    <p n="2315"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Good heavens ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>! ”</said>I cried .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ What is the matter ? Are you taken ill ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2316"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , no , ”</said>he gasped .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It is — it is — that I have an idea ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2317"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Oh ! ”</said>I exclaimed , much relieved .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ One of your ‘ little ideas ’ ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2318"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah , ma foi , no ! ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>frankly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ This time it is an idea gigantic ! Stupendous ! And you — you , my friend , have given it to me ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2319">Suddenly clasping me in his arms , he kissed me warmly on both cheeks , and before I had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room .</p>
    <p n="2320"><persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>entered at that moment .</p>
    <p n="2321"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ What is the matter with<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>? He rushed past me crying out : ‘ A garage ! For the love of Heaven , direct me to a garage , madame ! ’ And , before I could answer , he had dashed out into the street . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2322">I hurried to the window . True enough , there he was , tearing down the street , hatless , and gesticulating as he went . I turned to<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>with a gesture of despair .</p>
    <p n="2323"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ He 'll be stopped by a policeman in another minute . There he goes , round the corner ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2324">Our eyes met , and we stared helplessly at one another .</p>
    <p n="2325"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ What can be the matter ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2326">I shook my head .</p>
    <p n="2327"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I do n't know . He was building card houses , when suddenly he said he had an idea , and rushed off as you saw . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2328"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>,<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I expect he will be back before dinner . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2329">But night fell , and<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>had not returned .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="12">
    <p n="2330">POIROT 'S abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly . Sunday morning wore away , and still he did not reappear . But about three o'clock a ferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window , to see<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>alighting from a car , accompanied by<persName corresp="#Japp">Japp</persName>and<persName corresp="#Summerhaye">Summerhaye</persName>. The little man was transformed . He radiated an absurd complacency . He bowed with exaggerated respect to<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2331"><said who="#Summerhaye">“ Madame , I have your permission to hold a little reunion in the salon ? It is necessary for every one to attend . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2332"><persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>smiled sadly .</p>
    <p n="2333"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ You know ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>, that you have carte blanche in every way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2334"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You are too amiable , madame . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2335">Still beaming ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>marshalled us all into the drawing-room , bringing forward chairs as he did so .</p>
    <p n="2336"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>— here .<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>.<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>. The good<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>. And<persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>. Bien ! We must delay our proceedings a few minutes until<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>arrives . I have sent him a note . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2337"><persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>rose immediately from her seat .</p>
    <p n="2338"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ If that man comes into the house , I leave it ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2339"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , no ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>went up to her and pleaded in a low voice .</p>
    <p n="2340">Finally<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>consented to return to her chair . A few minutes later<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>entered the room .</p>
    <p n="2341">The company once assembled ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>rose from his seat with the air of a popular lecturer , and bowed politely to his audience .</p>
    <p n="2342"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Messieurs , mesdames , as you all know , I was called in by Monsieur<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>to investigate this case . I at once examined the bedroom of the deceased which , by the advice of the doctors , had been kept locked , and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy occurred . I found : first , a fragment of green material ; second , a stain on the carpet near the window , still damp ; thirdly , an empty box of bromide powders .</said></p>
    <p n="2343"><said who="#Alfred_Inglethorp">“ To take the fragment of green material first , I found it caught in the bolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one occupied by<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>. I handed the fragment over to the police who did not consider it of much importance . Nor did they recognize it for what it was — a piece torn from a green land armlet . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2344">There was a little stir of excitement .</p>
    <p n="2345"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Now there was only one person at Styles who worked on the land —<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>. Therefore it must have been<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>who entered the deceased 's room through the door communicating with<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>'s room . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2346"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ But that door was bolted on the inside ! ”</said>I cried .</p>
    <p n="2347"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ When I examined the room , yes . But in the first place we have only her word for it , since it was she who tried that particular door and reported it fastened . In the ensuing confusion she would have had ample opportunity to shoot the bolt across . I took an early opportunity of verifying my conjectures . To begin with , the fragment corresponds exactly with a tear in<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>'s armlet . Also , at the inquest ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>declared that she had heard , from her own room , the fall of the table by the bed . I took an early opportunity of testing that statement by stationing my friend Monsieur<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>in the left wing of the building , just outside<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>'s door . I myself , in company with the police , went to the deceased 's room , and whilst there I , apparently accidentally , knocked over the table in question , but found that , as I had expected , Monsieur<persName corresp="#Hastings">Hastings</persName>had heard no sound at all . This confirmed my belief that<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>was not speaking the truth when she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of the tragedy . In fact , I was convinced that , far from having been in her own room ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>was actually in the deceased 's room when the alarm was given . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2348">I shot a quick glance at<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>. She was very pale , but smiling .</p>
    <p n="2349"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I proceeded to reason on that assumption .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>is in her mother-in-law 's room . We will say that she is seeking for something and has not yet found it . Suddenly<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>awakens and is seized with an alarming paroxysm . She flings out her arm , overturning the bed table , and then pulls desperately at the bell .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>, startled , drops her candle , scattering the grease on the carpet . She picks it up , and retreats quickly to<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>'s room , closing the door behind her . She hurries out into the passage , for the servants must not find her where she is . But it is too late ! Already footsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings . What can she do ? Quick as thought , she hurries back to the young girl 's room , and starts shaking her awake . The hastily aroused household come trooping down the passage . They are all busily battering at<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s door . It occurs to nobody that<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>has not arrived with the rest , but — and this is significant — I can find no one who saw her come from the other wing . ”</said>He looked at<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary Cavendish</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Am I right , madame ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2350">She bowed her head .</p>
    <p n="2351"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Quite right , monsieur . You understand that , if I had thought I would do my husband any good by revealing these facts , I would have done so . But it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or innocence . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2352"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ In a sense , that is correct , madame . But it cleared my mind of many misconceptions , and left me free to see other facts in their true significance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2353"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ The will ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>.<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Then it was you ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>, who destroyed the will ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2354">She shook her head , and<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>shook his also .</p>
    <p n="2355"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , ”</said>he said quietly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ There is only one person who could possibly have destroyed that will —<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>herself ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2356"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Impossible ! ”</said>I exclaimed .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ She had only made it out that very afternoon ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2357"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Nevertheless , mon ami , it was<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>. Because , in no other way can you account for the fact that , on one of the hottest days of the year ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>ordered a fire to be lighted in her room . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2358">I gave a gasp . What idiots we had been never to think of that fire as being incongruous !<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>was continuing :</p>
    <p n="2359"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ The temperature on that day , messieurs , was 80 degrees in the shade . Yet<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>ordered a fire ! Why ? Because she wished to destroy something , and could think of no other way . You will remember that , in consequence of the War economics practiced at Styles , no waste paper was thrown away . There was therefore no means of destroying a thick document such as a will . The moment I heard of a fire being lighted in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s room , I leaped to the conclusion that it was to destroy some important document — possibly a will . So the discovery of the charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me . I did not , of course , know at the time that the will in question had only been made this afternoon , and I will admit that , when I learnt that fact , I fell into a grievous error . I came to the conclusion that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s determination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the quarrel she had that afternoon , and that therefore the quarrel took place after , and not before the making of the will .</said></p>
    <p n="2360"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Here , as we know , I was wrong , and I was forced to abandon that idea . I faced the problem from a new standpoint . Now , at 4 o'clock ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>overheard her mistress saying angrily : ‘ You need not think that any fear of publicity , or scandal between husband and wife will deter me . ”</said>I conjectured , and conjectured rightly , that these words were addressed , not to her husband , but to Mr.<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>. At 5 o'clock , an hour later , she uses almost the same words , but the standpoint is different . She admits to<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, ‘ I do n't know what to do ; scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing . ’ At 4 o'clock she has been angry , but completely mistress of herself . At 5 o'clock she is in violent distress , and speaks of having had a great shock .</p>
    <p n="2361"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Looking at the matter psychologically , I drew one deduction which I was convinced was correct . The second ‘ scandal ’ she spoke of was not the same as the first — and it concerned herself !</said></p>
    <p n="2362"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Let us reconstruct . At 4 o'clock ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>quarrels with her son , and threatens to denounce him to his wife — who , by the way , overheard the greater part of the conversation . At 4. 30 ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>, in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills , makes a will in favour of her husband , which the two gardeners witness . At 5 o'clock ,<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>finds her mistress in a state of considerable agitation , with a slip of paper — ‘ a letter , ’<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>thinks — in her hand , and it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted . Presumably , then , between 4. 30 and 5 o'clock , something has occurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling , since she is now as anxious to destroy the will , as she was before to make it . What was that something ?</said></p>
    <p n="2363"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ As far as we know , she was quite alone during that half-hour . Nobody entered or left that boudoir . What then occasioned this sudden change of sentiment ?</said></p>
    <p n="2364"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ One can only guess , but I believe my guess to be correct .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>had no stamps in her desk . We know this , because later she asked<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>to bring her some . Now in the opposite corner of the room stood her husband 's desk — locked . She was anxious to find some stamps , and , according to my theory , she tried her own keys in the desk . That one of them fitted I know . She therefore opened the desk , and in searching for the stamps she came across something else — that slip of paper which<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>saw in her hand , and which assuredly was never meant for<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s eyes . On the other hand ,<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>believed that the slip of paper to which her mother-in-law clung so tenaciously was a written proof of her own husband 's infidelity . She demanded it from<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>who assured her , quite truly , that it had nothing to do with that matter .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>did not believe her . She thought that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>was shielding her stepson . Now<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>is a very resolute woman , and , behind her mask of reserve , she was madly jealous of her husband . She determined to get hold of that paper at all costs , and in this resolution chance came to her aid . She happened to pick up the key of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s despatch-case , which had been lost that morning . She knew that her mother-in-law invariably kept all important papers in this particular case .</said></p>
    <p n="2365"><said who="#Dorcas">“<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>, therefore , made her plans as only a woman driven desperate through jealousy could have done . Some time in the evening she unbolted the door leading into<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>'s room . Possibly she applied oil to the hinges , for I found that it opened quite noiselessly when I tried it . She put off her project until the early hours of the morning as being safer , since the servants were accustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time . She dressed completely in her land kit , and made her way quietly through<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>'s room into that of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2366">He paused a moment , and<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>interrupted :</p>
    <p n="2367"><said who="#Cynthia">“ But I should have woken up if anyone had come through my room ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2368"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Not if you were drugged , mademoiselle . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2369"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Drugged ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2370"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Mais , oui ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2371"><said who="#Cynthia">“ You remember ”</said>— he addressed us collectively again —<said>“ that through all the tumult and noise next door<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>slept . That admitted of two possibilities . Either her sleep was feigned — which I did not believe — or her unconsciousness was indeed by artificial means .</said></p>
    <p n="2372"><said >“ With this latter idea in my mind , I examined all the coffee-cups most carefully , remembering that it was<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>who had brought<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>her coffee the night before . I took a sample from each cup , and had them analysed — with no result . I had counted the cups carefully , in the event of one having been removed . Six persons had taken coffee , and six cups were duly found . I had to confess myself mistaken .</said></p>
    <p n="2373"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Then I discovered that I had been guilty of a very grave oversight . Coffee had been brought in for seven persons , not six , for<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>had been there that evening . This changed the face of the whole affair , for there was now one cup missing . The servants noticed nothing , since<persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>, the housemaid , who took in the coffee , brought in seven cups , not knowing that<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>never drank it , whereas<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>, who cleared them away the following morning , found six as usual — or strictly speaking she found five , the sixth being the one found broken in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s room .</said></p>
    <p n="2374"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I was confident that the missing cup was that of<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>. I had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the cups found contained sugar , which<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>never took in her coffee . My attention was attracted by the story of<persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>about some ‘ salt ’ on the tray of coco which she took every night to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s room . I accordingly secured a sample of that coco , and sent it to be analysed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2375"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ But that had already been done by<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>quickly .</p>
    <p n="2376"><said who="#Cynthia">“ Not exactly . The analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine was , or was not , present . He did not have it tested , as I did , for a narcotic . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2377"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ For a narcotic ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2378"><said >“ Yes . Here is the analyst 's report .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>administered a safe , but effectual , narcotic to both<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>and<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>. And it is possible that she had a mauvais quart d'heure in consequence ! Imagine her feelings when her mother-in-law is suddenly taken ill and dies , and immediately after she hears the word ‘ Poison ’ ! She has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was perfectly harmless , but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment she must have feared that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s death lay at her door . She is seized with panic , and under its influence she hurries downstairs , and quickly drops the coffee-cup and saucer used by<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>into a large brass vase , where it is discovered later by<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>. The remains of the coco she dare not touch . Too many eyes are upon her . Guess at her relief when strychnine is mentioned , and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her doing .</said></p>
    <p n="2379"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ We are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning being so long in making their appearance . A narcotic taken with strychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2380"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>paused .<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>looked up at him , the colour slowly rising in her face .</p>
    <p n="2381"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ All you have said is quite true ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Monsieur Poirot</persName>. It was the most awful hour of my life . I shall never forget it . But you are wonderful . I understand now —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="2382"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ What I meant when I told you that you could safely confess to Papa<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, eh ? But you would not trust me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2383"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ I see everything now , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>.<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ The drugged coco , taken on top of the poisoned coffee , amply accounts for the delay . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2384"><said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ Exactly . But was the coffee poisoned , or was it not ? We come to a little difficulty here , since<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>never drank it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2385"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What ? ”</said>The cry of surprise was universal .</p>
    <p n="2386"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ No . You will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s room ? There were some peculiar points about that stain . It was still damp , it exhaled a strong odour of coffee , and imbedded in the nap of the carpet I found some little splinters of china . What had happened was plain to me , for not two minutes before I had placed my little case on the table near the window , and the table , tilting up , had deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot . In exactly the same way ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>had laid down her cup of coffee on reaching her room the night before , and the treacherous table had played her the same trick .</said></p>
    <p n="2387"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ What happened next is mere guess work on my part , but I should say that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>picked up the broken cup and placed it on the table by the bed . Feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind , she heated up her coco , and drank it off then and there . Now we are faced with a new problem . We know the coco contained no strychnine . The coffee was never drunk . Yet the strychnine must have been administered between seven and nine o'clock that evening . What third medium was there — a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that it is extraordinary no one has thought of it ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>looked round the room , and then answered himself impressively .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Her medicine ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2388"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her tonic ? ”</said>I cried .</p>
    <p n="2389"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ There was no need to introduce it . It was already there — in the mixture . The strychnine that killed<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>was the identical strychnine prescribed by<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>. To make that clear to you , I will read you an extract from a book on dispensing which I found in the Dispensary of the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster :</said></p>
    <p n="2390"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ ‘ The following prescription has become famous in text books : Strychninae Sulph . . . . . . gr. I Potass Bromide . . . . . . . 3vi Aqua ad . . . . . . . . . . . 3viii Fiat Mistura</said></p>
    <p n="2391">This solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the strychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals . A lady in England lost her life by taking a similar mixture : the precipitated strychnine collected at the bottom , and in taking the last dose she swallowed nearly all of it ! ”</p>
    <p n="2392"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Now there was , of course , no bromide in<persName corresp="#Dr._Wilkins">Dr. Wilkins</persName>’ prescription , but you will remember that I mentioned an empty box of bromide powders . One or two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine would effectually precipitate the strychnine , as the book describes , and cause it to be taken in the last dose . You will learn later that the person who usually poured out<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s medicine was always extremely careful not to shake the bottle , but to leave the sediment at the bottom of it undisturbed .</said></p>
    <p n="2393"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Throughout the case , there have been evidences that the tragedy was intended to take place on Monday evening . On that day ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s bell wire was neatly cut , and on Monday evening<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>was spending the night with friends , so that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>would have been quite alone in the right wing , completely shut off from help of any kind , and would have died , in all probability , before medical aid could have been summoned . But in her hurry to be in time for the village entertainment<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>forgot to take her medicine , and the next day she lunched away from home , so that the last — and fatal — dose was actually taken twenty-four hours later than had been anticipated by the murderer ; and it is owing to that delay that the final proof — the last link of the chain — is now in my hands . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2394">Amid breathless excitement , he held out three thin strips of paper .</p>
    <p n="2395"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ A letter in the murderer 's own hand-writing , mes amis ! Had it been a little clearer in its terms , it is possible that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>, warned in time , would have escaped . As it was , she realized her danger , but not the manner of it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2396">In the deathly silence ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>pieced together the slips of paper and , clearing his throat , read :</p>
    <p n="2397"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ ‘ Dearest Evelyn :</said></p>
    <p n="2398">‘ You will be anxious at hearing nothing . It is all right — only it will be to-night instead of last night . You understand . There 's a good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way . No one can possibly bring home the crime to me . That idea of yours about the bromides was a stroke of genius ! But we must be very circumspect . A false step —— ’</p>
    <p n="2399"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Here , my friends , the letter breaks off . Doubtless the writer was interrupted ; but there can be no question as to his identity . We all know this hand-writing and —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="2400">A howl that was almost a scream broke the silence .</p>
    <p n="2401"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You devil ! How did you get it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2402">A chair was overturned .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>skipped nimbly aside . A quick movement on his part , and his assailant fell with a crash .</p>
    <p n="2403"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Messieurs , mesdames , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, with a flourish ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ let me introduce you to the murderer , Mr.<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>! ”</said></p>

    <p n="2405">We were sitting in the library . Several hectic days lay behind us . In the room below ,<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>were together once more , while<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>and<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>were in custody . Now at last , I had<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>to myself , and could relieve my still burning curiosity .</p>
    <p n="2406"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>did not answer me for a moment , but at last he said :</p>
    <p n="2407"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I did not deceive you , mon ami . At most , I permitted you to deceive yourself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2408"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes , but why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2409"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , it is difficult to explain . You see , my friend , you have a nature so honest , and a countenance so transparent , that — enfin , to conceal your feelings is impossible ! If I had told you my ideas , the very first time you saw Mr.<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>that astute gentleman would have — in your so expressive idiom — ‘ smelt a rat ’ ! And then , bon jour to our chances of catching him ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2410"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ I think that I have more diplomacy than you give me credit for . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2411"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ My friend , ”</said>besought<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I implore you , do not enrage yourself ! Your help has been of the most invaluable . It is but the extremely beautiful nature that you have , which made me pause . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2412"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Well , ”</said>I grumbled , a little mollified .<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ I still think you might have given me a hint . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2413"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But I did , my friend . Several hints . You would not take them . Think now , did I ever say to you that I believed<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>guilty ? Did I not , on the contrary , tell you that he would almost certainly be acquitted ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2414"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes , but —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="2415"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And did I not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of bringing the murderer to justice ? Was it not plain to you that I was speaking of two entirely different persons ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2416"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ No , ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ it was not plain to me ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2417"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Then again , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>,<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ at the beginning , did I not repeat to you several times that I did n't want<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>arrested now ? That should have conveyed something to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2418"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2419"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes . To begin with , whoever else might benefit by<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s death , her husband would benefit the most . There was no getting away from that . When I went up to Styles with you that first day , I had no idea as to how the crime had been committed , but from what I knew of<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>I fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to connect him with it . When I arrived at the chateau , I realized at once that it was<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>who had burnt the will ; and there , by the way , you cannot complain , my friend , for I tried my best to force on you the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2420"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , yes , ”</said>I said impatiently .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Go on . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2421"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Well , my friend , as I say , my views as to<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>'s guilt were very much shaken . There was , in fact , so much evidence against him that I was inclined to believe that he had not done it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2422"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ When did you change your mind ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2423"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ When I found that the more efforts I made to clear him , the more efforts he made to get himself arrested . Then , when I discovered that<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>had nothing to do with<persName>Mrs. Raikes</persName>and that in fact it was<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>who was interested in that quarter , I was quite sure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2424"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2425"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Simply this . If it had been<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>who was carrying on an intrigue with<persName>Mrs. Raikes</persName>, his silence was perfectly comprehensible . But , when I discovered that it was known all over the village that it was<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>who was attracted by the farmer 's pretty wife , his silence bore quite a different interpretation . It was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid of the scandal , as no possible scandal could attach to him . This attitude of his gave me furiously to think , and I was slowly forced to the conclusion that<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>wanted to be arrested . Eh bien ! from that moment , I was equally determined that he should not be arrested . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2426"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Wait a minute . I do n't see why he wished to be arrested ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2427"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Because , mon ami , it is the law of your country that a man once acquitted can never be tried again for the same offence . Aha ! but it was clever — his idea ! Assuredly , he is a man of method . See here , he knew that in his position he was bound to be suspected , so he conceived the exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence against himself . He wished to be arrested . He would then produce his irreproachable alibi — and , hey presto , he was safe for life ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2428"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But I still do n't see how he managed to prove his alibi , and yet go to the chemist 's shop ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2429"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>stared at me in surprise .</p>
    <p n="2430"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Is it possible ? My poor friend ! You have not yet realized that it was<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>who went to the chemist 's shop ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2431"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2432"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ But , certainly . Who else ? It was most easy for her . She is of a good height , her voice is deep and manly ; moreover , remember , she and<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>are cousins , and there is a distinct resemblance between them , especially in their gait and bearing . It was simplicity itself . They are a clever pair ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2433"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was done , ”</said>I remarked .</p>
    <p n="2434"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Bon ! I will reconstruct for you as far as possible . I am inclined to think that<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>was the master mind in that affair . You remember her once mentioning that her father was a doctor ? Possibly she dispensed his medicines for him , or she may have taken the idea from one of the many books lying about when<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>was studying for her exam . Anyway , she was familiar with the fact that the addition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause the precipitation of the latter . Probably the idea came to her quite suddenly .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>had a box of bromide powders , which she occasionally took at night . What could be easier than quietly to dissolve one or more of those powders in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s large sized bottle of medicine when it came from Coot 's ? The risk is practically nil . The tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later . If anyone has seen either of them touching the medicine , they will have forgotten it by that time .<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>will have engineered her quarrel , and departed from the house . The lapse of time , and her absence , will defeat all suspicion . Yes , it was a clever idea ! If they had left it alone , it is possible the crime might never have been brought home to them . But they were not satisfied . They tried to be too clever — and that was their undoing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2435"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>puffed at his tiny cigarette , his eyes fixed on the ceiling .</p>
    <p n="2436"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ They arranged a plan to throw suspicion on<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>, by buying strychnine at the village chemist 's , and signing the register in his hand-writing .</said></p>
    <p n="2437"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ On Monday<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>will take the last dose of her medicine . On Monday , therefore , at six o'clock ,<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>arranges to be seen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village .<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and<persName>Mrs. Raikes</persName>to account for his holding his tongue afterwards . At six o'clock ,<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>, disguised as<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>, enters the chemist 's shop , with her story about a dog , obtains the strychnine , and writes the name of<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>in<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s handwriting , which she had previously studied carefully .</said></p>
    <p n="2438"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But , as it will never do if<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, too , can prove an alibi , she writes him an anonymous note — still copying his hand-writing — which takes him to a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see him .</said></p>
    <p n="2439"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ So far , all goes well .<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>goes back to Middlingham .<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>returns to Styles . There is nothing that can compromise him in any way , since it is<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>who has the strychnine , which , after all , is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>.</said></p>
    <p n="2440"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But now a hitch occurs .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>does not take her medicine that night . The broken bell ,<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>'s absence — arranged by<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>through his wife — all these are wasted . And then — he makes his slip .</said></p>
    <p n="2441"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>is out , and he sits down to write to his accomplice , who , he fears , may be in a panic at the nonsuccess of their plan . It is probable that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>returned earlier than he expected . Caught in the act , and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his desk . He fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it again , and that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>might catch sight of the letter before he could snatch it up . So he goes out and walks in the woods , little dreaming that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>will open his desk , and discover the incriminating document .</said></p>
    <p n="2442"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But this , as we know , is what happened .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>reads it , and becomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Evelyn Howard</persName>, though , unfortunately , the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to her mind . She knows that she is in danger — but is ignorant of where the danger lies . She decides to say nothing to her husband , but sits down and writes to her solicitor , asking him to come on the morrow , and she also determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just made . She keeps the fatal letter . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2443"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ It was to discover that letter , then , that her husband forced the lock of the despatch-case ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2444"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he realized its importance . That letter excepted , there was absolutely nothing to connect him with the crime . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2445"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ There 's only one thing I can n't make out , why did n't he destroy it at once when he got hold of it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2446"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all — that of keeping it on his own person . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2447"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ I do n't understand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2448"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Look at it from his point of view . I have discovered that there were only five short minutes in which he could have taken it — the five minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene , for before that time<persName corresp="#Annie">Annie</persName>was brushing the stairs , and would have seen anyone who passed going to the right wing . Figure to yourself the scene ! He enters the room , unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys — they were all much alike . He hurries to the despatch-case — it is locked , and the keys are nowhere to be seen . That is a terrible blow to him , for it means that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had hoped . But he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake of that damning piece of evidence . Quickly , he forces the lock with a penknife , and turns over the papers until he finds what he is looking for .</said></p>
    <p n="2449"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But now a fresh dilemma arises : he dare not keep that piece of paper on him . He may be seen leaving the room — he may be searched . If the paper is found on him , it is certain doom . Probably , at this minute , too , he hears the sounds below of<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>and<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>leaving the boudoir . He must act quickly . Where can he hide this terrible slip of paper ? The contents of the waste-paper-basket are kept and in any case , are sure to be examined . There are no means of destroying it ; and he dare not keep it . He looks round , and he sees — what do you think , mon ami ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2450">I shook my head .</p>
    <p n="2451"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ In a moment , he has torn the letter into long thin strips , and rolling them up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other spills in the vase on the mantle-piece . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2452">I uttered an exclamation .</p>
    <p n="2453"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No one would think of looking there , ”</said><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>continued .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And he will be able , at his leisure , to come back and destroy this solitary piece of evidence against him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2454"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Then , all the time , it was in the spill vase in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>'s bedroom , under our very noses ? ”</said>I cried .</p>
    <p n="2455"><persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>nodded .</p>
    <p n="2456"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , my friend . That is where I discovered my ‘ last link , ’ and I owe that very fortunate discovery to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2457"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ To me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2458"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes . Do you remember telling me that my hand shook as I was straightening the ornaments on the mantel-piece ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2459"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes , but I do n't see —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="2460"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , but I saw . Do you know , my friend , I remembered that earlier in the morning , when we had been there together , I had straightened all the objects on the mantel-piece . And , if they were already straightened , there would be no need to straighten them again , unless , in the meantime , some one else had touched them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2461"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Dear me , ”</said>I murmured ,<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ so that is the explanation of your extraordinary behaviour . You rushed down to Styles , and found it still there ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2462"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , and it was a race for time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2463"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ But I still can n't understand why<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>was such a fool as to leave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2464"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Ah , but he had no opportunity . I saw to that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2465"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ You ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2466"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes . Do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my confidence on the subject ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2467"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2468"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Well , my friend , I saw there was just one chance . I was not sure then if<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Inglethorp</persName>was the criminal or not , but if he was I reasoned that he would not have the paper on him , but would have hidden it somewhere , and by enlisting the sympathy of the household I could effectually prevent his destroying it . He was already under suspicion , and by making the matter public I secured the services of about ten amateur detectives , who would be watching him unceasingly , and being himself aware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy the document . He was therefore forced to depart from the house , leaving it in the spill vase . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2469"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But surely<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>had ample opportunities of aiding him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2470"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , but<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>did not know of the paper 's existence . In accordance with their prearranged plan , she never spoke to<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>. They were supposed to be deadly enemies , and until<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a meeting . Of course I had a watch kept on<persName corresp="#Inglethorp">Mr. Inglethorp</persName>, hoping that sooner or later he would lead me to the hiding-place . But he was too clever to take any chances . The paper was safe where it was ; since no one had thought of looking there in the first week , it was not likely they would do so afterwards . But for your lucky remark , we might never have been able to bring him to justice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2471"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I understand that now ; but when did you first begin to suspect<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2472"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ When I discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the letter she had received from<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2473"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Why , what was there to lie about ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2474"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ You saw that letter ? Do you recall its general appearance ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2475"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes — more or less . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2476"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ You will recollect , then , that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>wrote a very distinctive hand , and left large clear spaces between her words . But if you look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that ‘ July 17th ’ is quite different in this respect . Do you see what I mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2477"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , ”</said>I confessed ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2478"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You do not see that that letter was not written on the 17th , but on the 7th — the day after<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>'s departure ? The ‘ 1 ’ was written in before the ‘ 7 ’ to turn it into the ‘ 17th ’ . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2479"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ But why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2480"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ That is exactly what I asked myself . Why does<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>suppress the letter written on the 17th , and produce this faked one instead ? Because she did not wish to show the letter of the 17th . Why , again ? And at once a suspicion dawned in my mind . You will remember my saying that it was wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2481"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ And yet , ”</said>I cried indignantly ,<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ after that , you gave me two reasons why<persName corresp="#Evelyn_Howard">Miss Howard</persName>could not have committed the crime ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2482"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And very good reasons too , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ For a long time they were a stumbling-block to me until I remembered a very significant fact : that she and<persName corresp="#Alfred_Inglethorp">Alfred Inglethorp</persName>were cousins . She could not have committed the crime single-handed , but the reasons against that did not debar her from being an accomplice . And , then , there was that rather over-vehement hatred of hers ! It concealed a very opposite emotion . There was , undoubtedly , a tie of passion between them long before he came to Styles . They had already arranged their infamous plot — that he should marry this rich , but rather foolish old lady , induce her to make a will leaving her money to him , and then gain their ends by a very cleverly conceived crime . If all had gone as they planned , they would probably have left England , and lived together on their poor victim 's money .</said></p>
    <p n="2483"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ They are a very astute and unscrupulous pair . While suspicion was to be directed against him , she would be making quiet preparations for a very different denouement . She arrives from Middlingham with all the compromising items in her possession . No suspicion attaches to her . No notice is paid to her coming and going in the house . She hides the strychnine and glasses in<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>'s room . She puts the beard in the attic . She will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2484"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I do n't quite see why they tried to fix the blame on<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>, ”</said>I remarked .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It would have been much easier for them to bring the crime home to<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2485"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes , but that was mere chance . All the evidence against him arose out of pure accident . It must , in fact , have been distinctly annoying to the pair of schemers . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2486"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ His manner was unfortunate , ”</said>I observed thoughtfully .</p>
    <p n="2487"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes . You realize , of course , what was at the back of that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2488"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2489"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ You did not understand that he believed<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>guilty of the crime ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2490"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No , ”</said>I exclaimed , astonished .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Impossible ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2491"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Not at all . I myself nearly had the same idea . It was in my mind when I asked<persName corresp="#Mr._Wells">Mr. Wells</persName>that first question about the will . Then there were the bromide powders which she had made up , and her clever male impersonations , as<persName corresp="#Dorcas">Dorcas</persName>recounted them to us . There was really more evidence against her than anyone else . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2492"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ You are joking ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2493"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No . Shall I tell you what made<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>turn so pale when he first entered his mother 's room on the fatal night ? It was because , whilst his mother lay there , obviously poisoned , he saw , over your shoulder , that the door into<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>'s room was unbolted . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2494"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ But he declared that he saw it bolted ! ”</said>I cried .</p>
    <p n="2495"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Exactly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>dryly .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And that was just what confirmed my suspicion that it was not . He was shielding<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2496"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ But why should he shield her ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2497"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Because he is in love with her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2498">I laughed .</p>
    <p n="2499"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ There ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, you are quite wrong ! I happen to know for a fact that , far from being in love with her , he positively dislikes her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2500"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Who told you that , mon ami ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2501"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>herself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2502"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ La pauvre petite ! And she was concerned ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2503"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ She said that she did not mind at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2504"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Then she certainly did mind very much , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ They are like that — les femmes ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2505"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ What you say about<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>is a great surprise to me , ”</said>I said .</p>
    <p n="2506"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ But why ? It was most obvious . Did not<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>make the sour face every time<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>spoke and laughed with his brother ? He had taken it into his long head that<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>was in love with Monsieur<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John</persName>. When he entered his mother 's room , and saw her obviously poisoned , he jumped to the conclusion that<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Mademoiselle Cynthia</persName>knew something about the matter . He was nearly driven desperate . First he crushed the coffee-cup to powder under his feet , remembering that she had gone up with his mother the night before , and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its contents . Thenceforward , he strenuously , and quite uselessly , upheld the theory of ‘ Death from natural causes ’ . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2507"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ And what about the ‘ extra coffee-cup ’ ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2508"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I was fairly certain that it was<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mrs. Cavendish</persName>who had hidden it , but I had to make sure .<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>did not know at all what I meant ; but , on reflection , he came to the conclusion that if he could find an extra coffee-cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion . And he was perfectly right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2509"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ One thing more . What did<persName corresp="#Mrs._Inglethorp">Mrs. Inglethorp</persName>mean by her dying words ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2510"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ They were , of course , an accusation against her husband . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2511"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Dear me ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, ”</said>I said with a sigh ,<said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ I think you have explained everything .

    <p n="2512"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Thanks to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2513"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ How do you mean — thanks to you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2514"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ My dear friend , do you not realize that it was simply and solely the trial which has brought them together again ? That<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>still loved his wife , I was convinced . Also , that she was equally in love with him . But they had drifted very far apart . It all arose from a misunderstanding . She married him without love . He knew it . He is a sensitive man in his way , he would not force himself upon her if she did not want him . And , as he withdrew , her love awoke . But they are both unusually proud , and their pride held them inexorably apart . He drifted into an entanglement with<persName>Mrs. Raikes</persName>, and she deliberately cultivated the friendship of<persName corresp="#Dr._Bauerstein">Dr. Bauerstein</persName>. Do you remember the day of<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>'s arrest , when you found me deliberating over a big decision ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2515"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Yes , I quite understood your distress . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2516"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Pardon me , mon ami , but you did not understand it in the least . I was trying to decide whether or not I would clear<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>at once . I could have cleared him — though it might have meant a failure to convict the real criminals . They were entirely in the dark as to my real attitude up to the very last moment — which partly accounts for my success . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2517"><said who="#Evelyn_Howard">“ Do you mean that you could have saved<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>from being brought to trial ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2518"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , my friend . But I eventually decided in favour of ‘ a woman 's happiness ’ . Nothing but the great danger through which they have passed could have brought these two proud souls together again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2519">I looked at<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>in silent amazement . The colossal cheek of the little man ! Who on earth but<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>would have thought of a trial for murder as a restorer of conjugal happiness !</p>
    <p n="2520"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ I perceive your thoughts , mon ami , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, smiling at me .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ No one but<persName corresp="#Hercule_Poirot">Hercule Poirot</persName>would have attempted such a thing ! And you are wrong in condemning it . The happiness of one man and one woman is the greatest thing in all the world . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2521">His words took me back to earlier events . I remembered<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>as she lay white and exhausted on the sofa , listening , listening . There had come the sound of the bell below . She had started up .<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>had opened the door , and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently .<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Yes , madame , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Mary_Cavendish">“ I have brought him back to you . ”</said>He had stood aside , and as I went out I had seen the look in<persName corresp="#Mary_Cavendish">Mary</persName>'s eyes , as<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">John Cavendish</persName>had caught his wife in his arms .</p>
    <p n="2522"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Perhaps you are right ,<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, ”</said>I said gently .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes , it is the greatest thing in the world . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2523">Suddenly , there was a tap at the door , and<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>peeped in .</p>
    <p n="2524"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I — I only —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="2525"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Come in , ”</said>I said , springing up .</p>
    <p n="2526">She came in , but did not sit down .</p>
    <p n="2527"><said who="#Cynthia">“ I — only wanted to tell you something —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="2528"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Yes ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2529"><persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments , then , suddenly exclaiming :<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ You dears ! ”</said>kissed first me and then<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>, and rushed out of the room again .</p>
    <p n="2530"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ What on earth does this mean ? ”</said>I asked , surprised .</p>
    <p n="2531">It was very nice to be kissed by<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>, but the publicity of the salute rather impaired the pleasure .</p>
    <p n="2532"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ It means that she has discovered<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>does not dislike her as much as she thought , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>philosophically .</p>
    <p n="2533"><said who="#Cynthia">“ But —— ”</said></p>
    <p n="2534"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Here he is . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2535"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>at that moment passed the door .</p>
    <p n="2536"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Eh !<persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Monsieur Lawrence</persName>, ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ We must congratulate you , is it not so ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2537"><persName corresp="#John_Cavendish">Lawrence</persName>blushed , and then smiled awkwardly . A man in love is a sorry spectacle . Now<persName corresp="#Cynthia">Cynthia</persName>had looked charming .</p>
    <p n="2538">I sighed .</p>
    <p n="2539"><said who="#Cynthia">“ What is it , mon ami ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2540"><said who="#John_Cavendish">“ Nothing , ”</said>I said sadly .<said who="#John_Cavendish">“ They are two delightful women ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2541"><said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ And neither of them is for you ? ”</said>finished<persName corresp="#Monsieur_Poirot">Poirot</persName>.<said who="#Monsieur_Poirot">“ Never mind . Console yourself , my friend . We may hunt together again , who knows ? And then —— ”</said></p>
