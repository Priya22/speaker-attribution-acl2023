   <div type="chapter" n="2">
    <p n="1"><persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner . She was a blonde young lady , small , dainty , well gloved , and dressed in the most perfect taste . There was , however , a plainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited means . The dress was a sombre grayish beige , untrimmed and unbraided , and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue , relieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the side . Her face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion , but her expression was sweet and amiable , and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic . In an experience of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents , I have never looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature . I could not but observe that as she took the seat which<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>placed for her , her lip trembled , her hand quivered , and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation .</p>
    <p n="2"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I have come to you , Mr.<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ because you once enabled my employer ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">Mrs. Cecil Forrester</persName>, to unravel a little domestic complication . She was much impressed by your kindness and skill . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">Mrs. Cecil Forrester</persName>, ”</said>he repeated thoughtfully .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I believe that I was of some slight service to her . The case , however , as I remember it , was a very simple one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="4"><said who="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">“ She did not think so . But at least you cannot say the same of mine . I can hardly imagine anything more strange , more utterly inexplicable , than the situation in which I find myself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="5"><persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>rubbed his hands , and his eyes glistened . He leaned forward in his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his clear-cut , hawklike features .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ State your case , ”</said>said he , in brisk , business tones .</p>
    <p n="6">I felt that my position was an embarrassing one .<said who="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">“ You will , I am sure , excuse me , ”</said>I said , rising from my chair .</p>
    <p n="7">To my surprise , the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ If your friend , ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ would be good enough to stop , he might be of inestimable service to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="8">I relapsed into my chair .</p>
    <p n="9"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Briefly , ”</said>she continued ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ the facts are these . My father was an officer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite a child . My mother was dead , and I had no relative in England . I was placed , however , in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh , and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age . In the year 1878 my father , who was senior captain of his regiment , obtained twelve months ’ leave and came home . He telegraphed to me from London that he had arrived all safe , and directed me to come down at once , giving the Langham Hotel as his address . His message , as I remember , was full of kindness and love . On reaching London I drove to the Langham , and was informed that<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>was staying there , but that he had gone out the night before and had not yet returned . I waited all day without news of him . That night , on the advice of the manager of the hotel , I communicated with the police , and next morning we advertised in all the papers . Our inquiries led to no result ; and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father . He came home with his heart full of hope , to find some peace , some comfort , and instead — ”</said>She put her hand to her throat , and a choking sob cut short the sentence .</p>
    <p n="10"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The date ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, opening his note-book .</p>
    <p n="11"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ He disappeared upon the 3d of December , 1878 ,— nearly ten years ago . ”</said></p>
    <p n="12"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ His luggage ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="13"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Remained at the hotel . There was nothing in it to suggest a clue ,— some clothes , some books , and a considerable number of curiosities from the Andaman Islands . He had been one of the officers in charge of the convict-guard there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="14"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Had he any friends in town ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="15"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Only one that we know of ,—<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>, of his own regiment , the 34th Bombay Infantry . The major had retired some little time before , and lived at Upper Norwood . We communicated with him , of course , but he did not even know that his brother officer was in England . ”</said></p>
    <p n="16"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ A singular case , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.</p>
    <p n="17"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I have not yet described to you the most singular part . About six years ago — to be exact , upon the 4th of May , 1882 — an advertisement appeared in the Times asking for the address of Miss Mary<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward . There was no name or address appended . I had at that time just entered the family of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">Mrs. Cecil Forrester</persName>in the capacity of governess . By her advice I published my address in the advertisement column . The same day there arrived through the post a small card-board box addressed to me , which I found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl . No word of writing was enclosed . Since then every year upon the same date there has always appeared a similar box , containing a similar pearl , without any clue as to the sender . They have been pronounced by an expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value . You can see for yourselves that they are very handsome . ”</said>She opened a flat box as she spoke , and showed me six of the finest pearls that I had ever seen .</p>
    <p n="18"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Your statement is most interesting , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Has anything else occurred to you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="19"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Yes , and no later than to-day . That is why I have come to you . This morning I received this letter , which you will perhaps read for yourself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="20"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Thank you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The envelope too , please . Postmark , London , S. W . Date , July 7 . Hum ! Man 's thumb-mark on corner ,— probably postman . Best quality paper . Envelopes at sixpence a packet . Particular man in his stationery . No address . ‘ Be at the third pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven o'clock . If you are distrustful , bring two friends . You are a wronged woman , and shall have justice . Do not bring police . If you do , all will be in vain . Your unknown friend . ’ Well , really , this is a very pretty little mystery . What do you intend to do ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="21"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ That is exactly what I want to ask you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="22"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Then we shall most certainly go . You and I and — yes , why ,<persName corresp="#Dr._Watson">Dr. Watson</persName>is the very man . Your correspondent says two friends . He and I have worked together before . ”</said></p>
    <p n="23"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ But would he come ? ”</said>she asked , with something appealing in her voice and expression .</p>
    <p n="24"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I should be proud and happy , ”</said>said I , fervently ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ if I can be of any service . ”</said></p>
    <p n="25"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ You are both very kind , ”</said>she answered .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I have led a retired life , and have no friends whom I could appeal to . If I am here at six it will do , I suppose ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="26"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You must not be later , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ There is one other point , however . Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box addresses ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="27"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I have them here , ”</said>she answered , producing half a dozen pieces of paper .</p>
    <p n="28"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You are certainly a model client . You have the correct intuition . Let us see , now . ”</said>He spread out the papers upon the table , and gave little darting glances from one to the other .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ They are disguised hands , except the letter , ”</said>he said , presently ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ but there can be no question as to the authorship . See how the irrepressible Greek e will break out , and see the twirl of the final s. They are undoubtedly by the same person . I should not like to suggest false hopes ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of your father ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="29"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Nothing could be more unlike . ”</said></p>
    <p n="30"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I expected to hear you say so . We shall look out for you , then , at six . Pray allow me to keep the papers . I may look into the matter before then . It is only half-past three . Au revoir , then . ”</said></p>
    <p n="31"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Au revoir , ”</said>said our visitor , and , with a bright , kindly glance from one to the other of us , she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and hurried away . Standing at the window , I watched her walking briskly down the street , until the gray turban and white feather were but a speck in the sombre crowd .</p>
    <p n="32"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ What a very attractive woman ! ”</said>I exclaimed , turning to my companion .</p>
    <p n="33">He had lit his pipe again , and was leaning back with drooping eyelids .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Is she ? ”</said>he said , languidly .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I did not observe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="34"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You really are an automaton ,— a calculating-machine ! ”</said>I cried .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ There is something positively inhuman in you at times . ”</said></p>
    <p n="35">He smiled gently .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It is of the first importance , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ not to allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities . A client is to me a mere unit ,— a factor in a problem . The emotional qualities are antagonistic to clear reasoning . I assure you that the most winning woman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for their insurance-money , and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the London poor . ”</said></p>
    <p n="36"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ In this case , however — ”</said></p>
    <p n="37"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I never make exceptions . An exception disproves the rule . Have you ever had occasion to study character in handwriting ? What do you make of this fellow 's scribble ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="38"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ It is legible and regular , ”</said>I answered .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ A man of business habits and some force of character . ”</said></p>
    <p n="39"><persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>shook his head .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Look at his long letters , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ They hardly rise above the common herd . That d might be an a , and that l an e. Men of character always differentiate their long letters , however illegibly they may write . There is vacillation in his k 's and self-esteem in his capitals . I am going out now . I have some few references to make . Let me recommend this book ,— one of the most remarkable ever penned . It is Winwood Reade 's ‘ Martyrdom of Man . ’ I shall be back in an hour . ”</said></p>
    <p n="40">I sat in the window with the volume in my hand , but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer . My mind ran upon our late visitor ,— her smiles , the deep rich tones of her voice , the strange mystery which overhung her life . If she were seventeen at the time of her father 's disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now ,— a sweet age , when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience . So I sat and mused , until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology . What was I , an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account , that I should dare to think of such things ? She was a unit , a factor ,— nothing more . If my future were black , it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o ’ - the-wisps of the imagination .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="3">
    <p n="41">It was half-past five before<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>returned . He was bright , eager , and in excellent spirits ,— a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression .</p>
    <p n="42"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ There is no great mystery in this matter , ”</said>he said , taking the cup of tea which I had poured out for him .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The facts appear to admit of only one explanation . ”</said></p>
    <p n="43"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ What ! you have solved it already ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="44"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , that would be too much to say . I have discovered a suggestive fact , that is all . It is , however , VERY suggestive . The details are still to be added . I have just found , on consulting the back files of the Times , that<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>, of Upper Norword , late of the 34th Bombay Infantry , died upon the 28th of April , 1882 . ”</said></p>
    <p n="45"><said>“ I may be very obtuse ,<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, but I fail to see what this suggests . ”</said></p>
    <p n="46"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ No ? You surprise me . Look at it in this way , then .<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>disappears . The only person in London whom he could have visited is<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>.<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>denies having heard that he was in London . Four years later<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>dies . WITHIN A WEEK OF HIS DEATH<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>'s daughter receives a valuable present , which is repeated from year to year , and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman . What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father ? And why should the presents begin immediately after<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>'s death , unless it is that<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>'s heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation ? Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="47"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ But what a strange compensation ! And how strangely made ! Why , too , should he write a letter now , rather than six years ago ? Again , the letter speaks of giving her justice . What justice can she have ? It is too much to suppose that her father is still alive . There is no other injustice in her case that you know of . ”</said></p>
    <p n="48"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ There are difficulties ; there are certainly difficulties , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>, pensively .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ But our expedition of to-night will solve them all . Ah , here is a four-wheeler , and<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>is inside . Are you all ready ? Then we had better go down , for it is a little past the hour . ”</said></p>
    <p n="49">I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick , but I observed that<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket . It was clear that he thought that our night 's work might be a serious one .</p>
    <p n="50"><persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>was muffled in a dark cloak , and her sensitive face was composed , but pale . She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking , yet her self-control was perfect , and she readily answered the few additional questions which<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>put to her .</p>
    <p n="51"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>was a very particular friend of papa 's , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ His letters were full of allusions to the major . He and papa were in command of the troops at the Andaman Islands , so they were thrown a great deal together . By the way , a curious paper was found in papa 's desk which no one could understand . I do n't suppose that it is of the slightest importance , but I thought you might care to see it , so I brought it with me . It is here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="52"><persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee . He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens .</p>
    <p n="53"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It is paper of native Indian manufacture , ”</said>he remarked .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It has at some time been pinned to a board . The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls , corridors , and passages . At one point is a small cross done in red ink , and above it is ‘ 3. 37 from left , ’ in faded pencil-writing . In the left-hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching . Beside it is written , in very rough and coarse characters , ‘ The sign of the four ,—<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>,<persName corresp="#Mahomet_Singh">Mahomet Singh</persName>, Abdullah Khan , Dost Akbar . ’ No , I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the matter . Yet it is evidently a document of importance . It has been kept carefully in a pocket-book ; for the one side is as clean as the other . ”</said></p>
    <p n="54"><said who="#Mahomet_Singh">“ It was in his pocket-book that we found it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="55"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Preserve it carefully , then ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>, for it may prove to be of use to us . I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed . I must reconsider my ideas . ”</said>He leaned back in the cab , and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently .<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome , but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey .</p>
    <p n="56">It was a September evening , and not yet seven o'clock , but the day had been a dreary one , and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city . Mud-colored clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets . Down the Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement . The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy , vaporous air , and threw a murky , shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare . There was , to my mind , something eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light ,— sad faces and glad , haggard and merry . Like all human kind , they flitted from the gloom into the light , and so back into the gloom once more . I am not subject to impressions , but the dull , heavy evening , with the strange business upon which we were engaged , combined to make me nervous and depressed . I could see from<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>'s manner that she was suffering from the same feeling .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>alone could rise superior to petty influences . He held his open note-book upon his knee , and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern .</p>
    <p n="57">At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side-entrances . In front a continuous stream of hansoms and four-wheelers were rattling up , discharging their cargoes of shirt-fronted men and beshawled , bediamonded women . We had hardly reached the third pillar , which was our rendezvous , before a small , dark , brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us .</p>
    <p n="58"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Are you the parties who come with<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="59"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I am<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>, and these two gentlemen are my friends , ”</said>said she .</p>
    <p n="60">He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You will excuse me , miss , ”</said>he said with a certain dogged manner ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ but I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police-officer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="61"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I give you my word on that , ”</said>she answered .</p>
    <p n="62">He gave a shrill whistle , on which a street Arab led across a four-wheeler and opened the door . The man who had addressed us mounted to the box , while we took our places inside . We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse , and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets .</p>
    <p n="63">The situation was a curious one . We were driving to an unknown place , on an unknown errand . Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax ,— which was an inconceivable hypothesis ,— or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey .<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>'s demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever . I endeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan ; but , to tell the truth , I was myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were slightly involved . To this day she declares that I told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night , and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it . At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving ; but soon , what with our pace , the fog , and my own limited knowledge of London , I lost my bearings , and knew nothing , save that we seemed to be going a very long way .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>was never at fault , however , and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous by-streets .</p>
    <p n="64"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Rochester Row , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Now Vincent Square . Now we come out on the Vauxhall Bridge Road . We are making for the Surrey side , apparently . Yes , I thought so . Now we are on the bridge . You can catch glimpses of the river . ”</said></p>
    <p n="65">We did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames with the lamps shining upon the broad , silent water ; but our cab dashed on , and was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side .</p>
    <p n="66"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Wordsworth Road , ”</said>said my companion .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Priory Road . Lark Hall Lane . Stockwell Place . Robert Street . Cold Harbor Lane . Our quest does not appear to take us to very fashionable regions . ”</said></p>
    <p n="67">We had , indeed , reached a questionable and forbidding neighborhood . Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner . Then came rows of two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden , and then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings ,— the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country . At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace . None of the other houses were inhabited , and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbors , save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window . On our knocking , however , the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban , white loose-fitting clothes , and a yellow sash . There was something strangely incongruous in this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace door-way of a third-rate suburban dwelling-house .</p>
    <p n="68"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The<persName corresp="#Sahib">Sahib</persName>awaits you , ”</said>said he , and even as he spoke there came a high piping voice from some inner room .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Show them in to me , khitmutgar , ”</said>it cried .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Show them straight in to me . ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="4">
    <p n="69">We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage , ill lit and worse furnished , until he came to a door upon the right , which he threw open . A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us , and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head , a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it , and a bald , shining scalp which shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees . He writhed his hands together as he stood , and his features were in a perpetual jerk , now smiling , now scowling , but never for an instant in repose . Nature had given him a pendulous lip , and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth , which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face . In spite of his obtrusive baldness , he gave the impression of youth . In point of fact he had just turned his thirtieth year .</p>
    <p n="70"><said>“ Your servant ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>, ”</said>he kept repeating , in a thin , high voice .<said>“ Your servant , gentlemen . Pray step into my little sanctum . A small place , miss , but furnished to my own liking . An oasis of art in the howling desert of South London . ”</said></p>
    <p n="71">We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he invited us . In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass . The richest and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls , looped back here and there to expose some richly-mounted painting or Oriental vase . The carpet was of amber-and-black , so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it , as into a bed of moss . Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart it increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury , as did a huge hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner . A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room . As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odor .</p>
    <p n="72"><said>“<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName><persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>, ”</said>said the little man , still jerking and smiling .<said>“ That is my name . You are<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>, of course . And these gentlemen — ”</said></p>
    <p n="73"><said>“ This is<persName corresp="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">Mr. Sherlock Holmes</persName>, and this is<persName corresp="#Dr._Watson">Dr. Watson</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="74"><said>“ A doctor , eh ? ”</said>cried he , much excited .<said>“ Have you your stethoscope ? Might I ask you — would you have the kindness ? I have grave doubts as to my mitral valve , if you would be so very good . The aortic I may rely upon , but I should value your opinion upon the mitral . ”</said></p>
    <p n="75">I listened to his heart , as requested , but was unable to find anything amiss , save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear , for he shivered from head to foot .<said>“ It appears to be normal , ”</said>I said .<said>“ You have no cause for uneasiness . ”</said></p>
    <p n="76"><said>“ You will excuse my anxiety ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>, ”</said>he remarked , airily .<said>“ I am a great sufferer , and I have long had suspicions as to that valve . I am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted . Had your father ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart , he might have been alive now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="77">I could have struck the man across the face , so hot was I at this callous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter .<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>sat down , and her face grew white to the lips .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I knew in my heart that he was dead , ”</said>said she .</p>
    <p n="78"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I can give you every information , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ and , what is more , I can do you justice ; and I will , too , whatever Brother Bartholomew may say . I am so glad to have your friends here , not only as an escort to you , but also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say . The three of us can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew . But let us have no outsiders ,— no police or officials . We can settle everything satisfactorily among ourselves , without any interference . Nothing would annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity . ”</said>He sat down upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak , watery blue eyes .</p>
    <p n="79"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ For my part , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ whatever you may choose to say will go no further . ”</said></p>
    <p n="80">I nodded to show my agreement .</p>
    <p n="81"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ That is well ! That is well ! ”</said>said he .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ May I offer you a glass of Chianti ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>? Or of Tokay ? I keep no other wines . Shall I open a flask ? No ? Well , then , I trust that you have no objection to tobacco-smoke , to the mild balsamic odor of the Eastern tobacco . I am a little nervous , and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative . ”</said>He applied a taper to the great bowl , and the smoke bubbled merrily through the rose-water . We sat all three in a semicircle , with our heads advanced , and our chins upon our hands , while the strange , jerky little fellow , with his high , shining head , puffed uneasily in the centre .</p>
    <p n="82"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ When I first determined to make this communication to you , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I might have given you my address , but I feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you . I took the liberty , therefore , of making an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first . I have complete confidence in his discretion , and he had orders , if he were dissatisfied , to proceed no further in the matter . You will excuse these precautions , but I am a man of somewhat retiring , and I might even say refined , tastes , and there is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman . I have a natural shrinking from all forms of rough materialism . I seldom come in contact with the rough crowd . I live , as you see , with some little atmosphere of elegance around me . I may call myself a patron of the arts . It is my weakness . The landscape is a genuine Corot , and , though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa , there cannot be the least question about the Bouguereau . I am partial to the modern French school . ”</said></p>
    <p n="83"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ You will excuse me ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Sholto">Mr. Sholto</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>,<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ but I am here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell me . It is very late , and I should desire the interview to be as short as possible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="84"><said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ At the best it must take some time , ”</said>he answered ;<said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ for we shall certainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew . We shall all go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew . He is very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me . I had quite high words with him last night . You cannot imagine what a terrible fellow he is when he is angry . ”</said></p>
    <p n="85"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ If we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at once , ”</said>I ventured to remark .</p>
    <p n="86">He laughed until his ears were quite red .<said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ That would hardly do , ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ I do n't know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden way . No , I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each other . In the first place , I must tell you that there are several points in the story of which I am myself ignorant . I can only lay the facts before you as far as I know them myself .</said></p>
    <p n="87"><said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ My father was , as you may have guessed , Major John<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>, once of the Indian army . He retired some eleven years ago , and came to live at Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood . He had prospered in India , and brought back with him a considerable sum of money , a large collection of valuable curiosities , and a staff of native servants . With these advantages he bought himself a house , and lived in great luxury . My twin-brother<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew</persName>and I were the only children .</said></p>
    <p n="88"><said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the disappearance of<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>. We read the details in the papers , and , knowing that he had been a friend of our father 's , we discussed the case freely in his presence . He used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened . Never for an instant did we suspect that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast ,— that of all men he alone knew the fate of Arthur<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>.</said></p>
    <p n="89"><said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ We did know , however , that some mystery — some positive danger — overhung our father . He was very fearful of going out alone , and he always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge . Williams , who drove you to-night , was one of them . He was once light-weight champion of England . Our father would never tell us what it was he feared , but he had a most marked aversion to men with wooden legs . On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden-legged man , who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders . We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up . My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father 's , but events have since led us to change our opinion .</said></p>
    <p n="90"><said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great shock to him . He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened it , and from that day he sickened to his death . What was in the letter we could never discover , but I could see as he held it that it was short and written in a scrawling hand . He had suffered for years from an enlarged spleen , but he now became rapidly worse , and towards the end of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope , and that he wished to make a last communication to us .</said></p>
    <p n="91"><said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ When we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing heavily . He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side of the bed . Then , grasping our hands , he made a remarkable statement to us , in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain . I shall try and give it to you in his own very words .</said></p>
    <p n="92"><said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ ‘ I have only one thing , ’ he said , ‘ which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment . It is my treatment of poor<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>'s orphan . The cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her the treasure , half at least of which should have been hers . And yet I have made no use of it myself ,— so blind and foolish a thing is avarice . The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I could not bear to share it with another . See that chaplet dipped with pearls beside the quinine-bottle . Even that I could not bear to part with , although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her . You , my sons , will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure . But send her nothing — not even the chaplet — until I am gone . After all , men have been as bad as this and have recovered .</said></p>
    <p n="93"><said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ ‘ I will tell you how<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>died , ’ he continued . ‘ He had suffered for years from a weak heart , but he concealed it from every one . I alone knew it . When in India , he and I , through a remarkable chain of circumstances , came into possession of a considerable treasure . I brought it over to England , and on the night of<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>'s arrival he came straight over here to claim his share . He walked over from the station , and was admitted by my faithful Lal Chowdar , who is now dead .<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure , and we came to heated words .<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>had sprung out of his chair in a paroxysm of anger , when he suddenly pressed his hand to his side , his face turned a dusky hue , and he fell backwards , cutting his head against the corner of the treasure-chest . When I stooped over him I found , to my horror , that he was dead .</said></p>
    <p n="94"><said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ ‘ For a long time I sat half distracted , wondering what I should do . My first impulse was , of course , to call for assistance ; but I could not but recognize that there was every chance that I would be accused of his murder . His death at the moment of a quarrel , and the gash in his head , would be black against me . Again , an official inquiry could not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure , which I was particularly anxious to keep secret . He had told me that no soul upon earth knew where he had gone . There seemed to be no necessity why any soul ever should know .</said></p>
    <p n="95">“ ‘ I was still pondering over the matter , when , looking up , I saw my servant , Lal Chowdar , in the doorway . He stole in and bolted the door behind him .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Do not fear ,<persName corresp="#Sahib">Sahib</persName>, ”</said>he said .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ No one need know that you have killed him . Let us hide him away , and who is the wiser ? ”</said>“ I did not kill him , ” said I. Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I heard it all ,<persName corresp="#Sahib">Sahib</persName>, ”</said>said he .<said who="#Morstan">“ I heard you quarrel , and I heard the blow . But my lips are sealed . All are asleep in the house . Let us put him away together . ”</said>That was enough to decide me . If my own servant could not believe my innocence , how could I hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box ? Lal Chowdar and I disposed of the body that night , and within a few days the London papers were full of the mysterious disappearance of<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>. You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter . My fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only the body , but also the treasure , and that I have clung to<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>'s share as well as to my own . I wish you , therefore , to make restitution . Put your ears down to my mouth . The treasure is hidden in — ’ At this instant a horrible change came over his expression ; his eyes stared wildly , his jaw dropped , and he yelled , in a voice which I can never forget , ‘ Keep him out ! For Christ 's sake keep him out ! ’ We both stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed . A face was looking in at us out of the darkness . We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass . It was a bearded , hairy face , with wild cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence . My brother and I rushed towards the window , but the man was gone . When we returned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat .</p>
    <p n="96"><said who="#Sahib">“ We searched the garden that night , but found no sign of the intruder , save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower-bed . But for that one trace , we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild , fierce face . We soon , however , had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us . The window of my father 's room was found open in the morning , his cupboards and boxes had been rifled , and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper , with the words ‘ The sign of the four ’ scrawled across it . What the phrase meant , or who our secret visitor may have been , we never knew . As far as we can judge , none of my father 's property had been actually stolen , though everything had been turned out . My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life ; but it is still a complete mystery to us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="97">The little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully for a few moments . We had all sat absorbed , listening to his extraordinary narrative . At the short account of her father 's death<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>had turned deadly white , and for a moment I feared that she was about to faint . She rallied however , on drinking a glass of water which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon the side-table .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>leaned back in his chair with an abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes . As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life . Here at least was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost .<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName><persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect which his story had produced , and then continued between the puffs of his overgrown pipe .</p>
    <p n="98"><said who="#Sholto">“ My brother and I , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Sholto">“ were , as you may imagine , much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of . For weeks and for months we dug and delved in every part of the garden , without discovering its whereabouts . It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died . We could judge the splendor of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out . Over this chaplet my brother<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew</persName>and I had some little discussion . The pearls were evidently of great value , and he was averse to part with them , for , between friends , my brother was himself a little inclined to my father 's fault . He thought , too , that if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble . It was all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>'s address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals , so that at least she might never feel destitute . ”</said></p>
    <p n="99"><said who="#Mr._Thaddeus">“ It was a kindly thought , ”</said>said our companion , earnestly .<said who="#Mr._Thaddeus">“ It was extremely good of you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="100">The little man waved his hand deprecatingly .<said who="#Sholto">“ We were your trustees , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Sholto">“ That was the view which I took of it , though Brother Bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light . We had plenty of money ourselves . I desired no more . Besides , it would have been such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion . ‘ Le mauvais gout mene au crime . ’ The French have a very neat way of putting these things . Our difference of opinion on this subject went so far that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself : so I left Pondicherry Lodge , taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me . Yesterday , however , I learn that an event of extreme importance has occurred . The treasure has been discovered . I instantly communicated with<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood and demand our share . I explained my views last night to Brother Bartholomew : so we shall be expected , if not welcome , visitors . ”</said></p>
    <p n="101"><persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName><persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>ceased , and sat twitching on his luxurious settee . We all remained silent , with our thoughts upon the new development which the mysterious business had taken .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>was the first to spring to his feet .</p>
    <p n="102"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You have done well , sir , from first to last , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It is possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you . But , as<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>remarked just now , it is late , and we had best put the matter through without delay . ”</said></p>
    <p n="103">Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his hookah , and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged topcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs . This he buttoned tightly up , in spite of the extreme closeness of the night , and finished his attire by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the ears , so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky face .<said who="#Sholto">“ My health is somewhat fragile , ”</said>he remarked , as he led the way down the passage .<said who="#Sholto">“ I am compelled to be a valetudinarian . ”</said></p>
    <p n="104">Our cab was awaiting us outside , and our programme was evidently prearranged , for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace .<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus Sholto</persName>talked incessantly , in a voice which rose high above the rattle of the wheels .</p>
    <p n="105"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew</persName>is a clever fellow , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ How do you think he found out where the treasure was ? He had come to the conclusion that it was somewhere indoors : so he worked out all the cubic space of the house , and made measurements everywhere , so that not one inch should be unaccounted for . Among other things , he found that the height of the building was seventy-four feet , but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms , and making every allowance for the space between , which he ascertained by borings , he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet . There were four feet unaccounted for . These could only be at the top of the building . He knocked a hole , therefore , in the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room , and there , sure enough , he came upon another little garret above it , which had been sealed up and was known to no one . In the centre stood the treasure-chest , resting upon two rafters . He lowered it through the hole , and there it lies . He computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling . ”</said></p>
    <p n="106">At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open-eyed .<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>, could we secure her rights , would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in England . Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news ; yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul , and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me . I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation , and then sat downcast , with my head drooped , deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance . He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac , and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms , and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums , some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket . I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil , while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative . However that may be , I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door .</p>
    <p n="107"><said who="#Mr._Thaddeus">“ This ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>, is Pondicherry Lodge , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName><persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>, as he handed her out .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="5">
    <p n="108">It was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our night 's adventures . We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us , and the night was fairly fine . A warm wind blew from the westward , and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky , with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts . It was clear enough to see for some distance , but<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus Sholto</persName>took down one of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way .</p>
    <p n="109">Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds , and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass . A single narrow iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance . On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat .</p>
    <p n="110"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ Who is there ? ”</said>cried a gruff voice from within .</p>
    <p n="111"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ It is I , McMurdo . You surely know my knock by this time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="112">There was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys . The door swung heavily back , and a short , deep-chested man stood in the opening , with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his protruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes .</p>
    <p n="113"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ That you ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName>? But who are the others ? I had no orders about them from the master . ”</said></p>
    <p n="114"><said who="#Mr._Thaddeus">“ No , McMurdo ? You surprise me ! I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends . ”</said></p>
    <p n="115"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ He ai n't been out o ’ his room to-day ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName>, and I have no orders . You know very well that I must stick to regulations . I can let you in , but your friends must just stop where they are . ”</said></p>
    <p n="116">This was an unexpected obstacle .<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus Sholto</persName>looked about him in a perplexed and helpless manner .<said who="#Mr._Thaddeus">“ This is too bad of you , McMurdo ! ”</said>he said .<said who="#Mr._Thaddeus">“ If I guarantee them , that is enough for you . There is the young lady , too . She cannot wait on the public road at this hour . ”</said></p>
    <p n="117"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ Very sorry ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName>, ”</said>said the porter , inexorably .<said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ Folk may be friends o ’ yours , and yet no friends o ’ the master 's . He pays me well to do my duty , and my duty I 'll do . I do n't know none o ’ your friends . ”</said></p>
    <p n="118"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Oh , yes you do , McMurdo , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>, genially .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I do n't think you can have forgotten me . Do n't you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison 's rooms on the night of your benefit four years back ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="119"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ Not<persName corresp="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">Mr. Sherlock Holmes</persName>! ”</said>roared the prize-fighter .<said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ God 's truth ! how could I have mistook you ? If instead o ’ standin ’ there so quiet you had just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw , I 'd ha ’ known you without a question . Ah , you 're one that has wasted your gifts , you have ! You might have aimed high , if you had joined the fancy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="120"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You see ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>, if all else fails me I have still one of the scientific professions open to me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, laughing .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Our friend wo n't keep us out in the cold now , I am sure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="121"><said who="#Watson">“ In you come , sir , in you come ,— you and your friends , ”</said>he answered .<said who="#Watson">“ Very sorry ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName>, but orders are very strict . Had to be certain of your friends before I let them in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="122">Inside , a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of a house , square and prosaic , all plunged in shadow save where a moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window . The vast size of the building , with its gloom and its deathly silence , struck a chill to the heart . Even<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus Sholto</persName>seemed ill at ease , and the lantern quivered and rattled in his hand .</p>
    <p n="123"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ I cannot understand it , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ There must be some mistake . I distinctly told<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew</persName>that we should be here , and yet there is no light in his window . I do not know what to make of it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="124"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Does he always guard the premises in this way ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.</p>
    <p n="125"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ Yes ; he has followed my father 's custom . He was the favorite son , you know , and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me . That is<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew</persName>'s window up there where the moonshine strikes . It is quite bright , but there is no light from within , I think . ”</said></p>
    <p n="126"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ None , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ But I see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door . ”</said></p>
    <p n="127"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ Ah , that is the housekeeper 's room . That is where old<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bernstone">Mrs. Bernstone</persName>sits . She can tell us all about it . But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two , for if we all go in together and she has no word of our coming she may be alarmed . But hush ! what is that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="128">He held up the lantern , and his hand shook until the circles of light flickered and wavered all round us .<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>seized my wrist , and we all stood with thumping hearts , straining our ears . From the great black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sounds ,— the shrill , broken whimpering of a frightened woman .</p>
    <p n="129"><said who="#Sholto">“ It is<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bernstone">Mrs. Bernstone</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>.<said who="#Sholto">“ She is the only woman in the house . Wait here . I shall be back in a moment . ”</said>He hurried for the door , and knocked in his peculiar way . We could see a tall old woman admit him , and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him .</p>
    <p n="130"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName>, sir , I am so glad you have come ! I am so glad you have come ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName>, sir ! ”</said>We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone .</p>
    <p n="131">Our guide had left us the lantern .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>swung it slowly round , and peered keenly at the house , and at the great rubbish-heaps which cumbered the grounds .<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>and I stood together , and her hand was in mine . A wondrous subtle thing is love , for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day , between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed , and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other . I have marvelled at it since , but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her so , and , as she has often told me , there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection . So we stood hand in hand , like two children , and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us .</p>
    <p n="132"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ What a strange place ! ”</said>she said , looking round .</p>
    <p n="133"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it . I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat , where the prospectors had been at work . ”</said></p>
    <p n="134"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ And from the same cause , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ These are the traces of the treasure-seekers . You must remember that they were six years looking for it . No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit . ”</said></p>
    <p n="135">At that moment the door of the house burst open , and<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus Sholto</persName>came running out , with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes .</p>
    <p n="136"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ There is something amiss with<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew</persName>! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ I am frightened ! My nerves cannot stand it . ”</said>He was , indeed , half blubbering with fear , and his twitching feeble face peeping out from the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrified child .</p>
    <p n="137"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Come into the house , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, in his crisp , firm way .</p>
    <p n="138"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ Yes , do ! ”</said>pleaded<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus Sholto</persName>.<said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ I really do not feel equal to giving directions . ”</said></p>
    <p n="139">We all followed him into the housekeeper 's room , which stood upon the left-hand side of the passage . The old woman was pacing up and down with a scared look and restless picking fingers , but the sight of<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>appeared to have a soothing effect upon her .</p>
    <p n="140"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ God bless your sweet calm face ! ”</said>she cried , with an hysterical sob .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ It does me good to see you . Oh , but I have been sorely tried this day ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="141">Our companion patted her thin , work-worn hand , and murmured some few words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the color back into the others bloodless cheeks .</p>
    <p n="142"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Master has locked himself in and will not answer me , ”</said>she explained .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ All day I have waited to hear from him , for he often likes to be alone ; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss , so I went up and peeped through the key-hole . You must go up ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName>,— you must go up and look for yourself . I have seen Mr.<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew Sholto</persName>in joy and in sorrow for ten long years , but I never saw him with such a face on him as that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="143"><persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>took the lamp and led the way , for<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus Sholto</persName>'s teeth were chattering in his head . So shaken was he that I had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs , for his knees were trembling under him . Twice as we ascended<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>whipped his lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served as a stair-carpet . He walked slowly from step to step , holding the lamp , and shooting keen glances to right and left .<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper .</p>
    <p n="144">The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length , with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way , while we kept close at his heels , with our long black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor . The third door was that which we were seeking .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>knocked without receiving any answer , and then tried to turn the handle and force it open . It was locked on the inside , however , and by a broad and powerful bolt , as we could see when we set our lamp up against it . The key being turned , however , the hole was not entirely closed .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>bent down to it , and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath .</p>
    <p n="145"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ There is something devilish in this ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>, ”</said>said he , more moved than I had ever before seen him .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ What do you make of it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="146">I stooped to the hole , and recoiled in horror . Moonlight was streaming into the room , and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance . Looking straight at me , and suspended , as it were , in the air , for all beneath was in shadow , there hung a face ,— the very face of our companion<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus</persName>. There was the same high , shining head , the same circular bristle of red hair , the same bloodless countenance . The features were set , however , in a horrible smile , a fixed and unnatural grin , which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion . So like was the face to that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was indeed with us . Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins .</p>
    <p n="147"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ This is terrible ! ”</said>I said to<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ What is to be done ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="148"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The door must come down , ”</said>he answered , and , springing against it , he put all his weight upon the lock . It creaked and groaned , but did not yield . Together we flung ourselves upon it once more , and this time it gave way with a sudden snap , and we found ourselves within<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew Sholto</persName>'s chamber .</p>
    <p n="149">It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory . A double line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door , and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners , test-tubes , and retorts . In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets . One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken , for a stream of dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it , and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent , tar-like odor . A set of steps stood at one side of the room , in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster , and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through . At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together .</p>
    <p n="150">By the table , in a wooden arm-chair , the master of the house was seated all in a heap , with his head sunk upon his left shoulder , and that ghastly , inscrutable smile upon his face . He was stiff and cold , and had clearly been dead many hours . It seemed to me that not only his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion . By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument ,— a brown , close-grained stick , with a stone head like a hammer , rudely lashed on with coarse twine . Beside it was a torn sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>glanced at it , and then handed it to me .</p>
    <p n="151"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You see , ”</said>he said , with a significant raising of the eyebrows .</p>
    <p n="152">In the light of the lantern I read , with a thrill of horror ,<said who="#Bartholomew_Sholto">“ The sign of the four . ”</said></p>
    <p n="153"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ In God 's name , what does it all mean ? ”</said>I asked .</p>
    <p n="154"><said who="#Bartholomew_Sholto">“ It means murder , ”</said>said he , stooping over the dead man .<said who="#Bartholomew_Sholto">“ Ah , I expected it . Look here ! ”</said>He pointed to what looked like a long , dark thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear .</p>
    <p n="155"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It looks like a thorn , ”</said>said I .</p>
    <p n="156"><said who="#Bartholomew_Sholto">“ It is a thorn . You may pick it out . But be careful , for it is poisoned . ”</said></p>
    <p n="157">I took it up between my finger and thumb . It came away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark was left behind . One tiny speck of blood showed where the puncture had been .</p>
    <p n="158"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ This is all an insoluble mystery to me , ”</said>said I .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It grows darker instead of clearer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="159"><said who="#Bartholomew_Sholto">“ On the contrary , ”</said>he answered ,<said who="#Bartholomew_Sholto">“ it clears every instant . I only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case . ”</said></p>
    <p n="160">We had almost forgotten our companion 's presence since we entered the chamber . He was still standing in the door-way , the very picture of terror , wringing his hands and moaning to himself . Suddenly , however , he broke out into a sharp , querulous cry .</p>
    <p n="161"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The treasure is gone ! ”</said>he said .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ They have robbed him of the treasure ! There is the hole through which we lowered it . I helped him to do it ! I was the last person who saw him ! I left him here last night , and I heard him lock the door as I came down-stairs . ”</said></p>
    <p n="162"><said who="#Bartholomew_Sholto">“ What time was that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="163"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It was ten o'clock . And now he is dead , and the police will be called in , and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it . Oh , yes , I am sure I shall . But you do n't think so , gentlemen ? Surely you do n't think that it was I ? Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I ? Oh , dear ! oh , dear ! I know that I shall go mad ! ”</said>He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy .</p>
    <p n="164"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You have no reason for fear ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Sholto">Mr. Sholto</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, kindly , putting his hand upon his shoulder .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Take my advice , and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police . Offer to assist them in every way . We shall wait here until your return . ”</said></p>
    <p n="165">The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion , and we heard him stumbling down the stairs in the dark .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="6">
    <p n="166"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Now ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, rubbing his hands ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ we have half an hour to ourselves . Let us make good use of it . My case is , as I have told you , almost complete ; but we must not err on the side of over-confidence . Simple as the case seems now , there may be something deeper underlying it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="167"><said who="#Watson">“ Simple ! ”</said>I ejaculated .</p>
    <p n="168"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Surely , ”</said>said he , with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his class .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Just sit in the corner there , that your footprints may not complicate matters . Now to work ! In the first place , how did these folk come , and how did they go ? The door has not been opened since last night . How of the window ? ”</said>He carried the lamp across to it , muttering his observations aloud the while , but addressing them to himself rather than to me .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Window is snibbed on the inner side . Framework is solid . No hinges at the side . Let us open it . No water-pipe near . Roof quite out of reach . Yet a man has mounted by the window . It rained a little last night . Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill . And here is a circular muddy mark , and here again upon the floor , and here again by the table . See here ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>! This is really a very pretty demonstration . ”</said></p>
    <p n="169">I looked at the round , well-defined muddy discs .<said who="#Watson">“ This is not a footmark , ”</said>said I .</p>
    <p n="170"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It is something much more valuable to us . It is the impression of a wooden stump . You see here on the sill is the boot-mark , a heavy boot with the broad metal heel , and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="171"><said who="#Watson">“ It is the wooden-legged man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="172"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Quite so . But there has been some one else ,— a very able and efficient ally . Could you scale that wall , doctor ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="173">I looked out of the open window . The moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house . We were a good sixty feet from the round , and , look where I would , I could see no foothold , nor as much as a crevice in the brick-work .</p>
    <p n="174"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It is absolutely impossible , ”</said>I answered .</p>
    <p n="175"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Without aid it is so . But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner , securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall . Then , I think , if you were an active man , You might swarm up , wooden leg and all . You would depart , of course , in the same fashion , and your ally would draw up the rope , untie it from the hook , shut the window , snib it on the inside , and get away in the way that he originally came . As a minor point it may be noted , ”</said>he continued , fingering the rope ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ that our wooden-legged friend , though a fair climber , was not a professional sailor . His hands were far from horny . My lens discloses more than one blood-mark , especially towards the end of the rope , from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="176"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ This is all very well , ”</said>said I ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever . How about this mysterious ally ? How came he into the room ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="177"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Yes , the ally ! ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, pensively .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ There are features of interest about this ally . He lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace . I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country ,— though parallel cases suggest themselves from India , and , if my memory serves me , from Senegambia . ”</said></p>
    <p n="178"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ How came he , then ? ”</said>I reiterated .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The door is locked , the window is inaccessible . Was it through the chimney ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="179"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The grate is much too small , ”</said>he answered .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I had already considered that possibility . ”</said></p>
    <p n="180"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ How then ? ”</said>I persisted .</p>
    <p n="181"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You will not apply my precept , ”</said>he said , shaking his head .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains , HOWEVER IMPROBABLE , must be the truth ? We know that he did not come through the door , the window , or the chimney . We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room , as there is no concealment possible . Whence , then , did he come ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="182"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ He came through the hole in the roof , ”</said>I cried .</p>
    <p n="183"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Of course he did . He must have done so . If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me , we shall now extend our researches to the room above ,— the secret room in which the treasure was found . ”</said></p>
    <p n="184">He mounted the steps , and , seizing a rafter with either hand , he swung himself up into the garret . Then , lying on his face , he reached down for the lamp and held it while I followed him .</p>
    <p n="185">The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and six the other . The floor was formed by the rafters , with thin lath-and-plaster between , so that in walking one had to step from beam to beam . The roof ran up to an apex , and was evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house . There was no furniture of any sort , and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor .</p>
    <p n="186"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Here you are , you see , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>, putting his hand against the sloping wall .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ This is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof . I can press it back , and here is the roof itself , sloping at a gentle angle . This , then , is the way by which Number One entered . Let us see if we can find any other traces of his individuality . ”</said></p>
    <p n="187">He held down the lamp to the floor , and as he did so I saw for the second time that night a startled , surprised look come over his face . For myself , as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes . The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot ,— clear , well defined , perfectly formed , but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man .</p>
    <p n="188"><said>“<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, ”</said>I said , in a whisper ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ a child has done the horrid thing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="189">He had recovered his self-possession in an instant .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I was staggered for the moment , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ but the thing is quite natural . My memory failed me , or I should have been able to foretell it . There is nothing more to be learned here . Let us go down . ”</said></p>
    <p n="190"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ What is your theory , then , as to those footmarks ? ”</said>I asked , eagerly , when we had regained the lower room once more .</p>
    <p n="191"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>, try a little analysis yourself , ”</said>said he , with a touch of impatience .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You know my methods . Apply them , and it will be instructive to compare results . ”</said></p>
    <p n="192"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts , ”</said>I answered .</p>
    <p n="193"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It will be clear enough to you soon , ”</said>he said , in an off-hand way .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I think that there is nothing else of importance here , but I will look . ”</said>He whipped out his lens and a tape measure , and hurried about the room on his knees , measuring , comparing , examining , with his long thin nose only a few inches from the planks , and his beady eyes gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird . So swift , silent , and furtive were his movements , like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent , that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law , instead of exerting them in its defense . As he hunted about , he kept muttering to himself , and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight .</p>
    <p n="194"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ We are certainly in luck , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ We ought to have very little trouble now . Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the creosote . You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil-smelling mess . The carboy has been cracked , You see , and the stuff has leaked out . ”</said></p>
    <p n="195"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ What then ? ”</said>I asked .</p>
    <p n="196"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Why , we have got him , that 's all , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I know a dog that would follow that scent to the world 's end . If a pack can track a trailed herring across a shire , how far can a specially-trained hound follow so pungent a smell as this ? It sounds like a sum in the rule of three . The answer should give us the — But halloo ! here are the accredited representatives of the law . ”</said></p>
    <p n="197">Heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below , and the hall door shut with a loud crash .</p>
    <p n="198"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Before they come , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ just put your hand here on this poor fellow 's arm , and here on his leg . What do you feel ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="199"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The muscles are as hard as a board , ”</said>I answered .</p>
    <p n="200"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Quite so . They are in a state of extreme contraction , far exceeding the usual rigor mortis . Coupled with this distortion of the face , this Hippocratic smile , or ‘ risus sardonicus , ’ as the old writers called it , what conclusion would it suggest to your mind ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="201"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid , ”</said>I answered ,— “ some strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus . ”</p>
    <p n="202"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face . On getting into the room I at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system . As you saw , I discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp . You observe that the part struck was that which would be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his chair . Now examine the thorn . ”</said></p>
    <p n="203">I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern . It was long , sharp , and black , with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried upon it . The blunt end had been trimmed and rounded off with a knife .</p>
    <p n="204"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Is that an English thorn ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="205"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ No , it certainly is not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="206"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference . But here are the regulars : so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat . ”</said></p>
    <p n="207">As he spoke , the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on the passage , and a very stout , portly man in a gray suit strode heavily into the room . He was red-faced , burly and plethoric , with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouches . He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform , and by the still palpitating<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus Sholto</persName>.</p>
    <p n="208"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ Here 's a business ! ”</said>he cried , in a muffled , husky voice .<said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ Here 's a pretty business ! But who are all these ? Why , the house seems to be as full as a rabbit-warren ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="209"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I think you must recollect me ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">Mr. Athelney Jones</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, quietly .</p>
    <p n="210"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ Why , of course I do ! ”</said>he wheezed .<said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ It 's<persName corresp="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">Mr. Sherlock Holmes</persName>, the theorist . Remember you ! I 'll never forget how you lectured us all on causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case . It 's true you set us on the right track ; but you 'll own now that it was more by good luck than good guidance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="211"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It was a piece of very simple reasoning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="212"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ Oh , come , now , come ! Never be ashamed to own up . But what is all this ? Bad business ! Bad business ! Stern facts here ,— no room for theories . How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case ! I was at the station when the message arrived . What d'you think the man died of ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="213"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Oh , this is hardly a case for me to theorize over , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, dryly .</p>
    <p n="214"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ No , no . Still , we can n't deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes . Dear me ! Door locked , I understand . Jewels worth half a million missing . How was the window ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="215"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Fastened ; but there are steps on the sill . ”</said></p>
    <p n="216"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ Well , well , if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with the matter . That 's common sense . Man might have died in a fit ; but then the jewels are missing . Ha ! I have a theory . These flashes come upon me at times .— Just step outside , sergeant , and you ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Sholto">Mr. Sholto</persName>. Your friend can remain .— What do you think of this ,<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>?<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>was , on his own confession , with his brother last night . The brother died in a fit , on which<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>walked off with the treasure . How 's that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="217"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside . ”</said></p>
    <p n="218"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ Hum ! There 's a flaw there . Let us apply common sense to the matter . This<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus Sholto</persName>WAS with his brother ; there WAS a quarrel ; so much we know . The brother is dead and the jewels are gone . So much also we know . No one saw the brother from the time<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus</persName>left him . His bed had not been slept in .<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus</persName>is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind . His appearance is — well , not attractive . You see that I am weaving my web round<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus</persName>. The net begins to close upon him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="219"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You are not quite in possession of the facts yet , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ This splinter of wood , which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned , was in the man 's scalp where you still see the mark ; this card , inscribed as you see it , was on the table ; and beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed instrument . How does all that fit into your theory ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="220"><said who="#Thaddeus_Sholto">“ Confirms it in every respect , ”</said>said the fat detective , pompously .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ House is full of Indian curiosities .<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus</persName>brought this up , and if this splinter be poisonous<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus</persName>may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man . The card is some hocus-pocus ,— a blind , as like as not . The only question is , how did he depart ? Ah , of course , here is a hole in the roof . ”</said>With great activity , considering his bulk , he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret , and immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap-door .</p>
    <p n="221"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ He can find something , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, shrugging his shoulders .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ He has occasional glimmerings of reason . Il n'y a pas des sots si incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="222"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ You see ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Athelney_Jones">Athelney Jones</persName>, reappearing down the steps again .<said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Facts are better than mere theories , after all . My view of the case is confirmed . There is a trap-door communicating with the roof , and it is partly open . ”</said></p>
    <p n="223"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It was I who opened it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="224"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Oh , indeed ! You did notice it , then ? ”</said>He seemed a little crestfallen at the discovery .<said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Well , whoever noticed it , it shows how our gentleman got away . Inspector ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="225"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Yes , sir , ”</said>from the passage .</p>
    <p n="226"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Ask<persName corresp="#Mr._Sholto">Mr. Sholto</persName>to step this way .— Mr .<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>, it is my duty to inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you . I arrest you in the queen 's name as being concerned in the death of your brother . ”</said></p>
    <p n="227"><said who="#Sholto">“ There , now ! Did n't I tell you ! ”</said>cried the poor little man , throwing out his hands , and looking from one to the other of us .</p>
    <p n="228"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Do n't trouble yourself about it ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Sholto">Mr. Sholto</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I think that I can engage to clear you of the charge . ”</said></p>
    <p n="229"><said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ Do n't promise too much , Mr . Theorist ,— do n't promise too much ! ”</said>snapped the detective .<said who="#Mr._Sholto">“ You may find it a harder matter than you think . ”</said></p>
    <p n="230"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Not only will I clear him , Mr.<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>, but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night . His name , I have every reason to believe , is<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>. He is a poorly-educated man , small , active , with his right leg off , and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side . His left boot has a coarse , square-toed sole , with an iron band round the heel . He is a middle-aged man , much sunburned , and has been a convict . These few indications may be of some assistance to you , coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand . The other man — ”</said></p>
    <p n="231">“ Ah ! the other man —? ” asked<persName corresp="#Athelney_Jones">Athelney Jones</persName>, in a sneering voice , but impressed none the less , as I could easily see , by the precision of the other 's manner .</p>
    <p n="232"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Is a rather curious person , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>, turning upon his heel .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them .— A word with you ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="233">He led me out to the head of the stair .<said who="#Watson">“ This unexpected occurrence , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Watson">“ has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey . ”</said></p>
    <p n="234"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I have just been thinking so , ”</said>I answered .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It is not right that<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>should remain in this stricken house . ”</said></p>
    <p n="235"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ No . You must escort her home . She lives with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">Mrs. Cecil Forrester</persName>, in Lower Camberwell : so it is not very far . I will wait for you here if you will drive out again . Or perhaps you are too tired ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="236"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ By no means . I do n't think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business . I have seen something of the rough side of life , but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to-night has shaken my nerve completely . I should like , however , to see the matter through with you , now that I have got so far . ”</said></p>
    <p n="237"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Your presence will be of great service to me , ”</said>he answered .<said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ We shall work the case out independently , and leave this fellow<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>to exult over any mare'shYpppHeNnest which he may choose to construct . When you have dropped<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>I wish you to go on to No . 3 Pinchin Lane , down near the water 's edge at Lambeth . The third house on the right-hand side is a bird-stuffer 's : Sherman is the name . You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window . Knock old Sherman up , and tell him , with my compliments , that I want<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>at once . You will bring<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>back in the cab with you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="238"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ A dog , I suppose . ”</said></p>
    <p n="239"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Yes ,— a queer mongrel , with a most amazing power of scent . I would rather have<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>'s help than that of the whole detective force of London . ”</said></p>
    <p n="240"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I shall bring him , then , ”</said>said I .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It is one now . I ought to be back before three , if I can get a fresh horse . ”</said></p>
    <p n="241"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ And I , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ shall see what I can learn from<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bernstone">Mrs. Bernstone</persName>, and from the Indian servant , who ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName>tell me , sleeps in the next garret . Then I shall study the great<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>'s methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms . ‘ Wir sind gewohnt das die Menschen verhoehnen was sie nicht verstehen . ’ Goethe is always pithy . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="7">
    <p n="242">The police had brought a cab with them , and in this I escorted<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>back to her home . After the angelic fashion of women , she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker than herself to support , and I had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper . In the cab , however , she first turned faint , and then burst into a passion of weeping ,— so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night . She has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey . She little guessed the struggle within my breast , or the effort of self-restraint which held me back . My sympathies and my love went out to her , even as my hand had in the garden . I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet , brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences . Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips . She was weak and helpless , shaken in mind and nerve . It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time . Worse still , she was rich . If<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>'s researches were successful , she would be an heiress . Was it fair , was it honorable , that a half-pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about ? Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker ? I could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind . This Agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us .</p>
    <p n="243">It was nearly two o'clock when we reached<persName corresp="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">Mrs. Cecil Forrester</persName>'s . The servants had retired hours ago , but<persName corresp="#Mrs._Forrester">Mrs. Forrester</persName>had been so interested by the strange message which<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>had received that she had sat up in the hope of her return . She opened the door herself , a middle-aged , graceful woman , and it gave me joy to see how tenderly her arm stole round the other 's waist and how motherly was the voice in which she greeted her . She was clearly no mere paid dependant , but an honored friend . I was introduced , and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Forrester">Mrs. Forrester</persName>earnestly begged me to step in and tell her our adventures . I explained , however , the importance of my errand , and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case . As we drove away I stole a glance back , and I still seem to see that little group on the step , the two graceful , clinging figures , the half-opened door , the hall light shining through stained glass , the barometer , and the bright stair-rods . It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild , dark business which had absorbed us .</p>
    <p n="244">And the more I thought of what had happened , the wilder and darker it grew . I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets . There was the original problem : that at least was pretty clear now . The death of<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>, the sending of the pearls , the advertisement , the letter ,— we had had light upon all those events . They had only led us , however , to a deeper and far more tragic mystery . The Indian treasure , the curious plan found among<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>'s baggage , the strange scene at<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>'s death , the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer , the very singular accompaniments to the crime , the footsteps , the remarkable weapons , the words upon the card , corresponding with those upon<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>'s chart ,— here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue .</p>
    <p n="245">Pinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower quarter of Lambeth . I had to knock for some time at No . 3 before I could make my impression . At last , however , there was the glint of a candle behind the blind , and a face looked out at the upper window .</p>
    <p n="246"><said who="#the_face">“ Go on , you drunken vagabone , ”</said>said the face .<said who="#the_face">“ If you kick up any more row I 'll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="247"><said who="#Morstan">“ If you 'll let one out it 's just what I have come for , ”</said>said I .</p>
    <p n="248"><said who="#the_face">“ Go on ! ”</said>yelled the voice .<said who="#the_face">“ So help me gracious , I have a wiper in the bag , an ’ I 'll drop it on your ‘ ead if you do n't hook it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="249"><said who="#Morstan">“ But I want a dog , ”</said>I cried .</p>
    <p n="250"><said who="#the_face">“ I wo n't be argued with ! ”</said>shouted Mr. Sherman .<said who="#the_face">“ Now stand clear , for when I say ‘ three , ’ down goes the wiper . ”</said></p>
    <p n="251"><said who="#Morstan">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">Mr. Sherlock Holmes</persName>— ”</said>I began , but the words had a most magical effect , for the window instantly slammed down , and within a minute the door was unbarred and open . Mr. Sherman was a lanky , lean old man , with stooping shoulders , a stringy neck , and blue-tinted glasses .</p>
    <p n="252"><said who="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">“ A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">“ Step in , sir . Keep clear of the badger ; for he bites . Ah , naughty , naughty , would you take a nip at the gentleman ? ”</said>This to a stoat which thrust its wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage .<said who="#Morstan">“ Do n't mind that , sir : it 's only a slow-worm . It hai n't got no fangs , so I gives it the run o ’ the room , for it keeps the bettles down . You must not mind my bein ’ just a little short wi ’ you at first , for I 'm guyed at by the children , and there 's many a one just comes down this lane to knock me up . What was it that<persName corresp="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">Mr. Sherlock Holmes</persName>wanted , sir ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="253"><said who="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">“ He wanted a dog of yours . ”</said></p>
    <p n="254"><said who="#Morstan">“ Ah ! that would be<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="255"><said who="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">“ Yes ,<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>was the name . ”</said></p>
    <p n="256"><said who="#Morstan">“<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>lives at No . 7 on the left here . ”</said>He moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him . In the uncertain , shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing , glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner . Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls , who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers .</p>
    <p n="257"><persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>proved to an ugly , long-haired , lop-eared creature , half spaniel and half lurcher , brown-and-white in color , with a very clumsy waddling gait . It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me , and , having thus sealed an alliance , it followed me to the cab , and made no difficulties about accompanying me . It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at Pondicherry Lodge . The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had , I found , been arrested as an accessory , and both he and<persName corresp="#Mr._Sholto">Mr. Sholto</persName>had been marched off to the station . Two constables guarded the narrow gate , but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the detective 's name .</p>
    <p n="258"><persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>was standing on the door-step , with his hands in his pockets , smoking his pipe .</p>
    <p n="259"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Ah , you have him there ! ”</said>said he .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Good dog , then ! Atheney<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>has gone . We have had an immense display of energy since you left . He has arrested not only friend<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus</persName>, but the gatekeeper , the housekeeper , and the Indian servant . We have the place to ourselves , but for a sergeant up-stairs . Leave the dog here , and come up . ”</said></p>
    <p n="260">We tied<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>to the hall table , and reascended the stairs . The room was as he had left it , save that a sheet had been draped over the central figure . A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner .</p>
    <p n="261"><said who="#Toby">“ Lend me your bull'shYpppHeNeye , sergeant , ”</said>said my companion .<said who="#Toby">“ Now tie this bit of card round my neck , so as to hang it in front of me . Thank you . Now I must kick off my boots and stockings .— Just you carry them down with you ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>. I am going to do a little climbing . And dip my handkerchief into the creasote . That will do . Now come up into the garret with me for a moment . ”</said></p>
    <p n="262">We clambered up through the hole .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>turned his light once more upon the footsteps in the dust .</p>
    <p n="263"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Do you observe anything noteworthy about them ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="264"><said who="#Toby">“ They belong , ”</said>I said ,<said who="#Toby">“ to a child or a small woman . ”</said></p>
    <p n="265"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Apart from their size , though . Is there nothing else ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="266"><said who="#Toby">“ They appear to be much as other footmarks . ”</said></p>
    <p n="267"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Not at all . Look here ! This is the print of a right foot in the dust . Now I make one with my naked foot beside it . What is the chief difference ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="268"><said who="#Toby">“ Your toes are all cramped together . The other print has each toe distinctly divided . ”</said></p>
    <p n="269"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Quite so . That is the point . Bear that in mind . Now , would you kindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the wood-work ? I shall stay here , as I have this handkerchief in my hand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="270">I did as he directed , and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell .</p>
    <p n="271"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ That is where he put his foot in getting out . If YOU can trace him , I should think that<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>will have no difficulty . Now run down-stairs , loose the dog , and look out for Blondin . ”</said></p>
    <p n="272">By the time that I got out into the grounds<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>was on the roof , and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very slowly along the ridge . I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys , but he presently reappeared , and then vanished once more upon the opposite side . When I made my way round there I found him seated at one of the corner eaves .</p>
    <p n="273"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ That you ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>? ”</said>he cried .</p>
    <p n="274"><said who="#Watson">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="275"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ This is the place . What is that black thing down there ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="276"><said who="#Watson">“ A water-barrel . ”</said></p>
    <p n="277"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Top on it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="278"><said who="#Watson">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="279"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ No sign of a ladder ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="280"><said who="#Watson">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="281"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Confound the fellow ! It 's a most break-neck place . I ought to be able to come down where he could climb up . The water-pipe feels pretty firm . Here goes , anyhow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="282">There was a scuffling of feet , and the lantern began to come steadily down the side of the wall . Then with a light spring he came on to the barrel , and from there to the earth .</p>
    <p n="283"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It was easy to follow him , ”</said>he said , drawing on his stockings and boots .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Tiles were loosened the whole way along , and in his hurry he had dropped this . It confirms my diagnosis , as you doctors express it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="284">The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out of colored grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it . In shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case . Inside were half a dozen spines of dark wood , sharp at one end and rounded at the other , like that which had struck<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew Sholto</persName>.</p>
    <p n="285"><said who="#Bartholomew_Sholto">“ They are hellish things , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Bartholomew_Sholto">“ Look out that you do n't prick yourself . I 'm delighted to have them , for the chances are that they are all he has . There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our skin before long . I would sooner face a Martini bullet , myself . Are you game for a six-mile trudge ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="286"><said who="#Watson">“ Certainly , ”</said>I answered .</p>
    <p n="287"><said who="#Bartholomew_Sholto">“ Your leg will stand it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="288"><said who="#Watson">“ Oh , yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="289"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Here you are , doggy ! Good old<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>! Smell it ,<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>, smell it ! ”</said>He pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog 's nose , while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated , and with a most comical cock to its head , like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet of a famous vintage .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>then threw the handkerchief to a distance , fastened a stout cord to the mongrel 's collar , and led him to the foot of the water-barrel . The creature instantly broke into a succession of high , tremulous yelps , and , with his nose on the ground , and his tail in the air , pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed .</p>
    <p n="290">The east had been gradually whitening , and we could now see some distance in the cold gray light . The square , massive house , with its black , empty windows and high , bare walls , towered up , sad and forlorn , behind us . Our course led right across the grounds , in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected . The whole place , with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs , had a blighted , ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which hung over it .</p>
    <p n="291">On reaching the boundary wall<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>ran along , whining eagerly , underneath its shadow , and stopped finally in a corner screened by a young beech . Where the two walls joined , several bricks had been loosened , and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the lower side , as though they had frequently been used as a ladder .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>clambered up , and , taking the dog from me , he dropped it over upon the other side .</p>
    <p n="292"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ There 's the print of wooden-leg 's hand , ”</said>he remarked , as I mounted up beside him .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster . What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday ! The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight-and-twenty hours ’ start . ”</said></p>
    <p n="293">I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval . My fears were soon appeased , however .<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>never hesitated or swerved , but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion . Clearly , the pungent smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents .</p>
    <p n="294"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Do not imagine , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ that I depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot in the chemical . I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways . This , however , is the readiest and , since fortune has put it into our hands , I should be culpable if I neglected it . It has , however , prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be . There might have been some credit to be gained out of it , but for this too palpable clue . ”</said></p>
    <p n="295"><said who="#Toby">“ There is credit , and to spare , ”</said>said I .<said who="#Toby">“ I assure you ,<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case , even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder . The thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable . How , for example , could you describe with such confidence the wooden-legged man ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="296"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Pshaw , my dear boy ! it was simplicity itself . I do n't wish to be theatrical . It is all patent and above-board . Two officers who are in command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure . A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>. You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>'s possession . He had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates ,— the sign of the four , as he somewhat dramatically called it . Aided by this chart , the officers — or one of them — gets the treasure and brings it to England , leaving , we will suppose , some condition under which he received it unfulfilled . Now , then , why did not<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>get the treasure himself ? The answer is obvious . The chart is dated at a time when<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>was brought into close association with convicts .<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away . ”</said></p>
    <p n="297"><said who="#Toby">“ But that is mere speculation , ”</said>said I .</p>
    <p n="298"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It is more than that . It is the only hypothesis which covers the facts . Let us see how it fits in with the sequel .<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>remains at peace for some years , happy in the possession of his treasure . Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright . What was that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="299"><said who="#Toby">“ A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free . ”</said></p>
    <p n="300"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Or had escaped . That is much more likely , for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was . It would not have been a surprise to him . What does he do then ? He guards himself against a wooden-legged man ,— a white man , mark you , for he mistakes a white tradesman for him , and actually fires a pistol at him . Now , only one white man 's name is on the chart . The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans . There is no other white man . Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>. Does the reasoning strike you as being faulty ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="301"><said who="#Toby">“ No : it is clear and concise . ”</said></p>
    <p n="302"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , now , let us put ourselves in the place of<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>. Let us look at it from his point of view . He comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him . He found out where<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>lived , and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house . There is this butler , Lal Rao , whom we have not seen .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bernstone">Mrs. Bernstone</persName>gives him far from a good character .<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>could not find out , however , where the treasure was hid , for no one ever knew , save the major and one faithful servant who had died . Suddenly<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>learns that the major is on his death-bed . In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him , he runs the gauntlet of the guards , makes his way to the dying man 's window , and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons . Mad with hate , however , against the dead man , he enters the room that night , searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure , and finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card . He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder , but , from the point of view of the four associates , something in the nature of an act of justice . Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime , and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal . Do you follow all this ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="303"><said who="#Toby">“ Very clearly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="304"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Now , what could<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>do ? He could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure . Possibly he leaves England and only comes back at intervals . Then comes the discovery of the garret , and he is instantly informed of it . We again trace the presence of some confederate in the household . Jonathan , with his wooden leg , is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew Sholto</persName>. He takes with him , however , a rather curious associate , who gets over this difficulty , but dips his naked foot into creasote , whence comes<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis . ”</said></p>
    <p n="305"><said who="#Toby">“ But it was the associate , and not Jonathan , who committed the crime . ”</said></p>
    <p n="306"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Quite so . And rather to Jonathan 's disgust , to judge by the way he stamped about when he got into the room . He bore no grudge against<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew Sholto</persName>, and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged . He did not wish to put his head in a halter . There was no help for it , however : the savage instincts of his companion had broken out , and the poison had done its work : so<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>left his record , lowered the treasure-box to the ground , and followed it himself . That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them . Of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle-aged , and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the Andamans . His height is readily calculated from the length of his stride , and we know that he was bearded . His hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus Sholto</persName>when he saw him at the window . I do n't know that there is anything else . ”</said></p>
    <p n="307"><said who="#Toby">“ The associate ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="308"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Ah , well , there is no great mystery in that . But you will know all about it soon enough . How sweet the morning air is ! See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo . Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank . It shines on a good many folk , but on none , I dare bet , who are on a stranger errand than you and I . How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature ! Are you well up in your Jean Paul ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="309"><said who="#Toby">“ Fairly so . I worked back to him through Carlyle . ”</said></p>
    <p n="310"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ That was like following the brook to the parent lake . He makes one curious but profound remark . It is that the chief proof of man 's real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness . It argues , you see , a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility . There is much food for thought in Richter . You have not a pistol , have you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="311"><said who="#Toby">“ I have my stick . ”</said></p>
    <p n="312"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair . Jonathan I shall leave to you , but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead . ”</said>He took out his revolver as he spoke , and , having loaded two of the chambers , he put it back into the right-hand pocket of his jacket .</p>
    <p n="313">We had during this time been following the guidance of<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>down the half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis . Now , however , we were beginning to come among continuous streets , where laborers and dockmen were already astir , and slatternly women were taking down shutters and brushing door-steps . At the square-topped corner public houses business was just beginning , and rough-looking men were emerging , rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their morning wet . Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as we passed , but our inimitable<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>looked neither to the right nor to the left , but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent .</p>
    <p n="314">We had traversed Streatham , Brixton , Camberwell , and now found ourselves in Kennington Lane , having borne away through the side-streets to the east of the Oval . The men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zigzag road , with the idea probably of escaping observation . They had never kept to the main road if a parallel side-street would serve their turn . At the foot of Kennington Lane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street . Where the latter street turns into Knight 's Place ,<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>ceased to advance , but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the other drooping , the very picture of canine indecision . Then he waddled round in circles , looking up to us from time to time , as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment .</p>
    <p n="315"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ What the deuce is the matter with the dog ? ”</said>growled<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ They surely would not take a cab , or go off in a balloon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="316"><said who="#Toby">“ Perhaps they stood here for some time , ”</said>I suggested .</p>
    <p n="317"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Ah ! it 's all right . He 's off again , ”</said>said my companion , in a tone of relief .</p>
    <p n="318">He was indeed off , for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up his mind , and darted away with an energy and determination such as he had not yet shown . The scent appeared to be much hotter than before , for he had not even to put his nose on the ground , but tugged at his leash and tried to break into a run . I cold see by the gleam in<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>'s eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey .</p>
    <p n="319">Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and Nelson 's large timber-yard , just past the White Eagle tavern . Here the dog , frantic with excitement , turned down through the side-gate into the enclosure , where the sawyers were already at work . On the dog raced through sawdust and shavings , down an alley , round a passage , between two wood-piles , and finally , with a triumphant yelp , sprang upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had been brought . With lolling tongue and blinking eyes ,<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>stood upon the cask , looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation . The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid , and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creasote .</p>
    <p n="320"><persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>and I looked blankly at each other , and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="8">
    <p n="321"><said>“ What now ? ”</said>I asked .<said>“<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>has lost his character for infallibility . ”</said></p>
    <p n="322"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ He acted according to his lights , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, lifting him down from the barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ If you consider how much creasote is carted about London in one day , it is no great wonder that our trail should have been crossed . It is much used now , especially for the seasoning of wood . Poor<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>is not to blame . ”</said></p>
    <p n="323"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ We must get on the main scent again , I suppose . ”</said></p>
    <p n="324"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Yes . And , fortunately , we have no distance to go . Evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner of Knight 's Place was that there were two different trails running in opposite directions . We took the wrong one . It only remains to follow the other . ”</said></p>
    <p n="325">There was no difficulty about this . On leading<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>to the place where he had committed his fault , he cast about in a wide circle and finally dashed off in a fresh direction .</p>
    <p n="326"><said who="#Toby">“ We must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the creasote-barrel came from , ”</said>I observed .</p>
    <p n="327"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I had thought of that . But you notice that he keeps on the pavement , whereas the barrel passed down the roadway . No , we are on the true scent now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="328">It tended down towards the river-side , running through Belmont Place and Prince 's Street . At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to the water 's edge , where there was a small wooden wharf .<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>led us to the very edge of this , and there stood whining , looking out on the dark current beyond .</p>
    <p n="329"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ We are out of luck , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ They have taken to a boat here . ”</said>Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the edge of the wharf . We took<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>round to each in turn , but , though he sniffed earnestly , he made no sign .</p>
    <p n="330">Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house , with a wooden placard slung out through the second window . “<persName corresp="#Mordecai_Smith">Mordecai Smith</persName>” was printed across it in large letters , and , underneath ,<said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ Boats to hire by the hour or day . ”</said>A second inscription above the door informed us that a steam launch was kept ,— a statement which was confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>looked slowly round , and his face assumed an ominous expression .</p>
    <p n="331"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ This looks bad , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ These fellows are sharper than I expected . They seem to have covered their tracks . There has , I fear , been preconcerted management here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="332">He was approaching the door of the house , when it opened , and a little , curly-headed lad of six came running out , followed by a stoutish , red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand .</p>
    <p n="333"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You come back and be washed , Jack , ”</said>she shouted .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Come back , you young imp ; for if your father comes home and finds you like that , he 'll let us hear of it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="334"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Dear little chap ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, strategically .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ What a rosy-cheeked young rascal ! Now , Jack , is there anything you would like ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="335">The youth pondered for a moment .<said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ I 'd like a shillin ’ , ”</said>said he .</p>
    <p n="336"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Nothing you would like better ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="337"><said who="#the_prodigy">“ I 'd like two shillin ’ better , ”</said>the prodigy answered , after some thought .</p>
    <p n="338"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Here you are , then ! Catch !— A fine child ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Mrs. Smith</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="339"><said who="#Mrs._Smith">“ Lor ’ bless you , sir , he is that , and forward . He gets a'most too much for me to manage , ‘ specially when my man is away days at a time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="340"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Away , is he ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, in a disappointed voice .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I am sorry for that , for I wanted to speak to Mr.<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Smith</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="341"><said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ He 's been away since yesterday mornin ’ , sir , and , truth to tell , I am beginnin ’ to feel frightened about him . But if it was about a boat , sir , maybe I could serve as well . ”</said></p>
    <p n="342"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I wanted to hire his steam launch . ”</said></p>
    <p n="343"><said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ Why , bless you , sir , it is in the steam launch that he has gone . That 's what puzzles me ; for I know there ai n't more coals in her than would take her to about Woolwich and back . If he 'd been away in the barge I 'd ha ’ thought nothin ’ ; for many a time a job has taken him as far as Gravesend , and then if there was much doin ’ there he might ha ’ stayed over . But what good is a steam launch without coals ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="344"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ He might have bought some at a wharf down the river . ”</said></p>
    <p n="345"><said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ He might , sir , but it were n't his way . Many a time I 've heard him call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags . Besides , I do n't like that wooden-legged man , wi ’ his ugly face and outlandish talk . What did he want always knockin ’ about here for ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="346"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ A wooden-legged man ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, with bland surprise .</p>
    <p n="347"><said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ Yes , sir , a brown , monkey-faced chap that 's called more'n once for my old man . It was him that roused him up yesternight , and , what 's more , my man knew he was comin ’ , for he had steam up in the launch . I tell you straight , sir , I do n't feel easy in my mind about it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="348"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ But , my dear<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Mrs. Smith</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, shrugging his shoulders ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You are frightening yourself about nothing . How could you possibly tell that it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night ? I do n't quite understand how you can be so sure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="349"><said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ His voice , sir . I knew his voice , which is kind o ’ thick and foggy . He tapped at the winder ,— about three it would be . ‘ Show a leg , matey , ’ says he : ‘ time to turn out guard . ’ My old man woke up Jim ,— that 's my eldest ,— and away they went , without so much as a word to me . I could hear the wooden leg clackin ’ on the stones . ”</said></p>
    <p n="350"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ And was this wooden-legged man alone ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="351"><said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ Could n't say , I am sure , sir . I did n't hear no one else . ”</said></p>
    <p n="352"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I am sorry ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Mrs. Smith</persName>, for I wanted a steam launch , and I have heard good reports of the — Let me see , what is her name ? ”</said></p>

    <p n="354"><said who="#the_Aurora">“ Ah ! She 's not that old green launch with a yellow line , very broad in the beam ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="355"><said who="#Mrs._Smith">“ No , indeed . She 's as trim a little thing as any on the river . She 's been fresh painted , black with two red streaks . ”</said></p>
    <p n="356"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Thanks . I hope that you will hear soon from Mr.<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Smith</persName>. I am going down the river ; and if I should see anything of<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>I shall let him know that you are uneasy . A black funnel , you say ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="357"><said who="#Mrs._Smith">“ No , sir . Black with a white band . ”</said></p>
    <p n="358"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Ah , of course . It was the sides which were black . Good-morning , Mrs .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Smith</persName>.— There is a boatman here with a wherry ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>. We shall take it and cross the river .</said></p>
    <p n="359"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The main thing with people of that sort , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, as we sat in the sheets of the wherry ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you . If you do , they will instantly shut up like an oyster . If you listen to them under protest , as it were , you are very likely to get what you want . ”</said></p>
    <p n="360"><said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ Our course now seems pretty clear , ”</said>said I .</p>
    <p n="361"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ What would you do , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="362"><said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ I would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="363"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ My dear fellow , it would be a colossal task . She may have touched at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich . Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for miles . It would take you days and days to exhaust them , if you set about it alone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="364"><said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ Employ the police , then . ”</said></p>
    <p n="365"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ No . I shall probably call<persName corresp="#Athelney_Jones">Athelney Jones</persName>in at the last moment . He is not a bad fellow , and I should not like to do anything which would injure him professionally . But I have a fancy for working it out myself , now that we have gone so far . ”</said></p>
    <p n="366"><said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ Could we advertise , then , asking for information from wharfingers ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="367"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Worse and worse ! Our men would know that the chase was hot at their heels , and they would be off out of the country . As it is , they are likely enough to leave , but as long as they think they are perfectly safe they will be in no hurry .<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>'s energy will be of use to us there , for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily press , and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong scent . ”</said></p>
    <p n="368"><said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ What are we to do , then ? ”</said>I asked , as we landed near Millbank Penitentiary .</p>
    <p n="369"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Take this hansom , drive home , have some breakfast , and get an hour 's sleep . It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again . Stop at a telegraph-office , cabby ! We will keep<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>, for he may be of use to us yet . ”</said></p>
    <p n="370">We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office , and<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>despatched his wire .<said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ Whom do you think that is to ? ”</said>he asked , as we resumed our journey .</p>
    <p n="371"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I am sure I do n't know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="372"><said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ You remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force whom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="373"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , ”</said>said I , laughing .</p>
    <p n="374"><said who="#Mordecai_Smith">“ This is just the case where they might be invaluable . If they fail , I have other resources ; but I shall try them first . That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant ,<persName corresp="#Wiggins">Wiggins</persName>, and I expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast . ”</said></p>
    <p n="375">It was between eight and nine o'clock now , and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night . I was limp and weary , befogged in mind and fatigued in body . I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on , nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem . As far as the death of<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew Sholto</persName>went , I had heard little good of him , and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers . The treasure , however , was a different matter . That , or part of it , belonged rightfully to<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>. While there was a chance of recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the one object . True , if I found it it would probably put her forever beyond my reach . Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that . If<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>could work to find the criminals , I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure .</p>
    <p n="376">A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully . When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Homes pouring out the coffee .</p>
    <p n="377"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Here it is , ”</said>said he , laughing , and pointing to an open newspaper .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The energetic<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them . But you have had enough of the case . Better have your ham and eggs first . ”</said></p>
    <p n="378">I took the paper from him and read the short notice , which was headed “ Mysterious Business at Upper Norwood . ”</p>
    <p n="379"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ About twelve o'clock last night , ”</said>said the Standard ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Mr.<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew Sholto</persName>, of Pondicherry Lodge , Upper Norwood , was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play . As far as we can learn , no actual traces of violence were found upon<persName corresp="#Mr._Sholto">Mr. Sholto</persName>'s person , but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off . The discovery was first made by<persName corresp="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">Mr. Sherlock Holmes</persName>and<persName corresp="#Dr._Watson">Dr. Watson</persName>, who had called at the house with<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName><persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>, brother of the deceased . By a singular piece of good fortune ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">Mr. Athelney Jones</persName>, the well-known member of the detective police force , happened to be at the Norwood Police Station , and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm . His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals , with the gratifying result that the brother ,<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus Sholto</persName>, has already been arrested , together with the housekeeper ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bernstone">Mrs. Bernstone</persName>, an Indian butler named Lal Rao , and a porter , or gatekeeper , named McMurdo . It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house , for Mr.<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>'s well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window , but must have made their way across the roof of the building , and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found . This fact , which has been very clearly made out , proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary . The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind . We cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralized , and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate . ”</said></p>
    <p n="380"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Is n't it gorgeous ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, grinning over his coffee-cup .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ What do you think of it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="381"><said who="#Bartholomew_Sholto">“ I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime . ”</said></p>
    <p n="382"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ So do I. I would n't answer for our safety now , if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="383">At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell , and I could hear<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hudson">Mrs. Hudson</persName>, our landlady , raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and dismay .</p>
    <p n="384"><said who="#Mrs._Hudson">“ By heaven ,<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, ”</said>I said , half rising ,<said who="#Mrs._Hudson">“ I believe that they are really after us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="385"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ No , it 's not quite so bad as that . It is the unofficial force ,— the Baker Street irregulars . ”</said></p>
    <p n="386">As he spoke , there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the stairs , a clatter of high voices , and in rushed a dozen dirty and ragged little street-Arabs . There was some show of discipline among them , despite their tumultuous entry , for they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us with expectant faces . One of their number , taller and older than the others , stood forward with an air of lounging superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little scarecrow .</p>
    <p n="387"><said who="#Mrs._Hudson">“ Got your message , sir , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Mrs._Hudson">“ and brought ‘ em on sharp . Three bob and a tanner for tickets . ”</said></p>
    <p n="388"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Here you are , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, producing some silver .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ In future they can report to you ,<persName corresp="#Wiggins">Wiggins</persName>, and you to me . I cannot have the house invaded in this way . However , it is just as well that you should all hear the instructions . I want to find the whereabouts of a steam launch called<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>, owner<persName corresp="#Mordecai_Smith">Mordecai Smith</persName>, black with two red streaks , funnel black with a white band . She is down the river somewhere . I want one boy to be at<persName corresp="#Mordecai_Smith">Mordecai Smith</persName>'s landing-stage opposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back . You must divide it out among yourselves , and do both banks thoroughly . Let me know the moment you have news . Is that all clear ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="389"><said who="#Wiggins">“ Yes , guv'nor , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Wiggins">Wiggins</persName>.</p>
    <p n="390"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The old scale of pay , and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat . Here 's a day in advance . Now off you go ! ”</said>He handed them a shilling each , and away they buzzed down the stairs , and I saw them a moment later streaming down the street .</p>
    <p n="391"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ If the launch is above water they will find her , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, as he rose from the table and lit his pipe .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ They can go everywhere , see everything , overhear every one . I expect to hear before evening that they have spotted her . In the mean while , we can do nothing but await results . We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>or Mr.<persName corresp="#Mordecai_Smith">Mordecai Smith</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="392"><said who="#Wiggins">“<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>could eat these scraps , I dare say . Are you going to bed ,<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="393"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ No : I am not tired . I have a curious constitution . I never remember feeling tired by work , though idleness exhausts me completely . I am going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair client has introduced us . If ever man had an easy task , this of ours ought to be . Wooden-legged men are not so common , but the other man must , I should think , be absolutely unique . ”</said></p>
    <p n="394"><said who="#Wiggins">“ That other man again ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="395"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I have no wish to make a mystery of him ,— to you , anyway . But you must have formed your own opinion . Now , do consider the data . Diminutive footmarks , toes never fettered by boots , naked feet , stone-headed wooden mace , great agility , small poisoned darts . What do you make of all this ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="396"><said who="#Wiggins">“ A savage ! ”</said>I exclaimed .<said who="#Wiggins">“ Perhaps one of those Indians who were the associates of<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="397"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Hardly that , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ When first I saw signs of strange weapons I was inclined to think so ; but the remarkable character of the footmarks caused me to reconsider my views . Some of the inhabitants of the Indian Peninsula are small men , but none could have left such marks as that . The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet . The sandal-wearing Mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others , because the thong is commonly passed between . These little darts , too , could only be shot in one way . They are from a blow-pipe . Now , then , where are we to find our savage ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="398"><said who="#Wiggins">“ South American , ”</said>I hazarded .</p>
    <p n="399">He stretched his hand up , and took down a bulky volume from the shelf .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ This is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published . It may be looked upon as the very latest authority . What have we here ? ‘ Andaman Islands , situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra , in the Bay of Bengal . ’ Hum ! hum ! What 's all this ? Moist climate , coral reefs , sharks , Port Blair , convict-barracks , Rutland Island , cottonwoods — Ah , here we are . ‘ The aborigines of the Andaman Islands may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this earth , though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa , the Digger Indians of America , and the Terra del Fuegians . The average height is rather below four feet , although many full-grown adults may be found who are very much smaller than this . They are a fierce , morose , and intractable people , though capable of forming most devoted friendships when their confidence has once been gained . ’ Mark that ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>. Now , then , listen to this . ‘ They are naturally hideous , having large , misshapen heads , small , fierce eyes , and distorted features . Their feet and hands , however , are remarkably small . So intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British official have failed to win them over in any degree . They have always been a terror to shipwrecked crews , braining the survivors with their stone-headed clubs , or shooting them with their poisoned arrows . These massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast . ’ Nice , amiable people ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>! If this fellow had been left to his own unaided devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn . I fancy that , even as it is ,<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>would give a good deal not to have employed him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="400"><said who="#Watson">“ But how came he to have so singular a companion ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="401"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Ah , that is more than I can tell . Since , however , we had already determined that<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>had come from the Andamans , it is not so very wonderful that this islander should be with him . No doubt we shall know all about it in time . Look here ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>; you look regularly done . Lie down there on the sofa , and see if I can put you to sleep . ”</said></p>
    <p n="402">He took up his violin from the corner , and as I stretched myself out he began to play some low , dreamy , melodious air ,— his own , no doubt , for he had a remarkable gift for improvisation . I have a vague remembrance of his gaunt limbs , his earnest face , and the rise and fall of his bow . Then I seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound , until I found myself in dream-land , with the sweet face of Mary<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>looking down upon me .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="9">
    <p n="403">It was late in the afternoon before I woke , strengthened and refreshed .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>still sat exactly as I had left him , save that he had laid aside his violin and was deep in a book . He looked across at me , as I stirred , and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled .</p>
    <p n="404"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You have slept soundly , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I feared that our talk would wake you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="405"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I heard nothing , ”</said>I answered .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Have you had fresh news , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="406"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Unfortunately , no . I confess that I am surprised and disappointed . I expected something definite by this time .<persName corresp="#Wiggins">Wiggins</persName>has just been up to report . He says that no trace can be found of the launch . It is a provoking check , for every hour is of importance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="407"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Can I do anything ? I am perfectly fresh now , and quite ready for another night 's outing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="408"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ No , we can do nothing . We can only wait . If we go ourselves , the message might come in our absence , and delay be caused . You can do what you will , but I must remain on guard . ”</said></p>
    <p n="409"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon<persName corresp="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">Mrs. Cecil Forrester</persName>. She asked me to , yesterday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="410"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ On<persName corresp="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">Mrs. Cecil Forrester</persName>? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, with the twinkle of a smile in his eyes .</p>
    <p n="411"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , of course<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>too . They were anxious to hear what happened . ”</said></p>
    <p n="412"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I would not tell them too much , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Women are never to be entirely trusted ,— not the best of them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="413">I did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I shall be back in an hour or two , ”</said>I remarked .</p>
    <p n="414"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ All right ! Good luck ! But , I say , if you are crossing the river you may as well return<persName corresp="#Toby">Toby</persName>, for I do n't think it is at all likely that we shall have any use for him now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="415">I took our mongrel accordingly , and left him , together with a half-sovereign , at the old naturalist 's in Pinchin Lane . At Camberwell I found<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>a little weary after her night 's adventures , but very eager to hear the news .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Forrester">Mrs. Forrester</persName>, too , was full of curiosity . I told them all that we had done , suppressing , however , the more dreadful parts of the tragedy . Thus , although I spoke of<persName corresp="#Mr._Sholto">Mr. Sholto</persName>'s death , I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it . With all my omissions , however , there was enough to startle and amaze them .</p>
    <p n="416"><said who="#Mrs._Forrester">“ It is a romance ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs._Forrester">Mrs. Forrester</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Forrester">“ An injured lady , half a million in treasure , a black cannibal , and a wooden-legged ruffian . They take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl . ”</said></p>
    <p n="417"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ And two knight-errants to the rescue , ”</said>added<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>, with a bright glance at me .</p>
    <p n="418"><said who="#Mrs._Forrester">“ Why , Mary , your fortune depends upon the issue of this search . I do n't think that you are nearly excited enough . Just imagine what it must be to be so rich , and to have the world at your feet ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="419">It sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no sign of elation at the prospect . On the contrary , she gave a toss of her proud head , as though the matter were one in which she took small interest .</p>
    <p n="420"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ It is for<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName><persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>that I am anxious , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Nothing else is of any consequence ; but I think that he has behaved most kindly and honorably throughout . It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful and unfounded charge . ”</said></p>
    <p n="421">It was evening before I left Camberwell , and quite dark by the time I reached home . My companion 's book and pipe lay by his chair , but he had disappeared . I looked about in the hope of seeing a note , but there was none .</p>
    <p n="422"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I suppose that<persName corresp="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">Mr. Sherlock Holmes</persName>has gone out , ”</said>I said to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hudson">Mrs. Hudson</persName>as she came up to lower the blinds .</p>
    <p n="423"><said who="#Mrs._Hudson">“ No , sir . He has gone to his room , sir . Do you know , sir , ”</said>sinking her voice into an impressive whisper ,<said who="#Mrs._Hudson">“ I am afraid for his health ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="424"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Why so ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hudson">Mrs. Hudson</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="425"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Well , he 's that strange , sir . After you was gone he walked and he walked , up and down , and up and down , until I was weary of the sound of his footstep . Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering , and every time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead , with ‘ What is that ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hudson">Mrs. Hudson</persName>? ’ And now he has slammed off to his room , but I can hear him walking away the same as ever . I hope he 's not going to be ill , sir . I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine , but he turned on me , sir , with such a look that I do n't know how ever I got out of the room . ”</said></p>
    <p n="426"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I do n't think that you have any cause to be uneasy ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hudson">Mrs. Hudson</persName>, ”</said>I answered .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I have seen him like this before . He has some small matter upon his mind which makes him restless . ”</said>I tried to speak lightly to our worthy landlady , but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through the long night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread , and knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary inaction .</p>
    <p n="427">At breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard , with a little fleck of feverish color upon either cheek .</p>
    <p n="428"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ You are knocking yourself up , old man , ”</said>I remarked .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I heard you marching about in the night . ”</said></p>
    <p n="429"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ No , I could not sleep , ”</said>he answered .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ This infernal problem is consuming me . It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle , when all else had been overcome . I know the men , the launch , everything ; and yet I can get no news . I have set other agencies at work , and used every means at my disposal . The whole river has been searched on either side , but there is no news , nor has<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Mrs. Smith</persName>heard of her husband . I shall come to the conclusion soon that they have scuttled the craft . But there are objections to that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="430"><said who="#Mrs._Hudson">“ Or that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Mrs. Smith</persName>has put us on a wrong scent . ”</said></p>
    <p n="431"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ No , I think that may be dismissed . I had inquiries made , and there is a launch of that description . ”</said></p>
    <p n="432"><said who="#Mrs._Hudson">“ Could it have gone up the river ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="433"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I have considered that possibility too , and there is a search-party who will work up as far as Richmond . If no news comes to-day , I shall start off myself to-morrow , and go for the men rather than the boat . But surely , surely , we shall hear something . ”</said></p>
    <p n="434">We did not , however . Not a word came to us either from<persName corresp="#Wiggins">Wiggins</persName>or from the other agencies . There were articles in most of the papers upon the Norwood tragedy . They all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus Sholto</persName>. No fresh details were to be found , however , in any of them , save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day . I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report our ill success to the ladies , and on my return I found<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>dejected and somewhat morose . He would hardly reply to my questions , and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapors , ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment . Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment .</p>
    <p n="435">In the early dawn I woke with a start , and was surprised to find him standing by my bedside , clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket , and a coarse red scarf round his neck .</p>
    <p n="436"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I am off down the river ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>, ”</said>said he .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I have been turning it over in my mind , and I can see only one way out of it . It is worth trying , at all events . ”</said></p>
    <p n="437"><said who="#Watson">“ Surely I can come with you , then ? ”</said>said I .</p>
    <p n="438"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ No ; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my representative . I am loath to go , for it is quite on the cards that some message may come during the day , though<persName corresp="#Wiggins">Wiggins</persName>was despondent about it last night . I want you to open all notes and telegrams , and to act on your own judgment if any news should come . Can I rely upon you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="439"><said who="#Watson">“ Most certainly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="440"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me , for I can hardly tell yet where I may find myself . If I am in luck , however , I may not be gone so very long . I shall have news of some sort or other before I get back . ”</said></p>
    <p n="441">I had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time . On opening the Standard , however , I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business .<said who="#Watson">“ With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy , ”</said>it remarked ,<said who="#Watson">“ we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed . Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName><persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>could have been in any way concerned in the matter . He and the housekeeper ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bernstone">Mrs. Bernstone</persName>, were both released yesterday evening . It is believed , however , that the police have a clue as to the real culprits , and that it is being prosecuted by<persName corresp="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">Mr. Athelney Jones</persName>, of Scotland Yard , with all his well-known energy and sagacity . Further arrests may be expected at any moment . ”</said></p>
    <p n="442"><said who="#Mrs._Bernstone">“ That is satisfactory so far as it goes , ”</said>thought I .<said who="#Mrs._Bernstone">“ Friend<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>is safe , at any rate . I wonder what the fresh clue may be ; though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder . ”</said></p>
    <p n="443">I tossed the paper down upon the table , but at that moment my eye caught an advertisement in the agony column . It ran in this way :</p>
    <p n="444"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Lost .— Whereas<persName corresp="#Mordecai_Smith">Mordecai Smith</persName>, boatman , and his son , Jim , left<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Smith</persName>'s Wharf at or about three o'clock last Tuesday morning in the steam launch Aurora , black with two red stripes , funnel black with a white band , the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Mrs. Smith</persName>, at<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Smith</persName>'s Wharf , or at 221b Baker Street , as to the whereabouts of the said<persName corresp="#Mordecai_Smith">Mordecai Smith</persName>and the launch Aurora . ”</said></p>
    <p n="445">This was clearly<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>'s doing . The Baker Street address was enough to prove that . It struck me as rather ingenious , because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband .</p>
    <p n="446">It was a long day . Every time that a knock came to the door , or a sharp step passed in the street , I imagined that it was either<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>returning or an answer to his advertisement . I tried to read , but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing . Could there be , I wondered , some radical flaw in my companion 's reasoning . Might he be suffering from some huge self-deception ? Was it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises ? I had never known him to be wrong ; and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived . He was likely , I thought , to fall into error through the over-refinement of his logic ,— his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand . Yet , on the other hand , I had myself seen the evidence , and I had heard the reasons for his deductions . When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances , many of them trivial in themselves , but all tending in the same direction , I could not disguise from myself that even if<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>'s explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally outre and startling .</p>
    <p n="447">At three o'clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell , an authoritative voice in the hall , and , to my surprise , no less a person than<persName corresp="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">Mr. Athelney Jones</persName>was shown up to me . Very different was he , however , from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood . His expression was downcast , and his bearing meek and even apologetic .</p>
    <p n="448"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ Good-day , sir ; good-day , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">Mr. Sherlock Holmes</persName>is out , I understand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="449"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Yes , and I cannot be sure when he will be back . But perhaps you would care to wait . Take that chair and try one of these cigars . ”</said></p>
    <p n="450"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ Thank you ; I do n't mind if I do , ”</said>said he , mopping his face with a red bandanna handkerchief .</p>
    <p n="451"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ And a whiskey-and-soda ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="452"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ Well , half a glass . It is very hot for the time of year ; and I have had a good deal to worry and try me . You know my theory about this Norwood case ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="453"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I remember that you expressed one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="454"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ Well , I have been obliged to reconsider it . I had my net drawn tightly round<persName corresp="#Mr._Sholto">Mr. Sholto</persName>, sir , when pop he went through a hole in the middle of it . He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken . From the time that he left his brother 's room he was never out of sight of some one or other . So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trap-doors . It 's a very dark case , and my professional credit is at stake . I should be very glad of a little assistance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="455"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ We all need help sometimes , ”</said>said I .</p>
    <p n="456"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ Your friend<persName corresp="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">Mr. Sherlock Holmes</persName>is a wonderful man , sir , ”</said>said he , in a husky and confidential voice .<said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ He 's a man who is not to be beat . I have known that young man go into a good many cases , but I never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon . He is irregular in his methods , and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories , but , on the whole , I think he would have made a most promising officer , and I do n't care who knows it . I have had a wire from him this morning , by which I understand that he has got some clue to this<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>business . Here is the message . ”</said></p>
    <p n="457">He took the telegram out of his pocket , and handed it to me . It was dated from Poplar at twelve o'clock .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Go to Baker Street at once , ”</said>it said .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ If I have not returned , wait for me . I am close on the track of the<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>gang . You can come with us to-night if you want to be in at the finish . ”</said></p>
    <p n="458"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ This sounds well . He has evidently picked up the scent again , ”</said>said I .</p>
    <p n="459"><said who="#Jones">“ Ah , then he has been at fault too , ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>, with evident satisfaction .<said who="#Jones">“ Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes . Of course this may prove to be a false alarm ; but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip . But there is some one at the door . Perhaps this is he . ”</said></p>
    <p n="460">A heavy step was heard ascending the stair , with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath . Once or twice he stopped , as though the climb were too much for him , but at last he made his way to our door and entered . His appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard . He was an aged man , clad in seafaring garb , with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat . His back was bowed , his knees were shaky , and his breathing was painfully asthmatic . As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs . He had a colored scarf round his chin , and I could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eyes , overhung by bushy white brows , and long gray side-whiskers . Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty .</p>
    <p n="461"><said who="#Jones">“ What is it , my man ? ”</said>I asked .</p>
    <p n="462">He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age .</p>
    <p n="463"><said who="#Jones">“ Is<persName corresp="#Mr._Sherlock_Holmes">Mr. Sherlock Holmes</persName>here ? ”</said>said he .</p>
    <p n="464"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ No ; but I am acting for him . You can tell me any message you have for him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="465"><said who="#Jones">“ It was to him himself I was to tell it , ”</said>said he .</p>
    <p n="466"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ But I tell you that I am acting for him . Was it about<persName corresp="#Mordecai_Smith">Mordecai Smith</persName>'s boat ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="467"><said who="#Jones">“ Yes . I knows well where it is . An ’ I knows where the men he is after are . An ’ I knows where the treasure is . I knows all about it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="468"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ Then tell me , and I shall let him know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="469"><said who="#Jones">“ It was to him I was to tell it , ”</said>he repeated , with the petulant obstinacy of a very old man .</p>
    <p n="470"><said who="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">“ Well , you must wait for him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="471"><said who="#Jones">“ No , no ; I ai n't goin ’ to lose a whole day to please no one . If Mr.<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>ai n't here , then Mr.<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>must find it all out for himself . I do n't care about the look of either of you , and I wo n't tell a word . ”</said></p>
    <p n="472">He shuffled towards the door , but<persName corresp="#Athelney_Jones">Athelney Jones</persName>got in front of him .</p>
    <p n="473"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Wait a bit , my friend , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ You have important information , and you must not walk off . We shall keep you , whether you like or not , until our friend returns . ”</said></p>
    <p n="474">The old man made a little run towards the door , but , as<persName corresp="#Athelney_Jones">Athelney Jones</persName>put his broad back up against it , he recognized the uselessness of resistance .</p>
    <p n="475"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Pretty sort o ’ treatment this ! ”</said>he cried , stamping his stick .<said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ I come here to see a gentleman , and you two , who I never saw in my life , seize me and treat me in this fashion ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="476"><said who="#Jones">“ You will be none the worse , ”</said>I said .<said who="#Jones">“ We shall recompense you for the loss of your time . Sit over here on the sofa , and you will not have long to wait . ”</said></p>
    <p n="477">He came across sullenly enough , and seated himself with his face resting on his hands .<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>and I resumed our cigars and our talk . Suddenly , however ,<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>'s voice broke in upon us .</p>
    <p n="478"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I think that you might offer me a cigar too , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="479">We both started in our chairs . There was<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>sitting close to us with an air of quiet amusement .</p>
    <p n="480"><said who="#Jones">“<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>! ”</said>I exclaimed .<said who="#Jones">“ You here ! But where is the old man ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="481"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Here is the old man , ”</said>said he , holding out a heap of white hair .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Here he is ,— wig , whiskers , eyebrows , and all . I thought my disguise was pretty good , but I hardly expected that it would stand that test . ”</said></p>
    <p n="482"><said who="#Jones">“ Ah , You rogue ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>, highly delighted .<said who="#Jones">“ You would have made an actor , and a rare one . You had the proper workhouse cough , and those weak legs of yours are worth ten pound a week . I thought I knew the glint of your eye , though . You did n't get away from us so easily , You see . ”</said></p>
    <p n="483"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I have been working in that get-up all day , ”</said>said he , lighting his cigar .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You see , a good many of the criminal classes begin to know me ,— especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my cases : so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise like this . You got my wire ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="484"><said who="#Jones">“ Yes ; that was what brought me here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="485"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ How has your case prospered ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="486"><said who="#Jones">“ It has all come to nothing . I have had to release two of my prisoners , and there is no evidence against the other two . ”</said></p>
    <p n="487"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Never mind . We shall give you two others in the place of them . But you must put yourself under my orders . You are welcome to all the official credit , but you must act on the line that I point out . Is that agreed ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="488"><said who="#Jones">“ Entirely , if you will help me to the men . ”</said></p>
    <p n="489"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , then , in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat — a steam launch — to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o'clock . ”</said></p>
    <p n="490"><said who="#Jones">“ That is easily managed . There is always one about there ; but I can step across the road and telephone to make sure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="491"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Then I shall want two stanch men , in case of resistance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="492"><said who="#Jones">“ There will be two or three in the boat . What else ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="493"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ When we secure the men we shall get the treasure . I think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs . Let her be the first to open it .— Eh ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="494"><said who="#Watson">“ It would be a great pleasure to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="495"><said who="#Jones">“ Rather an irregular proceeding , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>, shaking his head .<said who="#Jones">“ However , the whole thing is irregular , and I suppose we must wink at it . The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation . ”</said></p>
    <p n="496"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Certainly . That is easily managed . One other point . I should much like to have a few details about this matter from the lips of<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>himself . You know I like to work the detail of my cases out . There is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him , either here in my rooms or elsewhere , as long as he is efficiently guarded ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="497"><said who="#Jones">“ Well , you are master of the situation . I have had no proof yet of the existence of this<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>. However , if you can catch him I do n't see how I can refuse you an interview with him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="498"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ That is understood , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="499"><said who="#Jones">“ Perfectly . Is there anything else ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="500"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Only that I insist upon your dining with us . It will be ready in half an hour . I have oysters and a brace of grouse , with something a little choice in white wines .—<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>, you have never yet recognized my merits as a housekeeper . ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="10">
    <p n="501">Our meal was a merry one .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>coud talk exceedingly well when he chose , and that night he did choose . He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation . I have never known him so brilliant . He spoke on a quick succession of subjects ,— on miracle-plays , on medieval pottery , on Stradivarius violins , on the Buddhism of Ceylon , and on the war-ships of the future ,— handling each as though he had made a special study of it . His bright humor marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days .<persName corresp="#Athelney_Jones">Athelney Jones</persName>proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation , and faced his dinner with the air of a bon vivant . For myself , I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task , and I caught something of<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>'s gaiety . None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together .</p>
    <p n="502">When the cloth was cleared ,<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>glanced at his watch , and filled up three glasses with port .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ One bumper , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ to the success of our little expedition . And now it is high time we were off . Have you a pistol ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="503"><said who="#Watson">“ I have my old service-revolver in my desk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="504"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You had best take it , then . It is well to be prepared . I see that the cab is at the door . I ordered it for half-past six . ”</said></p>
    <p n="505">It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf , and found our launch awaiting us .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>eyed it critically .</p>
    <p n="506"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="507"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Yes ,— that green lamp at the side . ”</said></p>
    <p n="508"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Then take it off . ”</said></p>
    <p n="509">The small change was made , we stepped on board , and the ropes were cast off .<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>,<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, and I sat in the stern . There was one man at the rudder , one to tend the engines , and two burly police-inspectors forward .</p>
    <p n="510"><said who="#Jones">“ Where to ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>.</p>
    <p n="511"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ To the Tower . Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson 's Yard . ”</said></p>
    <p n="512">Our craft was evidently a very fast one . We shot past the long lines of loaded barges as though they were stationary .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>smiled with satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us .</p>
    <p n="513"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ We ought to be able to catch anything on the river , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="514"><said who="#Jones">“ Well , hardly that . But there are not many launches to beat us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="515"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ We shall have to catch<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>, and she has a name for being a clipper . I will tell you how the land lies ,<persName corresp="#Watson">Watson</persName>. You recollect how annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="516"><said who="#Watson">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="517"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis . One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest . So it is . When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at , I came back to our problem of the Sholtos , and thought the whole matter out again . My boys had been up the river and down the river without result . The launch was not at any landing-stage or wharf , nor had it returned . Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces ,— though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed . I knew this man<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>had a certain degree of low cunning , but I did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse . That is usually a product of higher education . I then reflected that since he had certainly been in London some time — as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge — he could hardly leave at a moment 's notice , but would need some little time , if it were only a day , to arrange his affairs . That was the balance of probability , at any rate . ”</said></p>
    <p n="518"><said who="#Watson">“ It seems to me to be a little weak , ”</said>said I .<said who="#Watson">“ It is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition . ”</said></p>
    <p n="519"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ No , I hardly think so . This lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it . But a second consideration struck me .<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion , however much he may have top-coated him , would give rise to gossip , and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy . He was quite sharp enough to see that . They had started from their head-quarters under cover of darkness , and he would wish to get back before it was broad light . Now , it was past three o'clock , according to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Mrs. Smith</persName>, when they got the boat . It would be quite bright , and people would be about in an hour or so . Therefore , I argued , they did not go very far . They paid<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Smith</persName>well to hold his tongue , reserved his launch for the final escape , and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box . In a couple of nights , when they had time to see what view the papers took , and whether there was any suspicion , they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs , where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies . ”</said></p>
    <p n="520"><said who="#Watson">“ But the launch ? They could not have taken that to their lodgings . ”</said></p>
    <p n="521"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Quite so . I argued that the launch must be no great way off , in spite of its invisibility . I then put myself in the place of<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>, and looked at it as a man of his capacity would . He would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track . How , then , could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted ? I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes . I could only think of one way of doing it . I might land the launch over to some boat-builder or repairer , with directions to make a trifling change in her . She would then be removed to his shed or yard , and so be effectually concealed , while at the same time I could have her at a few hours ’ notice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="522"><said who="#Watson">“ That seems simple enough . ”</said></p>
    <p n="523"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked . However , I determined to act on the idea . I started at once in this harmless seaman 's rig and inquired at all the yards down the river . I drew blank at fifteen , but at the sixteenth — Jacobson 's — I learned that<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man , with some trivial directions as to her rudder . ‘ There ai n't naught amiss with her rudder , ’ said the foreman . ‘ There she lies , with the red streaks . ’ At that moment who should come down but<persName corresp="#Mordecai_Smith">Mordecai Smith</persName>, the missing owner ? He was rather the worse for liquor . I should not , of course , have known him , but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch . ‘ I want her to-night at eight o'clock , ’ said he ,— ‘ eight o'clock sharp , mind , for I have two gentlemen who wo n't be kept waiting . ’ They had evidently paid him well , for he was very flush of money , chucking shillings about to the men . I followed him some distance , but he subsided into an ale-house : so I went back to the yard , and , happening to pick up one of my boys on the way , I stationed him as a sentry over the launch . He is to stand at water 's edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start . We shall be lying off in the stream , and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men , treasure , and all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="524"><said who="#Jones">“ You have planned it all very neatly , whether they are the right men or not , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>;<said who="#Jones">“ but if the affair were in my hands I should have had a body of police in Jacobson 's Yard , and arrested them when they came down . ”</said></p>
    <p n="525"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Which would have been never . This man<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>is a pretty shrewd fellow . He would send a scout on ahead , and if anything made him suspicious lie snug for another week . ”</said></p>
    <p n="526"><said who="#Jones">“ But you might have stuck to<persName corresp="#Mordecai_Smith">Mordecai Smith</persName>, and so been led to their hiding-place , ”</said>said I .</p>
    <p n="527"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ In that case I should have wasted my day . I think that it is a hundred to one against<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Smith</persName>knowing where they live . As long as he has liquor and good pay , why should he ask questions ? They send him messages what to do . No , I thought over every possible course , and this is the best . ”</said></p>
    <p n="528">While this conversation had been proceeding , we had been shooting the long series of bridges which span the Thames . As we passed the City the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St. Paul 's . It was twilight before we reached the Tower .</p>
    <p n="529"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ That is Jacobson 's Yard , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, pointing to a bristle of masts and rigging on the Surrey side .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters . ”</said>He took a pair of night-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I see my sentry at his post , ”</said>he remarked ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ but no sign of a handkerchief . ”</said></p>
    <p n="530"><said who="#Jones">“ Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>, eagerly . We were all eager by this time , even the policemen and stokers , who had a very vague idea of what was going forward .</p>
    <p n="531"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ We have no right to take anything for granted , ”</said><persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>answered .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream , but we cannot be certain . From this point we can see the entrance of the yard , and they can hardly see us . It will be a clear night and plenty of light . We must stay where we are . See how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight . ”</said></p>
    <p n="532"><said who="#Jones">“ They are coming from work in the yard . ”</said></p>
    <p n="533"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Dirty-looking rascals , but I suppose every one has some little immortal spark concealed about him . You would not think it , to look at them . There is no a priori probability about it . A strange enigma is man ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="534"><said who="#Jones">“ Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal , ”</said>I suggested .</p>
    <p n="535"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Winwood Reade is good upon the subject , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ He remarks that , while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle , in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty . You can , for example , never foretell what any one man will do , but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to . Individuals vary , but percentages remain constant . So says the statistician . But do I see a handkerchief ? Surely there is a white flutter over yonder . ”</said></p>
    <p n="536"><said who="#Jones">“ Yes , it is your boy , ”</said>I cried .<said who="#Jones">“ I can see him plainly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="537"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ And there is<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>, ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ and going like the devil ! Full speed ahead , engineer . Make after that launch with the yellow light . By heaven , I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="538">She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two or three small craft , so that she had fairly got her speed up before we saw her . Now she was flying down the stream , near in to the shore , going at a tremendous rate .<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>looked gravely at her and shook his head .</p>
    <p n="539"><said who="#Jones">“ She is very fast , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Jones">“ I doubt if we shall catch her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="540"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ We MUST catch her ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, between his teeth .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Heap it on , stokers ! Make her do all she can ! If we burn the boat we must have them ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="541">We were fairly after her now . The furnaces roared , and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked , like a great metallic heart . Her sharp , steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us . With every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered like a living thing . One great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long , flickering funnel of light in front of us . Right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>lay , and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going . We flashed past barges , steamers , merchant-vessels , in and out , behind this one and round the other . Voices hailed us out of the darkness , but still<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>thundered on , and still we followed close upon her track .</p>
    <p n="542"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Pile it on , men , pile it on ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, looking down into the engine-room , while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager , aquiline face .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Get every pound of steam you can . ”</said></p>
    <p n="543"><said who="#Jones">“ I think we gain a little , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>, with his eyes on<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>.</p>
    <p n="544"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I am sure of it , ”</said>said I .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ We shall be up with her in a very few minutes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="545">At that moment , however , as our evil fate would have it , a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us . It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision , and before we could round them and recover our way<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>had gained a good two hundred yards . She was still , however , well in view , and the murky uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night . Our boilers were strained to their utmost , and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along . We had shot through the Pool , past the West India Docks , down the long Deptford Reach , and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs . The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora .<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>turned our search-light upon her , so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck . One man sat by the stern , with something black between his knees over which he stooped . Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog . The boy held the tiller , while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Smith</persName>, stripped to the waist , and shovelling coals for dear life . They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them , but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it . At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them . At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty . I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career , but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad , flying man-hunt down the Thames . Steadily we drew in upon them , yard by yard . In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery . The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck , and his arms were moving as though he were busy , while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us . Nearer we came and nearer .<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>yelled to them to stop . We were not more than four boat 's lengths behind them , both boats flying at a tremendous pace . It was a clear reach of the river , with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other . At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us , cursing the while in a high , cracked voice . He was a good-sized , powerful man , and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the right side . At the sound of his strident , angry cries there was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck . It straightened itself into a little black man — the smallest I have ever seen — with a great , misshapen head and a shock of tangled , dishevelled hair .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>had already drawn his revolver , and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage , distorted creature . He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket , which left only his face exposed ; but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night . Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty . His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light , and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth , which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury .</p>
    <p n="546"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Fire if he raises his hand , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, quietly . We were within a boat'shYpppHeNlength by this time , and almost within touch of our quarry . I can see the two of them now as they stood , the white man with his legs far apart , shrieking out curses , and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face , and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern .</p>
    <p n="547">It was well that we had so clear a view of him . Even as we looked he plucked out from under his covering a short , round piece of wood , like a school-ruler , and clapped it to his lips . Our pistols rang out together . He whirled round , threw up his arms , and with a kind of choking cough fell sideways into the stream . I caught one glimpse of his venomous , menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters . At the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down , so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank , while we shot past her stern , only clearing her by a few feet . We were round after her in an instant , but she was already nearly at the bank . It was a wild and desolate place , where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land , with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation . The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank , with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water . The fugitive sprang out , but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil . In vain he struggled and writhed . Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards . He yelled in impotent rage , and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot , but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank . When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out , and to drag him , like some evil fish , over our side . The two Smiths , father and son , sat sullenly in their launch , but came aboard meekly enough when commanded .<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">The Aurora</persName>herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern . A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck . This , there could be no question , was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos . There was no key , but it was of considerable weight , so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin . As we steamed slowly up-stream again , we flashed our search-light in every direction , but there was no sign of the Islander . Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores .</p>
    <p n="548"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ See here , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, pointing to the wooden hatchway .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ We were hardly quick enough with our pistols . ”</said>There , sure enough , just behind where we had been standing , stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well . It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we fired .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy fashion , but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible death which had passed so close to us that night .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="11">
    <p n="549">Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done so much and waited so long to gain . He was a sunburned , reckless-eyed fellow , with a net-work of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany features , which told of a hard , open-air life . There was a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his purpose . His age may have been fifty or thereabouts , for his black , curly hair was thickly shot with gray . His face in repose was not an unpleasing one , though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him , as I had lately seen , a terrible expression when moved to anger . He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap , and his head sunk upon his breast , while he looked with his keen , twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings . It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance . Once he looked up at me with a gleam of something like humor in his eyes .</p>
    <p n="550"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well ,<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, lighting a cigar ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I am sorry that it has come to this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="551"><said who="#Jonathan_Small">“ And so am I , sir , ”</said>he answered , frankly .<said who="#Jonathan_Small">“ I do n't believe that I can swing over the job . I give you my word on the book that I never raised hand against<persName corresp="#Mr._Sholto">Mr. Sholto</persName>. It was that little hell-hound<persName>Tonga</persName>who shot one of his cursed darts into him . I had no part in it , sir . I was as grieved as if it had been my blood-relation . I welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it , but it was done , and I could not undo it again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="552"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Have a cigar , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>;<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ and you had best take a pull out of my flask , for you are very wet . How could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower<persName corresp="#Mr._Sholto">Mr. Sholto</persName>and hold him while you were climbing the rope ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="553"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You seem to know as much about it as if you were there , sir . The truth is that I hoped to find the room clear . I knew the habits of the house pretty well , and it was the time when<persName corresp="#Mr._Sholto">Mr. Sholto</persName>usually went down to his supper . I shall make no secret of the business . The best defence that I can make is just the simple truth . Now , if it had been the old major I would have swung for him with a light heart . I would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar . But it 's cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>, with whom I had no quarrel whatever . ”</said></p>
    <p n="554"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You are under the charge of<persName corresp="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">Mr. Athelney Jones</persName>, of Scotland Yard . He is going to bring you up to my rooms , and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter . You must make a clean breast of it , for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you . I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room . ”</said></p>
    <p n="555"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ That he was , sir . I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the window . It fairly shook me , sir . I 'd have half killed<persName>Tonga</persName>for it if he had not scrambled off . That was how he came to leave his club , and some of his darts too , as he tells me , which I dare say helped to put you on our track ; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell . I do n't feel no malice against you for it . But it does seem a queer thing , ”</said>he added , with a bitter smile ,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ that I who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans , and am like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor . It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant<persName>Achmet</persName>and had to do with the Agra treasure , which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it . To him it brought murder , to<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>it brought fear and guilt , to me it has meant slavery for life . ”</said></p>
    <p n="556">At this moment<persName corresp="#Athelney_Jones">Athelney Jones</persName>thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders into the tiny cabin .<said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Quite a family party , ”</said>he remarked .<said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ I think I shall have a pull at that flask ,<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>. Well , I think we may all congratulate each other . Pity we did n't take the other alive ; but there was no choice . I say ,<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, you must confess that you cut it rather fine . It was all we could do to overhaul her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="557"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ All is well that ends well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ But I certainly did not know that<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>was such a clipper . ”</said></p>
    <p n="558"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Smith</persName>says she is one of the fastest launches on the river , and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her . He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business . ”</said></p>
    <p n="559"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Neither he did , ”</said>cried our prisoner ,— “ not a word . I chose his launch because I heard that she was a flier . We told him nothing , but we paid him well , and he was to get something handsome if we reached our vessel , the Esmeralda , at Gravesend , outward bound for the Brazils . ”</p>
    <p n="560"><said who="#Jones">“ Well , if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him . If we are pretty quick in catching our men , we are not so quick in condemning them . ”</said>It was amusing to notice how the consequential<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the capture . From the slight smile which played over<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>'s face , I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him .</p>
    <p n="561"><said who="#Jones">“ We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>,<said who="#Jones">“ and shall land you ,<persName corresp="#Dr._Watson">Dr. Watson</persName>, with the treasure-box . I need hardly tell you that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this . It is most irregular ; but of course an agreement is an agreement . I must , however , as a matter of duty , send an inspector with you , since you have so valuable a charge . You will drive , no doubt ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="562"><said who="#Dr._Watson">“ Yes , I shall drive . ”</said></p>
    <p n="563"><said who="#Jones">“ It is a pity there is no key , that we may make an inventory first . You will have to break it open . Where is the key , my man ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="564"><said who="#Small">“ At the bottom of the river , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>, shortly .</p>
    <p n="565"><said who="#Jones">“ Hum ! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble . We have had work enough already through you . However , doctor , I need not warn you to be careful . Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street rooms . You will find us there , on our way to the station . ”</said></p>
    <p n="566">They landed me at Vauxhall , with my heavy iron box , and with a bluff , genial inspector as my companion . A quarter of an hour 's drive brought us to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">Mrs. Cecil Forrester</persName>'s . The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">Mrs. Cecil Forrester</persName>was out for the evening , she explained , and likely to be very late .<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>, however , was in the drawing-room : so to the drawing-room I went , box in hand , leaving the obliging inspector in the cab .</p>
    <p n="567">She was seated by the open window , dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material , with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist . The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair , playing over her sweet , grave face , and tinting with a dull , metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair . One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair , and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy . At the sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet , however , and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks .</p>
    <p n="568"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I heard a cab drive up , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I thought that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Forrester">Mrs. Forrester</persName>had come back very early , but I never dreamed that it might be you . What news have you brought me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="569"><said who="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">“ I have brought something better than news , ”</said>said I , putting down the box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously , though my heart was heavy within me .<said who="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">“ I have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world . I have brought you a fortune . ”</said></p>
    <p n="570">She glanced at iron box .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Is that the treasure , then ? ”</said>she asked , coolly enough .</p>
    <p n="571"><said who="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">“ Yes , this is the great Agra treasure . Half of it is yours and half is<persName corresp="#Thaddeus_Sholto">Thaddeus Sholto</persName>'s . You will have a couple of hundred thousand each . Think of that ! An annuity of ten thousand pounds . There will be few richer young ladies in England . Is it not glorious ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="572">I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight , and that she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations , for I saw her eyebrows rise a little , and she glanced at me curiously .</p>
    <p n="573"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ If I have it , ”</said>said she ,<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ I owe it to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="574"><said who="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">“ No , no , ”</said>I answered ,<said who="#Mrs._Cecil_Forrester">“ not to me , but to my friend<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>. With all the will in the world , I could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius . As it was , we very nearly lost it at the last moment . ”</said></p>
    <p n="575"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Pray sit down and tell me all about it ,<persName corresp="#Dr._Watson">Dr. Watson</persName>, ”</said>said she .</p>
    <p n="576">I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her last ,—<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>'s new method of search , the discovery of<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>, the appearance of<persName corresp="#Athelney_Jones">Athelney Jones</persName>, our expedition in the evening , and the wild chase down the Thames . She listened with parted lips and shining eyes to my recital of our adventures . When I spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us , she turned so white that I feared that she was about to faint .</p>
    <p n="577"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ It is nothing , ”</said>she said , as I hastened to pour her out some water .<said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ I am all right again . It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed my friends in such horrible peril . ”</said></p>
    <p n="578"><said who="#the_Aurora">“ That is all over , ”</said>I answered .<said who="#the_Aurora">“ It was nothing . I will tell you no more gloomy details . Let us turn to something brighter . There is the treasure . What could be brighter than that ? I got leave to bring it with me , thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="579"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ It would be of the greatest interest to me , ”</said>she said . There was no eagerness in her voice , however . It had struck her , doubtless , that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which had cost so much to win .</p>
    <p n="580"><said who="#the_Aurora">“ What a pretty box ! ”</said>she said , stooping over it .<said who="#the_Aurora">“ This is Indian work , I suppose ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="581"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Yes ; it is Benares metal-work . ”</said></p>
    <p n="582"><said who="#the_Aurora">“ And so heavy ! ”</said>she exclaimed , trying to raise it .<said who="#the_Aurora">“ The box alone must be of some value . Where is the key ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="583"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>threw it into the Thames , ”</said>I answered .<said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ I must borrow<persName corresp="#Mrs._Forrester">Mrs. Forrester</persName>'s poker . ”</said>There was in the front a thick and broad hasp , wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha . Under this I thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever . The hasp sprang open with a loud snap . With trembling fingers I flung back the lid . We both stood gazing in astonishment . The box was empty !</p>
    <p n="584">No wonder that it was heavy . The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch thick all round . It was massive , well made , and solid , like a chest constructed to carry things of great price , but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it . It was absolutely and completely empty .</p>
    <p n="585"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ The treasure is lost , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>, calmly .</p>
    <p n="586">As I listened to the words and realized what they meant , a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul . I did not know how this Agra treasure had weighed me down , until now that it was finally removed . It was selfish , no doubt , disloyal , wrong , but I could realize nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us .<said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Thank God ! ”</said>I ejaculated from my very heart .</p>
    <p n="587">She looked at me with a quick , questioning smile .<said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Why do you say that ? ”</said>she asked .</p>
    <p n="588"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Because you are within my reach again , ”</said>I said , taking her hand . She did not withdraw it .<said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Because I love you , Mary , as truly as ever a man loved a woman . Because this treasure , these riches , sealed my lips . Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you . That is why I said , ‘ Thank God . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="589"><said who="#Miss_Morstan">“ Then I say , ‘ Thank God , ’ too , ”</said>she whispered , as I drew her to my side . Whoever had lost a treasure , I knew that night that I had gained one .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="12">
    <p n="590">A very patient man was that inspector in the cab , for it was a weary time before I rejoined him . His face clouded over when I showed him the empty box .</p>
    <p n="591"><said>“ There goes the reward ! ”</said>said he , gloomily .<said>“ Where there is no money there is no pay . This night 's work would have been worth a tenner each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="592"><said>“<persName corresp="#Mr._Thaddeus">Mr. Thaddeus</persName><persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>is a rich man , ”</said>I said .<said>“ He will see that you are rewarded , treasure or no . ”</said></p>
    <p n="593">The inspector shook his head despondently , however .<said>“ It 's a bad job , ”</said>he repeated ;<said>“ and so<persName corresp="#Mr._Athelney_Jones">Mr. Athelney Jones</persName>will think . ”</said></p>
    <p n="594">His forecast proved to be correct , for the detective looked blank enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box . They had only just arrived ,<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, the prisoner , and he , for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way . My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless expression , while<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one . As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud .</p>
    <p n="595"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ This is your doing ,<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Athelney_Jones">Athelney Jones</persName>, angrily .</p>
    <p n="596"><said who="#Small">“ Yes , I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it , ”</said>he cried , exultantly .<said who="#Small">“ It is my treasure ; and if I can n't have the loot I 'll take darned good care that no one else does . I tell you that no living man has any right to it , unless it is three men who are in the Andaman convict-barracks and myself . I know now that I cannot have the use of it , and I know that they cannot . I have acted all through for them as much as for myself . It 's been the sign of four with us always . Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have done , and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>or of<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>. It was not to make them rich that we did for<persName>Achmet</persName>. You 'll find the treasure where the key is , and where little<persName>Tonga</persName>is . When I saw that your launch must catch us , I put the loot away in a safe place . There are no rupees for you this journey . ”</said></p>
    <p n="597"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ You are deceiving us ,<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Athelney_Jones">Athelney Jones</persName>, sternly .<said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ If you had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been easier for you to have thrown box and all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="598"><said who="#Small">“ Easier for me to throw , and easier for you to recover , ”</said>he answered , with a shrewd , sidelong look .<said who="#Small">“ The man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river . Now that they are scattered over five miles or so , it may be a harder job . It went to my heart to do it , though . I was half mad when you came up with us . However , there 's no good grieving over it . I 've had ups in my life , and I 've had downs , but I 've learned not to cry over spilled milk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="599"><said who="#the_detective">“ This is a very serious matter ,<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>, ”</said>said the detective .<said who="#the_detective">“ If you had helped justice , instead of thwarting it in this way , you would have had a better chance at your trial . ”</said></p>
    <p n="600"><said who="#Small">“ Justice ! ”</said>snarled the ex-convict .<said who="#Small">“ A pretty justice ! Whose loot is this , if it is not ours ? Where is the justice that I should give it up to those who have never earned it ? Look how I have earned it ! Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp , all day at work under the mangrove-tree , all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts , bitten by mosquitoes , racked with ague , bullied by every cursed black-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man . That was how I earned the Agra treasure ; and you talk to me of justice because I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may enjoy it ! I would rather swing a score of times , or have one of<persName>Tonga</persName>'s darts in my hide , than live in a convict 's cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine . ”</said><persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>had dropped his mask of stoicism , and all this came out in a wild whirl of words , while his eyes blazed , and the handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his hands . I could understand , as I saw the fury and the passion of the man , that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>when he first learned that the injured convict was upon his track .</p>
    <p n="601"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ You forget that we know nothing of all this , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>quietly .<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ We have not heard your story , and we cannot tell how far justice may originally have been on your side . ”</said></p>
    <p n="602"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , sir , you have been very fair-spoken to me , though I can see that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists . Still , I bear no grudge for that . It is all fair and above-board . If you want to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back . What I say to you is God 's truth , every word of it . Thank you ; you can put the glass beside me here , and I 'll put my lips to it if I am dry .</said></p>
    <p n="603"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I am a Worcestershire man myself ,— born near Pershore . I dare say you would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look . I have often thought of taking a look round there , but the truth is that I was never much of a credit to the family , and I doubt if they would be so very glad to see me . They were all steady , chapel-going folk , small farmers , well known and respected over the country-side , while I was always a bit of a rover . At last , however , when I was about eighteen , I gave them no more trouble , for I got into a mess over a girl , and could only get out of it again by taking the queen 's shilling and joining the 3d Buffs , which was just starting for India .</said></p>
    <p n="604"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I was n't destined to do much soldiering , however . I had just got past the goose-step , and learned to handle my musket , when I was fool enough to go swimming in the Ganges . Luckily for me , my company sergeant , John Holder , was in the water at the same time , and he was one of the finest swimmers in the service . A crocodile took me , just as I was half-way across , and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have done it , just above the knee . What with the shock and the loss of blood , I fainted , and should have drowned if Holder had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank . I was five months in hospital over it , and when at last I was able to limp out of it with this timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalided out of the army and unfitted for any active occupation .</said></p>
    <p n="605"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I was , as you can imagine , pretty down on my luck at this time , for I was a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year . However , my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise . A man named Abelwhite , who had come out there as an indigo-planter , wanted an overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work . He happened to be a friend of our colonel 's , who had taken an interest in me since the accident . To make a long story short , the colonel recommended me strongly for the post and , as the work was mostly to be done on horseback , my leg was no great obstacle , for I had enough knee left to keep good grip on the saddle . What I had to do was to ride over the plantation , to keep an eye on the men as they worked , and to report the idlers . The pay was fair , I had comfortable quarters , and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo-planting . Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man , and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me , for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home .</said></p>
    <p n="606"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , I was never in luck 's way long . Suddenly , without a note of warning , the great mutiny broke upon us . One month India lay as still and peaceful , to all appearance , as Surrey or Kent ; the next there were two hundred thousand black devils let loose , and the country was a perfect hell . Of course you know all about it , gentlemen ,— a deal more than I do , very like , since reading is not in my line . I only know what I saw with my own eyes . Our plantation was at a place called Muttra , near the border of the Northwest Provinces . Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows , and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children , on their way to Agra , where were the nearest troops . Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man . He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated , and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up . There he sat on his veranda , drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots , while the country was in a blaze about him . Of course we stuck by him , I and Dawson , who , with his wife , used to do the book-work and the managing . Well , one fine day the crash came . I had been away on a distant plantation , and was riding slowly home in the evening , when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah . I rode down to see what it was , and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson 's wife , all cut into ribbons , and half eaten by jackals and native dogs . A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face , quite dead , with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying across each other in front of him . I reined up my horse , wondering which way I should turn , but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abelwhite 's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof . I knew then that I could do my employer no good , but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter . From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends , with their red coats still on their backs , dancing and howling round the burning house . Some of them pointed at me , and a couple of bullets sang past my head ; so I broke away across the paddy-fields , and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra .</said></p>
    <p n="607"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ As it proved , however , there was no great safety there , either . The whole country was up like a swarm of bees . Wherever the English could collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns commanded . Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives . It was a fight of the millions against the hundreds ; and the cruellest part of it was that these men that we fought against , foot , horse , and gunners , were our own picked troops , whom we had taught and trained , handling our own weapons , and blowing our own bugle-calls . At Agra there were the 3d Bengal Fusiliers , some Sikhs , two troops of horse , and a battery of artillery . A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed , and this I joined , wooden leg and all . We went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July , and we beat them back for a time , but our powder gave out , and we had to fall back upon the city . Nothing but the worst news came to us from every side ,— which is not to be wondered at , for if you look at the map you will see that we were right in the heart of it . Lucknow is rather better than a hundred miles to the east , and Cawnpore about as far to the south . From every point on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and outrage .</said></p>
    <p n="608"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The city of Agra is a great place , swarming with fanatics and fierce devil-worshippers of all sorts . Our handful of men were lost among the narrow , winding streets . Our leader moved across the river , therefore , and took up his position in the old fort at Agra . I do n't know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort . It is a very queer place ,— the queerest that ever I was in , and I have been in some rum corners , too . First of all , it is enormous in size . I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres . There is a modern part , which took all our garrison , women , children , stores , and everything else , with plenty of room over . But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter , where nobody goes , and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes . It is all full of great deserted halls , and winding passages , and long corridors twisting in and out , so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it . For this reason it was seldom that any one went into it , though now and again a party with torches might go exploring .</said></p>
    <p n="609"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The river washes along the front of the old fort , and so protects it , but on the sides and behind there are many doors , and these had to be guarded , of course , in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops . We were short-handed , with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns . It was impossible for us , therefore , to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates . What we did was to organize a central guard-house in the middle of the fort , and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives . I was selected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door upon the southwest side of the building . Two Sikh troopers were placed under my command , and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket , when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard . As the guard was a good two hundred paces away , however , and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors , I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack .</said></p>
    <p n="610"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , I was pretty proud at having this small command given me , since I was a raw recruit , and a game-legged one at that . For two nights I kept the watch with my Punjaubees . They were tall , fierce-looking chaps ,<persName corresp="#Mahomet_Singh">Mahomet Singh</persName>and Abdullah Khan by name , both old fighting-men who had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah . They could talk English pretty well , but I could get little out of them . They preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo . For myself , I used to stand outside the gate-way , looking down on the broad , winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city . The beating of drums , the rattle of tomtoms , and the yells and howls of the rebels , drunk with opium and with bang , were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbors across the stream . Every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts , to make sure that all was well .</said></p>
    <p n="611"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The third night of my watch was dark and dirty , with a small , driving rain . It was dreary work standing in the gate-way hour after hour in such weather . I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk , but without much success . At two in the morning the rounds passed , and broke for a moment the weariness of the night . Finding that my companions would not be led into conversation , I took out my pipe , and laid down my musket to strike the match . In an instant the two Sikhs were upon me . One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my head , while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step .</said></p>
    <p n="612"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ My first thought was that these fellows were in league with the rebels , and that this was the beginning of an assault . If our door were in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall , and the women and children be treated as they were in Cawnpore . Maybe you gentlemen think that I am just making out a case for myself , but I give you my word that when I thought of that , though I felt the point of the knife at my throat , I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream , if it was my last one , which might alarm the main guard . The man who held me seemed to know my thoughts ; for , even as I braced myself to it , he whispered , ‘ Do n't make a noise . The fort is safe enough . There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river . ’ There was the ring of truth in what he said , and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man . I could read it in the fellow 's brown eyes . I waited , therefore , in silence , to see what it was that they wanted from me .</said></p>
    <p n="613"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Listen to me ,<persName corresp="#Sahib">Sahib</persName>, ’ said the taller and fiercer of the pair , the one whom they called Abdullah Khan . ‘ You must either be with us now or you must be silenced forever . The thing is too great a one for us to hesitate . Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the cross of the Christians , or your body this night shall be thrown into the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army . There is no middle way . Which is it to be , death or life ? We can only give you three minutes to decide , for the time is passing , and all must be done before the rounds come again . ’</said></p>
    <p n="614"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ How can I decide ? ’ said I . ‘ You have not told me what you want of me . But I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of the fort I will have no truck with it , so you can drive home your knife and welcome . ’</said></p>
    <p n="615"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ It is nothing against the fort , ’ said he . ‘ We only ask you to do that which your countrymen come to this land for . We ask you to be rich . If you will be one of us this night , we will swear to you upon the naked knife , and by the threefold oath which no Sikh was ever known to break , that you shall have your fair share of the loot . A quarter of the treasure shall be yours . We can say no fairer . ’</said></p>
    <p n="616"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ But what is the treasure , then ? ’ I asked . ‘ I am as ready to be rich as you can be , if you will but show me how it can be done . ’</said></p>
    <p n="617"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ You will swear , then , ’ said he , ‘ by the bones of your father , by the honor of your mother , by the cross of your faith , to raise no hand and speak no word against us , either now or afterwards ? ’</said></p>
    <p n="618"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ I will swear it , ’ I answered , ‘ provided that the fort is not endangered . ’</said></p>
    <p n="619"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Then my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of the treasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us . ’</said></p>
    <p n="620"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ There are but three , ’ said I .</said></p>
    <p n="621"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ No ; Dost Akbar must have his share . We can tell the tale to you while we await them . Do you stand at the gate ,<persName corresp="#Mahomet_Singh">Mahomet Singh</persName>, and give notice of their coming . The thing stands thus ,<persName corresp="#Sahib">Sahib</persName>, and I tell it to you because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee , and that we may trust you . Had you been a lying Hindoo , though you had sworn by all the gods in their false temples , your blood would have been upon the knife , and your body in the water . But the Sikh knows the Englishman , and the Englishman knows the Sikh . Hearken , then , to what I have to say .</said></p>
    <p n="622"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth , though his lands are small . Much has come to him from his father , and more still he has set by himself , for he is of a low nature and hoards his gold rather than spend it . When the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger ,— with the Sepoy and with the Company 's Raj . Soon , however , it seemed to him that the white men 's day was come , for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow . Yet , being a careful man , he made such plans that , come what might , half at least of his treasure should be left to him . That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace , but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box , and sent it by a trusty servant who , under the guise of a merchant , should take it to the fort at Agra , there to lie until the land is at peace . Thus , if the rebels won he would have his money , but if the Company conquered his jewels would be saved to him . Having thus divided his hoard , he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys , since they were strong upon his borders . By doing this , mark you ,<persName corresp="#Sahib">Sahib</persName>, his property becomes the due of those who have been true to their salt .</said></p>
    <p n="623"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ This pretended merchant , who travels under the name of<persName>Achmet</persName>, is now in the city of Agra , and desires to gain his way into the fort . He has with him as travelling-companion my foster-brother Dost Akbar , who knows his secret . Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a side-postern of the fort , and has chosen this one for his purpose . Here he will come presently , and here he will find<persName corresp="#Mahomet_Singh">Mahomet Singh</persName>and myself awaiting him . The place is lonely , and none shall know of his coming . The world shall know of the merchant<persName>Achmet</persName>no more , but the great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us . What say you to it ,<persName corresp="#Sahib">Sahib</persName>? ’</said></p>
    <p n="624"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing ; but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and you have been used to meeting death at every turn . Whether<persName>Achmet</persName>the merchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me , but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it , and I thought of what I might do in the old country with it , and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne'erhYpppHeNdohYpppHeNwell coming back with his pockets full of gold moidores . I had , therefore , already made up my mind . Abdullah Khan , however , thinking that I hesitated , pressed the matter more closely .</said></p>
    <p n="625"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Consider ,<persName corresp="#Sahib">Sahib</persName>, ’ said he , ‘ that if this man is taken by the commandant he will be hung or shot , and his jewels taken by the government , so that no man will be a rupee the better for them . Now , since we do the taking of him , why should we not do the rest as well ? The jewels will be as well with us as in the Company 's coffers . There will be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs . No one can know about the matter , for here we are cut off from all men . What could be better for the purpose ? Say again , then ,<persName corresp="#Sahib">Sahib</persName>, whether you are with us , or if we must look upon you as an enemy . ’</said></p>
    <p n="626"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ I am with you heart and soul , ’ said I .</said></p>
    <p n="627"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ It is well , ’ he answered , handing me back my firelock . ‘ You see that we trust you , for your word , like ours , is not to be broken . We have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant . ’</said></p>
    <p n="628"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Does your brother know , then , of what you will do ? ’ I asked .</said></p>
    <p n="629"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ The plan is his . He has devised it . We will go to the gate and share the watch with<persName corresp="#Mahomet_Singh">Mahomet Singh</persName>. ’</said></p>
    <p n="630"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The rain was still falling steadily , for it was just the beginning of the wet season . Brown , heavy clouds were drifting across the sky , and it was hard to see more than a stone-cast . A deep moat lay in front of our door , but the water was in places nearly dried up , and it could easily be crossed . It was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death .</said></p>
    <p n="631"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side of the moat . It vanished among the mound-heaps , and then appeared again coming slowly in our direction .</said></p>
    <p n="632"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Here they are ! ’ I exclaimed .</said></p>
    <p n="633"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ You will challenge him ,<persName corresp="#Sahib">Sahib</persName>, as usual , ’ whispered Abdullah . ‘ Give him no cause for fear . Send us in with him , and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard . Have the lantern ready to uncover , that we may be sure that it is indeed the man . ’</said></p>
    <p n="634"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The light had flickered onwards , now stopping and now advancing , until I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat . I let them scramble down the sloping bank , splash through the mire , and climb half-way up to the gate , before I challenged them .</said></p>
    <p n="635"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Who goes there ? ’ said I , in a subdued voice .</said></p>
    <p n="636"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Friends , ’ came the answer . I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them . The first was an enormous Sikh , with a black beard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund . Outside of a show I have never seen so tall a man . The other was a little , fat , round fellow , with a great yellow turban , and a bundle in his hand , done up in a shawl . He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear , for his hands twitched as if he had the ague , and his head kept turning to left and right with two bright little twinkling eyes , like a mouse when he ventures out from his hole . It gave me the chills to think of killing him , but I thought of the treasure , and my heart set as hard as a flint within me . When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy and came running up towards me .</said></p>
    <p n="637"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Your protection ,<persName corresp="#Sahib">Sahib</persName>, ’ he panted ,— ‘ your protection for the unhappy merchant<persName>Achmet</persName>. I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek the shelter of the fort at Agra . I have been robbed and beaten and abused because I have been the friend of the Company . It is a blessed night this when I am once more in safety ,— I and my poor possessions . ’</said></p>
    <p n="638"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ What have you in the bundle ? ’ I asked .</said></p>
    <p n="639"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ An iron box , ’ he answered , ‘ which contains one or two little family matters which are of no value to others , but which I should be sorry to lose . Yet I am not a beggar ; and I shall reward you , young<persName corresp="#Sahib">Sahib</persName>, and your governor also , if he will give me the shelter I ask . ’</said></p>
    <p n="640"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man . The more I looked at his fat , frightened face , the harder did it seem that we should slay him in cold blood . It was best to get it over .</said></p>
    <p n="641"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Take him to the main guard , ’ said I . The two Sikhs closed in upon him on each side , and the giant walked behind , while they marched in through the dark gate-way . Never was a man so compassed round with death . I remained at the gate-way with the lantern .</said></p>
    <p n="642"><said who="#Major_Sholto">“ I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors . Suddenly it ceased , and I heard voices , and a scuffle , with the sound of blows . A moment later there came , to my horror , a rush of footsteps coming in my direction , with the loud breathing of a running man . I turned my lantern down the long , straight passage , and there was the fat man , running like the wind , with a smear of blood across his face , and close at his heels , bounding like a tiger , the great black-bearded Sikh , with a knife flashing in his hand . I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant . He was gaining on the Sikh , and I could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet . My heart softened to him , but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter . I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past , and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit . Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him , and buried his knife twice in his side . The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle , but lay were he had fallen . I think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall . You see , gentlemen , that I am keeping my promise . I am telling you every work of the business just exactly as it happened , whether it is in my favor or not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="643">He stopped , and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water which<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>had brewed for him . For myself , I confess that I had now conceived the utmost horror of the man , not only for this cold-blooded business in which he had been concerned , but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrated it . Whatever punishment was in store for him , I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me .<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>and<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>sat with their hands upon their knees , deeply interested in the story , but with the same disgust written upon their faces . He may have observed it , for there was a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceeded .</p>
    <p n="644"><said who="#Jones">“ It was all very bad , no doubt , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Jones">“ I should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains . Besides , it was my life or his when once he was in the fort . If he had got out , the whole business would come to light , and I should have been court-martialled and shot as likely as not ; for people were not very lenient at a time like that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="645"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Go on with your story , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, shortly .</p>
    <p n="646"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , we carried him in , Abdullah , Akbar , and I . A fine weight he was , too , for all that he was so short .<persName corresp="#Mahomet_Singh">Mahomet Singh</persName>was left to guard the door . We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared . It was some distance off , where a winding passage leads to a great empty hall , the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces . The earth floor had sunk in at one place , making a natural grave , so we left<persName>Achmet</persName>the merchant there , having first covered him over with loose bricks . This done , we all went back to the treasure .</said></p>
    <p n="647"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked . The box was the same which now lies open upon your table . A key was hung by a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top . We opened it , and the light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore . It was blinding to look upon them . When we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them . There were one hundred and forty-three diamonds of the first water , including one which has been called , I believe , ‘ the Great Mogul ’ and is said to be the second largest stone in existence . Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds , and one hundred and seventy rubies , some of which , however , were small . There were forty carbuncles , two hundred and ten sapphires , sixty-one agates , and a great quantity of beryls , onyxes , cats ’ - eyes , turquoises , and other stones , the very names of which I did not know at the time , though I have become more familiar with them since . Besides this , there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls , twelve of which were set in a gold coronet . By the way , these last had been taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it .</said></p>
    <p n="648"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gate-way to show them to<persName corresp="#Mahomet_Singh">Mahomet Singh</persName>. Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret . We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again , and then to divide it equally among ourselves . There was no use dividing it at present , for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion , and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them . We carried the box , therefore , into the same hall where we had buried the body , and there , under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall , we made a hollow and put our treasure . We made careful note of the place , and next day I drew four plans , one for each of us , and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom , for we had sworn that we should each always act for all , so that none might take advantage . That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken .</said></p>
    <p n="649"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , there 's no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian mutiny . After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the back of the business was broken . Fresh troops came pouring in , and Nana<persName corresp="#Sahib">Sahib</persName>made himself scarce over the frontier . A flying column under Colonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away from it . Peace seemed to be settling upon the country , and we four were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off with our shares of the plunder . In a moment , however , our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of<persName>Achmet</persName>.</said></p>
    <p n="650"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It came about in this way . When the rajah put his jewels into the hands of<persName>Achmet</persName>he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man . They are suspicious folk in the East , however : so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first ? This second man was ordered never to let<persName>Achmet</persName>out of his sight , and he followed him like his shadow . He went after him that night and saw him pass through the doorway . Of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort , and applied for admission there himself next day , but could find no trace of<persName>Achmet</persName>. This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides , who brought it to the ears of the commandant . A thorough search was quickly made , and the body was discovered . Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder ,— three of us because we had held the gate that night , and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man . Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial , for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India : so no one had any particular interest in them . The murder , however , was clearly made out , and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it . The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life , and I was condemned to death , though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others .</said></p>
    <p n="651"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then . There we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of ever getting out again , while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it . It was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office , to have rice to eat and water to drink , when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside , just waiting to be picked up . It might have driven me mad ; but I was always a pretty stubborn one , so I just held on and bided my time .</said></p>
    <p n="652"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ At last it seemed to me to have come . I was changed from Agra to Madras , and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans . There are very few white convicts at this settlement , and , as I had behaved well from the first , I soon found myself a sort of privileged person . I was given a hut in Hope Town , which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet , and I was left pretty much to myself . It is a dreary , fever-stricken place , and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives , who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance . There was digging , and ditching , and yam-planting , and a dozen other things to be done , so we were busy enough all day ; though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves . Among other things , I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon , and picked up a smattering of his knowledge . All the time I was on the lookout for a chance of escape ; but it is hundreds of miles from any other land , and there is little or no wind in those seas : so it was a terribly difficult job to get away .</said></p>
    <p n="653"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ The surgeon , Dr. Somerton , was a fast , sporting young chap , and the other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play cards . The surgery , where I used to make up my drugs , was next to his sitting-room , with a small window between us . Often , if I felt lonesome , I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery , and then , standing there , I could hear their talk and watch their play . I am fond of a hand at cards myself , and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others . There was<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>,<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>, and Lieutenant Bromley Brown , who were in command of the native troops , and there was the surgeon himself , and two or three prison-officials , crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game . A very snug little party they used to make .</said></p>
    <p n="654"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , there was one thing which very soon struck me , and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win . Mind , I do n't say that there was anything unfair , but so it was . These prison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans , and they knew each other 's game to a point , while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow . Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men , and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play .<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>was the hardest hit . He used to pay in notes and gold at first , but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums . He sometimes would win for a few deals , just to give him heart , and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever . All day he would wander about as black as thunder , and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him .</said></p>
    <p n="655"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ One night he lost even more heavily than usual . I was sitting in my hut when he and<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>came stumbling along on the way to their quarters . They were bosom friends , those two , and never far apart . The major was raving about his losses .</said></p>
    <p n="656"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ It 's all up ,<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>, ’ he was saying , as they passed my hut . ‘ I shall have to send in my papers . I am a ruined man . ’</said></p>
    <p n="657"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Nonsense , old chap ! ’ said the other , slapping him upon the shoulder . ‘ I 've had a nasty facer myself , but — ’ That was all I could hear , but it was enough to set me thinking .</said></p>
    <p n="658"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ A couple of days later<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>was strolling on the beach : so I took the chance of speaking to him .</said></p>
    <p n="659"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ I wish to have your advice , major , ’ said I .</said></p>
    <p n="660"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Well ,<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>, what is it ? ’ he asked , taking his cheroot from his lips .</said></p>
    <p n="661"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ I wanted to ask you , sir , ’ said I , ‘ who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over . I know where half a million worth lies , and , as I cannot use it myself , I thought perhaps the best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities , and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for me . ’</said></p>
    <p n="662"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Half a million ,<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>? ’ he gasped , looking hard at me to see if I was in earnest .</said></p>
    <p n="663"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Quite that , sir ,— in jewels and pearls . It lies there ready for any one . And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed and cannot hold property , so that it belongs to the first comer . ’</said></p>
    <p n="664"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ To government ,<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>, ’ he stammered ,— ‘ to government . ’ But he said it in a halting fashion , and I knew in my heart that I had got him .</said></p>
    <p n="665"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ You think , then , sir , that I should give the information to the Governor-General ? ’ said I , quietly .</said></p>
    <p n="666"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Well , well , you must not do anything rash , or that you might repent . Let me hear all about it ,<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>. Give me the facts . ’</said></p>
    <p n="667"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I told him the whole story , with small changes so that he could not identify the places . When I had finished he stood stock still and full of thought . I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a struggle going on within him .</said></p>
    <p n="668"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ This is a very important matter ,<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>, ’ he said , at last . ‘ You must not say a word to any one about it , and I shall see you again soon . ’</said></p>
    <p n="669"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Two nights later he and his friend<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern .</said></p>
    <p n="670"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ I want you just to let<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>hear that story from your own lips ,<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>, ’ said he .</said></p>
    <p n="671"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ I repeated it as I had told it before .</said></p>
    <p n="672"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ It rings true , eh ? ’ said he . ‘ It 's good enough to act upon ? ’</said></p>
    <p n="673"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>nodded .</said></p>
    <p n="674"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Look here ,<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>, ’ said the major . ‘ We have been talking it over , my friend here and I , and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours is hardly a government matter , after all , but is a private concern of your own , which of course you have the power of disposing of as you think best . Now , the question is , what price would you ask for it ? We might be inclined to take it up , and at least look into it , if we could agree as to terms . ’ He tried to speak in a cool , careless way , but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed .</said></p>
    <p n="675"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Why , as to that , gentlemen , ’ I answered , trying also to be cool , but feeling as excited as he did , ‘ there is only one bargain which a man in my position can make . I shall want you to help me to my freedom , and to help my three companions to theirs . We shall then take you into partnership , and give you a fifth share to divide between you . ’</said></p>
    <p n="676"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Hum ! ’ said he . ‘ A fifth share ! That is not very tempting . ’</said></p>
    <p n="677"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ It would come to fifty thousand apiece , ’ said I .</said></p>
    <p n="678"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ But how can we gain your freedom ? You know very well that you ask an impossibility . ’</said></p>
    <p n="679"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Nothing of the sort , ’ I answered . ‘ I have thought it all out to the last detail . The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit for the voyage , and no provisions to last us for so long a time . There are plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would serve our turn well . Do you bring one over . We shall engage to get aboard her by night , and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain . ’</said></p>
    <p n="680"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ If there were only one , ’ he said .</said></p>
    <p n="681"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ None or all , ’ I answered . ‘ We have sworn it . The four of us must always act together . ’</said></p>
    <p n="682"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ You see ,<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>, ’ said he , ‘<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>is a man of his word . He does not flinch from his friend . I think we may very well trust him . ’</said></p>
    <p n="683"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ It 's a dirty business , ’ the other answered . ‘ Yet , as you say , the money would save our commissions handsomely . ’</said></p>
    <p n="684"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Well ,<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>, ’ said the major , ‘ we must , I suppose , try and meet you . We must first , of course , test the truth of your story . Tell me where the box is hid , and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India in the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair . ’</said></p>
    <p n="685"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Not so fast , ’ said I , growing colder as he got hot . ‘ I must have the consent of my three comrades . I tell you that it is four or none with us . ’</said></p>

    <p n="687"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ ‘ Black or blue , ’ said I , ‘ they are in with me , and we all go together . ’</said></p>
    <p n="688"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , the matter ended by a second meeting , at which<persName corresp="#Mahomet_Singh">Mahomet Singh</persName>, Abdullah Khan , and Dost Akbar were all present . We talked the matter over again , and at last we came to an arrangement . We were to provide both the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid .<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>was to go to India to test our story . If he found the box he was to leave it there , to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage , which was to lie off Rutland Island , and to which we were to make our way , and finally to return to his duties .<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>was then to apply for leave of absence , to meet us at Agra , and there we were to have a final division of the treasure , he taking the major 's share as well as his own . All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter . I sat up all night with paper and ink , and by the morning I had the two charts all ready , signed with the sign of four ,— that is , of Abdullah , Akbar , Mahomet , and myself .</said></p>
    <p n="689"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , gentlemen , I weary you with my long story , and I know that my friend Mr.<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey . I 'll make it as short as I can . The villain<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>went off to India , but he never came back again .<persName corresp="#Morstan">Captain Morstan</persName>showed me his name among a list of passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards . His uncle had died , leaving him a fortune , and he had left the army , yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us .<persName corresp="#Morstan">Morstan</persName>went over to Agra shortly afterwards , and found , as we expected , that the treasure was indeed gone . The scoundrel had stolen it all , without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret . From that day I lived only for vengeance . I thought of it by day and I nursed it by night . It became an overpowering , absorbing passion with me . I cared nothing for the law ,— nothing for the gallows . To escape , to track down<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>, to have my hand upon his throat ,— that was my one thought . Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slaying of<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>.</said></p>
    <p n="690"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , I have set my mind on many things in this life , and never one which I did not carry out . But it was weary years before my time came . I have told you that I had picked up something of medicine . One day when Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was picked up by a convict-gang in the woods . He was sick to death , and had gone to a lonely place to die . I took him in hand , though he was as venomous as a young snake , and after a couple of months I got him all right and able to walk . He took a kind of fancy to me then , and would hardly go back to his woods , but was always hanging about my hut . I learned a little of his lingo from him , and this made him all the fonder of me .</said></p>
    <p n="691"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“<persName>Tonga</persName>— for that was his name — was a fine boatman , and owned a big , roomy canoe of his own . When I found that he was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me , I saw my chance of escape . I talked it over with him . He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded , and there he was to pick me up . I gave him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams , cocoa-nuts , and sweet potatoes .</said></p>
    <p n="692"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ He was stanch and true , was little<persName>Tonga</persName>. No man ever had a more faithful mate . At the night named he had his boat at the wharf . As it chanced , however , there was one of the convict-guard down there ,— a vile Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me . I had always vowed vengeance , and now I had my chance . It was as if fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island . He stood on the bank with his back to me , and his carbine on his shoulder . I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains with , but none could I see . Then a queer thought came into my head and showed me where I could lay my hand on a weapon . I sat down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg . With three long hops I was on him . He put his carbine to his shoulder , but I struck him full , and knocked the whole front of his skull in . You can see the split in the wood now where I hit him . We both went down together , for I could not keep my balance , but when I got up I found him still lying quiet enough . I made for the boat , and in an hour we were well out at sea .<persName>Tonga</persName>had brought all his earthly possessions with him , his arms and his gods . Among other things , he had a long bamboo spear , and some Andaman cocoa-nut matting , with which I made a sort of sail . For ten days we were beating about , trusting to luck , and on the eleventh we were picked up by a trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay pilgrims . They were a rum crowd , and<persName>Tonga</persName>and I soon managed to settle down among them . They had one very good quality : they let you alone and asked no questions .</said></p>
    <p n="693"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ Well , if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and I went through , you would not thank me , for I would have you here until the sun was shining . Here and there we drifted about the world , something always turning up to keep us from London . All the time , however , I never lost sight of my purpose . I would dream of<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>at night . A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep . At last , however , some three or four years ago , we found ourselves in England . I had no great difficulty in finding where<persName corresp="#Sholto">Sholto</persName>lived , and I set to work to discover whether he had realized the treasure , or if he still had it . I made friends with someone who could help me ,— I name no names , for I do n't want to get any one else in a hole ,— and I soon found that he still had the jewels . Then I tried to get at him in many ways ; but he was pretty sly , and had always two prize-fighters , besides his sons and his khitmutgar , on guard over him .</said></p>
    <p n="694"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ One day , however , I got word that he was dying . I hurried at once to the garden , mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that , and , looking through the window , I saw him lying in his bed , with his sons on each side of him . I 'd have come through and taken my chance with the three of them , only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped , and I knew that he was gone . I got into his room that same night , though , and I searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had hidden our jewels . There was not a line , however : so I came away , bitter and savage as a man could be . Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred : so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us , as it had been on the chart , and I pinned it on his bosom . It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled .</said></p>
    <p n="695"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor<persName>Tonga</persName>at fairs and other such places as the black cannibal . He would eat raw meat and dance his war-dance : so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day 's work . I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge , and for some years there was no news to hear , except that they were hunting for the treasure . At last , however , came what we had waited for so long . The treasure had been found . It was up at the top of the house , in Mr.<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew Sholto</persName>'s chemical laboratory . I came at once and had a look at the place , but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make my way up to it . I learned , however , about a trap-door in the roof , and also about<persName corresp="#Mr._Sholto">Mr. Sholto</persName>'s supper-hour . It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through<persName>Tonga</persName>. I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist . He could climb like a cat , and he soon made his way through the roof , but , as ill luck would have it ,<persName corresp="#Bartholomew_Sholto">Bartholomew Sholto</persName>was still in the room , to his cost .<persName>Tonga</persName>thought he had done something very clever in killing him , for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock . Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope 's end and cursed him for a little blood-thirsty imp . I took the treasure-box and let it down , and then slid down myself , having first left the sign of the four upon the table , to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them .<persName>Tonga</persName>then pulled up the rope , closed the window , and made off the way that he had come .</said></p>
    <p n="696"><said who="#Jones">“ I do n't know that I have anything else to tell you . I had heard a waterman speak of the speed of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Smith</persName>'s launch<persName corresp="#the_Aurora">the Aurora</persName>, so I thought she would be a handy craft for our escape . I engaged with old<persName corresp="#Mrs._Smith">Smith</persName>, and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship . He knew , no doubt , that there was some screw loose , but he was not in our secrets . All this is the truth , and if I tell it to you , gentlemen , it is not to amuse you ,— for you have not done me a very good turn ,— but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing , but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by<persName corresp="#Major_Sholto">Major Sholto</persName>, and how innocent I am of the death of his son . ”</said></p>
    <p n="697"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ A very remarkable account , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>.<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ A fitting wind-up to an extremely interesting case . There is nothing at all new to me in the latter part of your narrative , except that you brought your own rope . That I did not know . By the way , I had hoped that<persName>Tonga</persName>had lost all his darts ; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat . ”</said></p>

    <p n="702"><said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ Well ,<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Holmes</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Athelney_Jones">Athelney Jones</persName>,<said who="#Athelney_Jones">“ You are a man to be humored , and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime , but duty is duty , and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me . I shall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under lock and key . The cab still waits , and there are two inspectors down-stairs . I am much obliged to you both for your assistance . Of course you will be wanted at the trial . Good-night to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="703"><said who="#Jonathan_Small">“ Good-night , gentlemen both , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jonathan_Small">Jonathan Small</persName>.</p>
    <p n="704"><said who="#Jones">“ You first ,<persName corresp="#Small">Small</persName>, ”</said>remarked the wary<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>as they left the room .<said who="#Jones">“ I 'll take particular care that you do n't club me with your wooden leg , whatever you may have done to the gentleman at the Andaman Isles . ”</said></p>
    <p n="705"><said who="#Small">“ Well , and there is the end of our little drama , ”</said>I remarked , after we had set some time smoking in silence .<said who="#Small">“ I fear that it may be the last investigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your methods .<persName corresp="#Miss_Morstan">Miss Morstan</persName>has done me the honor to accept me as a husband in prospective . ”</said></p>
    <p n="706">He gave a most dismal groan .<said who="#Jones">“ I feared as much , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Jones">“ I really cannot congratulate you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="707">I was a little hurt .<said who="#Jonathan_Small">“ Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my choice ? ”</said>I asked .</p>
    <p n="708"><said who="#Jones">“ Not at all . I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met , and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing . She had a decided genius that way : witness the way in which she preserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father . But love is an emotional thing , and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things . I should never marry myself , lest I bias my judgment . ”</said></p>
    <p n="709"><said who="#Jonathan_Small">“ I trust , ”</said>said I , laughing ,<said who="#Jonathan_Small">“ that my judgment may survive the ordeal . But you look weary . ”</said></p>
    <p n="710"><said who="#Jones">“ Yes , the reaction is already upon me . I shall be as limp as a rag for a week . ”</said></p>
    <p n="711"><said who="#Jonathan_Small">“ Strange , ”</said>said I ,<said who="#Jonathan_Small">“ how terms of what in another man I should call laziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigor . ”</said></p>
    <p n="712"><said who="#Jones">“ Yes , ”</said>he answered ,<said who="#Jones">“ there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer and also of a pretty spry sort of fellow . I often think of those lines of old Goethe ,—</said></p>
    <p n="713">Schade dass die Natur nur EINEN Mensch aus Dir schuf , Denn zum wuerdigen Mann war und zum Schelmen der Stoff .</p>
    <p n="714"><said>“ By the way , a propos of this Norwood business , you see that they had , as I surmised , a confederate in the house , who could be none other than Lal Rao , the butler : so<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>actually has the undivided honor of having caught one fish in his great haul . ”</said></p>
    <p n="715"><said who="#Jones">“ The division seems rather unfair , ”</said>I remarked .<said>“ You have done all the work in this business . I get a wife out of it ,<persName corresp="#Jones">Jones</persName>gets the credit , pray what remains for you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="716"><said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ For me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sherlock_Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</persName>,<said who="#Sherlock_Holmes">“ there still remains the cocaine-bottle . ”</said>And he stretched his long white hand up for it .</p>
