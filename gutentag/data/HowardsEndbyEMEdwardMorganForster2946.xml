    <p n="2"><said >“ Tuesday .</said></p>
    <p n="3"><said >“ Dearest<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>,</said></p>
    <p n="4"><said >“ It is n't going to be what we expected . It is old and little , and altogether delightful — red brick . We can scarcely pack in as it is , and the dear knows what will happen when<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>( younger son ) arrives to-morrow . From hall you go right or left into dining-room or drawing-room . Hall itself is practically a room . You open another door in it , and there are the stairs going up in a sort of tunnel to the first-floor . Three bed-rooms in a row there , and three attics in a row above . That is n't all the house really , but it 's all that one notices — nine windows as you look up from the front garden .</said></p>
    <p n="5"><said >“ Then there 's a very big wych-elm — to the left as you look up — leaning a little over the house , and standing on the boundary between the garden and meadow . I quite love that tree already . Also ordinary elms , oaks — no nastier than ordinary oaks — pear-trees , apple-trees , and a vine . No silver birches , though . However , I must get on to my host and hostess . I only wanted to show that it is n't the least what we expected . Why did we settle that their house would be all gables and wiggles , and their garden all gamboge-coloured paths ? I believe simply because we associate them with expensive hotels —<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>trailing in beautiful dresses down long corridors ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>bullying porters , etc . We females are that unjust .</said></p>
    <p n="6"><said >“ I shall be back Saturday ; will let you know train later . They are as angry as I am that you did not come too ; really<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>is too tiresome , he starts a new mortal disease every month . How could he have got hay fever in London ? and even if he could , it seems hard that you should give up a visit to hear a schoolboy sneeze . Tell him that<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles Wilcox</persName>( the son who is here ) has hay fever too , but he 's brave , and gets quite cross when we inquire after it . Men like the Wilcoxes would do<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>a power of good . But you wo n't agree , and I 'd better change the subject .</said></p>
    <p n="7"><said >“ This long letter is because I 'm writing before breakfast . Oh , the beautiful vine leaves ! The house is covered with a vine . I looked out earlier , and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>was already in the garden . She evidently loves it . No wonder she sometimes looks tired . She was watching the large red poppies come out . Then she walked off the lawn to the meadow , whose corner to the right I can just see . Trail , trail , went her long dress over the sopping grass , and she came back with her hands full of the hay that was cut yesterday — I suppose for rabbits or something , as she kept on smelling it . The air here is delicious . Later on I heard the noise of croquet balls , and looked out again , and it was<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles Wilcox</persName>practising ; they are keen on all games . Presently he started sneezing and had to stop . Then I hear more clicketing , and it is<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>practising , and then , ‘ a-tissue , a-tissue ': he has to stop too . Then<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>comes out , and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a green-gage-tree — they put everything to use — and then she says ‘ a-tissue , ’ and in she goes . And finally<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>reappears , trail , trail , still smelling hay and looking at the flowers . I inflict all this on you because once you said that life is sometimes life and sometimes only a drama , and one must learn to distinguish tother from which , and up to now I have always put that down as ‘<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>'s clever nonsense . ’ But this morning , it really does seem not life but a play , and it did amuse me enormously to watch<persName>the W</persName>'s . Now<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>has come in .</said></p>
    <p n="8"><said >“ I am going to wear [ omission ] . Last night<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>wore an [ omission ] , and<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>[ omission ] . So it is n't exactly a go-as-you-please place , and if you shut your eyes it still seems the wiggly hotel that we expected . Not if you open them . The dog-roses are too sweet . There is a great hedge of them over the lawn — magnificently tall , so that they fall down in garlands , and nice and thin at the bottom , so that you can see ducks through it and a cow . These belong to the farm , which is the only house near us . There goes the breakfast gong . Much love . Modified love to<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>to<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>; how good of her to come and keep you company , but what a bore . Burn this . Will write again Thursday .</said></p>
    <p n="9"><said>“ HELEN . ”</said></p>
    <p n="10"><said >“ Howards End</said></p>
    <p n="11"><said >“ Friday</said></p>
    <p n="12"><said >“ Dearest<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>,</said></p>
    <p n="13"><said >“ I am having a glorious time . I like them all .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, if quieter than in Germany , is sweeter than ever , and I never saw anything like her steady unselfishness , and the best of it is that the others do not take advantage of her . They are the very happiest , jolliest family that you can imagine . I do really feel that we are making friends . The fun of it is that they think me a noodle , and say so — at least ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>does — and when that happens , and one does n't mind , it 's a pretty sure test , is n't it ? He says the most horrid things about woman 's suffrage so nicely , and when I said I believed in equality he just folded his arms and gave me such a setting down as I 've never had .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, shall we ever learn to talk less ? I never felt so ashamed of myself in my life . I could n't point to a time when men had been equal , nor even to a time when the wish to be equal had made them happier in other ways . I could n't say a word . I had just picked up the notion that equality is good from some book — probably from poetry , or you . Anyhow , it 's been knocked into pieces , and , like all people who are really strong ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>did it without hurting me . On the other hand , I laugh at them for catching hay fever . We live like fighting-cocks , and<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>takes us out every day in the motor — a tomb with trees in it , a hermit 's house , a wonderful road that was made by the Kings of Mercia — tennis — a cricket match — bridge and at night we squeeze up in this lovely house . The whole clan 's here now — it 's like a rabbit warren .<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>is a dear . They want me to stop over Sunday — I suppose it wo n't matter if I do . Marvellous weather and the views marvellous — views westward to the high ground . Thank you for your letter . Burn this .</said></p>
    <p n="14"><said who="#Margaret">“ Your affectionate</said></p>
    <p n="15"><said>“ HELEN . ”</said></p>
    <p n="16"><said >“ Howards End ,</said></p>
    <p n="17"><said >“ Sunday .</said></p>
    <p n="18"><said>“ Dearest , dearest<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>,— I do not know what you will say :<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>and I are in love — the younger son who only came here Wednesday . ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="2">
    <p n="19"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>glanced at her sister 's note and pushed it over the breakfast-table to her aunt . There was a moment 's hush , and then the flood-gates opened .</p>
    <p n="20"><said who="#Margaret">“ I can tell you nothing ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>. I know no more than you do . We met — we only met the father and mother abroad last spring . I know so little that I did n't even know their son 's name . It 's all so — ”</said>She waved her hand and laughed a little .</p>
    <p n="21"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ In that case it is far too sudden . ”</said></p>
    <p n="22"><said who="#Margaret">“ Who knows ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, who knows ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="23"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ But ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, dear , I mean , we must n't be unpractical now that we 've come to facts . It is too sudden , surely . ”</said></p>
    <p n="24"><said who="#Margaret">“ Who knows ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="25"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ But ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, dear — ”</said></p>
    <p n="26"><said who="#Margaret">“ I 'll go for her other letters , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ No , I wo n't , I 'll finish my breakfast . In fact , I have n't them . We met the Wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from Heidelberg to Speyer .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and I had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at Speyer — the Archbishop of Speyer was one of the seven electors — you know — ‘ Speyer , Maintz , and Koln . ’ Those three sees once commanded the Rhine Valley and got it the name of Priest Street . ”</said></p>
    <p n="27"><said>“ I still feel quite uneasy about this business ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="28"><said who="#Margaret">“ The train crossed by a bridge of boats , and at first sight it looked quite fine . But oh , in five minutes we had seen the whole thing . The cathedral had been ruined , absolutely ruined , by restoration ; not an inch left of the original structure . We wasted a whole day , and came across the Wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens . They too , poor things , had been taken in — they were actually stopping at Speyer — and they rather liked<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s insisting that they must fly with us to Heidelberg . As a matter of fact , they did come on next day . We all took some drives together . They knew us well enough to ask<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>to come and see them — at least , I was asked too , but<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>'s illness prevented me , so last Monday she went alone . That 's all . You know as much as I do now . It 's a young man out of the unknown . She was to have come back Saturday , but put off till Monday , perhaps on account of — I do n't know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="29">She broke off , and listened to the sounds of a London morning . Their house was in Wickham Place , and fairly quiet , for a lofty promontory of buildings separated it from the main thoroughfare . One had the sense of a backwater , or rather of an estuary , whose waters flowed in from the invisible sea , and ebbed into a profound silence while the waves without were still beating . Though the promontory consisted of flats — expensive , with cavernous entrance halls , full of concierges and palms — it fulfilled its purpose , and gained for the older houses opposite a certain measure of peace .</p>
    <p n="30">These , too , would be swept away in time , and another promontory would arise upon their site , as humanity piled itself higher and higher on the precious soil of London .</p>
    <p n="31"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>had her own method of interpreting her nieces . She decided that<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was a little hysterical , and was trying to gain time by a torrent of talk . Feeling very diplomatic , she lamented the fate of Speyer , and declared that never , never should she be so misguided as to visit it , and added of her own accord that the principles of restoration were ill understood in Germany .<said who="#Margaret">“ The Germans , ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Margaret">“ are too thorough , and this is all very well sometimes , but at other times it does not do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="32"><said who="#Margaret">“ Exactly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>;<said who="#Margaret">“ Germans are too thorough . ”</said>And her eyes began to shine .</p>
    <p n="33"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Of course I regard you Schlegels as English , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>hastily —<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ English to the backbone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="34"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>leaned forward and stroked her hand .</p>
    <p n="35"><said who="#Margaret">“ And that reminds me —<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s letter . ”</said></p>
    <p n="36"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Oh yes ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, I am thinking all right about<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s letter . I know — I must go down and see her . I am thinking about her all right . I am meaning to go down . ”</said></p>
    <p n="37"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ But go with some plan , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, admitting into her kindly voice a note of exasperation .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, if I may interfere , do n't be taken by surprise . What do you think of the Wilcoxes ? Are they our sort ? Are they likely people ? Could they appreciate<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who is to my mind a very special sort of person ? Do they care about<persName>Literature</persName>and<persName corresp="#Art">Art</persName>? That is most important when you come to think of it .<persName>Literature</persName>and<persName corresp="#Art">Art</persName>. Most important . How old would the son be ? She says ‘ younger son . ’ Would he be in a position to marry ? Is he likely to make<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>happy ? Did you gather — ”</said></p>
    <p n="38"><said who="#Margaret">“ I gathered nothing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="39">They began to talk at once .</p>
    <p n="40"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Then in that case — ”</said></p>
    <p n="41"><said who="#Margaret">“ In that case I can make no plans , do n't you see . ”</said></p>
    <p n="42"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ On the contrary — ”</said></p>
    <p n="43"><said who="#Margaret">“ I hate plans . I hate lines of action .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>is n't a baby . ”</said></p>
    <p n="44"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Then in that case , my dear , why go down ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="45"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was silent . If her aunt could not see why she must go down , she was not going to tell her . She was not going to say ,<said who="#Margaret">“ I love my dear sister ; I must be near her at this crisis of her life . ”</said>The affections are more reticent than the passions , and their expression more subtle . If she herself should ever fall in love with a man , she , like<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, would proclaim it from the housetops , but as she loved only a sister she used the voiceless language of sympathy .</p>
    <p n="46"><said who="#Margaret">“ I consider you odd girls , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>,<said who="#Margaret">“ and very wonderful girls , and in many ways far older than your years . But — you wo n't be offended ? frankly , I feel you are not up to this business . It requires an older person . Dear , I have nothing to call me back to Swanage . ”</said>She spread out her plump arms .<said who="#Margaret">“ I am all at your disposal . Let me go down to this house whose name I forget instead of you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="47"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>”</said>— she jumped up and kissed her —<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I must , must go to Howards End myself . You do n't exactly understand , though I can never thank you properly for offering . ”</said></p>
    <p n="48"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I do understand , ”</said>retorted<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, with immense confidence .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I go down in no spirit of interference , but to make inquiries . Inquiries are necessary . Now , I am going to be rude . You would say the wrong thing ; to a certainty you would . In your anxiety for<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s happiness you would offend the whole of these<persName corresp="#Wilcoxes">Wilcoxes</persName>by asking one of your impetuous questions — not that one minds offending them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="49"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I shall ask no questions . I have it in<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s writing that she and a man are in love . There is no question to ask as long as she keeps to that . All the rest is n't worth a straw . A long engagement if you like , but inquiries , questions , plans , lines of action — no ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, no . ”</said></p>
    <p n="50">Away she hurried , not beautiful , not supremely brilliant , but filled with something that took the place of both qualities — something best described as a profound vivacity , a continual and sincere response to all that she encountered in her path through life .</p>
    <p n="51"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ If<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had written the same to me about a shop assistant or a penniless clerk — ”</said></p>
    <p n="52"><said who="#Helen">“ Dear<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, do come into the library and shut the door . Your good maids are dusting the banisters . ”</said></p>
    <p n="53"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ — or if she had wanted to marry the man who calls for Carter Paterson , I should have said the same . ”</said>Then , with one of those turns that convinced her aunt that she was not mad really , and convinced observers of another type that she was not a barren theorist , she added :<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Though in the case of Carter Paterson I should want it to be a very long engagement indeed , I must say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="54"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I should think so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>;<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ and , indeed , I can scarcely follow you . Now , just imagine if you said anything of that sort to the Wilcoxes . I understand it , but most good people would think you mad . Imagine how disconcerting for<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>! What is wanted is a person who will go slowly , slowly in this business , and see how things are and where they are likely to lead to . ”</said></p>
    <p n="55"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was down on this .</p>
    <p n="56"><said who="#Margaret">“ But you implied just now that the engagement must be broken off . ”</said></p>
    <p n="57"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I think probably it must ; but slowly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="58"><said who="#Margaret">“ Can you break an engagement off slowly ? ”</said>Her eyes lit up .<said who="#Margaret">“ What 's an engagement made of , do you suppose ? I think it 's made of some hard stuff that may snap , but can n't break . It is different to the other ties of life . They stretch or bend . They admit of degree . They 're different . ”</said></p>
    <p n="59"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Exactly so . But wo n't you let me just run down to Howards House , and save you all the discomfort ? I will really not interfere , but I do so thoroughly understand the kind of thing you Schlegels want that one quiet look round will be enough for me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="60"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>again thanked her , again kissed her , and then ran upstairs to see her brother .</p>
    <p n="61">He was not so well .</p>
    <p n="62">The hay fever had worried him a good deal all night . His head ached , his eyes were wet , his mucous membrane , he informed her , in a most unsatisfactory condition . The only thing that made life worth living was the thought of Walter Savage Landor , from whose Imaginary Conversations she had promised to read at frequent intervals during the day .</p>
    <p n="63">It was rather difficult . Something must be done about<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. She must be assured that it is not a criminal offence to love at first sight . A telegram to this effect would be cold and cryptic , a personal visit seemed each moment more impossible . Now the doctor arrived , and said that<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was quite bad . Might it really be best to accept<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>'s kind offer , and to send her down to Howards End with a note ?</p>
    <p n="64">Certainly<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was impulsive . She did swing rapidly from one decision to another . Running downstairs into the library , she cried :<said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , I have changed my mind ; I do wish that you would go . ”</said></p>
    <p n="65">There was a train from King 's Cross at eleven . At half-past ten<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, with rare self-effacement , fell asleep , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was able to drive her aunt to the station .</p>
    <p n="66"><said who="#Margaret">“ You will remember ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, not to be drawn into discussing the engagement . Give my letter to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, and say whatever you feel yourself , but do keep clear of the relatives . We have scarcely got their names straight yet , and , besides , that sort of thing is so uncivilised and wrong . ”</said></p>
    <p n="67"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ So uncivilised ? ”</said>queried<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, fearing that she was losing the point of some brilliant remark .</p>
    <p n="68"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , I used an affected word . I only meant would you please talk the thing over only with<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="69"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Only with<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="70"><said who="#Margaret">“ Because — ”</said>But it was no moment to expound the personal nature of love . Even<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>shrank from it , and contented herself with stroking her good aunt 's hand , and with meditating , half sensibly and half poetically , on the journey that was about to begin from King 's Cross .</p>
    <p n="71">Like many others who have lived long in a great capital , she had strong feelings about the various railway termini . They are our gates to the glorious and the unknown . Through them we pass out into adventure and sunshine , to them , alas ! we return . In Paddington all Cornwall is latent and the remoter west ; down the inclines of Liverpool Street lie fenlands and the illimitable Broads ; Scotland is through the pylons of Euston ; Wessex behind the poised chaos of Waterloo . Italians realise this , as is natural ; those of them who are so unfortunate as to serve as waiters in Berlin call the Anhalt Bahnhof the Stazione d'Italia , because by it they must return to their homes . And he is a chilly Londoner who does not endow his stations with some personality , and extend to them , however shyly , the emotions of fear and love .</p>
    <p n="72">To<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>— I hope that it will not set the reader against her — the station of King 's Cross had always suggested Infinity . Its very situation — withdrawn a little behind the facile splendours of St. Pancras — implied a comment on the materialism of life . Those two great arches , colourless , indifferent , shouldering between them an unlovely clock , were fit portals for some eternal adventure , whose issue might be prosperous , but would certainly not be expressed in the ordinary language of prosperity . If you think this ridiculous , remember that it is not<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>who is telling you about it ; and let me hasten to add that they were in plenty of time for the train ; that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, though she took a second-class ticket , was put by the guard into a first ( only two “ seconds ” on the train , one smoking and the other babies — one cannot be expected to travel with babies ) ; and that<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, on her return to Wickham Place , was confronted with the following telegram :</p>
    <p n="73"><said who="#Margaret">“ All over . Wish I had never written . Tell no one —, HELEN . ”</said></p>
    <p n="74">But<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>was gone — gone irrevocably , and no power on earth could stop her .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="3">
    <p n="75">Most complacently did<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>rehearse her mission . Her nieces were independent young women , and it was not often that she was able to help them . Emily 's daughters had never been quite like other girls . They had been left motherless when<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was born , when<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was five and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>herself but thirteen . It was before the passing of the Deceased Wife 's Sister Bill , so<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>could without impropriety offer to go and keep house at Wickham Place . But her brother-in-law , who was peculiar and a German , had referred the question to<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who with the crudity of youth had answered ,<said who="#Schlegel">“ No , they could manage much better alone . ”</said>Five years later Mr.<persName corresp="#Schlegel">Schlegel</persName>had died too , and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>had repeated her offer .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, crude no longer , had been grateful and extremely nice , but the substance of her answer had been the same .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I must not interfere a third time , ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>. However , of course she did . She learnt , to her horror , that<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, now of age , was taking her money out of the old safe investments and putting it into Foreign Things , which always smash . Silence would have been criminal . Her own fortune was invested in Home Rails , and most ardently did she beg her niece to imitate her .<said who="#Margaret">“ Then we should be together , dear . ”</said><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, out of politeness , invested a few hundreds in the Nottingham and Derby Railway , and though the Foreign Things did admirably and the Nottingham and Derby declined with the steady dignity of which only Home Rails are capable ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>never ceased to rejoice , and to say ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I did manage that , at all events . When the smash comes poor<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>will have a nest-egg to fall back upon . ”</said>This year<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>came of age , and exactly the same thing happened in<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s case ; she also would shift her money out of Consols , but she , too , almost without being pressed , consecrated a fraction of it to the Nottingham and Derby Railway . So far so good , but in social matters their aunt had accomplished nothing . Sooner or later the girls would enter on the process known as throwing themselves away , and if they had delayed hitherto , it was only that they might throw themselves more vehemently in the future . They saw too many people at Wickham Place — unshaven musicians , an actress even , German cousins ( one knows what foreigners are ) , acquaintances picked up at Continental hotels ( one knows what they are too ) . It was interesting , and down at Swanage no one appreciated culture more than<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>; but it was dangerous , and disaster was bound to come . How right she was , and how lucky to be on the spot when the disaster came !</p>
    <p n="76">The train sped northward , under innumerable tunnels . It was only an hour 's journey , but<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>had to raise and lower the window again and again . She passed through the South Welwyn Tunnel , saw light for a moment , and entered the North Welwyn Tunnel , of tragic fame . She traversed the immense viaduct , whose arches span untroubled meadows and the dreamy flow of Tewin Water . She skirted the parks of politicians . At times the Great North Road accompanied her , more suggestive of infinity than any railway , awakening , after a nap of a hundred years , to such life as is conferred by the stench of motor-cars , and to such culture as is implied by the advertisements of antibilious pills . To history , to tragedy , to the past , to the future ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>remained equally indifferent ; hers but to concentrate on the end of her journey , and to rescue poor<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>from this dreadful mess .</p>
    <p n="77">The station for Howards End was at Hilton , one of the large villages that are strung so frequently along the North Road , and that owe their size to the traffic of coaching and pre-coaching days . Being near London , it had not shared in the rural decay , and its long High Street had budded out right and left into residential estates . For about a mile a series of tiled and slated houses passed before<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>'s inattentive eyes , a series broken at one point by six Danish tumuli that stood shoulder to shoulder along the highroad , tombs of soldiers . Beyond these tumuli , habitations thickened , and the train came to a standstill in a tangle that was almost a town .</p>
    <p n="78">The station , like the scenery , like<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s letters , struck an indeterminate note . Into which country will it lead , England or Suburbia ? It was new , it had island platforms and a subway , and the superficial comfort exacted by business men . But it held hints of local life , personal intercourse , as even<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>was to discover .</p>
    <p n="79"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I want a house , ”</said>she confided to the ticket boy .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Its name is Howards Lodge . Do you know where it is ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="80"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>! ”</said>the boy called .</p>
    <p n="81">A young man in front of them turned around .</p>
    <p n="82"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ She 's wanting Howards End . ”</said></p>
    <p n="83">There was nothing for it but to go forward , though<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>was too much agitated even to stare at the stranger . But remembering that there were two brothers , she had the sense to say to him ,<said who="#Helen">“ Excuse me asking , but are you the younger<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>or the elder ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="84"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ The younger . Can I do anything for you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="85"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh , well ”</said>— she controlled herself with difficulty .<said who="#Helen">“ Really . Are you ? I — ”</said>She moved ; away from the ticket boy and lowered her voice .<said who="#Helen">“ I am<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>'s aunt . I ought to introduce myself , ought n't I ? My name is<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="86">She was conscious that he raised his cap and said quite coolly ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Oh , rather ;<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>is stopping with us . Did you want to see her ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="87"><said who="#Helen">“ Possibly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="88"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I 'll call you a cab . No ; wait a mo — ”</said>He thought .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Our motor 's here . I 'll run you up in it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="89"><said who="#Helen">“ That is very kind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="90"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Not at all , if you 'll just wait till they bring out a parcel from the office . This way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="91"><said who="#Helen">“ My niece is not with you by any chance ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="92"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ No ; I came over with my father . He has gone on north in your train . You 'll see<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>at lunch . You 're coming up to lunch , I hope ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="93"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I should like to come UP , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, not committing herself to nourishment until she had studied<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s lover a little more . He seemed a gentleman , but had so rattled her round that her powers of observation were numbed . She glanced at him stealthily .</p>
    <p n="94">To a feminine eye there was nothing amiss in the sharp depressions at the corners of his mouth , or in the rather box-like construction of his forehead . He was dark , clean-shaven , and seemed accustomed to command .</p>
    <p n="95"><said who="#Helen">“ In front or behind ? Which do you prefer ? It may be windy in front . ”</said></p>
    <p n="96"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ In front if I may ; then we can talk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="97"><said who="#Helen">“ But excuse me one moment — I can n't think what they 're doing with that parcel . ”</said>He strode into the booking-office , and called with a new voice :<said who="#Helen">“ Hi ! hi , you there ! Are you going to keep me waiting all day ? Parcel for Wilcox , Howards End . Just look sharp ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="98">Emerging , he said in quieter tones :<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ This station 's abominably organised ; if I had my way , the whole lot of ‘ em should get the sack . May I help you in ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="99"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ This is very good of you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, as she settled herself into a luxurious cavern of red leather , and suffered her person to be padded with rugs and shawls . She was more civil than she had intended , but really this young man was very kind . Moreover , she was a little afraid of him ; his self-possession was extraordinary .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Very good indeed , ”</said>she repeated , adding :<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ It is just what I should have wished . ”</said></p>
    <p n="100"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Very good of you to say so , ”</said>he replied , with a slight look of surprise , which , like most slight looks , escaped<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>'s attention .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I was just tooling my father over to catch the down train . ”</said></p>
    <p n="101"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ You see , we heard from<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>this morning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="102">Young Wilcox was pouring in petrol , starting his engine , and performing other actions with which this story has no concern . The great car began to rock , and the form of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, trying to explain things , sprang agreeably up and down among the red cushions .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ The mater will be very glad to see you , ”</said>he mumbled .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Hi ! I say . Parcel . Parcel for Howards End . Bring it out . Hi ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="103">A bearded porter emerged with the parcel in one hand and an entry book in the other . With the gathering whir of the motor these ejaculations mingled : “ Sign , must I ? Why the — should I sign after all this bother ? Not even got a pencil on you ? Remember next time I report you to the station-master . My time 's of value , though yours may n't be . Here ” — here being a tip .</p>
    <p n="104"><said who="#Helen">“ Extremely sorry ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="105"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Not at all ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="106"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ And do you object to going through the village ? It is rather a longer spin , but I have one or two commissions . ”</said></p>
    <p n="107"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I should love going through the village . Naturally I am very anxious to talk things over with you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="108">As she said this she felt ashamed , for she was disobeying<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s instructions . Only disobeying them in the letter , surely .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had only warned her against discussing the incident with outsiders . Surely it was not “ uncivilised or wrong ” to discuss it with the young man himself , since chance had thrown them together .</p>
    <p n="109">A reticent fellow , he made no reply . Mounting by her side , he put on gloves and spectacles , and off they drove , the bearded porter — life is a mysterious business — looking after them with admiration .</p>
    <p n="110">The wind was in their faces down the station road , blowing the dust into<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>'s eyes . But as soon as they turned into the Great North Road she opened fire .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ You can well imagine , ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ that the news was a great shock to us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="111"><said who="#Margaret">“ What news ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="112"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, ”</said>she said frankly ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>has told me everything — everything . I have seen<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s letter . ”</said></p>
    <p n="113">He could not look her in the face , as his eyes were fixed on his work ; he was travelling as quickly as he dared down the High Street . But he inclined his head in her direction , and said :<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I beg your pardon ; I did n't catch . ”</said></p>
    <p n="114"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ About<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, of course .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>is a very exceptional person — I am sure you will let me say this , feeling towards her as you do — indeed , all the Schlegels are exceptional . I come in no spirit of interference , but it was a great shock . ”</said></p>
    <p n="115">They drew up opposite a draper 's . Without replying , he turned round in his seat , and contemplated the cloud of dust that they had raised in their passage through the village . It was settling again , but not all into the road from which he had taken it . Some of it had percolated through the open windows , some had whitened the roses and gooseberries of the wayside gardens , while a certain proportion had entered the lungs of the villagers .<said who="#Helen">“ I wonder when they 'll learn wisdom and tar the roads , ”</said>was his comment . Then a man ran out of the draper 's with a roll of oilcloth , and off they went again .</p>
    <p n="116"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>could not come herself , on account of poor<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, so I am here to represent her and to have a good talk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="117"><said who="#Helen">“ I 'm sorry to be so dense , ”</said>said the young man , again drawing up outside a shop .<said who="#Helen">“ But I still have n't quite understood . ”</said></p>
    <p n="118"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>— my niece and you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="119">He pushed up his goggles and gazed at her , absolutely bewildered . Horror smote her to the heart , for even she began to suspect that they were at cross-purposes , and that she had commenced her mission by some hideous blunder .</p>
    <p n="120"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>and myself ? ”</said>he asked , compressing his lips .</p>
    <p n="121"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I trust there has been no misunderstanding , ”</said>quavered<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Her letter certainly read that way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="122"><said who="#Margaret">“ What way ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="123"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ That you and she — ”</said>She paused , then drooped her eyelids .</p>
    <p n="124"><said who="#Margaret">“ I think I catch your meaning , ”</said>he said stickily .<said who="#Margaret">“ What an extraordinary mistake ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="125"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Then you did n't the least — ”</said>she stammered , getting blood-red in the face , and wishing she had never been born .</p>
    <p n="126"><said who="#Margaret">“ Scarcely , as I am already engaged to another lady . ”</said>There was a moment 's silence , and then he caught his breath and exploded with ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , good God ! Do n't tell me it ‘ s some silliness of<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>'s . ”</said></p>
    <p n="127"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ But you are<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="128"><said who="#Margaret">“ I 'm not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="129"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Then why did you say so at the station ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="130"><said who="#Margaret">“ I said nothing of the sort . ”</said></p>
    <p n="131"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I beg your pardon , you did . ”</said></p>
    <p n="132"><said who="#Margaret">“ I beg your pardon , I did not . My name is<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="133">“ Younger ” may mean son as opposed to father , or second brother as opposed to first . There is much to be said for either view , and later on they said it . But they had other questions before them now .</p>
    <p n="134"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Do you mean to tell me that<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="135">But she did not like his voice . He sounded as if he was talking to a porter , and , certain that he had deceived her at the station , she too grew angry .</p>
    <p n="136"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Do you mean to tell me that<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>and your niece — ”</said></p>
    <p n="137"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>— such is human nature — determined that she would champion the lovers . She was not going to be bullied by a severe young man .<said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , they care for one another very much indeed , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Margaret">“ I dare say they will tell you about it by-and-by . We heard this morning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="138">And<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>clenched his fist and cried ,<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ The idiot , the idiot , the little fool ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="139"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>tried to divest herself of her rugs .<said who="#Margaret">“ If that is your attitude ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, I prefer to walk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="140"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I beg you will do no such thing . I take you up this moment to the house . Let me tell you the thing 's impossible , and must be stopped . ”</said></p>
    <p n="141"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>did not often lose her temper , and when she did it was only to protect those whom she loved . On this occasion she blazed out .<said who="#Margaret">“ I quite agree , sir . The thing is impossible , and I will come up and stop it . My niece is a very exceptional person , and I am not inclined to sit still while she throws herself away on those who will not appreciate her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="142"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>worked his jaws .</p>
    <p n="143"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Considering she has only known your brother since Wednesday , and only met your father and mother at a stray hotel — ”</said></p>
    <p n="144"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Could you possibly lower your voice ? The shopman will overhear . ”</said></p>
    <p n="145">Esprit de classe — if one may coin the phrase — was strong in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>. She sat quivering while a member of the lower orders deposited a metal funnel , a saucepan , and a garden squirt beside the roll of oilcloth .</p>
    <p n="146"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Right behind ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="147"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Yes , sir . ”</said>And the lower orders vanished in a cloud of dust .</p>
    <p n="148"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I warn you :<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>has n't a penny ; it 's useless . ”</said></p>
    <p n="149"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ No need to warn us ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, I assure you . The warning is all the other way . My niece has been very foolish , and I shall give her a good scolding and take her back to London with me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="150"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ He has to make his way out in Nigeria . He could n't think of marrying for years , and when he does it must be a woman who can stand the climate , and is in other ways — Why has n't he told us ? Of course he 's ashamed . He knows he 's been a fool . And so he has — a downright fool . ”</said></p>
    <p n="151">She grew furious .</p>
    <p n="152"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Whereas<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>has lost no time in publishing the news . ”</said></p>
    <p n="153"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ If I were a man ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, for that last remark I 'd box your ears . You 're not fit to clean my niece 's boots , to sit in the same room with her , and you dare — you actually dare — I decline to argue with such a person . ”</said></p>
    <p n="154"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ All I know is , she 's spread the thing and he has n't , and my father 's away and I — ”</said></p>
    <p n="155"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ And all that I know is — ”</said></p>
    <p n="156"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Might I finish my sentence , please ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="157"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="158"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>clenched his teeth and sent the motor swerving all over the lane .</p>
    <p n="159">She screamed .</p>
    <p n="160">So they played the game of Capping Families , a round of which is always played when love would unite two members of our race . But they played it with unusual vigour , stating in so many words that Schlegels were better than<persName corresp="#Wilcoxes">Wilcoxes</persName>,<persName corresp="#Wilcoxes">Wilcoxes</persName>better than Schlegels . They flung decency aside . The man was young , the woman deeply stirred ; in both a vein of coarseness was latent . Their quarrel was no more surprising than are most quarrels — inevitable at the time , incredible afterwards . But it was more than usually futile . A few minutes , and they were enlightened . The motor drew up at Howards End , and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, looking very pale , ran out to meet her aunt .</p>
    <p n="161"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, I have just had a telegram from<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>; I — I meant to stop your coming . It is n't — it 's over . ”</said></p>
    <p n="162">The climax was too much for<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>. She burst into tears .</p>
    <p n="163"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>dear , do n't . Do n't let them know I 've been so silly . It was n't anything . Do bear up for my sake . ”</said></p>
    <p n="164"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles Wilcox</persName>, pulling his gloves off .</p>
    <p n="165"><said who="#Paul">“ Do n't let them know . They are never to know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="166"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Oh , my darling<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="167"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>!<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="168">A very young man came out of the house .</p>
    <p n="169"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>, is there any truth in this ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="170"><said who="#Paul">“ I did n't — I do n't — ”</said></p>
    <p n="171"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Yes or no , man ; plain question , plain answer . Did or did n't<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="172"><said who="#Paul">“<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, dear , ”</said>said a voice from the garden .<said who="#Paul">“<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, dear<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, one does n't ask plain questions . There are n't such things . ”</said></p>
    <p n="173">They were all silent . It was<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>.</p>
    <p n="174">She approached just as<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s letter had described her , trailing noiselessly over the lawn , and there was actually a wisp of hay in her hands . She seemed to belong not to the young people and their motor , but to the house , and to the tree that overshadowed it . One knew that she worshipped the past , and that the instinctive wisdom the past can alone bestow had descended upon her — that wisdom to which we give the clumsy name of aristocracy . High born she might not be . But assuredly she cared about her ancestors , and let them help her . When she saw<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>angry ,<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>frightened , and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>in tears , she heard her ancestors say ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Separate those human beings who will hurt each other most . The rest can wait . ”</said>So she did not ask questions . Still less did she pretend that nothing had happened , as a competent society hostess would have done . She said :<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, would you take your aunt up to your room or to my room , whichever you think best .<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>, do find<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, and tell her lunch for six , but I 'm not sure whether we shall all be downstairs for it . ”</said>And when they had obeyed her , she turned to her elder son , who still stood in the throbbing , stinking car , and smiled at him with tenderness , and without saying a word , turned away from him towards her flowers .</p>
    <p n="175"><said who="#Paul">“ Mother , ”</said>he called ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ are you aware that<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>has been playing the fool again ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="176"><said who="#Paul">“ It is all right , dear . They have broken off the engagement . ”</said></p>
    <p n="177"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Engagement —! ”</said></p>
    <p n="178"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ They do not love any longer , if you prefer it put that way , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, stooping down to smell a rose .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="4">
    <p n="179"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and her aunt returned to Wickham Place in a state of collapse , and for a little time<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had three invalids on her hands .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>soon recovered . She possessed to a remarkable degree the power of distorting the past , and before many days were over she had forgotten the part played by her own imprudence in the catastrophe . Even at the crisis she had cried ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Thank goodness , poor<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>is saved this ! ”</said>which during the journey to London evolved into , “ It had to be gone through by some one , ” which in its turn ripened into the permanent form of “ The one time I really did help Emily 's girls was over the Wilcox business . ” But<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was a more serious patient . New ideas had burst upon her like a thunderclap , and by them and by their reverberations she had been stunned .</p>
    <p n="180">The truth was that she had fallen in love , not with an individual , but with a family .</p>
    <p n="181">Before<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>arrived she had , as it were , been tuned up into his key . The energy of the Wilcoxes had fascinated her , had created new images of beauty in her responsive mind . To be all day with them in the open air , to sleep at night under their roof , had seemed the supreme joy of life , and had led to that abandonment of personality that is a possible prelude to love . She had liked giving in to<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, or<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, or<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>; she had liked being told that her notions of life were sheltered or academic ; that Equality was nonsense , Votes for Women nonsense ,<persName>Socialism</persName>nonsense ,<persName corresp="#Art">Art</persName>and<persName>Literature</persName>, except when conducive to strengthening the character , nonsense . One by one the<persName corresp="#Schlegel">Schlegel</persName>fetiches had been overthrown , and , though professing to defend them , she had rejoiced . When<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>said that one sound man of business did more good to the world than a dozen of your social reformers , she had swallowed the curious assertion without a gasp , and had leant back luxuriously among the cushions of his motorcar . When<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>said , “ Why be so polite to servants ? they do n't understand it , ” she had not given the<persName corresp="#Schlegel">Schlegel</persName>retort of ,<said who="#Schlegel">“ If they do n't understand it , I do . ”</said>No ; she had vowed to be less polite to servants in the future .<said who="#Schlegel">“ I am swathed in cant , ”</said>she thought ,<said who="#Paul">“ and it is good for me to be stripped of it . ”</said>And all that she thought or did or breathed was a quiet preparation for<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>.<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>was inevitable .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>was taken up with another girl ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>was so old ,<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>so young ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>so different . Round the absent brother she began to throw the halo of Romance , to irradiate him with all the splendour of those happy days , to feel that in him she should draw nearest to the robust ideal . He and she were about the same age ,<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>said . Most people thought<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>handsomer than his brother . He was certainly a better shot , though not so good at golf . And when<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>appeared , flushed with the triumph of getting through an examination , and ready to flirt with any pretty girl ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>met him halfway , or more than halfway , and turned towards him on the Sunday evening .</p>
    <p n="182">He had been talking of his approaching exile in Nigeria , and he should have continued to talk of it , and allowed their guest to recover . But the heave of her bosom flattered him . Passion was possible , and he became passionate . Deep down in him something whispered ,<said who="#Helen">“ This girl would let you kiss her ; you might not have such a chance again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="183">That was “ how it happened , ” or , rather , how<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>described it to her sister , using words even more unsympathetic than my own . But the poetry of that kiss , the wonder of it , the magic that there was in life for hours after it — who can describe that ? It is so easy for an Englishman to sneer at these chance collisions of human beings . To the insular cynic and the insular moralist they offer an equal opportunity . It is so easy to talk of “ passing emotion , ” and to forget how vivid the emotion was ere it passed . Our impulse to sneer , to forget , is at root a good one . We recognise that emotion is not enough , and that men and women are personalities capable of sustained relations , not mere opportunities for an electrical discharge . Yet we rate the impulse too highly . We do not admit that by collisions of this trivial sort the doors of heaven may be shaken open . To<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, at all events , her life was to bring nothing more intense than the embrace of this boy who played no part in it . He had drawn her out of the house , where there was danger of surprise and light ; he had led her by a path he knew , until they stood under the column of the vast wych-elm . A man in the darkness , he had whispered “ I love you ” when she was desiring love . In time his slender personality faded , the scene that he had evoked endured . In all the variable years that followed she never saw the like of it again .</p>
    <p n="184"><said who="#Margaret">“ I understand , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>—<said who="#Margaret">“ at least , I understand as much as ever is understood of these things . Tell me now what happened on the Monday morning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="185"><said who="#Helen">“ It was over at once . ”</said></p>
    <p n="186"><said who="#Margaret">“ How ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="187"><said who="#Helen">“ I was still happy while I dressed , but as I came downstairs I got nervous , and when I went into the dining-room I knew it was no good . There was<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>— I can n't explain — managing the tea-urn , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>reading the Times . ”</said></p>
    <p n="188"><said who="#Margaret">“ Was<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>there ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="189"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes ; and<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>was talking to him about stocks and shares , and he looked frightened . ”</said></p>
    <p n="190">By slight indications the sisters could convey much to each other .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>saw horror latent in the scene , and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s next remark did not surprise her .</p>
    <p n="191"><said who="#Helen">“ Somehow , when that kind of man looks frightened it is too awful . It is all right for us to be frightened , or for men of another sort — father , for instance ; but for men like that ! When I saw all the others so placid , and<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>mad with terror in case I said the wrong thing , I felt for a moment that the whole Wilcox family was a fraud , just a wall of newspapers and motor-cars and golf-clubs , and that if it fell I should find nothing behind it but panic and emptiness . ”</said></p>
    <p n="192"><said who="#Margaret">“ I do n't think that . The Wilcoxes struck me as being genuine people , particularly the wife . ”</said></p>
    <p n="193"><said who="#Helen">“ No , I do n't really think that . But<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>was so broad-shouldered ; all kinds of extraordinary things made it worse , and I knew that it would never do — never . I said to him after breakfast , when the others were practising strokes , ‘ We rather lost our heads , ’ and he looked better at once , though frightfully ashamed . He began a speech about having no money to marry on , but it hurt him to make it , and I stopped him . Then he said , ‘ I must beg your pardon over this ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>; I can n't think what came over me last night . ’ And I said , ‘ Nor what over me ; never mind . ’ And then we parted — at least , until I remembered that I had written straight off to tell you the night before , and that frightened him again . I asked him to send a telegram for me , for he knew you would be coming or something ; and he tried to get hold of the motor , but<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>wanted it to go to the station ; and<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>offered to send the telegram for me , and then I had to say that the telegram was of no consequence , for<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>said<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>might read it , and though I wrote it out several times , he always said people would suspect something . He took it himself at last , pretending that he must walk down to get cartridges , and , what with one thing and the other , it was not handed in at the post-office until too late . It was the most terrible morning .<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>disliked me more and more , and<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>talked cricket averages till I nearly screamed . I cannot think how I stood her all the other days . At last<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>and his father started for the station , and then came your telegram warning me that<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>was coming by that train , and<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>— oh , rather horrible — said that I had muddled it . But<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>knew . ”</said></p>
    <p n="194"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Knew what ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="195"><said who="#Helen">“ Everything ; though we neither of us told her a word , and she had known all along , I think . ”</said></p>
    <p n="196"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Oh , she must have overheard you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="197"><said who="#Helen">“ I suppose so , but it seemed wonderful . When<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>drove up , calling each other names ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>stepped in from the garden and made everything less terrible . Ugh ! but it has been a disgusting business . To think that — ”</said>She sighed .</p>
    <p n="198"><said who="#Margaret">“ To think that because you and a young man meet for a moment , there must be all these telegrams and anger , ”</said>supplied<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="199"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>nodded .</p>
    <p n="200"><said who="#Margaret">“ I 've often thought about it ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. It 's one of the most interesting things in the world . The truth is that there is a great outer life that you and I have never touched — a life in which telegrams and anger count . Personal relations , that we think supreme , are not supreme there . There love means marriage settlements , death , death duties . So far I 'm clear . But here my difficulty . This outer life , though obviously horrid ; often seems the real one — there 's grit in it . It does breed character . Do personal relations lead to sloppiness in the end ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="201"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>—, that 's what I felt , only not so clearly , when the Wilcoxes were so competent , and seemed to have their hands on all the ropes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="202"><said who="#Margaret">“ Do n't you feel it now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="203"><said who="#Helen">“ I remember<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>at breakfast , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>quietly .<said who="#Helen">“ I shall never forget him . He had nothing to fall back upon . I know that personal relations are the real life , for ever and ever . ”</said></p>
    <p n="204"><said who="#Margaret">“ Amen ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="205">So the Wilcox episode fell into the background , leaving behind it memories of sweetness and horror that mingled , and the sisters pursued the life that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had commended . They talked to each other and to other people , they filled the tall thin house at Wickham Place with those whom they liked or could befriend . They even attended public meetings . In their own fashion they cared deeply about politics , though not as politicians would have us care ; they desired that public life should mirror whatever is good in the life within . Temperance , tolerance , and sexual equality were intelligible cries to them ; whereas they did not follow our Forward Policy in Tibet with the keen attention that it merits , and would at times dismiss the whole British Empire with a puzzled , if reverent , sigh . Not out of them are the shows of history erected : the world would be a grey , bloodless place were it composed entirely of Miss Schlegels . But the world being what it is , perhaps they shine out in it like stars .</p>
    <p n="206">A word on their origin . They were not “ English to the back-bone , ” as their aunt had piously asserted . But , on the other hand , they were not “ Germans of the dreadful sort . ” Their father had belonged to a type that was more prominent in Germany fifty years ago than now . He was not the aggressive German , so dear to the English journalist , nor the domestic German , so dear to the English wit . If one classed him at all it would be as the countryman of Hegel and Kant , as the idealist , inclined to be dreamy , whose Imperialism was the Imperialism of the air . Not that his life had been inactive . He had fought like blazes against Denmark , Austria , France . But he had fought without visualising the results of victory . A hint of the truth broke on him after Sedan , when he saw the dyed moustaches of Napoleon going grey ; another when he entered Paris , and saw the smashed windows of the Tuileries . Peace came — it was all very immense , one had turned into an Empire — but he knew that some quality had vanished for which not all Alsace-Lorraine could compensate him . Germany a commercial Power , Germany a naval Power , Germany with colonies here and a Forward Policy there , and legitimate aspirations in the other place , might appeal to others , and be fitly served by them ; for his own part , he abstained from the fruits of victory , and naturalised himself in England . The more earnest members of his family never forgave him , and knew that his children , though scarcely English of the dreadful sort , would never be German to the back-bone . He had obtained work in one of our provincial universities , and there married Poor Emily ( or Die Englanderin , as the case may be ) , and as she had money , they proceeded to London , and came to know a good many people . But his gaze was always fixed beyond the sea . It was his hope that the clouds of materialism obscuring the Fatherland would part in time , and the mild intellectual light re-emerge .<said who="#Helen">“ Do you imply that we Germans are stupid , Uncle Ernst ? ”</said>exclaimed a haughty and magnificent nephew . Uncle Ernst replied ,<said who="#Helen">“ To my mind . You use the intellect , but you no longer care about it . That I call stupidity . ”</said>As the haughty nephew did not follow , he continued , “ You only care about the things that you can use , and therefore arrange them in the following order : Money , supremely useful ; intellect , rather useful ; imagination , of no use at all . No ” — for the other had protested —<said who="#Helen">“ your Pan-Germanism is no more imaginative than is our Imperialism over here . It is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness , to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile , and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven . That is not imagination . No , it kills it . When their poets over here try to celebrate bigness they are dead at once , and naturally . Your poets too are dying , your philosophers , your musicians , to whom Europe has listened for two hundred years . Gone . Gone with the little courts that nurtured them — gone with Esterhazy and Weimar . What ? What 's that ? Your universities ? Oh yes , you have learned men , who collect more facts than do the learned men of England . They collect facts , and facts , and empires of facts . But which of them will rekindle the light within ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="207">To all this<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>listened , sitting on the haughty nephew 's knee .</p>
    <p n="208">It was a unique education for the little girls . The haughty nephew would be at Wickham Place one day , bringing with him an even haughtier wife , both convinced that Germany was appointed by God to govern the world .<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>would come the next day , convinced that Great Britain had been appointed to the same post by the same authority . Were both these loud-voiced parties right ? On one occasion they had met and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>with clasped hands had implored them to argue the subject out in her presence . Whereat they blushed , and began to talk about the weather .<said who="#Margaret">“ Papa , ”</said>she cried — she was a most offensive child —<said who="#Margaret">“ why will they not discuss this most clear question ? ”</said>Her father , surveying the parties grimly , replied that he did not know . Putting her head on one side ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>then remarked ,<said who="#Margaret">“ To me one of two things is very clear ; either God does not know his own mind about England and Germany , or else these do not know the mind of God . ”</said>A hateful little girl , but at thirteen she had grasped a dilemma that most people travel through life without perceiving . Her brain darted up and down ; it grew pliant and strong . Her conclusion was , that any human being lies nearer to the unseen than any organisation , and from this she never varied .</p>
    <p n="209"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>advanced along the same lines , though with a more irresponsible tread . In character she resembled her sister , but she was pretty , and so apt to have a more amusing time . People gathered round her more readily , especially when they were new acquaintances , and she did enjoy a little homage very much . When their father died and they ruled alone at Wickham Place , she often absorbed the whole of the company , while<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>— both were tremendous talkers — fell flat . Neither sister bothered about this .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>never apologised afterwards ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>did not feel the slightest rancour . But looks have their influence upon character . The sisters were alike as little girls , but at the time of the Wilcox episode their methods were beginning to diverge ; the younger was rather apt to entice people , and , in enticing them , to be herself enticed ; the elder went straight ahead , and accepted an occasional failure as part of the game .</p>

    <p n="211">It will be generally admitted that<persName>Beethoven</persName>'s Fifth Symphony is the most sublime noise that has ever penetrated into the ear of man . All sorts and conditions are satisfied by it . Whether you are like<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, and tap surreptitiously when the tunes come — of course , not so as to disturb the others — or like<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who can see heroes and shipwrecks in the music 's flood ; or like<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who can only see the music ; or like<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, who is profoundly versed in counterpoint , and holds the full score open on his knee ; or like their cousin ,<persName corresp="#Fraulein_Mosebach">Fraulein Mosebach</persName>, who remembers all the time that<persName>Beethoven</persName>is echt Deutsch ; or like<persName corresp="#Fraulein_Mosebach">Fraulein Mosebach</persName>'s young man , who can remember nothing but<persName corresp="#Fraulein_Mosebach">Fraulein Mosebach</persName>: in any case , the passion of your life becomes more vivid , and you are bound to admit that such a noise is cheap at two shillings . It is cheap , even if you hear it in the Queen 's Hall , dreariest music-room in London , though not as dreary as the Free Trade Hall , Manchester ; and even if you sit on the extreme left of that hall , so that the brass bumps at you before the rest of the orchestra arrives , it is still cheap .</p>
    <p n="212"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Whom is<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>talking to ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, at the conclusion of the first movement . She was again in London on a visit to Wickham Place .</p>
    <p n="213"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>looked down the long line of their party , and said that she did not know .</p>
    <p n="214"><said who="#Helen">“ Would it be some young man or other whom she takes an interest in ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="215"><said who="#Helen">“ I expect so , ”</said><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>replied . Music enwrapped her , and she could not enter into the distinction that divides young men whom one takes an interest in from young men whom one knows .</p>
    <p n="216"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ You girls are so wonderful in always having — Oh dear ! one must n't talk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="217">For the Andante had begun — very beautiful , but bearing a family likeness to all the other beautiful Andantes that<persName>Beethoven</persName>had written , and , to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s mind , rather disconnecting the heroes and shipwrecks of the first movement from the heroes and goblins of the third . She heard the tune through once , and then her attention wandered , and she gazed at the audience , or the organ , or the architecture . Much did she censure the attenuated Cupids who encircle the ceiling of the Queen 's Hall , inclining each to each with vapid gesture , and clad in sallow pantaloons , on which the October sunlight struck .<said who="#Helen">“ How awful to marry a man like those Cupids ! ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. Here<persName>Beethoven</persName>started decorating his tune , so she heard him through once more , and then she smiled at her Cousin<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>. But<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>, listening to Classical Music , could not respond . Herr Liesecke , too , looked as if wild horses could not make him inattentive ; there were lines across his forehead , his lips were parted , his pince-nez at right angles to his nose , and he had laid a thick , white hand on either knee . And next to her was<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, so British , and wanting to tap . How interesting that row of people was ! What diverse influences had gone to the making ! Here<persName>Beethoven</persName>, after humming and hawing with great sweetness , said “ Heigho , ” and the Andante came to an end . Applause , and a round of “ wunderschoning ” and pracht volleying from the German contingent .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>started talking to her new young man ;<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>said to her aunt : “ Now comes the wonderful movement : first of all the goblins , and then a trio of elephants dancing ” ; and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>implored the company generally to look out for the transitional passage on the drum .</p>
    <p n="218"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ On the what , dear ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="219"><said who="#Helen">“ On the drum ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="220"><said who="#Helen">“ No ; look out for the part where you think you have done with the goblins and they come back , ”</said>breathed<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, as the music started with a goblin walking quietly over the universe , from end to end . Others followed him . They were not aggressive creatures ; it was that that made them so terrible to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. They merely observed in passing that there was no such thing as splendour or heroism in the world . After the interlude of elephants dancing , they returned and made the observation for the second time .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>could not contradict them , for , once at all events , she had felt the same , and had seen the reliable walls of youth collapse . Panic and emptiness ! Panic and emptiness ! The goblins were right . Her brother raised his finger ; it was the transitional passage on the drum .</p>
    <p n="221">For , as if things were going too far ,<persName>Beethoven</persName>took hold of the goblins and made them do what he wanted . He appeared in person . He gave them a little push , and they began to walk in a major key instead of in a minor , and then — he blew with his mouth and they were scattered ! Gusts of splendour , gods and demigods contending with vast swords , colour and fragrance broadcast on the field of battle , magnificent victory , magnificent death ! Oh , it all burst before the girl , and she even stretched out her gloved hands as if it was tangible . Any fate was titanic ; any contest desirable ; conqueror and conquered would alike be applauded by the angels of the utmost stars .</p>
    <p n="222">And the goblins — they had not really been there at all ? They were only the phantoms of cowardice and unbelief ? One healthy human impulse would dispel them ? Men like the Wilcoxes , or ex-President Roosevelt , would say yes .<persName>Beethoven</persName>knew better . The goblins really had been there . They might return — and they did . It was as if the splendour of life might boil over and waste to steam and froth . In its dissolution one heard the terrible , ominous note , and a goblin , with increased malignity , walked quietly over the universe from end to end . Panic and emptiness ! Panic and emptiness ! Even the flaming ramparts of the world might fall .<persName>Beethoven</persName>chose to make all right in the end . He built the ramparts up . He blew with his mouth for the second time , and again the goblins were scattered . He brought back the gusts of splendour , the heroism , the youth , the magnificence of life and of death , and , amid vast roarings of a superhuman joy , he led his Fifth Symphony to its conclusion . But the goblins were there . They could return . He had said so bravely , and that is why one can trust<persName>Beethoven</persName>when he says other things .</p>
    <p n="223"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>pushed her way out during the applause . She desired to be alone . The music had summed up to her all that had happened or could happen in her career .</p>
    <p n="224">She read it as a tangible statement , which could never be superseded . The notes meant this and that to her , and they could have no other meaning , and life could have no other meaning . She pushed right out of the building and walked slowly down the outside staircase , breathing the autumnal air , and then she strolled home .</p>
    <p n="225"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ is<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>all right ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="226"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="227"><said who="#Tibby">“ She is always going away in the middle of a programme , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.</p>
    <p n="228"><said who="#Fraulein_Mosebach">“ The music has evidently moved her deeply , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Fraulein_Mosebach">Fraulein Mosebach</persName>.</p>
    <p n="229"><said who="#Margaret">“ Excuse me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s young man , who had for some time been preparing a sentence ,<said who="#Margaret">“ but that lady has , quite inadvertently , taken my umbrella . ”</said></p>
    <p n="230"><said who="#Fraulein_Mosebach">“ Oh , good gracious me !— I am so sorry .<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, run after<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="231"><said who="#Tibby">“ I shall miss the Four Serious Songs if I do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="232"><said who="#Fraulein_Mosebach">“<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, love , you must go . ”</said></p>
    <p n="233"><said who="#Tibby">“ It is n't of any consequence , ”</said>said the young man , in truth a little uneasy about his umbrella .</p>
    <p n="234"><said who="#Fraulein_Mosebach">“ But of course it is .<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>!<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="235"><persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>rose to his feet , and wilfully caught his person on the backs of the chairs . By the time he had tipped up the seat and had found his hat , and had deposited his full score in safety , it was “ too late ” to go after<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. The Four Serious Songs had begun , and one could not move during their performance .</p>
    <p n="236"><said who="#Margaret">“ My sister is so careless , ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="237"><said who="#Helen">“ Not at all , ”</said>replied the young man ; but his voice was dead and cold .</p>
    <p n="238"><said who="#Margaret">“ If you would give me your address — ”</said></p>
    <p n="239"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh , not at all , not at all ; ”</said>and he wrapped his greatcoat over his knees .</p>
    <p n="240">Then the Four Serious Songs rang shallow in<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s ears . Brahms , for all his grumbling and grizzling , had never guessed what it felt like to be suspected of stealing an umbrella . For this fool of a young man thought that she and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>had been playing the confidence trick on him , and that if he gave his address they would break into his rooms some midnight or other and steal his walking-stick too . Most ladies would have laughed , but<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>really minded , for it gave her a glimpse into squalor . To trust people is a luxury in which only the wealthy can indulge ; the poor cannot afford it . As soon as Brahms had grunted himself out , she gave him her card and said ,<said who="#Margaret">“ That is where we live ; if you preferred , you could call for the umbrella after the concert , but I did n't like to trouble you when it has all been our fault . ”</said></p>
    <p n="241">His face brightened a little when he saw that Wickham Place was W. It was sad to see him corroded with suspicion , and yet not daring to be impolite , in case these well-dressed people were honest after all . She took it as a good sign that he said to her ,<said who="#Helen">“ It 's a fine programme this afternoon , is it not ? ”</said>for this was the remark with which he had originally opened , before the umbrella intervened .</p>
    <p n="242"><said who="#Margaret">“ The<persName>Beethoven</persName>'s fine , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who was not a female of the encouraging type .<said who="#Margaret">“ I do n't like the Brahms , though , nor the Mendelssohn that came first and ugh ! I do n't like this Elgar that 's coming . ”</said></p>
    <p n="243"><said who="#Tibby">“ What , what ? ”</said>called Herr Liesecke , overhearing .<said who="#Tibby">“ The ‘ Pomp and Circumstance ’ will not be fine ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="244"><said who="#Tibby">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, you tiresome girl ! ”</said>cried her aunt .</p>
    <p n="245"><said who="#Tibby">“ Here have I been persuading Herr Liesecke to stop for ‘ Pomp and Circumstance , ’ and you are undoing all my work . I am so anxious for him to hear what WE are doing in music . Oh ,— you mus n't run down our English composers ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="246"><said who="#Fraulein_Mosebach">“ For my part , I have heard the composition at Stettin , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Fraulein_Mosebach">Fraulein Mosebach</persName>,<said who="#Fraulein_Mosebach">“ on two occasions . It is dramatic , a little . ”</said></p>
    <p n="247"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>, you despise English music . You know you do . And English art . And English literature , except Shakespeare , and he 's a German . Very well ,<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>, you may go . ”</said></p>
    <p n="248">The lovers laughed and glanced at each other . Moved by a common impulse , they rose to their feet and fled from “ Pomp and Circumstance . ”</p>
    <p n="249"><said who="#Fraulein_Mosebach">“ We have this call to pay in Finsbury Circus , it is true , ”</said>said Herr Liesecke , as he edged past her and reached the gangway just as the music started .</p>
    <p n="250"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>— ”</said>loudly whispered by<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>.</p>
    <p n="251"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>!<persName corresp="#Fraulein_Mosebach">Fraulein Mosebach</persName>has left her beautiful little bag behind her on the seat . ”</said></p>
    <p n="252">Sure enough , there was<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>'s reticule , containing her address book , her pocket dictionary , her map of London , and her money .</p>
    <p n="253"><said who="#Frieda">“ Oh , what a bother — what a family we are ! Fr — frieda ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="254"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ Hush ! ”</said>said all those who thought the music fine .</p>
    <p n="255"><said who="#Frieda">“ But it 's the number they want in Finsbury Circus . ”</said></p>
    <p n="256"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ Might I — could n't I — ”</said>said the suspicious young man , and got very red .</p>
    <p n="257"><said who="#Frieda">“ Oh , I would be so grateful . ”</said></p>
    <p n="258">He took the bag — money clinking inside it — and slipped up the gangway with it . He was just in time to catch them at the swing-door , and he received a pretty smile from the German girl and a fine bow from her cavalier . He returned to his seat upsides with the world . The trust that they had reposed in him was trivial , but he felt that it cancelled his mistrust for them , and that probably he would not be “ had ” over his umbrella . This young man had been “ had ” in the past badly , perhaps overwhelmingly — and now most of his energies went in defending himself against the unknown . But this afternoon — perhaps on account of music — he perceived that one must slack off occasionally or what is the good of being alive ? Wickham Place , W ., though a risk , was as safe as most things , and he would risk it .</p>
    <p n="259">So when the concert was over and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>said ,<said who="#Margaret">“ We live quite near ; I am going there now . Could you walk round with me , and we 'll find your umbrella ? ”</said>he said , “ Thank you , ” peaceably , and followed her out of the Queen 's Hall . She wished that he was not so anxious to hand a lady downstairs , or to carry a lady 's programme for her — his class was near enough her own for its manners to vex her . But she found him interesting on the whole — every one interested the Schlegels on the whole at that time — and while her lips talked culture , her heart was planning to invite him to tea .</p>
    <p n="260"><said who="#Frieda">“ How tired one gets after music ! ”</said>she began .</p>
    <p n="261"><said who="#Margaret">“ Do you find the atmosphere of Queen 's Hall oppressive ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="262"><said who="#Frieda">“ Yes , horribly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="263"><said who="#Margaret">“ But surely the atmosphere of Covent Garden is even more oppressive . ”</said></p>
    <p n="264"><said who="#Frieda">“ Do you go there much ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="265"><said who="#Margaret">“ When my work permits , I attend the gallery for the Royal Opera . ”</said></p>
    <p n="266"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>would have exclaimed , “ So do I. I love the gallery , ” and thus have endeared herself to the young man .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>could do these things . But<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had an almost morbid horror of “ drawing people out , ” of “ making things go . ” She had been to the gallery at Covent Garden , but she did not “ attend ” it , preferring the more expensive seats ; still less did she love it . So she made no reply .</p>
    <p n="267"><said who="#Margaret">“ This year I have been three times — to ‘ Faust , ’ ‘ Tosca , ’ and — ”</said>Was it “ Tannhouser ” or “ Tannhoyser ” ? Better not risk the word .</p>
    <p n="268"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>disliked “ Tosca ” and “ Faust . ” And so , for one reason and another , they walked on in silence , chaperoned by the voice of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, who was getting into difficulties with her nephew .</p>
    <p n="269"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I do in a WAY remember the passage ,<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, but when every instrument is so beautiful , it is difficult to pick out one thing rather than another . I am sure that you and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>take me to the very nicest concerts . Not a dull note from beginning to end . I only wish that our German friends had stayed till it finished . ”</said></p>
    <p n="270"><said who="#Tibby">“ But surely you have n't forgotten the drum steadily beating on the low C ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>? ”</said>came<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>'s voice .<said who="#Tibby">“ No one could . It 's unmistakable . ”</said></p>
    <p n="271"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ A specially loud part ? ”</said>hazarded<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Of course I do not go in for being musical , ”</said>she added , the shot failing .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I only care for music — a very different thing . But still I will say this for myself — I do know when I like a thing and when I do n't . Some people are the same about pictures . They can go into a picture gallery — Miss Conder can — and say straight off what they feel , all round the wall . I never could do that . But music is so different from pictures , to my mind . When it comes to music I am as safe as houses , and I assure you ,<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, I am by no means pleased by everything . There was a thing — something about a faun in French — which<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>went into ecstasies over , but I thought it most tinkling and superficial , and said so , and I held to my opinion too . ”</said></p>
    <p n="272"><said who="#Margaret">“ Do you agree ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Do you think music is so different from pictures ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="273"><said who="#Margaret">“ I — I should have thought so , kind of , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="274"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ So should I . Now , my sister declares they 're just the same . We have great arguments over it . She says I 'm dense ; I say she 's sloppy . ”</said>Getting under way , she cried :<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Now , does n't it seem absurd to you ? What is the good of the Arts if they ‘ re interchangeable ? What is the good of the ear if it tells you the same as the eye ?<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s one aim is to translate tunes into the language of painting , and pictures into the language of music . It 's very ingenious , and she says several pretty things in the process , but what 's gained , I 'd like to know ? Oh , it 's all rubbish , radically false . If Monet 's really Debussy , and Debussy 's really Monet , neither gentleman is worth his salt — that 's my opinion . ”</said></p>
    <p n="275">Evidently these sisters quarrelled .</p>
    <p n="276"><said who="#Margaret">“ Now , this very symphony that we 've just been having — she wo n't let it alone . She labels it with meanings from start to finish ; turns it into literature . I wonder if the day will ever return when music will be treated as music . Yet I do n't know . There 's my brother — behind us . He treats music as music , and oh , my goodness ! He makes me angrier than any one , simply furious . With him I dare n't even argue . ”</said></p>
    <p n="277">An unhappy family , if talented .</p>
    <p n="278"><said who="#Margaret">“ But , of course , the real villain is Wagner . He has done more than any man in the nineteenth century towards the muddling of the arts . I do feel that music is in a very serious state just now , though extraordinarily interesting . Every now and then in history there do come these terrible geniuses , like Wagner , who stir up all the wells of thought at once . For a moment it 's splendid . Such a splash as never was . But afterwards — such a lot of mud ; and the wells — as it were , they communicate with each other too easily now , and not one of them will run quite clear . That 's what Wagner 's done . ”</said></p>
    <p n="279">Her speeches fluttered away from the young man like birds . If only he could talk like this , he would have caught the world . Oh , to acquire culture ! Oh , to pronounce foreign names correctly ! Oh , to be well informed , discoursing at ease on every subject that a lady started ! But it would take one years . With an hour at lunch and a few shattered hours in the evening , how was it possible to catch up with leisured women , who had been reading steadily from childhood ? His brain might be full of names , he might have even heard of Monet and Debussy ; the trouble was that he could not string them together into a sentence , he could not make them “ tell , ” he could not quite forget about his stolen umbrella . Yes , the umbrella was the real trouble . Behind Monet and Debussy the umbrella persisted , with the steady beat of a drum .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I suppose my umbrella will be all right , ”</said>he was thinking .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I do n't really mind about it . I will think about music instead . I suppose my umbrella will be all right . ”</said>Earlier in the afternoon he had worried about seats . Ought he to have paid as much as two shillings ? Earlier still he had wondered ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Shall I try to do without a programme ? ”</said>There had always been something to worry him ever since he could remember , always something that distracted him in the pursuit of beauty . For he did pursue beauty , and , therefore ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s speeches did flutter away from him like birds .</p>
    <p n="280"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>talked ahead , occasionally saying ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Do n't you think so ? do n't you feel the same ? ”</said>And once she stopped , and said ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Oh , do interrupt me ! ”</said>which terrified him . She did not attract him , though she filled him with awe . Her figure was meagre , her face seemed all teeth and eyes , her references to her sister and her brother were uncharitable . For all her cleverness and culture , she was probably one of those soulless , atheistical women who have been so shown up by Miss Corelli . It was surprising ( and alarming ) that she should suddenly say ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I do hope that you 'll come in and have some tea . We should be so glad . I have dragged you so far out of your way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="281">They had arrived at Wickham Place . The sun had set , and the backwater , in deep shadow , was filling with a gentle haze . To the right the fantastic sky-line of the flats towered black against the hues of evening ; to the left the older houses raised a square-cut , irregular parapet against the grey .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>fumbled for her latch-key . Of course she had forgotten it . So , grasping her umbrella by its ferrule , she leant over the area and tapped at the dining-room window .</p>
    <p n="282"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>! Let us in ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="283"><said who="#Helen">“ All right , ”</said>said a voice .</p>
    <p n="284"><said who="#Margaret">“ You 've been taking this gentleman 's umbrella . ”</said></p>
    <p n="285"><said who="#Helen">“ Taken a what ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, opening the door .<said who="#Helen">“ Oh , what 's that ? Do come in ! How do you do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="286"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, you must not be so ramshackly . You took this gentleman 's umbrella away from Queen 's Hall , and he has had the trouble of coming round for it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="287"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh , I am so sorry ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, all her hair flying . She had pulled off her hat as soon as she returned , and had flung herself into the big dining-room chair .<said who="#Helen">“ I do nothing but steal umbrellas . I am so very sorry ! Do come in and choose one . Is yours a hooky or a nobbly ? Mine 's a nobbly — at least , I THINK it is . ”</said></p>
    <p n="288">The light was turned on , and they began to search the hall ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who had abruptly parted with the Fifth Symphony , commenting with shrill little cries .</p>
    <p n="289"><said who="#Helen">“ Do n't you talk ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>! You stole an old gentleman 's silk top-hat . Yes , she did ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>. It is a positive fact . She thought it was a muff . Oh , heavens ! I 've knocked the In-and-Out card down . Where 's<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>?<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, why do n't you ever — No , I can n't remember what I was going to say . That was n't it , but do tell the maids to hurry tea up . What about this umbrella ? ”</said>She opened it .<said who="#Helen">“ No , it 's all gone along the seams . It 's an appalling umbrella . It must be mine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="290">But it was not .</p>
    <p n="291">He took it from her , murmured a few words of thanks , and then fled , with the lilting step of the clerk .</p>
    <p n="292"><said who="#Margaret">“ But if you will stop — ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Now ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, how stupid you 've been ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="293"><said who="#Helen">“ Whatever have I done ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="294"><said who="#Helen">“ Do n't you see that you 've frightened him away ? I meant him to stop to tea . You ought n't to talk about stealing or holes in an umbrella . I saw his nice eyes getting so miserable . No , it 's not a bit of good now . ”</said>For<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had darted out into the street , shouting ,<said who="#Helen">“ Oh , do stop ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="295"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I dare say it is all for the best , ”</said>opined<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ We know nothing about the young man ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, and your drawing-room is full of very tempting little things . ”</said></p>
    <p n="296">But<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>cried :<said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, how can you ! You make me more and more ashamed . I 'd rather he had been a thief and taken all the apostle spoons than that I — Well , I must shut the front-door , I suppose . One more failure for<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="297"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , I think the apostle spoons could have gone as rent , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. Seeing that her aunt did not understand , she added :<said who="#Margaret">“ You remember ‘ rent ’ ? It was one of father 's words — Rent to the ideal , to his own faith in human nature . You remember how he would trust strangers , and if they fooled him he would say , ‘ It 's better to be fooled than to be suspicious ’ — that the confidence trick is the work of man , but the want-of-confidence trick is the work of the devil . ”</said></p>
    <p n="298"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I remember something of the sort now , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, rather tartly , for she longed to add ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ It was lucky that your father married a wife with money . ”</said>But this was unkind , and she contented herself with ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Why , he might have stolen the little Ricketts picture as well . ”</said></p>
    <p n="299"><said who="#Helen">“ Better that he had , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>stoutly .</p>
    <p n="300"><said who="#Margaret">“ No , I agree with<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ I 'd rather mistrust people than lose my little Ricketts . There are limits . ”</said></p>
    <p n="301">Their brother , finding the incident commonplace , had stolen upstairs to see whether there were scones for tea . He warmed the teapot — almost too deftly — rejected the orange pekoe that the parlour-maid had provided , poured in five spoonfuls of a superior blend , filled up with really boiling water , and now called to the ladies to be quick or they would lose the aroma .</p>
    <p n="302"><said who="#Margaret">“ All right , Auntie<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, ”</said>called Heien , while<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, thoughtful again , said :<said who="#Margaret">“ In a way , I wish we had a real boy in the house — the kind of boy who cares for men . It would make entertaining so much easier . ”</said></p>
    <p n="303"><said who="#Helen">“ So do I , ”</said>said her sister .<said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>only cares for cultured females singing Brahms . ”</said>And when they joined him she said rather sharply :<said who="#Helen">“ Why did n't you make that young man welcome ,<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>? You must do the host a little , you know . You ought to have taken his hat and coaxed him into stopping , instead of letting him be swamped by screaming women . ”</said></p>
    <p n="304"><persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>sighed , and drew a long strand of hair over his forehead .</p>
    <p n="305"><said who="#Tibby">“ Oh , it 's no good looking superior . I mean what I say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="306"><said who="#Margaret">“ Leave<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>alone ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who could not bear her brother to be scolded .</p>
    <p n="307"><said who="#Helen">“ Here 's the house a regular hen-coop ! ”</said>grumbled<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="308"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh , my dear ! ”</said>protested<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ How can you say such dreadful things ! The number of men you get here has always astonished me . If there is any danger it 's the other way round . ”</said></p>
    <p n="309"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Yes , but it 's the wrong sort of men ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>means . ”</said></p>
    <p n="310"><said who="#Helen">“ No , I do n't , ”</said>corrected<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ We get the right sort of man , but the wrong side of him , and I say that 's<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>'s fault . There ought to be a something about the house — an — I do n't know what . ”</said></p>
    <p n="311"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ A touch of<persName>the W</persName>'s , perhaps ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="312"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>put out her tongue .</p>
    <p n="313"><said who="#Tibby">“ Who are<persName>the W</persName>'s ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.</p>
    <p n="314"><said who="#Helen">“<persName>The W</persName>'s are things I and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>and<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>know about and you do n't , so there ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="315"><said who="#Margaret">“ I suppose that ours is a female house , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>,<said who="#Margaret">“ and one must just accept it . No ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, I do n't mean that this house is full of women . I am trying to say something much more clever . I mean that it was irrevocably feminine , even in father 's time . Now I 'm sure you understand ! Well , I 'll give you another example . It 'll shock you , but I do n't care . Suppose Queen Victoria gave a dinner-party , and that the guests had been Leighton , Millais , Swinburne , Rossetti , Meredith , Fitzgerald , etc . Do you suppose that the atmosphere of that dinner would have been artistic ? Heavens , no ! The very chairs on which they sat would have seen to that . So with out house — it must be feminine , and all we can do is to see that it is n't effeminate . Just as another house that I can mention , but wo n't , sounded irrevocably masculine , and all its inmates can do is to see that it is n't brutal . ”</said></p>
    <p n="316"><said who="#Tibby">“ That house being<persName>the W</persName>'s house , I presume , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.</p>
    <p n="317"><said who="#Helen">“ You 're not going to be told about<persName>the W</persName>'s , my child , ”</said><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>cried ,<said who="#Helen">“ so do n't you think it . And on the other hand , I do n't the least mind if you find out , so do n't you think you 've done anything clever , in either case . Give me a cigarette . ”</said></p>
    <p n="318"><said who="#Margaret">“ You do what you can for the house , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ The drawing-room reeks of smoke . ”</said></p>
    <p n="319"><said who="#Helen">“ If you smoked too , the house might suddenly turn masculine . Atmosphere is probably a question of touch and go . Even at Queen Victoria 's dinner-party — if something had been just a little Different — perhaps if she 'd worn a clinging Liberty tea-gown instead of a magenta satin . ”</said></p>
    <p n="320"><said who="#Margaret">“ With an India shawl over her shoulders — ”</said></p>
    <p n="321"><said who="#Helen">“ Fastened at the bosom with a Cairngorm-pin . ”</said></p>
    <p n="322">Bursts of disloyal laughter — you must remember that they are half German — greeted these suggestions , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>said pensively ,<said who="#Margaret">“ How inconceivable it would be if the Royal Family cared about<persName corresp="#Art">Art</persName>. ”</said>And the conversation drifted away and away , and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s cigarette turned to a spot in the darkness , and the great flats opposite were sown with lighted windows which vanished and were refit again , and vanished incessantly . Beyond them the thoroughfare roared gently — a tide that could never be quiet , while in the east , invisible behind the smokes of Wapping , the moon was rising .</p>
    <p n="323"><said who="#Helen">“ That reminds me ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. We might have taken that young man into the dining-room , at all events . Only the majolica plate — and that is so firmly set in the wall . I am really distressed that he had no tea . ”</said></p>
    <p n="324">For that little incident had impressed the three women more than might be supposed . It remained as a goblin footfall , as a hint that all is not for the best in the best of all possible worlds , and that beneath these superstructures of wealth and art there wanders an ill-fed boy , who has recovered his umbrella indeed , but who has left no address behind him , and no name .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="6">
    <p n="325">WE are not concerned with the very poor . They are unthinkable and only to be approached by the statistician or the poet . This story deals with gentlefolk , or with those who are obliged to pretend that they are gentlefolk .</p>
    <p n="326">The boy ,<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard Bast</persName>, stood at the extreme verge of gentility . He was not in the abyss , but he could see it , and at times people whom he knew had dropped in , and counted no more . He knew that he was poor , and would admit it ; he would have died sooner than confess any inferiority to the rich . This may be splendid of him . But he was inferior to most rich people , there is not the least doubt of it . He was not as courteous as the average rich man , nor as intelligent , nor as healthy , nor as lovable . His mind and his body had been alike underfed , because he was poor , and because he was modern they were always craving better food . Had he lived some centuries ago , in the brightly coloured civilisations of the past , he would have had a definite status , his rank and his income would have corresponded . But in his day the angel of Democracy had arisen , enshadowing the classes with leathern wings , and proclaiming , “ All men are equal — all men , that is to say , who possess umbrellas , ” and so he was obliged to assert gentility , lest he slip into the abyss where nothing counts , and the statements of Democracy are inaudible .</p>
    <p n="327">As he walked away from Wickham Place , his first care was to prove that he was as good as the Miss Schlegels . Obscurely wounded in his pride , he tried to wound them in return . They were probably not ladies . Would real ladies have asked him to tea ? They were certainly ill-natured and cold . At each step his feeling of superiority increased . Would a real lady have talked about stealing an umbrella ? Perhaps they were thieves after all , and if he had gone into the house they would have clapped a chloroformed handkerchief over his face . He walked on complacently as far as the Houses of Parliament . There an empty stomach asserted itself , and told him that he was a fool .</p>
    <p n="328"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Evening ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="329"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ Evening , Mr. Dealtry . ”</said></p>
    <p n="330"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Nice evening . ”</said></p>
    <p n="331"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ Evening . ”</said></p>
    <p n="332">Mr. Dealtry , a fellow clerk , passed on , and<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>stood wondering whether he would take the tram as far as a penny would take him , or whether he would walk . He decided to walk — it is no good giving in , and he had spent money enough at Queen 's Hall — and he walked over Westminster Bridge , in front of St. Thomas 's Hospital , and through the immense tunnel that passes under the South-Western main line at Vauxhall . In the tunnel he paused and listened to the roar of the trains . A sharp pain darted through his head , and he was conscious of the exact form of his eye sockets . He pushed on for another mile , and did not slacken speed until he stood at the entrance of a road called Camelia Road which was at present his home .</p>
    <p n="333">Here he stopped again , and glanced suspiciously to right and left , like a rabbit that is going to bolt into its hole . A block of flats , constructed with extreme cheapness , towered on either hand . Farther down the road two more blocks were being built , and beyond these an old house was being demolished to accommodate another pair . It was the kind of scene that may be observed all over London , whatever the locality — bricks and mortar rising and falling with the restlessness of the water in a fountain as the city receives more and more men upon her soil . Camelia Road would soon stand out like a fortress , and command , for a little , an extensive view . Only for a little . Plans were out for the erection of flats in Magnolia Road also . And again a few years , and all the flats in either road might be pulled down , and new buildings , of a vastness at present unimaginable , might arise where they had fallen .</p>
    <p n="334"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Evening ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="335"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ Evening ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cunningham">Mr. Cunningham</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="336"><said who="#Mr._Cunningham">“ Very serious thing this decline of the birth-rate in Manchester . ”</said></p>
    <p n="337"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ I beg your pardon ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="338"><said who="#Mr._Cunningham">“ Very serious thing this decline of the birth-rate in Manchester , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Mr._Cunningham">Mr. Cunningham</persName>, tapping the Sunday paper , in which the calamity in question had just been announced to him .</p>
    <p n="339"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Ah , yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, who was not going to let on that he had not bought a Sunday paper .</p>
    <p n="340"><said who="#Mr._Cunningham">“ If this kind of thing goes on the population of England will be stationary in 1960 . ”</said></p>
    <p n="341"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ You do n't say so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="342"><said who="#Mr._Cunningham">“ I call it a very serious thing , eh ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="343"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Good-evening ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cunningham">Mr. Cunningham</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="344"><said who="#Mr._Cunningham">“ Good-evening ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="345">Then<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>entered Block B of the flats , and turned , not upstairs , but down , into what is known to house agents as a semi-basement , and to other men as a cellar . He opened the door , and cried ,<said who="#Mr._Bast">“ Hullo ! ”</said>with the pseudo geniality of the Cockney . There was no reply .<said who="#Mr._Bast">“ Hullo ! ”</said>he repeated . The sitting-room was empty , though the electric light had been left burning . A look of relief came over his face , and he flung himself into the armchair .</p>
    <p n="346">The sitting-room contained , besides the armchair , two other chairs , a piano , a three-legged table , and a cosy corner . Of the walls , one was occupied by the window , the other by a draped mantelshelf bristling with Cupids . Opposite the window was the door , and beside the door a bookcase , while over the piano there extended one of the masterpieces of Maud Goodman . It was an amorous and not unpleasant little hole when the curtains were drawn , and the lights turned on , and the gas-stove unlit . But it struck that shallow makeshift note that is so often heard in the dwelling-place . It had been too easily gained , and could be relinquished too easily .</p>
    <p n="347">As<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>was kicking off his boots he jarred the three-legged table , and a photograph frame , honourably poised upon it , slid sideways , fell off into the fireplace , and smashed . He swore in a colourless sort of way , and picked the photograph up . It represented a young lady called<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>, and had been taken at the time when young ladies called<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>were often photographed with their mouths open . Teeth of dazzling whiteness extended along either of<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>'s jaw 's , and positively weighed her head sideways , so large were they and so numerous . Take my word for it , that smile was simply stunning , and it is only you and I who will be fastidious , and complain that true joy begins in the eyes , and that the eyes of<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>did not accord with her smile , but were anxious and hungry .</p>
    <p n="348"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>tried to pull out the fragments of glass , and cut his fingers and swore again . A drop of blood fell on the frame , another followed , spilling over on to the exposed photograph . He swore more vigorously , and dashed into the kitchen , where he bathed his hands . The kitchen was the same size as the sitting-room ; beyond it was a bedroom . This completed his home . He was renting the flat furnished ; of all the objects that encumbered it none were his own except the photograph frame , the Cupids , and the books .</p>
    <p n="349"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Damn , damn , damnation ! ”</said>he murmured , together with such other words as he had learnt from older men . Then he raised his hand to his forehead and said ,<said who="#Ruskin">“ Oh , damn it all — ”</said>which meant something different . He pulled himself together . He drank a little tea , black and silent , that still survived upon an upper shelf . He swallowed some dusty crumbs of a cake . Then he went back to the sitting-room , settled himself anew , and began to read a volume of<persName corresp="#Ruskin">Ruskin</persName>.</p>
    <p n="350"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Seven miles to the north of Venice — ”</said></p>
    <p n="351">How perfectly the famous chapter opens ! How supreme its command of admonition and of poetry ! The rich man is speaking to us from his gondola .</p>
    <p n="352"><said who="#Ruskin">“ Seven miles to the north of Venice the banks of sand which nearer the city rise little above low-water mark attain by degrees a higher level , and knit themselves at last into fields of salt morass , raised here and there into shapeless mounds , and intercepted by narrow creeks of sea . ”</said></p>
    <p n="353"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>was trying to form his style on<persName corresp="#Ruskin">Ruskin</persName>; he understood him to be the greatest master of English Prose . He read forward steadily , occasionally making a few notes .</p>
    <p n="354"><said who="#Ruskin">“ Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession , and first ( for of the shafts enough has been said already ) , what is very peculiar to this church — its luminousness . ”</said></p>
    <p n="355">Was there anything to be learnt from this fine sentence ? Could he adapt it to the needs of daily life ? Could he introduce it , with modifications , when he next wrote a letter to his brother , the lay-reader ? For example :</p>
    <p n="356"><said who="#Ruskin">“ Let us consider a little each of these characters in succession , and first ( for of the absence of ventilation enough has been said already ) , what is very peculiar to this flat — its obscurity . ”</said></p>
    <p n="357">Something told him that the modifications would not do ; and that something , had he known it , was the spirit of English Prose .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ My flat is dark as well as stuffy . ”</said>Those were the words for him .</p>
    <p n="358">And the voice in the gondola rolled on , piping melodiously of Effort and Self-Sacrifice , full of high purpose , full of beauty , full even of sympathy and the love of men , yet somehow eluding all that was actual and insistent in<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>'s life . For it was the voice of one who had never been dirty or hungry , and had not guessed successfully what dirt and hunger are .</p>
    <p n="359"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>listened to it with reverence . He felt that he was being done good to , and that if he kept on with<persName corresp="#Ruskin">Ruskin</persName>, and the Queen 's Hall Concerts , and some pictures by Watts , he would one day push his head out of the grey waters and see the universe . He believed in sudden conversion , a belief which may be right , but which is peculiarly attractive to a half-baked mind . It is the basis of much popular religion ; in the domain of business it dominates the Stock Exchange , and becomes that “ bit of luck ” by which all successes and failures are explained .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ If only I had a bit of luck , the whole thing would come straight ... He 's got a most magnificent place down at Streatham and a 20 h. p . Fiat , but then , mind you , he 's had luck ... I ‘ m sorry the wife 's so late , but she never has any luck over catching trains . ”</said><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>was superior to these people ; he did believe in effort and in a steady preparation for the change that he desired . But of a heritage that may expand gradually , he had no conception ; he hoped to come to Culture suddenly , much as the Revivalist hopes to come to Jesus . Those Miss Schlegels had come to it ; they had done the trick ; their hands were upon the ropes , once and for all . And meanwhile , his flat was dark , as well as stuffy .</p>
    <p n="360">Presently there was a noise on the staircase . He shut up<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s card in the pages of<persName corresp="#Ruskin">Ruskin</persName>, and opened the door . A woman entered , of whom it is simplest to say that she was not respectable . Her appearance was awesome . She seemed all strings and bell-pulls — ribbons , chains , bead necklaces that clinked and caught and a boa of azure feathers hung round her neck , with the ends uneven . Her throat was bare , wound with a double row of pearls , her arms were bare to the elbows , and might again be detected at the shoulder , through cheap lace . Her hat , which was flowery , resembled those punnets , covered with flannel , which we sowed with mustard and cress in our childhood , and which germinated here yes , and there no . She wore it on the back of her head . As for her hair , or rather hairs , they are too complicated to describe , but one system went down her back , lying in a thick pad there , while another , created for a lighter destiny , rippled around her forehead . The face — the face does not signify . It was the face of the photograph , but older , and the teeth were not so numerous as the photographer had suggested , and certainly not so white . Yes ,<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>was past her prime , whatever that prime may have been . She was descending quicker than most women into the colourless years , and the look in her eyes confessed it .</p>
    <p n="361"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ What ho ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, greeting the apparition with much spirit , and helping it off with its boa .</p>
    <p n="362"><persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>, in husky tones , replied ,<said who="#Jacky">“ What ho ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="363"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Been out ? ”</said>he asked . The question sounds superfluous , but it cannot have been really , for the lady answered , “ No , ” adding ,<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Oh , I am so tired . ”</said></p>
    <p n="364"><said who="#Jacky">“ You tired ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="365"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Eh ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="366"><said who="#Jacky">“ I 'm tired , ”</said>said he , hanging the boa up .</p>
    <p n="367"><said who="#Jacky">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Len</persName>, I am so tired . ”</said></p>
    <p n="368"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I 've been to that classical concert I told you about , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>.</p>
    <p n="369"><said who="#Jacky">“ What 's that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="370"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I came back as soon as it was over . ”</said></p>
    <p n="371"><said who="#Jacky">“ Any one been round to our place ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>.</p>
    <p n="372"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Not that I 've seen . I met<persName corresp="#Mr._Cunningham">Mr. Cunningham</persName>outside , and we passed a few remarks . ”</said></p>
    <p n="373"><said who="#Jacky">“ What , not<persName corresp="#Mr._Cunningham">Mr. Cunningham</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="374"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="375"><said who="#Jacky">“ Oh , you mean<persName corresp="#Mr._Cunningham">Mr. Cunningham</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="376"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Yes .<persName corresp="#Mr._Cunningham">Mr. Cunningham</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="377"><said who="#Mr._Cunningham">“ I 've been out to tea at a lady friend 's . ”</said></p>
    <p n="378">Her secret being at last given — to the world , and the name of the lady friend being even adumbrated ,<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>made no further experiments in the difficult and tiring art of conversation . She never had been a great talker . Even in her photographic days she had relied upon her smile and her figure to attract , and now that she was</p>
    <p n="379"><said who="#Jacky">“ On the shelf , On the shelf , Boys , boys , I 'm on the shelf , ”</said></p>
    <p n="380">she was not likely to find her tongue . Occasional bursts of song ( of which the above is an example ) still issued from her lips , but the spoken word was rare .</p>
    <p n="381">She sat down on<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>'s knee , and began to fondle him . She was now a massive woman of thirty-three , and her weight hurt him , but he could not very well say anything . Then she said ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Is that a book you 're reading ? ”</said>and he said , “ That 's a book , ” and drew it from her unreluctant grasp .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s card fell out of it . It fell face downwards , and he murmured ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Bookmarker . ”</said></p>
    <p n="382"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Len</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="383"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ What is it ? ”</said>he asked , a little wearily , for she only had one topic of conversation when she sat upon his knee .</p>
    <p n="384"><said who="#Margaret">“ You do love me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="385"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>, you know that I do . How can you ask such questions ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="386"><said who="#Jacky">“ But you do love me ,<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Len</persName>, do n't you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="387"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Of course I do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="388">A pause . The other remark was still due .</p>
    <p n="389"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Len</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="390"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Well ? What is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="391"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Len</persName>, you will make it all right ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="392"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I can n't have you ask me that again , ”</said>said the boy , flaring up into a sudden passion .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I 've promised to marry you when I 'm of age , and that 's enough . My word 's my word . I 've promised to marry you as soon as ever I 'm twenty-one , and I can n't keep on being worried . I 've worries enough . It is n't likely I 'd throw you over , let alone my word , when I 've spent all this money . Besides , I 'm an Englishman , and I never go back on my word .<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>, do be reasonable . Of course I 'll marry you . Only do stop badgering me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="393"><said who="#Jacky">“ When 's your birthday ,<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Len</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="394"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I 've told you again and again , the eleventh of November next . Now get off my knee a bit ; some one must get supper , I suppose . ”</said></p>
    <p n="395"><persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>went through to the bedroom , and began to see to her hat . This meant blowing at it with short sharp puffs .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>tidied up the sitting-room , and began to prepare their evening meal . He put a penny into the slot of the gas-meter , and soon the flat was reeking with metallic fumes . Somehow he could not recover his temper , and all the time he was cooking he continued to complain bitterly .</p>
    <p n="396"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ It really is too bad when a fellow is n't trusted . It makes one feel so wild , when I 've pretended to the people here that you 're my wife — all right , all right , you SHALL be my wife — and I 've bought you the ring to wear , and I 've taken this flat furnished , and it 's far more than I can afford , and yet you are n't content , and I 've also not told the truth when I 've written home . ”</said>He lowered his voice .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ He 'd stop it . ”</said>In a tone of horror , that was a little luxurious , he repeated :<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ My brother 'd stop it . I 'm going against the whole world ,<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>.</said></p>
    <p n="397"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ That 's what I am ,<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>. I do n't take any heed of what any one says . I just go straight forward , I do . That 's always been my way . I 'm not one of your weak knock-kneed chaps . If a woman 's in trouble , I do n't leave her in the lurch . That 's not my street . No , thank you .</said></p>
    <p n="398"><said who="#Jacky">“ I 'll tell you another thing too . I care a good deal about improving myself by means of<persName>Literature</persName>and<persName corresp="#Art">Art</persName>, and so getting a wider outlook . For instance , when you came in I was reading<persName corresp="#Ruskin">Ruskin</persName>'s Stones of Venice . I do n't say this to boast , but just to show you the kind of man I am . I can tell you , I enjoyed that classical concert this afternoon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="399">To all his moods<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>remained equally indifferent . When supper was ready — and not before — she emerged from the bedroom , saying :<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ But you do love me , do n't you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="400">They began with a soup square , which<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>had just dissolved in some hot water . It was followed by the tongue — a freckled cylinder of meat , with a little jelly at the top , and a great deal of yellow fat at the bottom — ending with another square dissolved in water ( jelly : pineapple ) , which<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>had prepared earlier in the day .<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>ate contentedly enough , occasionally looking at her man with those anxious eyes , to which nothing else in her appearance corresponded , and which yet seemed to mirror her soul . And<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>managed to convince his stomach that it was having a nourishing meal .</p>
    <p n="401">After supper they smoked cigarettes and exchanged a few statements . She observed that her “ likeness ” had been broken . He found occasion to remark , for the second time , that he had come straight back home after the concert at Queen 's Hall . Presently she sat upon his knee . The inhabitants of Camelia Road tramped to and fro outside the window , just on a level with their heads , and the family in the flat on the ground-floor began to sing ,<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Hark , my soul , it is the Lord . ”</said></p>
    <p n="402"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ That tune fairly gives me the hump , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>.</p>
    <p n="403"><persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>followed this , and said that , for her part , she thought it a lovely tune .</p>
    <p n="404"><said who="#Jacky">“ No ; I 'll play you something lovely . Get up , dear , for a minute . ”</said></p>
    <p n="405">He went to the piano and jingled out a little Grieg . He played badly and vulgarly , but the performance was not without its effect , for<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>said she thought she 'd be going to bed . As she receded , a new set of interests possessed the boy , and he began to think of what had been said about music by that odd<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>— the one that twisted her face about so when she spoke . Then the thoughts grew sad and envious . There was the girl named<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who had pinched his umbrella , and the German girl who had smiled at him pleasantly , and Herr some one , and Aunt some one , and the brother — all , all with their hands on the ropes . They had all passed up that narrow , rich staircase at Wickham Place to some ample room , whither he could never follow them , not if he read for ten hours a day . Oh , it was no good , this continual aspiration . Some are born cultured ; the rest had better go in for whatever comes easy . To see life steadily and to see it whole was not for the likes of him .</p>
    <p n="406">From the darkness beyond the kitchen a voice called ,<said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Len</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="407"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ You in bed ? ”</said>he asked , his forehead twitching .</p>
    <p n="408"><said who="#Helen">“ All right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="409">Presently she called him again .</p>
    <p n="410"><said who="#Helen">“ I must clean my boots ready for the morning , ”</said>he answered .</p>
    <p n="411">Presently she called him again .</p>
    <p n="412"><said who="#Helen">“ I rather want to get this chapter done . ”</said></p>
    <p n="413"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ What ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="414">He closed his ears against her .</p>
    <p n="415"><said who="#Helen">“ What 's that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="416"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ All right ,<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>, nothing ; I 'm reading a book . ”</said></p>
    <p n="417"><said who="#Jacky">“ What ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="418"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ What ? ”</said>he answered , catching her degraded deafness .</p>
    <p n="419">Presently she called him again .</p>
    <p n="420"><persName corresp="#Ruskin">Ruskin</persName>had visited Torcello by this time , and was ordering his gondoliers to take him to Murano . It occurred to him , as he glided over the whispering lagoons , that the power of<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>could not be shortened by the folly , nor her beauty altogether saddened by the misery of such as<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>.</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="7">
    <p n="421"><said>“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, ”</said>cried her aunt next morning ,<said>“ such a most unfortunate thing has happened . I could not get you alone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="422">The most unfortunate thing was not very serious . One of the flats in the ornate block opposite had been taken furnished by the Wilcox family ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ coming up , no doubt , in the hope of getting into London society . ”</said>That<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>should be the first to discover the misfortune was not remarkable , for she was so interested in the flats , that she watched their every mutation with unwearying care . In theory she despised them — they took away that old-world look — they cut off the sun — flats house a flashy type of person . But if the truth had been known , she found her visits to Wickham Place twice as amusing since Wickham Mansions had arisen , and would in a couple of days learn more about them than her nieces in a couple of months , or her nephew in a couple of years . She would stroll across and make friends with the porters , and inquire what the rents were , exclaiming for example :<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ What ! a hundred and twenty for a basement ? You 'll never get it ! ”</said>And they would answer :<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ One can but try , madam . ”</said>The passenger lifts , the arrangement for coals ( a great temptation for a dishonest porter ) , were all familiar matters to her , and perhaps a relief from the politico-economical-esthetic atmosphere that reigned at the Schlegels .</p>
    <p n="423"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>received the information calmly , and did not agree that it would throw a cloud over poor<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s life .</p>
    <p n="424"><said>“ Oh , but<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>is n't a girl with no interests , ”</said>she explained .<said who="#Helen">“ She has plenty of other things and other people to think about . She made a false start with the Wilcoxes , and she 'll be as willing as we are to have nothing more to do with them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="425"><said who="#Margaret">“ For a clever girl , dear , how very oddly you do talk .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'ll HAVE to have something more to do with them , now that they ‘ re all opposite . She may meet that<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>in the street . She cannot very well not bow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="426"><said>“ Of course she must bow . But look here ; let 's do the flowers . I was going to say , the will to be interested in him has died , and what else matters ? I look on that disastrous episode ( over which you were so kind ) as the killing of a nerve in<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. It 's dead , and she 'll never be troubled with it again . The only things that matter are the things that interest one . Bowing , even calling and leaving cards , even a dinner-party — we can do all those things to the Wilcoxes , if they find it agreeable ; but the other thing , the one important thing — never again . Do n't you see ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="427"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>did not see , and indeed<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was making a most questionable statement — that any emotion , any interest once vividly aroused , can wholly die .</p>
    <p n="428"><said who="#Margaret">“ I also have the honour to inform you that the Wilcoxes are bored with us . I did n't tell you at the time — it might have made you angry , and you had enough to worry you — but I wrote a letter to Mrs. W , and apologised for the trouble that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had given them . She did n't answer it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="429"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ How very rude ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="430"><said who="#Margaret">“ I wonder . Or was it sensible ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="431"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ No ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, most rude . ”</said></p>
    <p n="432"><said who="#Margaret">“ In either case one can class it as reassuring . ”</said></p>
    <p n="433"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>sighed . She was going back to Swanage on the morrow , just as her nieces were wanting her most . Other regrets crowded upon her : for instance , how magnificently she would have cut<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>if she had met him face to face . She had already seen him , giving an order to the porter — and very common he looked in a tall hat . But unfortunately his back was turned to her , and though she had cut his back , she could not regard this as a telling snub .</p>
    <p n="434"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ But you will be careful , wo n't you ? ”</said>she exhorted .</p>
    <p n="435"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Oh , certainly . Fiendishly careful . ”</said></p>
    <p n="436"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ And<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>must be careful , too . ”</said></p>
    <p n="437"><said who="#Helen">“ Careful over what ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, at that moment coming into the room with her cousin .</p>
    <p n="438">“ Nothing ” said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, seized with a momentary awkwardness .</p>
    <p n="439"><said who="#Margaret">“ Careful over what ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="440"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>assumed a cryptic air .<said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ It is only that a certain family , whom we know by name but do not mention , as you said yourself last night after the concert , have taken the flat opposite from the Mathesons — where the plants are in the balcony . ”</said></p>
    <p n="441"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>began some laughing reply , and then disconcerted them all by blushing .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>was so disconcerted that she exclaimed ,<said who="#Margaret">“ What ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, you do n't mind them coming , do you ? ”</said>and deepened the blush to crimson .</p>
    <p n="442"><said who="#Helen">“ Of course I do n't mind , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>a little crossly .<said who="#Helen">“ It is that you and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>are both so absurdly grave about it , when there 's nothing to be grave about at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="443"><said who="#Margaret">“ I 'm not grave , ”</said>protested<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, a little cross in her turn .</p>
    <p n="444"><said who="#Helen">“ Well , you look grave ; does n't she ,<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="445"><said who="#Frieda">“ I do n't feel grave , that 's all I can say ; you 're going quite on the wrong tack . ”</said></p>
    <p n="446"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ No , she does not feel grave , ”</said>echoed<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I can bear witness to that . She disagrees — ”</said></p>
    <p n="447"><said who="#Fraulein_Mosebach">“ Hark ! ”</said>interrupted<persName corresp="#Fraulein_Mosebach">Fraulein Mosebach</persName>.<said who="#Fraulein_Mosebach">“ I hear Bruno entering the hall . ”</said></p>
    <p n="448">For Herr Liesecke was due at Wickham Place to call for the two younger girls . He was not entering the hall — in fact , he did not enter it for quite five minutes . But<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>detected a delicate situation , and said that she and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had much better wait for Bruno down below , and leave<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>to finish arranging the flowers .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>acquiesced . But , as if to prove that the situation was not delicate really , she stopped in the doorway and said :</p>
    <p n="449"><said who="#Helen">“ Did you say the Mathesons ’ flat ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>? How wonderful you are ! I never knew that the name of the woman who laced too tightly was Matheson . ”</said></p>
    <p n="450"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ Come ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, ”</said>said her cousin .</p>
    <p n="451"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ Go ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, ”</said>said her aunt ; and continued to<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>almost in the same breath :<said who="#Aunt_Juley">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>cannot deceive me . She does mind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="452"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , hush ! ”</said>breathed<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>'ll hear you , and she can be so tiresome . ”</said></p>
    <p n="453"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ She minds , ”</said>persisted<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, moving thoughtfully about the room , and pulling the dead chrysanthemums out of the vases .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I knew she 'd mind — and I 'm sure a girl ought to ! Such an experience ! Such awful coarse-grained people ! I know more about them than you do , which you forget , and if<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>had taken you that motor drive — well , you 'd have reached the house a perfect wreck . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, you do n't know what you are in for ! They 're all bottled up against the drawing-room window . There 's<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>— I 've seen her . There 's<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>. There 's<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, who is a minx . There 's<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>— I saw him to start with . And who would an elderly man with a moustache and a copper-coloured face be ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="454"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, possibly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="455"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I knew it . And there 's<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="456"><said who="#Margaret">“ It 's a shame to call his face copper colour , ”</said>complained<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ He has a remarkably good complexion for a man of his age . ”</said></p>
    <p n="457"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, triumphant elsewhere , could afford to concede<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>his complexion . She passed on from it to the plan of campaign that her nieces should pursue in the future .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>tried to stop her .</p>
    <p n="458"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>did not take the news quite as I expected , but the Wilcox nerve is dead in her really , so there 's no need for plans . ”</said></p>
    <p n="459"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ It 's as well to be prepared . ”</said></p>
    <p n="460"><said who="#Margaret">“ No — it 's as well not to be prepared . ”</said></p>
    <p n="461"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="462"><said who="#Margaret">“ Because — ”</said></p>
    <p n="463">Her thought drew being from the obscure borderland . She could not explain in so many words , but she felt that those who prepare for all the emergencies of life beforehand may equip themselves at the expense of joy . It is necessary to prepare for an examination , or a dinner-party , or a possible fall in the price of stock : those who attempt human relations must adopt another method , or fail .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Because I 'd sooner risk it , ”</said>was her lame conclusion .</p>
    <p n="464"><said who="#Margaret">“ But imagine the evenings , ”</said>exclaimed her aunt , pointing to the Mansions with the spout of the watering can .<said who="#Margaret">“ Turn the electric light on here or there , and it 's almost the same room . One evening they may forget to draw their blinds down , and you 'll see them ; and the next , you yours , and they 'll see you . Impossible to sit out on the balconies . Impossible to water the plants , or even speak . Imagine going out of the front-door , and they come out opposite at the same moment . And yet you tell me that plans are unnecessary , and you 'd rather risk it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="465"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I hope to risk things all my life . ”</said></p>
    <p n="466"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, most dangerous . ”</said></p>
    <p n="467"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ But after all , ”</said>she continued with a smile ,<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ there 's never any great risk as long as you have money . ”</said></p>
    <p n="468"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , shame ! What a shocking speech ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="469"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Money pads the edges of things , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ God help those who have none . ”</said></p>
    <p n="470"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ But this is something quite new ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, who collected new ideas as a squirrel collects nuts , and was especially attracted by those that are portable .</p>
    <p n="471"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ New for me ; sensible people have acknowledged it for years . You and I and the Wilcoxes stand upon money as upon islands . It is so firm beneath our feet that we forget its very existence . It 's only when we see some one near us tottering that we realise all that an independent income means . Last night , when we were talking up here round the fire , I began to think that the very soul of the world is economic , and that the lowest abyss is not the absence of love , but the absence of coin . ”</said></p>
    <p n="472"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I call that rather cynical . ”</said></p>
    <p n="473"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ So do I . But<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and I , we ought to remember , when we are tempted to criticise others , that we are standing on these islands , and that most of the others are down below the surface of the sea . The poor cannot always reach those whom they want to love , and they can hardly ever escape from those whom they love no longer . We rich can . Imagine the tragedy last June , if<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>Wilcox had been poor people , and could n't invoke railways and motor-cars to part them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="474"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ That 's more like<persName>Socialism</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>suspiciously .</p>
    <p n="475"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Call it what you like . I call it going through life with one 's hand spread open on the table . I 'm tired of these rich people who pretend to be poor , and think it shows a nice mind to ignore the piles of money that keep their feet above the waves . I stand each year upon six hundred pounds , and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>upon the same , and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>will stand upon eight , and as fast as our pounds crumble away into the sea they are renewed — from the sea , yes , from the sea . And all our thoughts are the thoughts of six-hundred-pounders , and all our speeches ; and because we do n't want to steal umbrellas ourselves , we forget that below the sea people do want to steal them and do steal them sometimes , and that what 's a joke up here is down there reality . ”</said></p>
    <p n="476"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ There they go — there goes<persName corresp="#Fraulein_Mosebach">Fraulein Mosebach</persName>. Really , for a German she does dress charmingly . Oh !— ”</said></p>
    <p n="477"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ What is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="478"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was looking up at the Wilcoxes ’ flat . ”</said></p>
    <p n="479"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Why should n't she ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="480"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I beg your pardon , I interrupted you . What was it you were saying about reality ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="481"><said who="#Margaret">“ I had worked round to myself , as usual , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>in tones that were suddenly preoccupied .</p>
    <p n="482"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Do tell me this , at all events . Are you for the rich or for the poor ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="483"><said who="#Margaret">“ Too difficult . Ask me another . Am I for poverty or for riches ? For riches . Hurrah for riches ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="484"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ For riches ! ”</said>echoed<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, having , as it were , at last secured her nut .</p>
    <p n="485"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes . For riches . Money for ever ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="486"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ So am I , and so , I am afraid , are most of my acquaintances at Swanage , but I am surprised that you agree with us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="487"><said who="#Margaret">“ Thank you so much ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>. While I have talked theories , you have done the flowers . ”</said></p>
    <p n="488"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ Not at all , dear . I wish you would let me help you in more important things . ”</said></p>
    <p n="489"><said who="#Margaret">“ Well , would you be very kind ? Would you come round with me to the registry office ? There 's a housemaid who wo n't say yes but does n't say no . ”</said></p>
    <p n="490">On their way thither they too looked up at the Wilcoxes ’ flat .<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>was in the balcony , “ staring most rudely , ” according to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>. Oh yes , it was a nuisance , there was no doubt of it .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was proof against a passing encounter , but —<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>began to lose confidence . Might it reawake the dying nerve if the family were living close against her eyes ? And<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>Mosebach was stopping with them for another fortnight , and<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>was sharp , abominably sharp , and quite capable of remarking ,<said who="#Frieda">“ You love one of the young gentlemen opposite , yes ? ”</said>The remark would be untrue , but of the kind which , if stated often enough , may become true ; just as the remark , “ England and Germany are bound to fight , ” renders war a little more likely each time that it is made , and is therefore made the more readily by the gutter press of either nation . Have the private emotions also their gutter press ?<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>thought so , and feared that good<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>and<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>were typical specimens of it . They might , by continual chatter , lead<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>into a repetition of the desires of June . Into a repetition — they could not do more ; they could not lead her into lasting love . They were — she saw it clearly — Journalism ; her father , with all his defects and wrong-headedness , had been<persName>Literature</persName>, and had he lived , he would have persuaded his daughter rightly .</p>
    <p n="491">The registry office was holding its morning reception . A string of carriages filled the street .<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>waited her turn , and finally had to be content with an insidious “ temporary , ” being rejected by genuine housemaids on the ground of her numerous stairs . Her failure depressed her , and though she forgot the failure , the depression remained . On her way home she again glanced up at the Wilcoxes ’ flat , and took the rather matronly step of speaking about the matter to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="492"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, you must tell me whether this thing worries you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="493"><said who="#Helen">“ If what ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who was washing her hands for lunch .</p>
    <p n="494"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ The Ws ’ coming . ”</said></p>
    <p n="495"><said who="#Helen">“ No , of course not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="496"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Really ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="497"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Really . ”</said>Then she admitted that she was a little worried on<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s account ; she implied that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>might reach backward into deep feelings , and be pained by things that never touched the other members of that clan .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I sha n't mind if<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>points at our house and says , ‘ There lives the girl who tried to catch me . ’ But she might . ”</said></p>
    <p n="498"><said who="#Helen">“ If even that worries you , we could arrange something . There 's no reason we should be near people who displease us or whom we displease , thanks to our money . We might even go away for a little . ”</said></p>
    <p n="499"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Well , I am going away .<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>'s just asked me to Stettin , and I sha n't be back till after the New Year . Will that do ? Or must I fly the country altogether ? Really ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, what has come over you to make such a fuss ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="500"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , I 'm getting an old maid , I suppose . I thought I minded nothing , but really I — I should be bored if you fell in love with the same man twice and ”</said>— she cleared her throat —<said who="#Margaret">“ you did go red , you know , when<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>attacked you this morning . I should n't have referred to it otherwise . ”</said></p>
    <p n="501">But<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s laugh rang true , as she raised a soapy hand to heaven and swore that never , nowhere and nohow , would she again fall in love with any of the Wilcox family , down to its remotest collaterals .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="8">
    <p n="502">The friendship between<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, which was to develop so quickly and with such strange results , may perhaps have had its beginnings at Speyer , in the spring . Perhaps the elder lady , as she gazed at the vulgar , ruddy cathedral , and listened to the talk of her husband and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, may have detected in the other and less charming of the sisters a deeper sympathy , a sounder judgment . She was capable of detecting such things . Perhaps it was she who had desired the Miss Schlegels to be invited to Howards End , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>whose presence she had particularly desired . All this is speculation ;<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>has left few clear indications behind her . It is certain that she came to call at Wickham Place a fortnight later , the very day that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was going with her cousin to Stettin .</p>
    <p n="503"><said who="#Fraulein_Mosebach">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Fraulein_Mosebach">Fraulein Mosebach</persName>in awestruck tones ( she was now in her cousin 's confidence ) —<said who="#Fraulein_Mosebach">“ his mother has forgiven you ! ”</said>And then , remembering that in England the new-comer ought not to call before she is called upon , she changed her tone from awe to disapproval , and opined that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>was keine Dame .</p>
    <p n="504"><said who="#Margaret">“ Bother the whole family ! ”</said>snapped<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, stop giggling and pirouetting , and go and finish your packing . Why can n't the woman leave us alone ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="505"><said who="#Helen">“ I do n't know what I shall do with<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, ”</said><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>retorted , collapsing upon the stairs .<said who="#Helen">“ She 's got Wilcox and Box upon the brain .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, I do n't love the young gentleman ; I do n't love the young gentleman ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>. Can a body speak plainer ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="506"><said who="#Fraulein_Mosebach">“ Most certainly her love has died , ”</said>asserted<persName corresp="#Fraulein_Mosebach">Fraulein Mosebach</persName>.</p>
    <p n="507"><said who="#Helen">“ Most certainly it has ,<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>, but that will not prevent me from being bored with the Wilcoxes if I return the call . ”</said></p>
    <p n="508">Then<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>simulated tears , and<persName corresp="#Fraulein_Mosebach">Fraulein Mosebach</persName>, who thought her extremely amusing , did the same .<said who="#Frieda">“ Oh , boo hoo ! boo hoo hoo !<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>'s going to return the call , and I can n't . ‘ Cos why ? ‘ Cos I 'm going to German-eye . ”</said></p>
    <p n="509"><said who="#Helen">“ If you are going to Germany , go and pack ; if you are n't , go and call on the Wilcoxes instead of me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="510"><said who="#Frieda">“ But ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, I do n't love the young gentleman ; I do n't love the young — O lud , who 's that coming down the stairs ? I vow ‘ tis my brother . O crimini ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="511">A male — even such a male as<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>— was enough to stop the foolery . The barrier of sex , though decreasing among the civilised , is still high , and higher on the side of women .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>could tell her sister all , and her cousin much about<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>; she told her brother nothing . It was not prudishness , for she now spoke of “ the Wilcox ideal ” with laughter , and even with a growing brutality . Nor was it precaution , for<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>seldom repeated any news that did not concern himself . It was rather the feeling that she betrayed a secret into the camp of men , and that , however trivial it was on this side of the barrier , it would become important on that . So she stopped , or rather began to fool on other subjects , until her long-suffering relatives drove her upstairs .<persName corresp="#Fraulein_Mosebach">Fraulein Mosebach</persName>followed her , but lingered to say heavily over the banisters to<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>,<said who="#Margaret">“ It is all right — she does not love the young man — he has not been worthy of her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="512"><said who="#Frieda">“ Yes , I know ; thanks very much . ”</said></p>
    <p n="513"><said who="#Margaret">“ I thought I did right to tell you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="514"><said who="#Frieda">“ Ever so many thanks . ”</said></p>
    <p n="515"><said who="#Tibby">“ What 's that ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>. No one told him , and he proceeded into the dining-room , to eat plums .</p>
    <p n="516">That evening<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>took decisive action . The house was very quiet , and the fog — we are in November now — pressed against the windows like an excluded ghost .<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and all their luggages had gone .<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, who was not feeling well , lay stretched on a sofa by the fire .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>sat by him , thinking . Her mind darted from impulse to impulse , and finally marshalled them all in review . The practical person , who knows what he wants at once , and generally knows nothing else , will accuse her of indecision . But this was the way her mind worked . And when she did act , no one could accuse her of indecision then . She hit out as lustily as if she had not considered the matter at all . The letter that she wrote<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>glowed with the native hue of resolution . The pale cast of thought was with her a breath rather than a tarnish , a breath that leaves the colours all the more vivid when it has been wiped away .</p>
    <p>“ DEAR MRS. WILCOX ,</p>
    <p n="517"><said who="#Tibby">“ I have to write something discourteous . It would be better if we did not meet . Both my sister and my aunt have given displeasure to your family , and , in my sister 's case , the grounds for displeasure might recur . So far as I know she no longer occupies her thoughts with your son . But it would not be fair , either to her or to you , if they met , and it is therefore right that our acquaintance , which began so pleasantly , should end .</said></p>
    <p n="518"><said who="#Tibby">“ I fear that you will not agree with this ; indeed , I know that you will not , since you have been good enough to call on us . It is only an instinct on my part , and no doubt the instinct is wrong . My sister would , undoubtedly , say that it is wrong . I write without her knowledge , and I hope that you will not associate her with my discourtesy .</said></p>
    <p n="519"><said who="#Tibby">“ Believe me ,</said></p>
    <p n="520"><said who="#Tibby">“ Yours truly ,</said></p>
    <p n="521"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ M. J. SCHLEGEL . ”</said></p>
    <p n="522"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>sent this letter round by the post . Next morning she received the following reply by hand :</p>
    <p>“ DEAR MISS SCHLEGEL ,</p>
    <p n="523"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ You should not have written me such a letter . I called to tell you that<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>has gone abroad .</said></p>
    <p n="524"><said who="#Margaret">“ RUTH WILCOX . ”</said></p>
    <p n="525"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s cheeks burnt . She could not finish her breakfast . She was on fire with shame .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had told her that the youth was leaving England , but other things had seemed more important , and she had forgotten . All her absurd anxieties fell to the ground , and in their place arose the certainty that she had been rude to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>. Rudeness affected<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>like a bitter taste in the mouth . It poisoned life . At times it is necessary , but woe to those who employ it without due need . She flung on a hat and shawl , just like a poor woman , and plunged into the fog , which still continued . Her lips were compressed , the letter remained in her hand , and in this state she crossed the street , entered the marble vestibule of the flats , eluded the concierges , and ran up the stairs till she reached the second floor . She sent in her name , and to her surprise was shown straight into<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s bedroom .</p>
    <p n="526"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, I have made the baddest blunder . I am more , more ashamed and sorry than I can say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="527"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>bowed gravely . She was offended , and did not pretend to the contrary . She was sitting up in bed , writing letters on an invalid table that spanned her knees . A breakfast tray was on another table beside her . The light of the fire , the light from the window , and the light of a candle-lamp , which threw a quivering halo round her hands combined to create a strange atmosphere of dissolution .</p>
    <p n="528"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I knew he was going to India in November , but I forgot . ”</said></p>
    <p n="529"><said who="#Margaret">“ He sailed on the 17th for Nigeria , in Africa . ”</said></p>
    <p n="530"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I knew — I know . I have been too absurd all through . I am very much ashamed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="531"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>did not answer .</p>
    <p n="532"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I am more sorry than I can say , and I hope that you will forgive me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="533"><said who="#Margaret">“ It does n't matter ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>. It is good of you to have come round so promptly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="534"><said who="#Margaret">“ It does matter , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ I have been rude to you ; and my sister is not even at home , so there was not even that excuse . ”</said></p>
    <p n="535"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Indeed ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="536"><said who="#Margaret">“ She has just gone to Germany . ”</said></p>
    <p n="537"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ She gone as well , ”</said>murmured the other .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Yes , certainly , it is quite safe — safe , absolutely , now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="538"><said who="#Margaret">“ You 've been worrying too ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, getting more and more excited , and taking a chair without invitation .<said who="#Margaret">“ How perfectly extraordinary ! I can see that you have . You felt as I do ;<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>must n't meet him again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="539"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I did think it best . ”</said></p>
    <p n="540"><said who="#Margaret">“ Now why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="541"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ That 's a most difficult question , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, smiling , and a little losing her expression of annoyance .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I think you put it best in your letter — it was an instinct , which may be wrong . ”</said></p>
    <p n="542"><said who="#Margaret">“ It was n't that your son still — ”</said></p>
    <p n="543"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Oh no ; he often — my<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>is very young , you see . ”</said></p>
    <p n="544"><said who="#Margaret">“ Then what was it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="545">She repeated :<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ An instinct which may be wrong . ”</said></p>
    <p n="546"><said who="#Margaret">“ In other words , they belong to types that can fall in love , but could n't live together . That 's dreadfully probable . I 'm afraid that in nine cases out of ten<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>pulls one way and human nature another . ”</said></p>
    <p n="547"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ These are indeed ‘ other words , ’ ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I had nothing so coherent in my head . I was merely alarmed when I knew that my boy cared for your sister . ”</said></p>
    <p n="548"><said who="#Margaret">“ Ah , I have always been wanting to ask you . How DID you know ?<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was so surprised when our aunt drove up , and you stepped forward and arranged things . Did<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>tell you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="549"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ There is nothing to be gained by discussing that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>after a moment 's pause .</p>
    <p n="550"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, were you very angry with us last June ? I wrote you a letter and you did n't answer it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="551"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I was certainly against taking Mrs. Matheson 's flat . I knew it was opposite your house . ”</said></p>
    <p n="552"><said who="#Margaret">“ But it 's all right now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="553"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I think so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="554"><said who="#Margaret">“ You only think ? You are n't sure ? I do love these little muddles tidied up ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="555"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Oh yes , I 'm sure , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, moving with uneasiness beneath the clothes .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I always sound uncertain over things . It is my way of speaking . ”</said></p>
    <p n="556"><said who="#Margaret">“ That 's all right , and I 'm sure , too . ”</said></p>
    <p n="557">Here the maid came in to remove the breakfast-tray . They were interrupted , and when they resumed conversation it was on more normal lines .</p>
    <p n="558"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I must say good-bye now — you will be getting up . ”</said></p>
    <p n="559"><said who="#Margaret">“ No — please stop a little longer — I am taking a day in bed . Now and then I do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="560"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I thought of you as one of the early risers . ”</said></p>
    <p n="561"><said who="#Margaret">“ At Howards End — yes ; there is nothing to get up for in London . ”</said></p>
    <p n="562"><said who="#Margaret">“ Nothing to get up for ? ”</said>cried the scandalised<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ When there are all the autumn exhibitions , and Ysaye playing in the afternoon ! Not to mention people . ”</said></p>
    <p n="563"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ The truth is , I am a little tired . First came the wedding , and then<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>went off , and , instead of resting yesterday , I paid a round of calls . ”</said></p>
    <p n="564"><said who="#Margaret">“ A wedding ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="565"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Yes ;<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, my elder son , is married . ”</said></p>
    <p n="566"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Indeed ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="567"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ We took the flat chiefly on that account , and also that<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>could get his African outfit . The flat belongs to a cousin of my husband 's , and she most kindly offered it to us . So before the day came we were able to make the acquaintance of<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s people , which we had not yet done . ”</said></p>
    <p n="568"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>asked who<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s people were .</p>
    <p n="569"><said who="#Dolly">“ Fussell . The father is in the Indian army — retired ; the brother is in the army . The mother is dead . ”</said></p>
    <p n="570">So perhaps these were the “ chinless sunburnt men ” whom<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had espied one afternoon through the window .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>felt mildly interested in the fortunes of the Wilcox family . She had acquired the habit on<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s account , and it still clung to her . She asked for more information about Miss<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>Fussell that was , and was given it in even , unemotional tones .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s voice , though sweet and compelling , had little range of expression . It suggested that pictures , concerts , and people are all of small and equal value . Only once had it quickened — when speaking of Howards End .</p>
    <p n="571"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>and Albert Fussell have known one another some time . They belong to the same club , and are both devoted to golf .<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>plays golf too , though I believe not so well ; and they first met in a mixed foursome . We all like her , and are very much pleased . They were married on the 11th , a few days before<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>sailed .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>was very anxious to have his brother as best man , so he made a great point of having it on the 11th . The Fussells would have preferred it after Christmas , but they were very nice about it . There is<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s photograph — in that double frame . ”</said></p>
    <p n="572"><said who="#Dolly">“ Are you quite certain that I 'm not interrupting ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="573"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Yes , quite . ”</said></p>
    <p n="574"><said who="#Dolly">“ Then I will stay . I 'm enjoying this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="575"><persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s photograph was now examined . It was signed “ For dear Mims , ” which<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>interpreted as “ the name she and<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>had settled that she should call me . ”<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>looked silly , and had one of those triangular faces that so often prove attractive to a robust man . She was very pretty . From her<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>passed to<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, whose features prevailed opposite . She speculated on the forces that had drawn the two together till God parted them . She found time to hope that they would be happy .</p>
    <p n="576"><said who="#Margaret">“ They have gone to Naples for their honeymoon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="577"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Lucky people ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="578"><said who="#Margaret">“ I can hardly imagine<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>in Italy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="579"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Does n't he care for travelling ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="580"><said who="#Margaret">“ He likes travel , but he does see through foreigners so . What he enjoys most is a motor tour in England , and I think that would have carried the day if the weather had not been so abominable . His father gave him a car for a wedding present , which for the present is being stored at Howards End . ”</said></p>
    <p n="581"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I suppose you have a garage there ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="582"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes . My husband built a little one only last month , to the west of the house , not far from the wych-elm , in what used to be the paddock for the pony . ”</said></p>
    <p n="583">The last words had an indescribable ring about them .</p>
    <p n="584"><said who="#Margaret">“ Where 's the pony gone ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>after a pause .</p>
    <p n="585"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ The pony ? Oh , dead , ever so long ago . ”</said></p>
    <p n="586"><said who="#Margaret">“ The wych-elm I remember .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>spoke of it as a very splendid tree . ”</said></p>
    <p n="587"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ It is the finest wych-elm in Hertfordshire . Did your sister tell you about the teeth ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="588"><said who="#Margaret">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="589"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Oh , it might interest you . There are pigs ’ teeth stuck into the trunk , about four feet from the ground . The country people put them in long ago , and they think that if they chew a piece of the bark , it will cure the toothache . The teeth are almost grown over now , and no one comes to the tree . ”</said></p>
    <p n="590"><said who="#Margaret">“ I should . I love folklore and all festering superstitions . ”</said></p>
    <p n="591"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Do you think that the tree really did cure toothache , if one believed in it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="592"><said who="#Margaret">“ Of course it did . It would cure anything — once . ”</said></p>
    <p n="593"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Certainly I remember cases — you see I lived at Howards End long , long before<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>knew it . I was born there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="594">The conversation again shifted . At the time it seemed little more than aimless chatter . She was interested when her hostess explained that Howards End was her own property . She was bored when too minute an account was given of the Fussell family , of the anxieties of<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>concerning Naples , of the movements of<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>and<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, who were motoring in Yorkshire .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>could not bear being bored . She grew inattentive , played with the photograph frame , dropped it , smashed<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s glass , apologised , was pardoned , cut her finger thereon , was pitied , and finally said she must be going — there was all the housekeeping to do , and she had to interview<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>'s riding-master .</p>
    <p n="595">Then the curious note was struck again .</p>
    <p n="596"><said who="#Tibby">“ Good-bye ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, good-bye . Thank you for coming . You have cheered me up . ”</said></p>
    <p n="597"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ I 'm so glad ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="598"><said who="#Tibby">“ I — I wonder whether you ever think about yourself ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="599"><said who="#Margaret">“ I think of nothing else , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, blushing , but letting her hand remain in that of the invalid .</p>
    <p n="600"><said who="#Tibby">“ I wonder . I wondered at Heidelberg . ”</said></p>
    <p n="601"><said who="#Margaret">“ I 'M sure ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="602"><said who="#Tibby">“ I almost think — ”</said></p>
    <p n="603"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, for there was a long pause — a pause that was somehow akin to the flicker of the fire , the quiver of the reading-lamp upon their hands , the white blur from the window ; a pause of shifting and eternal shadows .</p>
    <p n="604"><said who="#Tibby">“ I almost think you forget you 're a girl . ”</said></p>
    <p n="605"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was startled and a little annoyed .<said who="#Margaret">“ I 'm twenty-nine , ”</said>she remarked .<said who="#Margaret">“ That 's not so wildly girlish . ”</said></p>
    <p n="606"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>smiled .</p>
    <p n="607"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ What makes you say that ? Do you mean that I have been gauche and rude ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="608">A shake of the head .<said who="#Margaret">“ I only meant that I am fifty-one , and that to me both of you — Read it all in some book or other ; I cannot put things clearly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="609"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Oh , I 've got it — inexperience . I 'm no better than<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, you mean , and yet I presume to advise her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="610"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes . You have got it . Inexperience is the word . ”</said></p>
    <p n="611"><said who="#Margaret">“ Inexperience , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, in serious yet buoyant tones .</p>
    <p n="612"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Of course , I have everything to learn — absolutely everything — just as much as<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. Life 's very difficult and full of surprises . At all events , I 've got as far as that . To be humble and kind , to go straight ahead , to love people rather than pity them , to remember the submerged — well , one can n't do all these things at once , worse luck , because they 're so contradictory . It 's then that proportion comes in — to live by proportion . Do n't BEGIN with proportion . Only prigs do that . Let proportion come in as a last resource , when the better things have failed , and a deadlock — Gracious me , I 've started preaching ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="613"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Indeed , you put the difficulties of life splendidly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, withdrawing her hand into the deeper shadows .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ It is just what I should have liked to say about them myself . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="9">
    <p n="614"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>cannot be accused of giving<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>much information about life . And<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, on the other hand , has made a fair show of modesty , and has pretended to an inexperience that she certainly did not feel . She had kept house for over ten years ; she had entertained , almost with distinction ; she had brought up a charming sister , and was bringing up a brother . Surely , if experience is attainable , she had attained it . Yet the little luncheon-party that she gave in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s honour was not a success . The new friend did not blend with the “ one or two delightful people ” who had been asked to meet her , and the atmosphere was one of polite bewilderment . Her tastes were simple , her knowledge of culture slight , and she was not interested in the New English<persName corresp="#Art">Art</persName>Club , nor in the dividing-line between Journalism and<persName>Literature</persName>, which was started as a conversational hare . The delightful people darted after it with cries of joy ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>leading them , and not till the meal was half over did they realise that the principal guest had taken no part in the chase . There was no common topic .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, whose life had been spent in the service of husband and sons , had little to say to strangers who had never shared it , and whose age was half her own . Clever talk alarmed her , and withered her delicate imaginings ; it was the social counterpart of a motor-car , all jerks , and she was a wisp of hay , a flower . Twice she deplored the weather , twice criticised the train service on the Great Northern Railway . They vigorously assented , and rushed on , and when she inquired whether there was any news of<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, her hostess was too much occupied in placing Rothenstein to answer . The question was repeated :<said who="#Margaret">“ I hope that your sister is safe in Germany by now . ”</said><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>checked herself and said ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , thank you ; I heard on Tuesday . ”</said>But the demon of vociferation was in her , and the next moment she was off again .</p>
    <p n="615"><said who="#Helen">“ Only on Tuesday , for they live right away at Stettin . Did you ever know any one living at Stettin ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="616"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Never , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>gravely , while her neighbour , a young man low down in the Education Office , began to discuss what people who lived at Stettin ought to look like . Was there such a thing as Stettininity ?<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>swept on .</p>
    <p n="617"><said who="#Helen">“ People at Stettin drop things into boats out of overhanging warehouses . At least , our cousins do , but are n't particularly rich . The town is n't interesting , except for a clock that rolls its eyes , and the view of the Oder , which truly is something special . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, you would love the Oder ! The river , or rather rivers — there seem to be dozens of them — are intense blue , and the plain they run through an intensest green . ”</said></p>
    <p n="618"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Indeed ! That sounds like a most beautiful view ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="619"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ So I say , but<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who will muddle things , says no , it 's like music . The course of the Oder is to be like music . It 's obliged to remind her of a symphonic poem . The part by the landing-stage is in B minor , if I remember rightly , but lower down things get extremely mixed . There is a slodgy theme in several keys at once , meaning mud-banks , and another for the navigable canal , and the exit into the Baltic is in C sharp major , pianissimo . ”</said></p>
    <p n="620"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ What do the overhanging warehouses make of that ? ”</said>asked the man , laughing .</p>
    <p n="621"><said who="#Margaret">“ They make a great deal of it , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, unexpectedly rushing off on a new track .<said who="#Margaret">“ I think it 's affectation to compare the Oder to music , and so do you , but the overhanging warehouses of Stettin take beauty seriously , which we do n't , and the average Englishman does n't , and despises all who do . Now do n't say ‘ Germans have no taste , ’ or I shall scream . They have n't . But — but — such a tremendous but !— they take poetry seriously . They do take poetry seriously . ”</said></p>
    <p n="622"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Is anything gained by that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="623"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , yes . The German is always on the lookout for beauty . He may miss it through stupidity , or misinterpret it , but he is always asking beauty to enter his life , and I believe that in the end it will come . At Heidelberg I met a fat veterinary surgeon whose voice broke with sobs as he repeated some mawkish poetry . So easy for me to laugh — I , who never repeat poetry , good or bad , and cannot remember one fragment of verse to thrill myself with . My blood boils — well , I ‘ m half German , so put it down to patriotism — when I listen to the tasteful contempt of the average islander for things Teutonic , whether they 're Bocklin or my veterinary surgeon . ‘ Oh , Bocklin , ’ they say ; ‘ he strains after beauty , he peoples<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>with gods too consciously . ’ Of course Bocklin strains , because he wants something — beauty and all the other intangible gifts that are floating about the world . So his landscapes do n't come off , and Leader 's do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="624"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I am not sure that I agree . Do you ? ”</said>said he , turning to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>.</p>
    <p n="625">She replied : “ I think<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>puts everything splendidly ; ” and a chill fell on the conversation .</p>
    <p n="626"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, say something nicer than that . It 's such a snub to be told you put things splendidly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="627"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I do not mean it as a snub . Your last speech interested me so much . Generally people do not seem quite to like Germany . I have long wanted to hear what is said on the other side . ”</said></p>
    <p n="628"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ The other side ? Then you do disagree . Oh , good ! Give us your side . ”</said></p>
    <p n="629"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I have no side . But my husband ”</said>— her voice softened , the chill increased —<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ has very little faith in the Continent , and our children have all taken after him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="630"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ On what grounds ? Do they feel that the Continent is in bad form ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="631"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>had no idea ; she paid little attention to grounds . She was not intellectual , nor even alert , and it was odd that , all the same , she should give the idea of greatness .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, zigzagging with her friends over Thought and<persName corresp="#Art">Art</persName>, was conscious of a personality that transcended their own and dwarfed their activities . There was no bitterness in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>; there was not even criticism ; she was lovable , and no ungracious or uncharitable word had passed her lips . Yet she and daily life were out of focus ; one or the other must show blurred . And at lunch she seemed more out of focus than usual , and nearer the line that divides daily life from a life that may be of greater importance .</p>
    <p n="632"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ You will admit , though , that the Continent — it seems silly to speak of ‘ the Continent , ’ but really it is all more like itself than any part of it is like England . England is unique . Do have another jelly first . I was going to say that the Continent , for good or for evil , is interested in ideas . Its<persName>Literature</persName>and<persName corresp="#Art">Art</persName>have what one might call the kink of the unseen about them , and this persists even through decadence and affectation . There is more liberty of action in England , but for liberty of thought go to bureaucratic Prussia . People will there discuss with humility vital questions that we here think ourselves too good to touch with tongs . ”</said></p>
    <p n="633"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I do not want to go to Prussia , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>“ not even to see that interesting view that you were describing . And for discussing with humility I am too old . We never discuss anything at Howards End . ”</p>
    <p n="634"><said who="#Margaret">“ Then you ought to ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Discussion keeps a house alive . It cannot stand by bricks and mortar alone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="635"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ It cannot stand without them , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, unexpectedly catching on to the thought , and rousing , for the first and last time , a faint hope in the breasts of the delightful people .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ It cannot stand without them , and I sometimes think — But I cannot expect your generation to agree , for even my daughter disagrees with me here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="636"><said who="#Margaret">“ Never mind us or her . Do say ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="637"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I sometimes think that it is wiser to leave action and discussion to men . ”</said></p>
    <p n="638">There was a little silence .</p>
    <p n="639"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ One admits that the arguments against the suffrage ARE extraordinarily strong , ”</said>said a girl opposite , leaning forward and crumbling her bread .</p>
    <p n="640"><said who="#Margaret">“ Are they ? I never follow any arguments . I am only too thankful not to have a vote myself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="641"><said who="#Margaret">“ We did n't mean the vote , though , did we ? ”</said>supplied<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Are n't we differing on something much wider ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>? Whether women are to remain what they have been since the dawn of history ; or whether , since men have moved forward so far , they too may move forward a little now . I say they may . I would even admit a biological change . ”</said></p>
    <p n="642"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I do n't know , I do n't know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="643"><said who="#Margaret">“ I must be getting back to my overhanging warehouse , ”</said>said the man .<said who="#Margaret">“ They 've turned disgracefully strict . ”</said></p>
    <p n="644"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>also rose .</p>
    <p n="645"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Oh , but come upstairs for a little . Miss Quested plays . Do you like MacDowell ? Do you mind his only having two noises ? If you must really go , I 'll see you out . Wo n't you even have coffee ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="646">They left the dining-room closing the door behind them , and as<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>buttoned up her jacket , she said :<said who="#Margaret">“ What an interesting life you all lead in London ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="647"><said who="#Margaret">“ No , we do n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, with a sudden revulsion .<said who="#Margaret">“ We lead the lives of gibbering monkeys .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>— really — We have something quiet and stable at the bottom . We really have . All my friends have . Do n't pretend you enjoyed lunch , for you loathed it , but forgive me by coming again , alone , or by asking me to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="648"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I am used to young people , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, and with each word she spoke the outlines of known things grew dim .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I hear a great deal of chatter at home , for we , like you , entertain a great deal . With us it is more sport and politics , but — I enjoyed my lunch very much ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, dear , and am not pretending , and only wish I could have joined in more . For one thing , I 'm not particularly well just to-day . For another , you younger people move so quickly that it dazes me .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>is the same ,<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>the same . But we are all in the same boat , old and young . I never forget that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="649">They were silent for a moment . Then , with a newborn emotion , they shook hands . The conversation ceased suddenly when<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>re-entered the dining-room ; her friends had been talking over her new friend , and had dismissed her as uninteresting .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="10">
    <p n="650">Was<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>one of the unsatisfactory people — there are many of them — who dangle intimacy and then withdraw it ? They evoke our interests and affections , and keep the life of the spirit dawdling round them . Then they withdraw . When physical passion is involved , there is a definite name for such behaviour — flirting — and if carried far enough it is punishable by law . But no law — not public opinion even — punishes those who coquette with friendship , though the dull ache that they inflict , the sense of misdirected effort and exhaustion , may be as intolerable . Was she one of these ?</p>
    <p n="651"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>feared so at first , for , with a Londoner 's impatience , she wanted everything to be settled up immediately . She mistrusted the periods of quiet that are essential to true growth . Desiring to book<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>as a friend , she pressed on the ceremony , pencil , as it were , in hand , pressing the more because the rest of the family were away , and the opportunity seemed favourable . But the elder woman would not be hurried . She refused to fit in with the Wickham Place set , or to reopen discussion of<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>, whom<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>would have utilised as a short-cut . She took her time , or perhaps let time take her , and when the crisis did come all was ready .</p>
    <p n="652">The crisis opened with a message : Would<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>come shopping ? Christmas was nearing , and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>felt behindhand with the presents . She had taken some more days in bed , and must make up for lost time .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>accepted , and at eleven o'clock one cheerless morning they started out in a brougham .</p>
    <p n="653"><said who="#Margaret">“ First of all , ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>,<said who="#Margaret">“ we must make a list and tick off the people 's names . My aunt always does , and this fog may thicken up any moment . Have you any ideas ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="654"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I thought we would go to Harrods or the Haymarket Stores , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>rather hopelessly .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Everything is sure to be there . I am not a good shopper . The din is so confusing , and your aunt is quite right — one ought to make a list . Take my notebook , then , and write your own name at the top of the page .</said></p>
    <p n="655"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , hooray ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, writing it .<said who="#Margaret">“ How very kind of you to start with me ! ”</said>But she did not want to receive anything expensive . Their acquaintance was singular rather than intimate , and she divined that the Wilcox clan would resent any expenditure on outsiders ; the more compact families do . She did not want to be thought a second<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who would snatch presents since she could not snatch young men , nor to be exposed like a second<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, to the insults of<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. A certain austerity of demeanour was best , and she added :<said who="#Margaret">“ I do n't really want a Yuletide gift , though . In fact , I 'd rather not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="656"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="657"><said who="#Margaret">“ Because I 've odd ideas about Christmas . Because I have all that money can buy . I want more people , but no more things . ”</said></p>
    <p n="658"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I should like to give you something worth your acquaintance ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, in memory of your kindness to me during my lonely fortnight . It has so happened that I have been left alone , and you have stopped me from brooding . I am too apt to brood . ”</said></p>
    <p n="659"><said who="#Margaret">“ If that is so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>,<said who="#Margaret">“ if I have happened to be of use to you , which I did n't know , you cannot pay me back with anything tangible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="660"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I suppose not , but one would like to . Perhaps I shall think of something as we go about . ”</said></p>
    <p n="661">Her name remained at the head of the list , but nothing was written opposite it . They drove from shop to shop . The air was white , and when they alighted it tasted like cold pennies . At times they passed through a clot of grey .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s vitality was low that morning , and it was<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>who decided on a horse for this little girl , a golliwog for that , for the rector 's wife a copper warming-tray .<said who="#Margaret">“ We always give the servants money . ”</said>“ Yes , do you , yes , much easier , ” replied<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>but felt the grotesque impact of the unseen upon the seen , and saw issuing from a forgotten manger at Bethlehem this torrent of coins and toys . Vulgarity reigned . Public-houses , besides their usual exhortation against temperance reform , invited men to “ Join our Christmas goose club ” — one bottle of gin , etc ., or two , according to subscription . A poster of a woman in tights heralded the Christmas pantomime , and little red devils , who had come in again that year , were prevalent upon the Christmas-cards .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was no morbid idealist . She did not wish this spate of business and self-advertisement checked . It was only the occasion of it that struck her with amazement annually . How many of these vacillating shoppers and tired shop-assistants realised that it was a divine event that drew them together ? She realised it , though standing outside in the matter . She was not a Christian in the accepted sense ; she did not believe that God had ever worked among us as a young artisan . These people , or most of them , believed it , and if pressed , would affirm it in words . But the visible signs of their belief were Regent Street or Drury Lane , a little mud displaced , a little money spent , a little food cooked , eaten , and forgotten . Inadequate . But in public who shall express the unseen adequately ? It is private life that holds out the mirror to infinity ; personal intercourse , and that alone , that ever hints at a personality beyond our daily vision .</p>
    <p n="662"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ No , I do like Christmas on the whole , ”</said>she announced .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ In its clumsy way , it does approach Peace and Goodwill . But oh , it is clumsier every year . ”</said></p>
    <p n="663"><said who="#Margaret">“ Is it ? I am only used to country Christmases . ”</said></p>
    <p n="664"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ We are usually in London , and play the game with vigour — carols at the Abbey , clumsy midday meal , clumsy dinner for the maids , followed by Christmas-tree and dancing of poor children , with songs from<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. The drawing-room does very well for that . We put the tree in the powder-closet , and draw a curtain when the candles are lighted , and with the looking-glass behind it looks quite pretty . I wish we might have a powder-closet in our next house . Of course , the tree has to be very small , and the presents do n't hang on it . No ; the presents reside in a sort of rocky landscape made of crumpled brown paper . ”</said></p>
    <p n="665"><said who="#Margaret">“ You spoke of your ‘ next house , ’<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>. Then are you leaving Wickham Place ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="666"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Yes , in two or three years , when the lease expires . We must . ”</said></p>
    <p n="667"><said who="#Margaret">“ Have you been there long ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="668"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ All our lives . ”</said></p>
    <p n="669"><said who="#Margaret">“ You will be very sorry to leave it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="670"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I suppose so . We scarcely realise it yet . My father — ”</said>She broke off , for they had reached the stationery department of the Haymarket Stores , and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>wanted to order some private greeting cards .</p>
    <p n="671"><said who="#Margaret">“ If possible , something distinctive , ”</said>she sighed . At the counter she found a friend , bent on the same errand , and conversed with her insipidly , wasting much time .<said who="#Margaret">“ My husband and our daughter are motoring . ”</said><said who="#Margaret">“ Bertha , too ? Oh , fancy , what a coincidence ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="672"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, though not practical , could shine in such company as this . While they talked , she went through a volume of specimen cards , and submitted one for<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s inspection .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>was delighted — so original , words so sweet ; she would order a hundred like that , and could never be sufficiently grateful . Then , just as the assistant was booking the order , she said :<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Do you know , I 'll wait . On second thoughts , I 'll wait . There 's plenty of time still , is n't there , and I shall be able to get<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s opinion . ”</said></p>
    <p n="673">They returned to the carriage by devious paths ; when they were in , she said ,<said who="#Margaret">“ But could n't you get it renewed ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="674"><said who="#Margaret">“ I beg your pardon ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="675"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ The lease , I mean . ”</said></p>
    <p n="676"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , the lease ! Have you been thinking of that all the time ? How very kind of you ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="677"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Surely something could be done . ”</said></p>
    <p n="678"><said who="#Margaret">“ No ; values have risen too enormously . They mean to pull down Wickham Place , and build flats like yours . ”</said></p>
    <p n="679"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ But how horrible ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="680"><said who="#Margaret">“ Landlords are horrible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="681">Then she said vehemently :<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ It is monstrous ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>; it is n't right . I had no idea that this was hanging over you . I do pity you from the bottom of my heart . To be parted from your house , your father 's house — it ought n't to be allowed . It is worse than dying . I would rather die than — Oh , poor girls ! Can what they call civilisation be right , if people may n't die in the room where they were born ? My dear , I am so sorry . ”</said></p>
    <p n="682"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>did not know what to say .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>had been overtired by the shopping , and was inclined to hysteria .</p>
    <p n="683"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Howards End was nearly pulled down once . It would have killed me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="684"><said who="#Margaret">“ I — Howards End must be a very different house to ours . We are fond of ours , but there is nothing distinctive about it . As you saw , it is an ordinary London house . We shall easily find another . ”</said></p>
    <p n="685"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ So you think . ”</said></p>
    <p n="686"><said who="#Margaret">“ Again my lack of experience , I suppose ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, easing away from the subject .<said who="#Margaret">“ I can n't say anything when you take up that line ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>. I wish I could see myself as you see me — foreshortened into a backfisch . Quite the ingenue . Very charming — wonderfully well read for my age , but incapable — ”</said></p>
    <p n="687"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>would not be deterred .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Come down with me to Howards End now , ”</said>she said , more vehemently than ever .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I want you to see it . You have never seen it . I want to hear what you say about it , for you do put things so wonderfully . ”</said></p>
    <p n="688"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>glanced at the pitiless air and then at the tired face of her companion .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Later on I should love it , ”</said>she continued ,<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ but it 's hardly the weather for such an expedition , and we ought to start when we 're fresh . Is n't the house shut up , too ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="689">She received no answer .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>appeared to be annoyed .</p>
    <p n="690"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Might I come some other day ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="691"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>bent forward and tapped the glass .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Back to Wickham Place , please ! ”</said>was her order to the coachman .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had been snubbed .</p>
    <p n="692"><said who="#Margaret">“ A thousand thanks ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, for all your help . ”</said></p>
    <p n="693"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Not at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="694"><said who="#Margaret">“ It is such a comfort to get the presents off my mind — the Christmas-cards especially . I do admire your choice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="695">It was her turn to receive no answer . In her turn<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>became annoyed .</p>
    <p n="696"><said who="#Margaret">“ My husband and<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>will be back the day after to-morrow . That is why I dragged you out shopping to-day . I stayed in town chiefly to shop , but got through nothing , and now he writes that they must cut their tour short , the weather is so bad , and the police-traps have been so bad — nearly as bad as in Surrey . Ours is such a careful chauffeur , and my husband feels it particularly hard that they should be treated like road-hogs . ”</said></p>
    <p n="697"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="698"><said who="#Margaret">“ Well , naturally he — he is n't a road-hog . ”</said></p>
    <p n="699"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ He was exceeding the speed-limit , I conclude . He must expect to suffer with the lower animals . ”</said></p>
    <p n="700"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>was silenced . In growing discomfort they drove homewards . The city seemed Satanic , the narrower streets oppressing like the galleries of a mine .</p>
    <p n="701">No harm was done by the fog to trade , for it lay high , and the lighted windows of the shops were thronged with customers . It was rather a darkening of the spirit which fell back upon itself , to find a more grievous darkness within .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>nearly spoke a dozen times , but something throttled her . She felt petty and awkward , and her meditations on Christmas grew more cynical . Peace ? It may bring other gifts , but is there a single Londoner to whom Christmas is peaceful ? The craving for excitement and for elaboration has ruined that blessing . Goodwill ? Had she seen any example of it in the hordes of purchasers ? Or in herself ? She had failed to respond to this invitation merely because it was a little queer and imaginative — she , whose birthright it was to nourish imagination ! Better to have accepted , to have tired themselves a little by the journey , than coldly to reply ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Might I come some other day ? ”</said>Her cynicism left her . There would be no other day . This shadowy woman would never ask her again .</p>
    <p n="702">They parted at the Mansions .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>went in after due civilities , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>watched the tall , lonely figure sweep up the hall to the lift . As the glass doors closed on it she had the sense of an imprisonment The beautiful head disappeared first , still buried in the muff ; the long trailing skirt followed . A woman of undefinable rarity was going up heavenward , like a specimen in a bottle . And into what a heaven — a vault as of hell , sooty black , from which soot descended !</p>
    <p n="703">At lunch her brother , seeing her inclined for silence insisted on talking .<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was not ill-natured , but from babyhood something drove him to do the unwelcome and the unexpected . Now he gave her a long account of the day-school that he sometimes patronised . The account was interesting , and she had often pressed him for it before , but she could not attend now , for her mind was focussed on the invisible . She discerned that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, though a loving wife and mother , had only one passion in life — her house — and that the moment was solemn when she invited a friend to share this passion with her . To answer “ another day ” was to answer as a fool . “ Another day ” will do for brick and mortar , but not for the Holy of Holies into which Howards End had been transfigured . Her own curiosity was slight . She had heard more than enough about it in the summer . The nine windows , the vine , and the wych-elm had no pleasant connections for her , and she would have preferred to spend the afternoon at a concert . But imagination triumphed . While her brother held forth she determined to go , at whatever cost , and to compel<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>to go , too . When lunch was over she stepped over to the flats .</p>
    <p n="704"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>had just gone away for the night .</p>
    <p n="705"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>said that it was of no consequence , hurried downstairs , and took a hansom to King 's Cross . She was convinced that the escapade was important , though it would have puzzled her to say why . There was question of imprisonment and escape , and though she did not know the time of the train , she strained her eyes for St. Pancras 's clock .</p>
    <p n="706">Then the clock of King 's Cross swung into sight , a second moon in that infernal sky , and her cab drew up at the station . There was a train for Hilton in five minutes . She took a ticket , asking in her agitation for a single . As she did so , a grave and happy voice saluted her and thanked her .</p>
    <p n="707"><said who="#Margaret">“ I will come if I still may , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, laughing nervously .</p>
    <p n="708"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ You are coming to sleep , dear , too . It is in the morning that my house is most beautiful . You are coming to stop . I cannot show you my meadow properly except at sunrise . These fogs ”</said>— she pointed at the station roof —<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ never spread far . I dare say they are sitting in the sun in Hertfordshire , and you will never repent joining them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="709"><said who="#Margaret">“ I shall never repent joining you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="710"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ It is the same . ”</said></p>
    <p n="711">They began the walk up the long platform . Far at its end stood the train , breasting the darkness without . They never reached it . Before imagination could triumph , there were cries of “ Mother ! mother ! ” and a heavy-browed girl darted out of the cloak-room and seized<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>by the arm .</p>
    <p n="712"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>! ”</said>she gasped —<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, my pet — ”</said></p>
    <p n="713">The girl called ,<said who="#Evie">“ Father ! I say ! look who 's here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="714"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, dearest girl , why are n't you in Yorkshire ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="715"><said who="#Evie">“ No — motor smash — changed plans — father 's coming . ”</said></p>
    <p n="716"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Why ,<persName corresp="#Ruth">Ruth</persName>! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, joining them ,<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ what in the name of all that 's wonderful are you doing here ,<persName corresp="#Ruth">Ruth</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="717"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>had recovered herself .</p>
    <p n="718"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>dear !— here 's a lovely surprise — but let me introduce — but I think you know<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="719"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Oh yes , ”</said>he replied , not greatly interested .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ But how 's yourself ,<persName corresp="#Ruth">Ruth</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="720"><said who="#Ruth">“ Fit as a fiddle , ”</said>she answered gaily .</p>
    <p n="721"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ So are we , and so was our car , which ran A1 as far as Ripon , but there a wretched horse and cart which a fool of a driver — ”</said></p>
    <p n="722"><said who="#Ruth">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, our little outing must be for another day . ”</said></p>
    <p n="723"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ I was saying that this fool of a driver , as the policeman himself admits . ”</said></p>
    <p n="724"><said who="#Ruth">“ Another day ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>. Of course . ”</said></p>
    <p n="725"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ — But as we 've insured against third party risks , it wo n't so much matter — ”</said></p>
    <p n="726"><said who="#Ruth">“ — Cart and car being practically at right angles — ”</said></p>
    <p n="727">The voices of the happy family rose high .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was left alone . No one wanted her .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>walked out of King 's Cross between her husband and her daughter , listening to both of them .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="11">
    <p n="728">The funeral was over . The carriages had rolled away through the soft mud , and only the poor remained . They approached to the newly-dug shaft and looked their last at the coffin , now almost hidden beneath the spadefuls of clay . It was their moment . Most of them were women from the dead woman 's district , to whom black garments had been served out by<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>'s orders . Pure curiosity had brought others . They thrilled with the excitement of a death , and of a rapid death , and stood in groups or moved between the graves , like drops of ink . The son of one of them , a wood-cutter , was perched high above their heads , pollarding one of the churchyard elms . From where he sat he could see the village of Hilton , strung upon the North Road , with its accreting suburbs ; the sunset beyond , scarlet and orange , winking at him beneath brows of grey ; the church ; the plantations ; and behind him an unspoilt country of fields and farms . But he , too , was rolling the event luxuriously in his mouth . He tried to tell his mother down below all that he had felt when he saw the coffin approaching : how he could not leave his work , and yet did not like to go on with it ; how he had almost slipped out of the tree , he was so upset ; the rooks had cawed , and no wonder — it was as if rooks knew too . His mother claimed the prophetic power herself — she had seen a strange look about<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>for some time . London had done the mischief , said others . She had been a kind lady ; her grandmother had been kind , too — a plainer person , but very kind . Ah , the old sort was dying out !<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, he was a kind gentleman . They advanced to the topic again and again , dully , but with exaltation . The funeral of a rich person was to them what the funeral of Alcestis or Ophelia is to the educated . It was<persName corresp="#Art">Art</persName>; though remote from life , it enhanced life 's values , and they witnessed it avidly .</p>
    <p n="729">The grave-diggers , who had kept up an undercurrent of disapproval — they disliked<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>; it was not a moment to speak of such things , but they did not like<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles Wilcox</persName>— the grave-diggers finished their work and piled up the wreaths and crosses above it . The sun set over Hilton ; the grey brows of the evening flushed a little , and were cleft with one scarlet frown . Chattering sadly to each other , the mourners passed through the lych-gate and traversed the chestnut avenues that led down to the village . The young wood-cutter stayed a little longer , poised above the silence and swaying rhythmically . At last the bough fell beneath his saw . With a grunt , he descended , his thoughts dwelling no longer on death , but on love , for he was mating . He stopped as he passed the new grave ; a sheaf of tawny chrysanthemums had caught his eye .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ They did n't ought to have coloured flowers at buryings , ”</said>he reflected . Trudging on a few steps , he stopped again , looked furtively at the dusk , turned back , wrenched a chrysanthemum from the sheaf , and hid it in his pocket .</p>
    <p n="730">After him came silence absolute . The cottage that abutted on the churchyard was empty , and no other house stood near . Hour after hour the scene of the interment remained without an eye to witness it . Clouds drifted over it from the west ; or the church may have been a ship , high-prowed , steering with all its company towards infinity . Towards morning the air grew colder , the sky clearer , the surface of the earth hard and sparkling above the prostrate dead . The wood-cutter , returning after a night of joy , reflected :<said who="#Art">“ They lilies , they chrysants ; it 's a pity I did n't take them all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="731">Up at Howards End they were attempting breakfast .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>sat in the dining-room , with Mrs.<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. Their father , who could not bear to see a face , breakfasted upstairs . He suffered acutely . Pain came over him in spasms , as if it was physical , and even while he was about to eat , his eyes would fill with tears , and he would lay down the morsel untasted .</p>
    <p n="732">He remembered his wife 's even goodness during thirty years . Not anything in detail — not courtship or early raptures — but just the unvarying virtue , that seemed to him a woman 's noblest quality . So many women are capricious , breaking into odd flaws of passion or frivolity . Not so his wife . Year after year , summer and winter , as bride and mother , she had been the same , he had always trusted her . Her tenderness ! Her innocence ! The wonderful innocence that was hers by the gift of God .<persName corresp="#Ruth">Ruth</persName>knew no more of worldly wickedness and wisdom than did the flowers in her garden , or the grass in her field . Her idea of business —<said who="#Ruth">“<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, why do people who have enough money try to get more money ? ”</said>Her idea of politics — “ I am sure that if the mothers of various nations could meet , there would be no more wars , ” Her idea of religion — ah , this had been a cloud , but a cloud that passed . She came of Quaker stock , and he and his family , formerly Dissenters , were now members of the Church of England . The rector 's sermons had at first repelled her , and she had expressed a desire for “ a more inward light , ” adding , “ not so much for myself as for baby ” (<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>) . Inward light must have been granted , for he heard no complaints in later years . They brought up their three children without dispute . They had never disputed .</p>
    <p n="733">She lay under the earth now . She had gone , and as if to make her going the more bitter , had gone with a touch of mystery that was all unlike her .<said who="#Henry">“ Why did n't you tell me you knew of it ? ”</said>he had moaned , and her faint voice had answered :<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I did n't want to ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>— I might have been wrong — and every one hates illnesses . ”</said>He had been told of the horror by a strange doctor , whom she had consulted during his absence from town . Was this altogether just ? Without fully explaining , she had died . It was a fault on her part , and — tears rushed into his eyes — what a little fault ! It was the only time she had deceived him in those thirty years .</p>
    <p n="734">He rose to his feet and looked out of the window , for<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>had come in with the letters , and he could meet no one 's eye . Ah yes — she had been a good woman — she had been steady . He chose the word deliberately . To him steadiness included all praise . He himself , gazing at the wintry garden , is in appearance a steady man . His face was not as square as his son 's , and , indeed , the chin , though firm enough in outline , retreated a little , and the lips , ambiguous , were curtained by a moustache . But there was no external hint of weakness . The eyes , if capable of kindness and good-fellowship , if ruddy for the moment with tears , were the eyes of one who could not be driven . The forehead , too , was like<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s . High and straight , brown and polished , merging abruptly into temples and skull , it had the effect of a bastion that protected his head from the world . At times it had the effect of a blank wall . He had dwelt behind it , intact and happy , for fifty years .<said who="#Evie">“ The post 's come , father , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>awkwardly .</p>
    <p n="735"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Thanks . Put it down . ”</said></p>
    <p n="736"><said who="#Evie">“ Has the breakfast been all right ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="737"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Yes , thanks . ”</said></p>
    <p n="738">The girl glanced at him and at it with constraint . She did not know what to do .</p>
    <p n="739"><said who="#Evie">“<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>says do you want the Times ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="740"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ No , I 'll read it later . ”</said></p>
    <p n="741"><said who="#Evie">“ Ring if you want anything , father , wo n't you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="742"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I 've all I want . ”</said></p>
    <p n="743">Having sorted the letters from the circulars , she went back to the dining-room .</p>
    <p n="744"><said who="#Evie">“ Father 's eaten nothing , ”</said>she announced , sitting down with wrinkled brows behind the tea-urn .</p>
    <p n="745"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>did not answer , but after a moment he ran quickly upstairs , opened the door , and said “ Look here father , you must eat , you know ; ” and having paused for a reply that did not come , stole down again .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ He 's going to read his letters first , I think , ”</said>he said evasively ;<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I dare say he will go on with his breakfast afterwards . ”</said>Then he took up the Times , and for some time there was no sound except the clink of cup against saucer and of knife on plate .</p>
    <p n="746">Poor Mrs.<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>sat between her silent companions terrified at the course of events , and a little bored . She was a rubbishy little creature , and she knew it . A telegram had dragged her from Naples to the death-bed of a woman whom she had scarcely known . A word from her husband had plunged her into mourning . She desired to mourn inwardly as well , but she wished that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, since fated to die , could have died before the marriage , for then less would have been expected of her . Crumbling her toast , and too nervous to ask for the butter , she remained almost motionless , thankful only for this , that her father-in-law was having his breakfast upstairs .</p>
    <p n="747">At last<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>spoke .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ They had no business to be pollarding those elms yesterday , ”</said>he said to his sister .</p>
    <p n="748"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ No , indeed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="749"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I must make a note of that , ”</said>he continued .<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I am surprised that the rector allowed it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="750"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Perhaps it may not be the rector 's affair . ”</said></p>
    <p n="751"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Whose else could it be ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="752"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ The lord of the manor . ”</said></p>
    <p n="753"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Impossible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="754"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Butter ,<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="755"><said who="#Dolly">“ Thank you ,<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>dear .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="756"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Yes , dear ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="757"><said who="#Dolly">“ I did n't know one could pollard elms . I thought one only pollarded willows . ”</said></p>
    <p n="758"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Oh no , one can pollard elms . ”</said></p>
    <p n="759"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Then why ought n't the elms in the churchyard to be pollarded ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>frowned a little , and turned again to his sister .</p>
    <p n="760"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Another point . I must speak to Chalkeley . ”</said></p>
    <p n="761"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Yes , rather ; you must complain to Chalkeley . ”</said></p>
    <p n="762"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ It 's no good his saying he is not responsible for those men . He is responsible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="763"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Yes , rather . ”</said></p>
    <p n="764">Brother and sister were not callous . They spoke thus , partly because they desired to keep Chalkeley up to the mark — a healthy desire in its way — partly because they avoided the personal note in life . All<persName corresp="#Wilcoxes">Wilcoxes</persName>did . It did not seem to them of supreme importance . Or it may be as<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>supposed : they realised its importance , but were afraid of it . Panic and emptiness , could one glance behind . They were not callous , and they left the breakfast-table with aching hearts . Their mother never had come in to breakfast . It was in the other rooms , and especially in the garden , that they felt her loss most . As<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>went out to the garage , he was reminded at every step of the woman who had loved him and whom he could never replace . What battles he had fought against her gentle conservatism ! How she had disliked improvements , yet how loyally she had accepted them when made ! He and his father — what trouble they had had to get this very garage ! With what difficulty had they persuaded her to yield them the paddock for it — the paddock that she loved more dearly than the garden itself ! The vine — she had got her way about the vine . It still encumbered the south wall with its unproductive branches . And so with<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, as she stood talking to the cook . Though she could take up her mother 's work inside the house , just as the man could take it up without , she felt that something unique had fallen out of her life . Their grief , though less poignant than their father 's , grew from deeper roots , for a wife may be replaced ; a mother never .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>would go back to the office . There was little at Howards End . The contents of his mother 's will had long been known to them . There were no legacies , no annuities , none of the posthumous bustle with which some of the dead prolong their activities . Trusting her husband , she had left him everything without reserve . She was quite a poor woman — the house had been all her dowry , and the house would come to<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>in time . Her watercolours<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>intended to reserve for<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>, while<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>would take the jewellery and lace . How easily she slipped out of life !<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>thought the habit laudable , though he did not intend to adopt it himself , whereas<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>would have seen in it an almost culpable indifference to earthly fame . Cynicism — not the superficial cynicism that snarls and sneers , but the cynicism that can go with courtesy and tenderness — that was the note of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s will . She wanted not to vex people . That accomplished , the earth might freeze over her for ever .</p>
    <p n="765">No , there was nothing for<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>to wait for . He could not go on with his honeymoon , so he would go up to London and work — he felt too miserable hanging about . He and<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>would have the furnished flat while his father rested quietly in the country with<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>. He could also keep an eye on his own little house , which was being painted and decorated for him in one of the Surrey suburbs , and in which he hoped to install himself soon after Christmas . Yes , he would go up after lunch in his new motor , and the town servants , who had come down for the funeral , would go up by train .</p>
    <p n="766">He found his father 's chauffeur in the garage , said “ Morning ” without looking at the man 's face , and bending over the car , continued :<said who="#Evie">“ Hullo ! my new car 's been driven ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="767"><said who="#Dolly">“ Has it , sir ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="768"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, getting rather red ;<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ and whoever 's driven it has n't cleaned it properly , for there 's mud on the axle . Take it off . ”</said></p>
    <p n="769">The man went for the cloths without a word . He was a chauffeur as ugly as sin — not that this did him disservice with<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, who thought charm in a man rather rot , and had soon got rid of the little Italian beast with whom they had started .</p>
    <p n="770"><said who="#Evie">“<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>— ”</said>His bride was tripping after him over the hoar-frost , a dainty black column , her little face and elaborate mourning hat forming the capital thereof .</p>
    <p n="771"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ One minute , I 'm busy . Well ,<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>, who 's been driving it , do you suppose ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="772"><said who="#Crane">“ Do n't know , I 'm sure , sir . No one 's driven it since I 've been back , but , of course , there 's the fortnight I 've been away with the other car in Yorkshire . ”</said></p>
    <p n="773">The mud came off easily .</p>
    <p n="774"><said who="#Evie">“<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, your father 's down . Something 's happened . He wants you in the house at once . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="775"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Wait , dear , wait a minute . Who had the key of the garage while you were away ,<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="776"><said who="#Crane">“ The gardener , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="777"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Do you mean to tell me that old Penny can drive a motor ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="778"><said who="#Crane">“ No , sir ; no one 's had the motor out , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="779"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Then how do you account for the mud on the axle ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="780"><said who="#Crane">“ I can n't , of course , say for the time I 've been in Yorkshire . No more mud now , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="781"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>was vexed . The man was treating him as a fool , and if his heart had not been so heavy he would have reported him to his father . But it was not a morning for complaints . Ordering the motor to be round after lunch , he joined his wife , who had all the while been pouring out some incoherent story about a letter and a<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>.</p>
    <p n="782"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Now ,<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, I can attend to you .<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>? What does she want ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="783">When people wrote a letter<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>always asked what they wanted . Want was to him the only cause of action . And the question in this case was correct , for his wife replied ,<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ She wants Howards End . ”</said></p>
    <p n="784"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Howards End ? Now ,<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>, just do n't forget to put on the Stepney wheel . ”</said></p>
    <p n="785"><said who="#Crane">“ No , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="786"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Now , mind you do n't forget , for I — Come , little woman . ”</said>When they were out of the chauffeur 's sight he put his arm round her waist and pressed her against him . All his affection and half his attention — it was what he granted her throughout their happy married life .</p>
    <p n="787"><said who="#Crane">“ But you have n't listened ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="788"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ What 's wrong ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="789"><said who="#Crane">“ I keep on telling you — Howards End .<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>'s got it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="790"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Got what ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, unclasping her .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ What the dickens are you talking about ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="791"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Now ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, you promised not so say those naughty — ”</said></p>
    <p n="792"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Look here , I 'm in no mood for foolery . It 's no morning for it either . ”</said></p>
    <p n="793"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I tell you — I keep on telling you —<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>— she 's got it — your mother 's left it to her — and you 've all got to move out ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="794"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ HOWARDS END ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="795"><said who="#Evie">“ HOWARDS END ! ”</said>she screamed , mimicking him , and as she did so<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>came dashing out of the shubbery .</p>
    <p n="796"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, go back at once ! My father 's much annoyed with you .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>”</said>— she hit herself wildly —<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ come in at once to father . He 's had a letter that 's too awful . ”</said></p>
    <p n="797"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>began to run , but checked himself , and stepped heavily across the gravel path . There the house was with the nine windows , the unprolific vine . He exclaimed ,<said who="#Dolly">“ Schlegels again ! ”</said>and as if to complete chaos ,<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>said ,<said who="#Dolly">“ Oh no , the matron of the nursing home has written instead of her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="798"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Come in , all three of you ! ”</said>cried his father , no longer inert .</p>
    <p n="799"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, why have you disobeyed me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="800"><said who="#Dolly">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="801"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I told you not to go out to the garage . I 've heard you all shouting in the garden . I wo n't have it . Come in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="802">He stood in the porch , transformed , letters in his hand .</p>
    <p n="803"><said who="#Dolly">“ Into the dining-room , every one of you . We can n't discuss private matters in the middle of all the servants . Here ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, here ; read these . See what you make . ”</said></p>
    <p n="804"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>took two letters , and read them as he followed the procession . The first was a covering note from the matron .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>had desired her , when the funeral should be over , to forward the enclosed . The enclosed — it was from his mother herself . She had written :<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ To my husband : I should like<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>(<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>) to have Howards End . ”</said></p>
    <p n="805"><said who="#Margaret">“ I suppose we 're going to have a talk about this ? ”</said>he remarked , ominously calm .</p>
    <p n="806"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Certainly . I was coming out to you when<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="807"><said who="#Margaret">“ Well , let 's sit down . ”</said></p>
    <p n="808"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Come ,<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, do n't waste time , sit — down . ”</said></p>
    <p n="809">In silence they drew up to the breakfast-table . The events of yesterday — indeed , of this morning suddenly receded into a past so remote that they seemed scarcely to have lived in it . Heavy breathings were heard . They were calming themselves .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, to steady them further , read the enclosure out loud :<said who="#Evie">“ A note in my mother 's handwriting , in an envelope addressed to my father , sealed . Inside : ‘ I should like<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>(<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>) to have Howards End . ’ No date , no signature . Forwarded through the matron of that nursing home . Now , the question is — ”</said></p>
    <p n="810"><persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>interrupted him .<said who="#Margaret">“ But I say that note is n't legal . Houses ought to be done by a lawyer ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, surely . ”</said></p>
    <p n="811">Her husband worked his jaw severely . Little lumps appeared in front of either ear — a symptom that she had not yet learnt to respect , and she asked whether she might see the note .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>looked at his father for permission , who said abstractedly ,<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Give it her . ”</said>She seized it , and at once exclaimed :<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Why , it 's only in pencil ! I said so . Pencil never counts . ”</said></p>
    <p n="812"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ We know that it is not legally binding ,<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, speaking from out of his fortress .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ We are aware of that . Legally , I should be justified in tearing it up and throwing it into the fire . Of course , my dear , we consider you as one of the family , but it will be better if you do not interfere with what you do not understand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="813"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, vexed both with his father and his wife , then repeated :<said who="#Dolly">“ The question is — ”</said>He had cleared a space of the breakfast-table from plates and knives , so that he could draw patterns on the tablecloth .<said who="#Dolly">“ The question is whether<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, during the fortnight we were all away , whether she unduly — ”</said>He stopped .</p>
    <p n="814"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I do n't think that , ”</said>said his father , whose nature was nobler than his son 's .</p>
    <p n="815"><said who="#Dolly">“ Do n't think what ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="816"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ That she would have — that it is a case of undue influence . No , to my mind the question is the — the invalid 's condition at the time she wrote . ”</said></p>
    <p n="817"><said who="#Dolly">“ My dear father , consult an expert if you like , but I do n't admit it is my mother 's writing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="818"><said who="#Dolly">“ Why , you just said it was ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>.</p>
    <p n="819"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Never mind if I did , ”</said>he blazed out ;<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ and hold your tongue . ”</said></p>
    <p n="820">The poor little wife coloured at this , and , drawing her handkerchief from her pocket , shed a few tears . No one noticed her .<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>was scowling like an angry boy . The two men were gradually assuming the manner of the committee-room . They were both at their best when serving on committees . They did not make the mistake of handling human affairs in the bulk , but disposed of them item by item , sharply . Caligraphy was the item before them now , and on it they turned their well-trained brains .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, after a little demur , accepted the writing as genuine , and they passed on to the next point . It is the best — perhaps the only — way of dodging emotion . They were the average human article , and had they considered the note as a whole it would have driven them miserable or mad . Considered item by item , the emotional content was minimised , and all went forward smoothly . The clock ticked , the coals blazed higher , and contended with the white radiance that poured in through the windows . Unnoticed , the sun occupied his sky , and the shadows of the tree stems , extraordinarily solid , fell like trenches of purple across the frosted lawn . It was a glorious winter morning .<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s fox terrier , who had passed for white , was only a dirty grey dog now , so intense was the purity that surrounded him . He was discredited , but the blackbirds that he was chasing glowed with Arabian darkness , for all the conventional colouring of life had been altered . Inside , the clock struck ten with a rich and confident note . Other clocks confirmed it , and the discussion moved towards its close .</p>
    <p n="821">To follow it is unnecessary . It is rather a moment when the commentator should step forward . Ought the Wilcoxes to have offered their home to<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>? I think not . The appeal was too flimsy . It was not legal ; it had been written in illness , and under the spell of a sudden friendship ; it was contrary to the dead woman 's intentions in the past , contrary to her very nature , so far as that nature was understood by them . To them Howards End was a house : they could not know that to her it had been a spirit , for which she sought a spiritual heir . And — pushing one step farther in these mists — may they not have decided even better than they supposed ? Is it credible that the possessions of the spirit can be bequeathed at all ? Has the soul offspring ? A wych-elm tree , a vine , a wisp of hay with dew on it — can passion for such things be transmitted where there is no bond of blood ? No ; the Wilcoxes are not to be blamed . The problem is too terrific , and they could not even perceive a problem . No ; it is natural and fitting that after due debate they should tear the note up and throw it on to their dining-room fire . The practical moralist may acquit them absolutely . He who strives to look deeper may acquit them — almost . For one hard fact remains . They did neglect a personal appeal . The woman who had died did say to them , “ Do this , ” and they answered ,<said who="#Evie">“ We will not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="822">The incident made a most painful impression on them . Grief mounted into the brain and worked there disquietingly . Yesterday they had lamented :<said who="#Margaret">“ She was a dear mother , a true wife ; in our absence she neglected her health and died . ”</said>To-day they thought :<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ She was not as true , as dear , as we supposed . ”</said>The desire for a more inward light had found expression at last , the unseen had impacted on the seen , and all that they could say was “ Treachery . ”<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>had been treacherous to the family , to the laws of property , to her own written word . How did she expect Howards End to be conveyed to<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>? Was her husband , to whom it legally belonged , to make it over to her as a free gift ? Was the said<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>to have a life interest in it , or to own it absolutely ? Was there to be no compensation for the garage and other improvements that they had made under the assumption that all would be theirs some day ? Treacherous ! treacherous and absurd ! When we think the dead both treacherous and absurd , we have gone far towards reconciling ourselves to their departure . That note , scribbled in pencil , sent through the matron , was unbusinesslike as well as cruel , and decreased at once the value of the woman who had written it .</p>
    <p n="823"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Ah , well ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, rising from the table .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I should n't have thought it possible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="824"><said who="#Evie">“ Mother could n't have meant it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, still frowning .</p>
    <p n="825"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ No , my girl , of course not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="826"><said who="#Evie">“ Mother believed so in ancestors too — it is n't like her to leave anything to an outsider , who 'd never appreciate . ”</said></p>
    <p n="827"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ The whole thing is unlike her , ”</said>he announced .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ If<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>had been poor , if she had wanted a house , I could understand it a little . But she has a house of her own . Why should she want another ? She would n't have any use for Howards End . ”</said></p>
    <p n="828"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ That time may prove , ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>.</p>
    <p n="829"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ How ? ”</said>asked his sister .</p>
    <p n="830"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Presumably she knows — mother will have told her . She got twice or three times into the nursing home . Presumably she is awaiting developments . ”</said></p>
    <p n="831"><said who="#Dolly">“ What a horrid woman ! ”</said>And<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, who had recovered , cried ,<said who="#Dolly">“ Why , she may be coming down to turn us out now ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="832"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>put her right .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I wish she would , ”</said>he said ominously .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I could then deal with her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="833"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ So could I , ”</said>echoed his father , who was feeling rather in the cold .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>had been kind in undertaking the funeral arrangements and in telling him to eat his breakfast , but the boy as he grew up was a little dictatorial , and assumed the post of chairman too readily .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I could deal with her , if she comes , but she wo n't come . You 're all a bit hard on<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="834"><said who="#Dolly">“ That<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>business was pretty scandalous , though . ”</said></p>
    <p n="835"><said who="#Dolly">“ I want no more of the<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>business ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, as I said at the time , and besides , it is quite apart from this business .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName><persName corresp="#Schlegel">Schlegel</persName>has been officious and tiresome during this terrible week , and we have all suffered under her , but upon my soul she 's honest . She 's NOT in collusion with the matron . I 'm absolutely certain of it . Nor was she with the doctor , I 'm equally certain of that . She did not hide anything from us , for up to that very afternoon she was as ignorant as we are . She , like ourselves , was a dupe — ”</said>He stopped for a moment .<said who="#Dolly">“ You see ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, in her terrible pain your mother put us all in false positions .<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>would not have left England , you would not have gone to Italy , nor<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>and I into Yorkshire , if only we had known . Well ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>'s position has been equally false . Take all in all , she has not come out of it badly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="836"><persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>said :<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ But those chrysanthemums — ”</said></p>
    <p n="837"><said who="#Dolly">“ Or coming down to the funeral at all — ”</said>echoed<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>.</p>
    <p n="838"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Why should n't she come down ? She had the right to , and she stood far back among the Hilton women . The flowers — certainly we should not have sent such flowers , but they may have seemed the right thing to her ,<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, and for all you know they may be the custom in Germany . ”</said></p>
    <p n="839"><said who="#Evie">“ Oh , I forget she is n't really English , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>.<said who="#Evie">“ That would explain a lot . ”</said></p>
    <p n="840"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ She 's a cosmopolitan , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, looking at his watch .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I admit I 'm rather down on cosmopolitans . My fault , doubtless . I cannot stand them , and a German cosmopolitan is the limit . I think that 's about all , is n't it ? I want to run down and see Chalkeley . A bicycle will do . And , by the way , I wish you 'd speak to<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>some time . I 'm certain he 's had my new car out . ”</said></p>
    <p n="841"><said who="#Evie">“ Has he done it any harm ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="842"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="843"><said who="#Evie">“ In that case I shall let it pass . It 's not worth while having a row . ”</said></p>
    <p n="844"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>and his father sometimes disagreed . But they always parted with an increased regard for one another , and each desired no doughtier comrade when it was necessary to voyage for a little past the emotions . So the sailors of Ulysses voyaged past the Sirens , having first stopped one another 's ears with wool .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="12">
    <p n="845"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>need not have been anxious .<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>had never heard of his mother 's strange request . She was to hear of it in after years , when she had built up her life differently , and it was to fit into position as the headstone of the corner . Her mind was bent on other questions now , and by her also it would have been rejected as the fantasy of an invalid .</p>
    <p n="846">She was parting from these<persName corresp="#Wilcoxes">Wilcoxes</persName>for the second time .<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>and his mother , ripple and great wave , had flowed into her life and ebbed out of it for ever . The ripple had left no traces behind ; the wave had strewn at her feet fragments torn from the unknown . A curious seeker , she stood for a while at the verge of the sea that tells so little , but tells a little , and watched the outgoing of this last tremendous tide . Her friend had vanished in agony , but not , she believed , in degradation . Her withdrawal had hinted at other things besides disease and pain . Some leave our life with tears , others with an insane frigidity ;<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>had taken the middle course , which only rarer natures can pursue . She had kept proportion . She had told a little of her grim secret to her friends , but not too much ; she had shut up her heart — almost , but not entirely . It is thus , if there is any rule , that we ought to die — neither as victim nor as fanatic , but as the seafarer who can greet with an equal eye the deep that he is entering , and the shore that he must leave .</p>
    <p n="847">The last word — whatever it would be — had certainly not been said in Hilton churchyard . She had not died there . A funeral is not death , any more than baptism is birth or marriage union . All three are the clumsy devices , coming now too late , now too early , by which<persName>Society</persName>would register the quick motions of man . In<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s eyes<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>had escaped registration . She had gone out of life vividly , her own way , and no dust was so truly dust as the contents of that heavy coffin , lowered with ceremonial until it rested on the dust of the earth , no flowers so utterly wasted as the chrysanthemums that the frost must have withered before morning .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had once said she “ loved superstition . ” It was not true . Few women had tried more earnestly to pierce the accretions in which body and soul are enwrapped . The death of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>had helped her in her work . She saw a little more clearly than hitherto what a human being is , and to what he may aspire . Truer relationships gleamed . Perhaps the last word would be hope — hope even on this side of the grave .</p>
    <p n="848">Meanwhile , she could take an interest in the survivors . In spite of her Christmas duties , in spite of her brother , the Wilcoxes continued to play a considerable part in her thoughts . She had seen so much of them in the final week . They were not “ her sort , ” they were often suspicious and stupid , and deficient where she excelled ; but collision with them stimulated her , and she felt an interest that verged into liking , even for<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. She desired to protect them , and often felt that they could protect her , excelling where she was deficient . Once past the rocks of emotion , they knew so well what to do , whom to send for ; their hands were on all the ropes , they had grit as well as grittiness and she valued grit enormously . They led a life that she could not attain to — the outer life of “ telegrams and anger , ” which had detonated when<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>had touched in June , and had detonated again the other week . To<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>this life was to remain a real force . She could not despise it , as<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>affected to do . It fostered such virtues as neatness , decision , and obedience , virtues of the second rank , no doubt , but they have formed our civilisation . They form character , too ;<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>could not doubt it ; they keep the soul from becoming sloppy . How dare Schlegels despise<persName corresp="#Wilcoxes">Wilcoxes</persName>, when it takes all sorts to make a world ?</p>
    <p n="849"><said who="#Wilcoxes">“ Do n't brood too much , ”</said>she wrote to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>,<said who="#Wilcoxes">“ on the superiority of the unseen to the seen . It 's true , but to brood on it is medieval . Our business is not to contrast the two , but to reconcile them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="850"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>replied that she had no intention of brooding on such a dull subject . What did her sister take her for ? The weather was magnificent . She and the Mosebachs had gone tobogganing on the only hill that Pomerania boasted . It was fun , but over-crowded , for the rest of Pomerania had gone there too .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>loved the country , and her letter glowed with physical exercise and poetry . She spoke of the scenery , quiet , yet august ; of the snow-clad fields , with their scampering herds of deer ; of the river and its quaint entrance into the Baltic Sea ; of the Oderberge , only three hundred feet high , from which one slid all too quickly back into the Pomeranian plains , and yet these Oderberge were real mountains , with pine-forests , streams , and views complete .<said who="#Helen">“ It is n't size that counts so much as the way things are arranged . ”</said>In another paragraph she referred to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>sympathetically , but the news had not bitten into her . She had not realised the accessories of death , which are in a sense more memorable than death itself . The atmosphere of precautions and recriminations , and in the midst a human body growing more vivid because it was in pain ; the end of that body in Hilton churchyard ; the survival of something that suggested hope , vivid in its turn against life 's workaday cheerfulness ;— all these were lost to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who only felt that a pleasant lady could now be pleasant no longer . She returned to Wickham Place full of her own affairs — she had had another proposal — and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, after a moment 's hesitation , was content that this should be so .</p>
    <p n="851">The proposal had not been a serious matter . It was the work of<persName corresp="#Fraulein_Mosebach">Fraulein Mosebach</persName>, who had conceived the large and patriotic notion of winning back her cousins to the Fatherland by matrimony . England had played<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>Wilcox , and lost ; Germany played Herr Forstmeister some one —<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>could not remember his name . Herr Forstmeister lived in a wood , and , standing on the summit of the Oderberge , he had pointed out his house to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, or rather , had pointed out the wedge of pines in which it lay . She had exclaimed ,<said who="#Frieda">“ Oh , how lovely ! That 's the place for me ! ”</said>and in the evening<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>appeared in her bedroom .<said who="#Frieda">“ I have a message , dear<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, ”</said>etc ., and so she had , but had been very nice when<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>laughed ; quite understood — a forest too solitary and damp — quite agreed , but Herr Forstmeister believed he had assurance to the contrary . Germany had lost , but with good-humour ; holding the manhood of the world , she felt bound to win .<said who="#Helen">“ And there will even be some one for<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, ”</said>concluded<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ There now ,<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, think of that ;<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>is saving up a little girl for you , in pig-tails and white worsted stockings but the feet of the stockings are pink as if the little girl had trodden in strawberries . I 've talked too much . My head aches . Now you talk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="852"><persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>consented to talk . He too was full of his own affairs , for he had just been up to try for a scholarship at Oxford . The men were down , and the candidates had been housed in various colleges , and had dined in hall .<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was sensitive to beauty , the experience was new , and he gave a description of his visit that was almost glowing . The august and mellow University , soaked with the richness of the western counties that it has served for a thousand years , appealed at once to the boy 's taste ; it was the kind of thing he could understand , and he understood it all the better because it was empty . Oxford is — Oxford ; not a mere receptacle for youth , like Cambridge . Perhaps it wants its inmates to love it rather than to love one another ; such at all events was to be its effect on<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>. His sisters sent him there that he might make friends , for they knew that his education had been cranky , and had severed him from other boys and men . He made no friends . His Oxford remained Oxford empty , and he took into life with him , not the memory of a radiance , but the memory of a colour scheme .</p>
    <p n="853">It pleased<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>to hear her brother and sister talking . They did not get on overwell as a rule . For a few moments she listened to them , feeling elderly and benign .</p>
    <p n="854">Then something occurred to her , and she interrupted .</p>
    <p n="855"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, I told you about poor<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>; that sad business ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="856"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="857"><said who="#Margaret">“ I have had a correspondence with her son . He was winding up the estate , and wrote to ask me whether his mother had wanted me to have anything . I thought it good of him , considering I knew her so little . I said that she had once spoken of giving me a Christmas present , but we both forgot about it afterwards . ”</said></p>
    <p n="858"><said who="#Helen">“ I hope<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>took the hint . ”</said></p>
    <p n="859"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes — that is to say , her husband wrote later on , and thanked me for being a little kind to her , and actually gave me her silver vinaigrette . Do n't you think that is extraordinarily generous ? It has made me like him very much . He hopes that this will not be the end of our acquaintance , but that you and I will go and stop with<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>some time in the future . I like<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. He is taking up his work — rubber — it is a big business . I gather he is launching out rather .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>is in it , too .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>is married — a pretty little creature , but she does n't seem wise . They took on the flat , but now they have gone off to a house of their own . ”</said></p>
    <p n="860"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, after a decent pause , continued her account of Stettin . How quickly a situation changes ! In June she had been in a crisis ; even in November she could blush and be unnatural ; now it was January and the whole affair lay forgotten . Looking back on the past six months ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>realised the chaotic nature of our daily life , and its difference from the orderly sequence that has been fabricated by historians . Actual life is full of false clues and sign-posts that lead nowhere . With infinite effort we nerve ourselves for a crisis that never comes . The most successful career must show a waste of strength that might have removed mountains , and the most unsuccessful is not that of the man who is taken unprepared , but of him who has prepared and is never taken . On a tragedy of that kind our national morality is duly silent . It assumes that preparation against danger is in itself a good , and that men , like nations , are the better for staggering through life fully armed . The tragedy of preparedness has scarcely been handled , save by the Greeks . Life is indeed dangerous , but not in the way morality would have us believe . It is indeed unmanageable , but the essence of it is not a battle . It is unmanageable because it is a romance , and its essence is romantic beauty .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>hoped that for the future she would be less cautious , not more cautious , than she had been in the past .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="13">
    <p n="861">Over two years passed , and the<persName corresp="#Schlegel">Schlegel</persName>household continued to lead its life of cultured , but not ignoble , ease , still swimming gracefully on the grey tides of London . Concerts and plays swept past them , money had been spent and renewed , reputations won and lost , and the city herself , emblematic of their lives , rose and fell in a continual flux , while her shallows washed more widely against the hills of Surrey and over the fields of Hertfordshire . This famous building had arisen , that was doomed . To-day Whitehall had been transformed ; it would be the turn of Regent Street to-morrow . And month by month the roads smelt more strongly of petrol , and were more difficult to cross , and human beings heard each other speak with greater difficulty , breathed less of the air , and saw less of the sky .<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>withdrew ; the leaves were falling by midsummer ; the sun shone through dirt with an admired obscurity .</p>
    <p n="862">To speak against London is no longer fashionable . The Earth as an artistic cult has had its day , and the literature of the near future will probably ignore the country and seek inspiration from the town . One can understand the reaction . Of Pan and the elemental forces , the public has heard a ‘ little too much — they seem Victorian , while London is Georgian — and those who care for the earth with sincerity may wait long ere the pendulum swings back to her again . Certainly London fascinates . One visualises it as a tract of quivering grey , intelligent without purpose , and excitable without love ; as a spirit that has altered before it can be chronicled ; as a heart that certainly beats , but with no pulsation of humanity . It lies beyond everything ;<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>, with all her cruelty , comes nearer to us than do these crowds of men . A friend explains himself ; the earth is explicable — from her we came , and we must return to her . But who can explain Westminster Bridge Road or Liverpool Street in the morning — the city inhaling — or the same thoroughfares in the evening — the city exhaling her exhausted air ? We reach in desperation beyond the fog , beyond the very stars , the voids of the universe are ransacked to justify the monster , and stamped with a human face . London is religion 's opportunity — not the decorous religion of theologians , but anthropomorphic , crude . Yes , the continuous flow would be tolerable if a man of our own sort — not any one pompous or tearful — were caring for us up in the sky .</p>
    <p n="863">The Londoner seldom understands his city until it sweeps him , too , away from his moorings , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s eyes were not opened until the lease of Wickham Place expired . She had always known that it must expire , but the knowledge only became vivid about nine months before the event . Then the house was suddenly ringed with pathos . It had seen so much happiness . Why had it to be swept away ? In the streets of the city she noted for the first time the architecture of hurry and heard the language of hurry on the mouths of its inhabitants — clipped words , formless sentences , potted expressions of approval or disgust . Month by month things were stepping livelier , but to what goal ? The population still rose , but what was the quality of the men born ? The particular millionaire who owned the freehold of Wickham Place , and desired to erect Babylonian flats upon it — what right had he to stir so large a portion of the quivering jelly ? He was not a fool — she had heard him expose<persName>Socialism</persName>— but true insight began just where his intelligence ended , and one gathered that this was the case with most millionaires . What right had such men — But<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>checked herself . That way lies madness . Thank goodness , she , too , had some money , and could purchase a new home .</p>
    <p n="864"><persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, now in his second year at Oxford , was down for the Easter vacation , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>took the opportunity of having a serious talk with him . Did he at all know where he wanted to live ?<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>did n't know that he did know . Did he at all know what he wanted to do ? He was equally uncertain , but when pressed remarked that he should prefer to be quite free of any profession .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was not shocked , but went on sewing for a few minutes before she replied :</p>
    <p n="865"><said who="#Margaret">“ I was thinking of Mr. Vyse . He never strikes me as particularly happy .</said></p>
    <p n="866"><said who="#Tibby">“ Ye — es . ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, and then held his mouth open in a curious quiver , as if he , too , had thought of Mr. Vyse , had seen round , through , over , and beyond Mr. Vyse , had weighed Mr. Vyse , grouped him , and finally dismissed him as having no possible bearing on the Subject under discussion . That bleat of<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>'s infuriated<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. But<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was now down in the dining room preparing a speech about political economy . At times her voice could be heard declaiming through the floor .</p>
    <p n="867"><said who="#Margaret">“ But Mr. Vyse is rather a wretched , weedy man , do n't you think ? Then there 's Guy . That was a pitiful business . Besides ”</said>— shifting to the general —<said who="#Margaret">“ every one is the better for some regular work . ”</said></p>
    <p n="868">Groans .</p>
    <p n="869"><said who="#Margaret">“ I shall stick to it , ”</said>she continued , smiling .<said who="#Margaret">“ I am not saying it to educate you ; it is what I really think . I believe that in the last century men have developed the desire for work , and they must not starve it . It 's a new desire . It goes with a great deal that 's bad , but in itself it 's good , and I hope that for women , too , ‘ not to work ’ will soon become as shocking as ‘ not to be married ’ was a hundred years ago . ”</said></p>
    <p n="870"><said who="#Tibby">“ I have no experience of this profound desire to which you allude , ”</said>enunciated<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.</p>
    <p n="871"><said who="#Margaret">“ Then we 'll leave the subject till you do . I 'm not going to rattle you round . Take your time . Only do think over the lives of the men you like most , and see how they 've arranged them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="872"><said who="#Tibby">“ I like Guy and Mr. Vyse most , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>faintly , and leant so far back in his chair that he extended in a horizontal line from knees to throat .</p>
    <p n="873"><said who="#Margaret">“ And do n't think I 'm not serious because I do n't use the traditional arguments — making money , a sphere awaiting you , and so on — all of which are , for various reasons , cant . ”</said>She sewed on .<said who="#Margaret">“ I 'm only your sister . I have n't any authority over you , and I do n't want to have any . Just to put before you what I think the Truth . You see ”</said>— she shook off the pince-nez to which she had recently taken —<said who="#Margaret">“ in a few years we shall be the same age practically , and I shall want you to help me . Men are so much nicer than women . ”</said></p>
    <p n="874"><said who="#Tibby">“ Labouring under such a delusion , why do you not marry ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="875"><said who="#Margaret">“ I sometimes jolly well think I would if I got the chance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="876"><said who="#Tibby">“ Has nobody arst you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="877"><said who="#Margaret">“ Only ninnies . ”</said></p>
    <p n="878"><said who="#Tibby">“ Do people ask<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="879"><said who="#Margaret">“ Plentifully . ”</said></p>
    <p n="880"><said who="#Tibby">“ Tell me about them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="881"><said who="#Margaret">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="882"><said who="#Tibby">“ Tell me about your ninnies , then . ”</said></p>
    <p n="883"><said who="#Margaret">“ They were men who had nothing better to do , ”</said>said his sister , feeling that she was entitled to score this point .<said who="#Margaret">“ So take warning ; you must work , or else you must pretend to work , which is what I do . Work , work , work if you 'd save your soul and your body . It is honestly a necessity , dear boy . Look at the Wilcoxes , look at Mr. Pembroke . With all their defects of temper and understanding , such men give me more pleasure than many who are better equipped , and I think it is because they have worked regularly and honestly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="884"><said who="#Tibby">“ Spare me the Wilcoxes , ”</said>he moaned .</p>
    <p n="885"><said who="#Margaret">“ I shall not . They are the right sort . ”</said></p>
    <p n="886">“ Oh , goodness me ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>—! ” he protested , suddenly sitting up , alert and angry .<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, for all his defects , had a genuine personality .</p>
    <p n="887"><said who="#Tibby">“ Well , they 're as near the right sort as you can imagine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="888"><said who="#Margaret">“ No , no — oh , no ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="889"><said who="#Tibby">“ I was thinking of the younger son , whom I once classed as a ninny , but who came back so ill from Nigeria . He 's gone out there again ,<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>Wilcox tells me — out to his duty . ”</said></p>
    <p n="890">“ Duty ” always elicited a groan .</p>
    <p n="891"><said who="#Tibby">“ He does n't want the money , it is work he wants , though it is beastly work — dull country , dishonest natives , an eternal fidget over fresh water and food ... A nation that can produce men of that sort may well be proud . No wonder England has become an Empire .</said></p>
    <p n="892"><said who="#Margaret">“ EMPIRE ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="893"><said who="#Margaret">“ I can n't bother over results , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, a little sadly .<said who="#Margaret">“ They are too difficult for me . I can only look at the men . An Empire bores me , so far , but I can appreciate the heroism that builds it up . London bores me , but what thousands of splendid people are labouring to make London — ”</said></p>
    <p n="894"><said who="#Margaret">“ What it is , ”</said>he sneered .</p>
    <p n="895"><said who="#Tibby">“ What it is , worse luck . I want activity without civilisation . How paradoxical ! Yet I expect that is what we shall find in heaven . ”</said></p>
    <p n="896"><said who="#Tibby">“ And I , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>,<said who="#Tibby">“ want civilisation without activity , which , I expect , is what we shall find in the other place . ”</said></p>
    <p n="897"><said who="#Margaret">“ You need n't go as far as the other place , Tibbikins , if you want that . You can find it at Oxford . ”</said></p>
    <p n="898"><said who="#Tibby">“ Stupid — ”</said></p>
    <p n="899"><said who="#Margaret">“ If I 'm stupid , get me back to the house-hunting . I 'll even live in Oxford if you like — North Oxford . I 'll live anywhere except Bournemouth , Torquay , and Cheltenham . Oh yes , or Ilfracombe and Swanage and Tunbridge Wells and Surbiton and Bedford . There on no account . ”</said></p>
    <p n="900"><said who="#Tibby">“ London , then . ”</said></p>
    <p n="901"><said who="#Margaret">“ I agree , but<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>rather wants to get away from London . However , there 's no reason we should n't have a house in the country and also a flat in town , provided we all stick together and contribute . Though of course — Oh , how one does maunder on and to think , to think of the people who are really poor . How do they live ? Not to move about the world would kill me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="902">As she spoke , the door was flung open , and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>burst in in a state of extreme excitement .</p>
    <p n="903"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh , my dears , what do you think ? You 'll never guess . A woman 's been here asking me for her husband . Her WHAT ? ”</said>(<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was fond of supplying her own surprise . )<said who="#Helen">“ Yes , for her husband , and it really is so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="904"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not anything to do with Bracknell ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who had lately taken on an unemployed of that name to clean the knives and boots .</p>
    <p n="905"><said who="#Helen">“ I offered Bracknell , and he was rejected . So was<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>. ( Cheer up ,<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>! ) It 's no one we know . I said , ‘ Hunt , my good woman ; have a good look round , hunt under the tables , poke up the chimney , shake out the antimacassars . Husband ? husband ? ’ Oh , and she so magnificently dressed and tinkling like a chandelier . ”</said></p>
    <p n="906"><said who="#Tibby">“ Now ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, what did really happen ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="907"><said who="#Tibby">“ What I say . I was , as it were , orating my speech . Annie opens the door like a fool , and shows a female straight in on me , with my mouth open . Then we began — very civilly . ‘ I want my husband , what I have reason to believe is here . ’ No — how unjust one is . She said ‘ whom , ’ not ‘ what . ’ She got it perfectly . So I said , ‘ Name , please ? ’ and she said , ‘ Lan , Miss , ’ and there we were .</said></p>
    <p n="908"><said who="#Margaret">“ Lan ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="909"><said who="#Tibby">“ Lan or<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Len</persName>. We were not nice about our vowels . Lanoline . ”</said></p>
    <p n="910"><said who="#Margaret">“ But what an extraordinary — ”</said></p>
    <p n="911"><said who="#Tibby">“ I said , ‘ My good<persName>Mrs. Lanoline</persName>, we have some grave misunderstanding here . Beautiful as I am , my modesty is even more remarkable than my beauty , and never , never has Mr. Lanoline rested his eyes on mine . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="912"><said who="#Tibby">“ I hope you were pleased , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.</p>
    <p n="913"><said who="#Helen">“ Of course , ”</said><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>squeaked .<said who="#Helen">“ A perfectly delightful experience . Oh ,<persName>Mrs. Lanoline</persName>'s a dear — she asked for a husband as if he were an umbrella . She mislaid him Saturday afternoon — and for a long time suffered no inconvenience . But all night , and all this morning her apprehensions grew . Breakfast did n't seem the same — no , no more did lunch , and so she strolled up to 2 Wickham Place as being the most likely place for the missing article . ”</said></p>
    <p n="914"><said who="#Tibby">“ But how on earth — ”</said></p>
    <p n="915"><said who="#Helen">“ Do n't begin how on earthing . ‘ I know what I know , ’ she kept repeating , not uncivilly , but with extreme gloom . In vain I asked her what she did know . Some knew what others knew , and others did n't , and then others again had better be careful . Oh dear , she was incompetent ! She had a face like a silkworm , and the dining-room reeks of orris-root . We chatted pleasantly a little about husbands , and I wondered where hers was too , and advised her to go to the police . She thanked me . We agreed that Mr. Lanoline 's a notty , notty man , and has n't no business to go on the lardy-da . But I think she suspected me up to the last . Bags I writing to<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>about this . Now ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, remember — bags I . ”</said></p>
    <p n="916"><said who="#Margaret">“ Bag it by all means , ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, putting down her work .<said who="#Margaret">“ I 'm not sure that this is so funny ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. It means some horrible volcano smoking somewhere , does n't it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="917"><said who="#Helen">“ I do n't think so — she does n't really mind . The admirable creature is n't capable of tragedy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="918"><said who="#Margaret">“ Her husband may be , though , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, moving to the window .</p>
    <p n="919"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh no , not likely . No one capable of tragedy could have married<persName>Mrs. Lanoline</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="920"><said who="#Margaret">“ Was she pretty ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="921"><said who="#Helen">“ Her figure may have been good once . ”</said></p>
    <p n="922">The flats , their only outlook , hung like an ornate curtain between<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and the welter of London . Her thoughts turned sadly to house-hunting . Wickham Place had been so safe . She feared , fantastically , that her own little flock might be moving into turmoil and squalor , into nearer contact with such episodes as these .</p>
    <p n="923"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>and I have again been wondering where we 'll live next September , ”</said>she said at last .</p>
    <p n="924"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>had better first wonder what he 'll do , ”</said>retorted<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>; and that topic was resumed , but with acrimony . Then tea came , and after tea<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>went on preparing her speech , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>prepared one , too , for they were going out to a discussion society on the morrow . But her thoughts were poisoned .<persName>Mrs. Lanoline</persName>had risen out of the abyss , like a faint smell , a goblin football , telling of a life where love and hatred had both decayed .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="14">
    <p n="925">The mystery , like so many mysteries , was explained . Next day , just as they were dressed to go out to dinner , a<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>called . He was a clerk in the employment of<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>Fire Insurance Company . Thus much from his card . He had come “ about the lady yesterday . ” Thus much from Annie , who had shown him into the dining-room .</p>
    <p n="926"><said who="#Helen">“ Cheers , children ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ It 's<persName>Mrs. Lanoline</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="927"><persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was interested . The three hurried downstairs , to find , not the gay dog they expected , but a young man , colourless , toneless , who had already the mournful eyes above a drooping moustache that are so common in London , and that haunt some streets of the city like accusing presences . One guessed him as the third generation , grandson to the shepherd or ploughboy whom civilisation had sucked into the town ; as one of the thousands who have lost the life of the body and failed to reach the life of the spirit . Hints of robustness survived in him , more than a hint of primitive good looks , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, noting the spine that might have been straight , and the chest that might have broadened , wondered whether it paid to give up the glory of the animal for a tail coat and a couple of ideas . Culture had worked in her own case , but during the last few weeks she had doubted whether it humanised the majority , so wide and so widening is the gulf that stretches between the natural and the philosophic man , so many the good chaps who are wrecked in trying to cross it . She knew this type very well — the vague aspirations , the mental dishonesty , the familiarity with the outsides of books . She knew the very tones in which he would address her . She was only unprepared for an example of her own visiting-card .</p>
    <p n="928"><said who="#Margaret">“ You would n't remember giving me this ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>? ”</said>said he , uneasily familiar .</p>
    <p n="929"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ No ; I can n't say I do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="930"><said who="#Margaret">“ Well , that was how it happened , you see . ”</said></p>
    <p n="931"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Where did we meet ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>? For the minute I do n't remember . ”</said></p>
    <p n="932"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ It was a concert at the Queen 's Hall . I think you will recollect , ”</said>he added pretentiously ,<said who="#Mr._Bast">“ when I tell you that it included a performance of the Fifth Symphony of<persName>Beethoven</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="933"><said who="#Margaret">“ We hear the Fifth practically every time it 's done , so I 'm not sure — do you remember ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="934"><said who="#Helen">“ Was it the time the sandy cat walked round the balustrade ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="935">He thought not .</p>
    <p n="936"><said who="#Margaret">“ Then I do n't remember . That 's the only<persName>Beethoven</persName>I ever remember specially . ”</said></p>
    <p n="937"><said who="#Helen">“ And you , if I may say so , took away my umbrella , inadvertently of course . ”</said></p>
    <p n="938"><said who="#Helen">“ Likely enough , ”</said><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>laughed ,<said who="#Helen">“ for I steal umbrellas even oftener than I hear<persName>Beethoven</persName>. Did you get it back ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="939"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , thank you ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="940"><said who="#Margaret">“ The mistake arose out of my card , did it ? ”</said>interposed<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="941"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , the mistake arose — it was a mistake . ”</said></p>
    <p n="942"><said who="#Margaret">“ The lady who called here yesterday thought that you were calling too , and that she could find you ? ”</said>she continued , pushing him forward , for , though he had promised an explanation , he seemed unable to give one .</p>
    <p n="943"><said who="#Helen">“ That 's so , calling too — a mistake . ”</said></p>
    <p n="944">“ Then why —? ” began<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, but<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>laid a hand on her arm .</p>
    <p n="945"><said who="#Helen">“ I said to my wife , ”</said>he continued more rapidly “ I said to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>, ‘ I have to pay a call on some friends , ’ and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>said to me , ‘ Do go . ’ While I was gone , however , she wanted me on important business , and thought I had come here , owing to the card , and so came after me , and I beg to tender my apologies , and hers as well , for any inconvenience we may have inadvertently caused you . ”</p>
    <p n="946"><said who="#Helen">“ No inconvenience , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>;<said who="#Helen">“ but I still do n't understand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="947">An air of evasion characterised<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>. He explained again , but was obviously lying , and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>did n't see why he should get off . She had the cruelty of youth . Neglecting her sister 's pressure , she said ,<said who="#Mr._Bast">“ I still do n't understand . When did you say you paid this call ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="948"><said who="#Helen">“ Call ? What call ? ”</said>said he , staring as if her question had been a foolish one , a favourite device of those in mid-stream .</p>
    <p n="949"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ This afternoon call . ”</said></p>
    <p n="950"><said who="#Tibby">“ In the afternoon , of course ! ”</said>he replied , and looked at<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>to see how the repartee went . But<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was unsympathetic , and said ,<said who="#Tibby">“ Saturday afternoon or Sunday afternoon ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="951"><said who="#Helen">“ S — Saturday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="952"><said who="#Helen">“ Really ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>;<said who="#Helen">“ and you were still calling on Sunday , when your wife came here . A long visit . ”</said></p>
    <p n="953"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ I do n't call that fair , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>, going scarlet and handsome . There was fight in his eyes .<said who="#Mr._Bast">“ I know what you mean , and it is n't so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="954"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , do n't let us mind , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, distressed again by odours from the abyss .</p>
    <p n="955"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ It was something else , ”</said>he asserted , his elaborate manner breaking down .<said who="#Mr._Bast">“ I was somewhere else to what you think , so there ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="956"><said who="#Margaret">“ It was good of you to come and explain , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Margaret">“ The rest is naturally no concern of ours . ”</said></p>
    <p n="957"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ Yes , but I want — I wanted — have you ever read The Ordeal of Richard Feverel ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="958"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>nodded .</p>
    <p n="959"><said who="#Margaret">“ It 's a beautiful book . I wanted to get back to the earth , do n't you see , like Richard does in the end . Or have you ever read Stevenson 's Prince Otto ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="960"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>groaned gently .</p>
    <p n="961"><said who="#Tibby">“ That 's another beautiful book . You get back to the earth in that . I wanted — ”</said>He mouthed affectedly . Then through the mists of his culture came a hard fact , hard as a pebble .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I walked all the Saturday night , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>.<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I walked . ”</said>A thrill of approval ran through the sisters . But culture closed in again . He asked whether they had ever read E. V. Lucas 's Open Road .</p>
    <p n="962">Said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>,<said who="#Helen">“ No doubt it 's another beautiful book , but I 'd rather hear about your road . ”</said></p>
    <p n="963"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Oh , I walked . ”</said></p>
    <p n="964"><said who="#Helen">“ How far ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="965"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I do n't know , nor for how long . It got too dark to see my watch . ”</said></p>
    <p n="966"><said who="#Helen">“ Were you walking alone , may I ask ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="967"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Yes , ”</said>he said , straightening himself ;<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ but we 'd been talking it over at the office . There 's been a lot of talk at the office lately about these things . The fellows there said one steers by the Pole Star , and I looked it up in the celestial atlas , but once out of doors everything gets so mixed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="968"><said who="#Helen">“ Do n't talk to me about the Pole Star , ”</said>interrupted<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who was becoming interested .<said who="#Helen">“ I know its little ways . It goes round and round , and you go round after it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="969"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Well , I lost it entirely . First of all the street lamps , then the trees , and towards morning it got cloudy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="970"><persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, who preferred his comedy undiluted , slipped from the room . He knew that this fellow would never attain to poetry , and did not want to hear him trying .</p>
    <p n="971"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>remained . Their brother influenced them more than they knew ; in his absence they were stirred to enthusiasm more easily .</p>
    <p n="972"><said who="#Margaret">“ Where did you start from ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Do tell us more . ”</said></p>
    <p n="973"><said who="#Helen">“ I took the Underground to Wimbledon . As I came out of the office I said to myself , ‘ I must have a walk once in a way . If I do n't take this walk now , I shall never take it . ’ I had a bit of dinner at Wimbledon , and then — ”</said></p>
    <p n="974"><said who="#Margaret">“ But not good country there , is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="975"><said who="#Helen">“ It was gas-lamps for hours . Still , I had all the night , and being out was the great thing . I did get into woods , too , presently . ”</said></p>
    <p n="976"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , go on , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="977"><said who="#Margaret">“ You 've no idea how difficult uneven ground is when it 's dark . ”</said></p>
    <p n="978"><said who="#Helen">“ Did you actually go off the roads ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="979"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh yes . I always meant to go off the roads , but the worst of it is that it 's more difficult to find one 's way .</said></p>
    <p n="980"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>, you 're a born adventurer , ”</said>laughed<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ No professional athlete would have attempted what you 've done . It 's a wonder your walk did n't end in a broken neck . Whatever did your wife say ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="981"><said who="#Helen">“ Professional athletes never move without lanterns and compasses , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ Besides , they can n't walk . It tires them . Go on . ”</said></p>
    <p n="982"><said who="#Margaret">“ I felt like R. L. S. You probably remember how in Virginibus . ”</said></p>
    <p n="983"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , but the wood . This ‘ ere wood . How did you get out of it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="984"><said who="#Margaret">“ I managed one wood , and found a road the other side which went a good bit uphill . I rather fancy it was those North Downs , for the road went off into grass , and I got into another wood . That was awful , with gorse bushes . I did wish I 'd never come , but suddenly it got light — just while I seemed going under one tree . Then I found a road down to a station , and took the first train I could back to London . ”</said></p>
    <p n="985"><said who="#Helen">“ But was the dawn wonderful ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="986">With unforgettable sincerity he replied ,<said who="#Helen">“ No . ”</said>The word flew again like a pebble from the sling . Down toppled all that had seemed ignoble or literary in his talk , down toppled tiresome R. L. S. and the “ love of the earth ” and his silk top-hat . In the presence of these women<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>had arrived , and he spoke with a flow , an exultation , that he had seldom known .</p>
    <p n="987"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ The dawn was only grey , it was nothing to mention . ”</said></p>
    <p n="988"><said who="#Helen">“ Just a grey evening turned upside down . I know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="989"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ — and I was too tired to lift up my head to look at it , and so cold too . I 'm glad I did it , and yet at the time it bored me more than I can say . And besides — you can believe me or not as you choose — I was very hungry . That dinner at Wimbledon — I meant it to last me all night like other dinners . I never thought that walking would make such a difference . Why , when you 're walking you want , as it were , a breakfast and luncheon and tea during the night as well , and I 'd nothing but a packet of Woodbines . Lord , I did feel bad ! Looking back , it was n't what you may call enjoyment . It was more a case of sticking to it . I did stick . I — I was determined . Oh , hang it all ! what 's the good — I mean , the good of living in a room for ever ? There one goes on day after day , same old game , same up and down to town , until you forget there is any other game . You ought to see once in a way what 's going on outside , if it 's only nothing particular after all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="990"><said who="#Helen">“ I should just think you ought , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, sitting — on the edge of the table .</p>
    <p n="991">The sound of a lady 's voice recalled him from sincerity , and he said :<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Curious it should all come about from reading something of Richard Jefferies . ”</said></p>
    <p n="992"><said who="#Helen">“ Excuse me ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>, but you 're wrong there . It did n't . It came from something far greater . ”</said></p>
    <p n="993">But she could not stop him . Borrow was imminent after Jefferies — Borrow , Thoreau , and sorrow . R. L. S. brought up the rear , and the outburst ended in a swamp of books . No disrespect to these great names . The fault is ours , not theirs . They mean us to use them for sign-posts we mistake the sign-post for the destination . And<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>had reached the destination . He had visited the county of Surrey when darkness covered its amenities , and its cosy villas had re-entered ancient night . Every twelve hours this miracle happens , but he had troubled to go and see for himself . Within his cramped little mind dwelt something that was greater than Jefferies ’ books — the spirit that led Jefferies to write them ; and his dawn , though revealing nothing but monotones , was part of the eternal sunrise that shows George Borrow Stonehenge .</p>
    <p n="994"><said who="#Nature">“ Then you do n't think I was foolish ? ”</said>he asked becoming again the naive and sweet-tempered boy for whom<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>intended him .</p>
    <p n="995"><said who="#Margaret">“ Heavens , no ! ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="996"><said who="#Margaret">“ Heaven help us if we do ! ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="997"><said who="#Helen">“ I 'm very glad you say that . Now , my wife would never understand — not if I explained for days . ”</said></p>
    <p n="998"><said who="#Helen">“ No , it was n't foolish ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, her eyes aflame .<said who="#Helen">“ You 've pushed back the boundaries ; I think it splendid of you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="999"><said who="#Margaret">“ You 've not been content to dream as we have — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1000"><said who="#Helen">“ Though we have walked , too — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1001"><said who="#Margaret">“ I must show you a picture upstairs — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1002">Here the door-bell rang . The hansom had come to take them to their evening party .</p>
    <p n="1003"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , bother , not to say dash — I had forgotten we were dining out ; but do , do , come round again and have a talk . ”</said>“ Yes , you must — do , ” echoed<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1004"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, with extreme sentiment , replied :<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ No , I shall not . It 's better like this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1005"><said who="#Margaret">“ Why better ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1006"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ No , it is better not to risk a second interview . I shall always look back on this talk with you as one of the finest things in my life . Really . I mean this . We can never repeat . It has done me real good , and there we had better leave it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1007"><said who="#Margaret">“ That 's rather a sad view of life , surely . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1008"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Things so often get spoiled . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1009"><said who="#Helen">“ I know , ”</said>flashed<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>,<said who="#Helen">“ but people do n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1010">He could not understand this . He continued in a vein which mingled true imagination and false . What he said was n't wrong , but it was n't right , and a false note jarred . One little twist , they felt , and the instrument might be in tune . One little strain , and it might be silent for ever . He thanked the ladies very much , but he would not call again . There was a moment 's awkwardness , and then<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>said :<said who="#Margaret">“ Go , then ; perhaps you know best ; but never forget you 're better than Jefferies . ”</said>And he went . Their hansom caught him up at the corner , passed with a waving of hands , and vanished with its accomplished load into the evening .</p>
    <p n="1011">London was beginning to illuminate herself against the night . Electric lights sizzled and jagged in the main thoroughfares , gas-lamps in the side streets glimmered a canary gold or green . The sky was a crimson battlefield of spring , but London was not afraid . Her smoke mitigated the splendour , and the clouds down Oxford Street were a delicately painted ceiling , which adorned while it did not distract . She had never known the clear-cut armies of the purer air .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>hurried through her tinted wonders , very much part of the picture . His was a grey life , and to brighten it he had ruled off few corners for romance . The Miss Schlegels — or , to speak more accurately , his interview with them — were to fill such a corner , nor was it by any means the first time that he had talked intimately to strangers . The habit was analogous to a debauch , an outlet , though the worst of outlets , for instincts that would not be denied . Terrifying him , it would beat down his suspicions and prudence until he was confiding secrets to people whom he had scarcely seen . It brought him many fears and some pleasant memories . Perhaps the keenest happiness he had ever known was during a railway journey to Cambridge , where a decent-mannered undergraduate had spoken to him . They had got into conversation , and gradually<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>flung reticence aside , told some of his domestic troubles and hinted at the rest . The undergraduate , supposing they could start a friendship , asked him to “ coffee after hall , ” which he accepted , but afterwards grew shy , and took care not to stir from the commercial hotel where he lodged . He did not want Romance to collide with<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>, still less with<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>, and people with fuller , happier lives are slow to understand this . To the Schlegels , as to the undergraduate , he was an interesting creature , of whom they wanted to see more . But they to him were denizens of Romance , who must keep to the corner he had assigned them , pictures that must not walk out of their frames .</p>
    <p n="1012">His behaviour over<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s visiting-card had been typical . His had scarcely been a tragic marriage . Where there is no money and no inclination to violence tragedy cannot be generated . He could not leave his wife , and he did not want to hit her . Petulance and squalor were enough . Here “ that card ” had come in .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, though furtive , was untidy , and left it lying about .<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>found it , and then began ,<said who="#Jacky">“ What 's that card , eh ? ”</said><said who="#Jacky">“ Yes , do n't you wish you knew what that card was ? ”</said><said who="#Jacky">“<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Len</persName>, who 's<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>? ”</said>etc . Months passed , and the card , now as a joke , now as a grievance , was handed about , getting dirtier and dirtier . It followed them when they moved from Camelia Road to Tulse Hill . It was submitted to third parties . A few inches of pasteboard , it became the battlefield on which the souls of<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>and his wife contended . Why did he not say , “ A lady took my umbrella , another gave me this that I might call for my umbrella ” ? Because<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>would have disbelieved him ? Partly , but chiefly because he was sentimental . No affection gathered round the card , but it symbolised the life of culture , that<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>should never spoil . At night he would say to himself ,<said who="#Jacky">“ Well , at all events , she does n't know about that card . Yah ! done her there ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1013">Poor<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>! she was not a bad sort , and had a great deal to bear . She drew her own conclusion — she was only capable of drawing one conclusion — and in the fulness of time she acted upon it . All the Friday<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>had refused to speak to her , and had spent the evening observing the stars . On the Saturday he went up , as usual , to town , but he came not back Saturday night , nor Sunday morning , nor Sunday afternoon . The inconvenience grew intolerable , and though she was now of a retiring habit , and shy of women , she went up to Wickham Place .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>returned in her absence . The card , the fatal card , was gone from the pages of<persName corresp="#Ruskin">Ruskin</persName>, and he guessed what had happened .</p>
    <p n="1014"><said who="#Ruskin">“ Well ? ”</said>he had exclaimed , greeting her with peals of laughter .<said who="#Ruskin">“ I know where you 've been , but you do n't know where I 've been . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1015"><persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>sighed , said , “<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Len</persName>, I do think you might explain , ” and resumed domesticity .</p>
    <p n="1016">Explanations were difficult at this stage , and<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>was too silly — or it is tempting to write , too sound a chap to attempt them . His reticence was not entirely the shoddy article that a business life promotes , the reticence that pretends that nothing is something , and hides behind the Daily Telegraph . The adventurer , also , is reticent , and it is an adventure for a clerk to walk for a few hours in darkness . You may laugh at him , you who have slept nights out on the veldt , with your rifle beside you and all the atmosphere of adventure pat . And you also may laugh who think adventures silly . But do not be surprised if<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>is shy whenever he meets you , and if the Schlegels rather than<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>hear about the dawn .</p>
    <p n="1017">That the Schlegels had not thought him foolish became a permanent joy . He was at his best when he thought of them . It buoyed him as he journeyed home beneath fading heavens . Somehow the barriers of wealth had fallen , and there had been — he could not phrase it — a general assertion of the wonder of the world .<said who="#Jacky">“ My conviction , ”</said>says the mystic , “ gains infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it , ” and they had agreed that there was something beyond life 's daily grey . He took off his top-hat and smoothed it thoughtfully . He had hitherto supposed the unknown to be books , literature , clever conversation , culture . One raised oneself by study , and got upsides with the world . But in that quick interchange a new light dawned . Was that “ something ” walking in the dark among the suburban hills ?</p>
    <p n="1018">He discovered that he was going bareheaded down Regent Street . London came back with a rush . Few were about at this hour , but all whom he passed looked at him with a hostility that was the more impressive because it was unconscious . He put his hat on . It was too big ; his head disappeared like a pudding into a basin , the ears bending outwards at the touch of the curly brim . He wore it a little backwards , and its effect was greatly to elongate the face and to bring out the distance between the eyes and the moustache . Thus equipped , he escaped criticism . No one felt uneasy as he titupped along the pavements , the heart of a man ticking fast in his chest .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="15">
    <p n="1019">The sisters went out to dinner full of their adventure , and when they were both full of the same subject , there were few dinner-parties that could stand up against them . This particular one , which was all ladies , had more kick in it than most , but succumbed after a struggle .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>at one part of the table ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>at the other , would talk of<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>and of no one else , and somewhere about the entree their monologues collided , fell ruining , and became common property . Nor was this all . The dinner-party was really an informal discussion club ; there was a paper after it , read amid coffee-cups and laughter in the drawing-room , but dealing more or less thoughtfully with some topic of general interest . After the paper came a debate , and in this debate<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>also figured , appearing now as a bright spot in civilisation , now as a dark spot , according to the temperament of the speaker . The subject of the paper had been ,<said who="#Mr._Bast">“ How ought I to dispose of my money ? ”</said>the reader professing to be a millionaire on the point of death , inclined to bequeath her fortune for the foundation of local art galleries , but open to conviction from other sources . The various parts had been assigned beforehand , and some of the speeches were amusing . The hostess assumed the ungrateful role of “ the millionaire 's eldest son , ” and implored her expiring parent not to dislocate<persName>Society</persName>by allowing such vast sums to pass out of the family . Money was the fruit of self-denial , and the second generation had a right to profit by the self-denial of the first . What right had “<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>” to profit ? The National Gallery was good enough for the likes of him . After property had had its say — a saying that is necessarily ungracious — the various philanthropists stepped forward . Something must be done for “<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>” ; his conditions must be improved without impairing his independence ; he must have a free library , or free tennis-courts ; his rent must be paid in such a way that he did not know it was being paid ; it must be made worth his while to join the Territorials ; he must be forcibly parted from his uninspiring wife , the money going to her as compensation ; he must be assigned a Twin Star , some member of the leisured classes who would watch over him ceaselessly ( groans from<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>) ; he must be given food but no clothes , clothes but no food , a third-return ticket to Venice , without either food or clothes when he arrived there . In short , he might be given anything and everything so long as it was not the money itself .</p>
    <p n="1020">And here<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>interrupted .</p>
    <p n="1021"><said who="#Margaret">“ Order , order ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>! ”</said>said the reader of the paper .<said who="#Margaret">“ You are here , I understand , to advise me in the interests of the<persName>Society</persName>for the Preservation of Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty . I cannot have you speaking out of your role . It makes my poor head go round , and I think you forget that I am very ill . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1022"><said who="#Margaret">“ Your head wo n't go round if only you 'll listen to my argument , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Why not give him the money itself ? You 're supposed to have about thirty thousand a year . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1023"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ Have I ? I thought I had a million . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1024"><said who="#Margaret">“ Was n't a million your capital ? Dear me ! we ought to have settled that . Still , it does n't matter . Whatever you 've got , I order you to give as many poor men as you can three hundred a year each . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1025"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ But that would be pauperising them , ”</said>said an earnest girl , who liked the Schlegels , but thought them a little unspiritual at times .</p>
    <p n="1026"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not if you gave them so much . A big windfall would not pauperise a man . It is these little driblets , distributed among too many , that do the harm . Money 's educational . It 's far more educational than the things it buys . ”</said>There was a protest .<said who="#the_protest">“ In a sense , ”</said>added<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, but the protest continued .<said who="#the_protest">“ Well , is n't the most civilized thing going , the man who has learnt to wear his income properly ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1027"><said who="#Margaret">“ Exactly what your Mr. Basts wo n't do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1028"><said who="#the_protest">“ Give them a chance . Give them money . Do n't dole them out poetry-books and railway-tickets like babies . Give them the wherewithal to buy these things . When your<persName>Socialism</persName>comes it may be different , and we may think in terms of commodities instead of cash . Till it comes give people cash , for it is the warp of civilisation , whatever the woof may be . The imagination ought to play upon money and realise it vividly , for it 's the — the second most important thing in the world . It is so slurred over and hushed up , there is so little clear thinking — oh , political economy , of course , but so few of us think clearly about our own private incomes , and admit that independent thoughts are in nine cases out of ten the result of independent means . Money : give<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>money , and do n't bother about his ideals . He 'll pick up those for himself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1029">She leant back while the more earnest members of the club began to misconstrue her . The female mind , though cruelly practical in daily life , cannot bear to hear ideals belittled in conversation , and<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>was asked however she could say such dreadful things , and what it would profit<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>if he gained the whole world and lost his own soul . She answered ,<said who="#Mr._Bast">“ Nothing , but he would not gain his soul until he had gained a little of the world . ”</said>Then they said , “ No , we do not believe it , ” and she admitted that an overworked clerk may save his soul in the superterrestrial sense , where the effort will be taken for the deed , but she denied that he will ever explore the spiritual resources of this world , will ever know the rarer joys of the body , or attain to clear and passionate intercourse with his fellows . Others had attacked the fabric of<persName>Society</persName>— Property , Interest , etc . ; she only fixed her eyes on a few human beings , to see how , under present conditions , they could be made happier . Doing good to humanity was useless : the many-coloured efforts thereto spreading over the vast area like films and resulting in an universal grey . To do good to one , or , as in this case , to a few , was the utmost she dare hope for .</p>
    <p n="1030">Between the idealists , and the political economists ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had a bad time . Disagreeing elsewhere , they agreed in disowning her , and in keeping the administration of the millionaire 's money in their own hands . The earnest girl brought forward a scheme of “ personal supervision and mutual help , ” the effect of which was to alter poor people until they became exactly like people who were not so poor . The hostess pertinently remarked that she , as eldest son , might surely rank among the millionaire 's legatees .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>weakly admitted the claim , and another claim was at once set up by<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who declared that she had been the millionaire 's housemaid for over forty years , overfed and underpaid ; was nothing to be done for her , so corpulent and poor ? The millionaire then read out her last will and testament , in which she left the whole of her fortune to the Chancellor of the Exchequer . Then she died . The serious parts of the discussion had been of higher merit than the playful — in a men 's debate is the reverse more general ?— but the meeting broke up hilariously enough , and a dozen happy ladies dispersed to their homes .</p>
    <p n="1031"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>walked with the earnest girl as far as Battersea Bridge Station , arguing copiously all the way . When she had gone they were conscious of an alleviation , and of the great beauty of the evening . They turned back towards Oakley Street . The lamps and the plane-trees , following the line of the embankment , struck a note of dignity that is rare in English cities . The seats , almost deserted , were here and there occupied by gentlefolk in evening dress , who had strolled out from the houses behind to enjoy fresh air and the whisper of the rising tide . There is something continental about Chelsea Embankment . It is an open space used rightly , a blessing more frequent in Germany than here . As<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>sat down , the city behind them seemed to be a vast theatre , an opera-house in which some endless trilogy was performing , and they themselves a pair of satisfied subscribers , who did not mind losing a little of the second act .</p>
    <p n="1032"><said who="#Helen">“ Cold ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1033"><said who="#Margaret">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1034"><said who="#Helen">“ Tired ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1035"><said who="#Margaret">“ Does n't matter . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1036">The earnest girl 's train rumbled away over the bridge ,<said who="#Margaret">“ I say ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1037"><said who="#Helen">“ Well ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1038"><said who="#Margaret">“ Are we really going to follow up<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1039"><said who="#Helen">“ I do n't know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1040"><said who="#Margaret">“ I think we wo n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1041"><said who="#Helen">“ As you like . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1042"><said who="#Margaret">“ It 's no good , I think , unless you really mean to know people . The discussion brought that home to me . We got on well enough with him in a spirit of excitement , but think of rational intercourse . We must n't play at friendship . No , it 's no good . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1043"><said who="#Helen">“ There 's<persName>Mrs. Lanoline</persName>, too , ”</said><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>yawned .<said who="#Helen">“ So dull . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1044"><said who="#Margaret">“ Just so , and possibly worse than dull . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1045"><said who="#Helen">“ I should like to know how he got hold of your card . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1046"><said who="#Margaret">“ But he said — something about a concert and an umbrella . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1047"><said who="#Helen">“ Then did the card see the wife — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1048"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, come to bed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1049"><said who="#Helen">“ No , just a little longer , it is so beautiful . Tell me ; oh yes ; did you say money is the warp of the world ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1050"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1051"><said who="#Helen">“ Then what 's the woof ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1052"><said who="#Margaret">“ Very much what one chooses , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ It 's something that is n't money — one can n't say more . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1053"><said who="#Helen">“ Walking at night ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1054"><said who="#Margaret">“ Probably . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1055"><said who="#Helen">“ For<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, Oxford ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1056"><said who="#Margaret">“ It seems so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1057"><said who="#Helen">“ For you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1058"><said who="#Margaret">“ Now that we have to leave Wickham Place , I begin to think it 's that . For<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>it was certainly Howards End . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1059">One 's own name will carry immense distances .<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, who was sitting with friends many seats away , heard this , rose to his feet , and strolled along towards the speakers .</p>
    <p n="1060"><said who="#Margaret">“ It is sad to suppose that places may ever be more important than people , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1061"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Why ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>? They 're so much nicer generally . I 'd rather think of that forester 's house in Pomerania than of the fat Herr Forstmeister who lived in it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1062"><said who="#Margaret">“ I believe we shall come to care about people less and less ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. The more people one knows the easier it becomes to replace them . It 's one of the curses of London . I quite expect to end my life caring most for a place . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1063">Here<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>reached them . It was several weeks since they had met .</p>
    <p n="1064"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ How do you do ? ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I thought I recognised your voices . Whatever are you both doing down here ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1065">His tones were protective . He implied that one ought not to sit out on Chelsea Embankment without a male escort .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>resented this , but<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>accepted it as part of the good man 's equipment .</p>
    <p n="1066"><said who="#Margaret">“ What an age it is since I 've seen you ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. I met<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>in the Tube , though , lately . I hope you have good news of your son . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1067"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, extinguishing his cigarette , and sitting down between them .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>'s all right . We had a line from Madeira . He 'll be at work again by now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1068"><said who="#Helen">“ Ugh — ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, shuddering from complex causes .</p>
    <p n="1069"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I beg your pardon ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1070"><said who="#Helen">“ Is n't the climate of Nigeria too horrible ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1071"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Some one 's got to go , ”</said>he said simply .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ England will never keep her trade overseas unless she is prepared to make sacrifices . Unless we get firm in West Africa , Ger — untold complications may follow . Now tell me all your news . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1072"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh , we 've had a splendid evening , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who always woke up at the advent of a visitor .<said who="#Helen">“ We belong to a kind of club that reads papers ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and I — all women , but there is a discussion after . This evening it was on how one ought to leave one 's money — whether to one 's family , or to the poor , and if so how — oh , most interesting . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1073">The man of business smiled . Since his wife 's death he had almost doubled his income . He was an important figure at last , a reassuring name on company prospectuses , and life had treated him very well . The world seemed in his grasp as he listened to the River Thames , which still flowed inland from the sea . So wonderful to the girls , it held no mysteries for him . He had helped to shorten its long tidal trough by taking shares in the lock at Teddington , and if he and other capitalists thought good , some day it could be shortened again . With a good dinner inside him and an amiable but academic woman on either flank , he felt that his hands were on all the ropes of life , and that what he did not know could not be worth knowing .</p>
    <p n="1074"><said who="#Helen">“ Sounds a most original entertainment ! ”</said>he exclaimed , and laughed in his pleasant way .<said who="#Helen">“ I wish<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>would go to that sort of thing . But she has n't the time . She 's taken to breeding Aberdeen terriers — jolly little dogs . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1075"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I expect we 'd better be doing the same , really . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1076"><said who="#Helen">“ We pretend we 're improving ourselves , you see , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>a little sharply , for the Wilcox glamour is not of the kind that returns , and she had bitter memories of the days when a speech such as he had just made would have impressed her favourably .<said who="#Helen">“ We suppose it a good thing to waste an evening once a fortnight over a debate , but , as my sister says , it may be better to breed dogs . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1077"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Not at all . I do n't agree with your sister . There 's nothing like a debate to teach one quickness . I often wish I had gone in for them when I was a youngster . It would have helped me no end . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1078"><said who="#Helen">“ Quickness —? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1079"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Yes . Quickness in argument . Time after time I 've missed scoring a point because the other man has had the gift of the gab and I have n't . Oh , I believe in these discussions . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1080">The patronising tone , thought<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, came well enough from a man who was old enough to be their father . She had always maintained that<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>had a charm . In times of sorrow or emotion his inadequacy had pained her , but it was pleasant to listen to him now , and to watch his thick brown moustache and high forehead confronting the stars . But<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was nettled . The aim of their debates she implied was Truth .</p>
    <p n="1081"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh yes , it does n't much matter what subject you take , ”</said>said he .</p>
    <p n="1082"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>laughed and said ,<said who="#Helen">“ But this is going to be far better than the debate itself . ”</said><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>recovered herself and laughed too .<said who="#Helen">“ No , I wo n't go on , ”</said>she declared .<said who="#Helen">“ I 'll just put our special case to<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1083"><said who="#Margaret">“ About<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>? Yes , do . He 'll be more lenient to a special case . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1084"><said who="#Helen">“ But ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, do first light another cigarette . It 's this . We 've just come across a young fellow , who 's evidently very poor , and who seems interest — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1085"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ What 's his profession ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1086"><said who="#Helen">“ Clerk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1087"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ What in ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1088"><said who="#Helen">“ Do you remember ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1089"><said who="#Margaret">“ Porphyrion Fire Insurance Company . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1090"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh yes ; the nice people who gave<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>a new hearth rug . He seems interesting , in some ways very , and one wishes one could help him . He is married to a wife whom he does n't seem to care for much . He likes books , and what one may roughly call adventure , and if he had a chance — But he is so poor . He lives a life where all the money is apt to go on nonsense and clothes . One is so afraid that circumstances will be too strong for him and that he will sink . Well , he got mixed up in our debate . He was n't the subject of it , but it seemed to bear on his point . Suppose a millionaire died , and desired to leave money to help such a man . How should he be helped ? Should he be given three hundred pounds a year direct , which was<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s plan ? Most of them thought this would pauperise him . Should he and those like him be given free libraries ? I said ‘ No ! ’ He does n't want more books to read , but to read books rightly . My suggestion was he should be given something every year towards a summer holiday , but then there is his wife , and they said she would have to go too . Nothing seemed quite right ! Now what do you think ? Imagine that you were a millionaire , and wanted to help the poor . What would you do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1091"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, whose fortune was not so very far below the standard indicated , laughed exuberantly .<said who="#Margaret">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, I will not rush in where your sex has been unable to tread . I will not add another plan to the numerous excellent ones that have been already suggested . My only contribution is this : let your young friend clear out of<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>Fire Insurance Company with all possible speed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1092"><said who="#Margaret">“ Why ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1093">He lowered his voice .<said who="#Margaret">“ This is between friends . It 'll be in the Receiver 's hands before Christmas . It 'll smash , ”</said>he added , thinking that she had not understood .</p>
    <p n="1094"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Dear me ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, listen to that . And he 'll have to get another place ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1095"><said who="#Helen">“ WILL have ? Let him leave the ship before it sinks . Let him get one now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1096"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Rather than wait , to make sure ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1097"><said who="#Helen">“ Decidedly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1098"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Why 's that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1099">Again the Olympian laugh , and the lowered voice .<said who="#Helen">“ Naturally the man who 's in a situation when he applies stands a better chance , is in a stronger position , that the man who is n't . It looks as if he 's worth something . I know by myself — ( this is letting you into the State secrets ) — it affects an employer greatly . Human nature , I 'm afraid . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1100"><said who="#Margaret">“ I had n't thought of that , ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, while<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>said ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Our human nature appears to be the other way round . We employ people because they 're unemployed . The boot man , for instance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1101"><said who="#Helen">“ And how does he clean the boots ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1102"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not well , ”</said>confessed<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1103"><said who="#Helen">“ There you are ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1104"><said who="#Margaret">“ Then do you really advise us to tell this youth —? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1105"><said who="#Helen">“ I advise nothing , ”</said>he interrupted , glancing up and down the Embankment , in case his indiscretion had been overheard .<said who="#Helen">“ I ought n't to have spoken — but I happen to know , being more or less behind the scenes .<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">The Porphyrion</persName>'s a bad , bad concern — Now , do n't say I said so . It 's outside the Tariff Ring . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1106"><said who="#Margaret">“ Certainly I wo n't say . In fact , I do n't know what that means . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1107"><said who="#Helen">“ I thought an insurance company never smashed , ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s contribution .<said who="#Helen">“ Do n't the others always run in and save them ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1108"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ You 're thinking of reinsurance , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>mildly .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ It is exactly there that<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>is weak . It has tried to undercut , has been badly hit by a long series of small fires , and it has n't been able to reinsure . I 'm afraid that public companies do n't save one another for love . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1109"><said who="#Helen">“ ‘ Human nature , ’ I suppose , ”</said>quoted<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, and he laughed and agreed that it was . When<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>said that she supposed that clerks , like every one else , found it extremely difficult to get situations in these days , he replied , “ Yes , extremely , ” and rose to rejoin his friends . He knew by his own office — seldom a vacant post , and hundreds of applicants for it ; at present no vacant post .</p>
    <p n="1110"><said who="#Margaret">“ And how 's Howards End looking ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, wishing to change the subject before they parted .<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>was a little apt to think one wanted to get something out of him .</p>
    <p n="1111"><said who="#Helen">“ It 's let . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1112"><said who="#Margaret">“ Really . And you wandering homeless in longhaired Chelsea ? How strange are the ways of Fate ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1113"><said who="#Helen">“ No ; it 's let unfurnished . We 've moved . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1114"><said who="#Margaret">“ Why , I thought of you both as anchored there for ever .<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>never told me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1115"><said who="#Helen">“ I dare say when you met<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>the thing was n't settled . We only moved a week ago .<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>has rather a feeling for the old place , and we held on for him to have his holiday there ; but , really , it is impossibly small . Endless drawbacks . I forget whether you 've been up to it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1116"><said who="#Margaret">“ As far as the house , never . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1117"><said who="#Helen">“ Well , Howards End is one of those converted farms . They do n't really do , spend what you will on them . We messed away with a garage all among the wych-elm roots , and last year we enclosed a bit of the meadow and attempted a rockery .<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>got rather keen on Alpine plants . But it did n't do — no , it did n't do . You remember , your sister will remember , the farm with those abominable guinea-fowls , and the hedge that the old woman never would cut properly , so that it all went thin at the bottom . And , inside the house , the beams — and the staircase through a door — picturesque enough , but not a place to live in . ”</said>He glanced over the parapet cheerfully .<said who="#Helen">“ Full tide . And the position was n't right either . The neighbourhood 's getting suburban . Either be in London or out of it , I say ; so we 've taken a house in Ducie Street , close to Sloane Street , and a place right down in Shropshire —<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>Grange . Ever heard of<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>? Do come and see us — right away from everywhere , up towards Wales . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1118"><said who="#Margaret">“ What a change ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. But the change was in her own voice , which had become most sad .<said who="#Margaret">“ I can n't imagine Howards End or Hilton without you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1119"><said who="#Margaret">“ Hilton is n't without us , ”</said>he replied .<said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>is there still . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1121"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , but they moved eighteen months ago .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, the good chap ”</said>— his voice dropped —<said who="#Margaret">“ thought I should be lonely .

    <p n="1126"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ And some people are lucky enough to have both . You 're doing yourself proud ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. My congratulations . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1128"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Do remind<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>to come and see us — 2 Wickham Place . We sha n't be there very long , either . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1130"><said who="#Margaret">“ Next September , ”</said><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>sighed .</p>
    <p n="1131"><said who="#Helen">“ Every one moving ! Good-bye . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1132">The tide had begun to ebb .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>leant over the parapet and watched it sadly .<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>had forgotten his wife ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>her lover ; she herself was probably forgetting . Every one moving . Is it worth while attempting the past when there is this continual flux even in the hearts of men ?</p>
    <p n="1133"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>roused her by saying :<said who="#Helen">“ What a prosperous vulgarian<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>has grown ! I have very little use for him in these days . However , he did tell us about<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>.

    <p n="1135"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>accepted the invitation to tea next Saturday . But he was right ; the visit proved a conspicuous failure .</p>
    <p n="1136"><said who="#Margaret">“ Sugar ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1137"><said who="#Margaret">“ Cake ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ The big cake or the little deadlies ? I 'm afraid you thought my letter rather odd , but we 'll explain — we are n't odd , really — nor affected , really . We 're over-expressive — that 's all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1138">As a lady 's lap-dog<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>did not excel . He was not an Italian , still less a Frenchman , in whose blood there runs the very spirit of persiflage and of gracious repartee . His wit was the Cockney 's ; it opened no doors into imagination , and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was drawn up short by “ The more a lady has to say , the better , ” administered waggishly .</p>
    <p n="1139"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh yes , ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="1140"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Ladies brighten — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1141"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , I know . The darlings are regular sunbeams . Let me give you a plate . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1142"><said who="#Margaret">“ How do you like your work ? ”</said>interposed<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1143">He , too , was drawn up short . He would not have these women prying into his work . They were Romance , and so was the room to which he had at last penetrated , with the queer sketches of people bathing upon its walls , and so were the very tea-cups , with their delicate borders of wild strawberries . But he would not let romance interfere with his life . There is the devil to pay then .</p>
    <p n="1144"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , well enough , ”</said>he answered .</p>
    <p n="1145"><said who="#Helen">“ Your company is<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>, is n't it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1146"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , that 's so . ”</said>— becoming rather offended .<said who="#Margaret">“ It 's funny how things get round . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1147"><said who="#Helen">“ Why funny ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who did not follow the workings of his mind .<said who="#Helen">“ It was written as large as life on your card , and considering we wrote to you there , and that you replied on the stamped paper — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1148"><said who="#Margaret">“ Would you call<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>one of the big Insurance Companies ? ”</said>pursued<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1149"><said who="#Helen">“ It depends on what you call big . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1150"><said who="#Margaret">“ I mean by big , a solid , well-established concern , that offers a reasonably good career to its employes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1151"><said who="#the_employe">“ I could n't say — some would tell you one thing and others another , ”</said>said the employe uneasily .<said who="#the_employe">“ For my own part ”</said>— he shook his head —<said who="#the_employe">“ I only believe half I hear . Not that even ; it 's safer . Those clever ones come to the worse grief , I 've often noticed . Ah , you can n't be too careful . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1152">He drank , and wiped his moustache , which was going to be one of those moustaches that always droop into tea-cups — more bother than they 're worth , surely , and not fashionable either .</p>
    <p n="1153"><said who="#Margaret">“ I quite agree , and that 's why I was curious to know ; is it a solid , well-established concern ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1154"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>had no idea . He understood his own corner of the machine , but nothing beyond it . He desired to confess neither knowledge nor ignorance , and under these circumstances , another motion of the head seemed safest . To him , as to the British public ,<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>was<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>of the advertisement — a giant , in the classical style , but draped sufficiently , who held in one hand a burning torch , and pointed with the other to<persName>St. Paul</persName>'s and Windsor Castle . A large sum of money was inscribed below , and you drew your own conclusions . This giant caused<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>to do arithmetic and write letters , to explain the regulations to new clients , and re-explain them to old ones . A giant was of an impulsive morality — one knew that much . He would pay for<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>'s hearthrug with ostentatious haste , a large claim he would repudiate quietly , and fight court by court . But his true fighting weight , his antecedents , his amours with other members of the commercial Pantheon — all these were as uncertain to ordinary mortals as were the escapades of Zeus . While the gods are powerful , we learn little about them . It is only in the days of their decadence that a strong light beats into heaven .</p>
    <p n="1155"><said who="#Helen">“ We were told<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>'s no go , ”</said>blurted<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ We wanted to tell you ; that 's why we wrote . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1156"><said who="#Margaret">“ A friend of ours did think that it is insufficiently reinsured , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1157">Now<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>had his clue .</p>
    <p n="1158">He must praise<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>.<said who="#the_Porphyrion">“ You can tell your friend , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#the_Porphyrion">“ that he 's quite wrong . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1159"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Oh , good ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1160">The young man coloured a little . In his circle to be wrong was fatal . The Miss Schlegels did not mind being wrong . They were genuinely glad that they had been misinformed . To them nothing was fatal but evil .</p>
    <p n="1161"><said who="#the_Porphyrion">“ Wrong , so to speak , ”</said>he added .</p>
    <p n="1162"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ How ‘ so to speak ’ ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1163"><said who="#the_Porphyrion">“ I mean I would n't say he 's right altogether . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1164">But this was a blunder .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Then he is right partly , ”</said>said the elder woman , quick as lightning .</p>
    <p n="1165"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>replied that every one was right partly , if it came to that .</p>
    <p n="1166"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>, I do n't understand business , and I dare say my questions are stupid , but can you tell me what makes a concern ‘ right ’ or ‘ wrong ’ ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1167"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>sat back with a sigh .</p>
    <p n="1168"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Our friend , who is also a business man , was so positive . He said before Christmas — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1169"><said who="#Helen">“ And advised you to clear out of it , ”</said>concluded<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ But I do n't see why he should know better than you do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1170"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>rubbed his hands . He was tempted to say that he knew nothing about the thing at all . But a commercial training was too strong for him . Nor could he say it was a bad thing , for this would be giving it away ; nor yet that it was good , for this would be giving it away equally . He attempted to suggest that it was something between the two , with vast possibilities in either direction , but broke down under the gaze of four sincere eyes . And yet he scarcely distinguished between the two sisters . One was more beautiful and more lively , but “ the Miss Schlegels ” still remained a composite Indian god , whose waving arms and contradictory speeches were the product of a single mind .</p>
    <p n="1171"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ One can but see , ”</said>he remarked , adding , “ as Ibsen says , ‘ things happen . ’ ” He was itching to talk about books and make the most of his romantic hour . Minute after minute slipped away , while the ladies , with imperfect skill , discussed the subject of reinsurance or praised their anonymous friend .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>grew annoyed — perhaps rightly . He made vague remarks about not being one of those who minded their affairs being talked over by others , but they did not take the hint . Men might have shown more tact . Women , however tactful elsewhere , are heavy-handed here . They cannot see why we should shroud our incomes and our prospects in a veil .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ How much exactly have you , and how much do you expect to have next June ? ”</said>And these were women with a theory , who held that reticence about money matters is absurd , and that life would be truer if each would state the exact size of the golden island upon which he stands , the exact stretch of warp over which he throws the woof that is not money . How can we do justice to the pattern otherwise ?</p>
    <p n="1172">And the precious minutes slipped away , and<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>and squalor came nearer . At last he could bear it no longer , and broke in , reciting the names of books feverishly . There was a moment of piercing joy when<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>said , “ So YOU like Carlyle ” and then the door opened , and “<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, Miss Wilcox ” entered , preceded by two prancing puppies .</p>
    <p n="1173"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh , the dears ! Oh ,<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, how too impossibly sweet ! ”</said>screamed<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, falling on her hands and knees .</p>
    <p n="1174"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ We brought the little fellows round , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1175"><said who="#Helen">“ I bred ‘ em myself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1176"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Oh , really !<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>, come and play with puppies . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1177"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I 've got to be going now , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>sourly .</p>
    <p n="1178"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ But play with puppies a little first . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1179"><said who="#Evie">“ This is Ahab , that 's Jezebel , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, who was one of those who name animals after the less successful characters of Old Testament history .</p>
    <p n="1180"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I 've got to be going . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1181"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was too much occupied with puppies to notice him .</p>
    <p n="1182"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, Mr. Ba —— Must you be really ?</said></p>
    <p n="1183"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Good-bye ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1184"><said who="#Helen">“ Come again , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>from the floor .</p>
    <p n="1185">Then<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>'s gorge arose . Why should he come again ? What was the good of it ? He said roundly :<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ No , I sha n't ; I knew it would be a failure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1186">Most people would have let him go .<said who="#Helen">“ A little mistake . We tried knowing another class — impossible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1187">But the Schlegels had never played with life . They had attempted friendship , and they would take the consequences .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>retorted ,<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I call that a very rude remark . What do you want to turn on me like that for ? ”</said>and suddenly the drawing-room re-echoed to a vulgar row .</p>
    <p n="1188"><said who="#Helen">“ You ask me why I turn on you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1189"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1190"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ What do you want to have me here for ? ’</said></p>
    <p n="1191"><said who="#Helen">“ To help you , you silly boy ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ And do n't shout . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1192"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I do n't want your patronage . I do n't want your tea . I was quite happy . What do you want to unsettle me for ? ”</said>He turned to<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>.<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I put it to this gentleman . I ask you , sir , am I to have my brain picked ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1193"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>turned to<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>with the air of humorous strength that he could so well command .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Are we intruding ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>? Can we be of any use , or shall we go ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1194">But<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>ignored him .</p>
    <p n="1195"><said who="#Margaret">“ I 'm connected with a leading insurance company , sir . I receive what I take to be an invitation from these — ladies ”</said>( he drawled the word ) .<said who="#Margaret">“ I come , and it 's to have my brain picked . I ask you , is it fair ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1196"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Highly unfair , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, drawing a gasp from<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, who knew that her father was becoming dangerous .</p>
    <p n="1197"><said who="#Margaret">“ There , you hear that ? Most unfair , the gentleman says . There ! Not content with ”</said>— pointing at<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>—<said who="#Jacky">“ you can n't deny it . ”</said>His voice rose ; he was falling into the rhythm of a scene with<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>.<said who="#Jacky">“ But as soon as I 'm useful it 's a very different thing . ‘ Oh yes , send for him . Cross-question him . Pick his brains . ’ Oh yes . Now , take me on the whole , I 'm a quiet fellow : I 'm law-abiding , I do n't wish any unpleasantness ; but I — I — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1198"><said who="#Margaret">“ You , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>—<said who="#Margaret">“ you — you — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1199">Laughter from<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>as at a repartee .</p>
    <p n="1200"><said who="#Margaret">“ You are the man who tried to walk by the Pole Star . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1203">Laughter .</p>
    <p n="1204"><said who="#Margaret">“ You tried to get away from the fogs that are stifling us all — away past books and houses to the truth . You were looking for a real home . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1205"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I fail to see the connection , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, hot with stupid anger .</p>
    <p n="1206"><said who="#Margaret">“ So do I . ”</said>There was a pause .<said who="#Margaret">“ You were that last Sunday — you are this to-day .<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>! I and my sister have talked you over . We wanted to help you ; we also supposed you might help us . We did not have you here out of charity — which bores us — but because we hoped there would be a connection between last Sunday and other days . What is the good of your stars and trees , your sunrise and the wind , if they do not enter into our daily lives ? They have never entered into mine , but into yours , we thought — Have n't we all to struggle against life 's daily greyness , against pettiness , against mechanical cheerfulness , against suspicion ? I struggle by remembering my friends ; others I have known by remembering some place — some beloved place or tree — we thought you one of these . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1236"><said who="#Margaret">“ Exactly . How indeed ! Just horrible , corroding suspicion . One touch of thought or of goodwill would have brushed it away . Just the senseless fear that does make men intolerable brutes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1237"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I come back to my original point . You ought to be more careful ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>. Your servants ought to have orders not to let such people in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1238">She turned to him frankly .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Let me explain exactly why we like this man , and want to see him again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1239"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ That 's your clever way of talking . I shall never believe you like him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1240"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ I do . Firstly , because he cares for physical adventure , just as you do . Yes , you go motoring and shooting ; he would like to go camping out . Secondly , he cares for something special IN adventure . It is quickest to call that special something poetry — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1241"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Oh , he 's one of that writer sort . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1242"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ No — oh no ! I mean he may be , but it would be loathsome stuff . His brain is filled with the husks of books , culture — horrible ; we want him to wash out his brain and go to the real thing . We want to show him how he may get upsides with life . As I said , either friends or the country , some ”</said>— she hesitated —<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ either some very dear person or some very dear place seems necessary to relieve life 's daily grey , and to show that it is grey . If possible , one should have both . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1243">Some of her words ran past<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. He let them run past . Others he caught and criticised with admirable lucidity .</p>
    <p n="1244"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Your mistake is this , and it is a very common mistake . This young bounder has a life of his own . What right have you to conclude it is an unsuccessful life , or , as you call it , ‘ grey ’ ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1245"><said who="#Margaret">“ Because — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1246">“ One minute . You know nothing about him . He probably has his own joys and interests — wife , children , snug little home . That 's where we practical fellows ” he smiled —<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ are more tolerant than you intellectuals . We live and let live , and assume that things are jogging on fairly well elsewhere , and that the ordinary plain man may be trusted to look after his own affairs . I quite grant — I look at the faces of the clerks in my own office , and observe them to be dull , but I do n't know what 's going on beneath . So , by the way , with London . I have heard you rail against London ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, and it seems a funny thing to say but I was very angry with you . What do you know about London ? You only see civilisation from the outside . I do n't say in your case , but in too many cases that attitude leads to morbidity , discontent , and<persName>Socialism</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1247">She admitted the strength of his position , though it undermined imagination . As he spoke , some outposts of poetry and perhaps of sympathy fell ruining , and she retreated to what she called her “ second line ” — to the special facts of the case .</p>
    <p n="1248"><said who="#Margaret">“ His wife is an old bore , ”</said>she said simply .<said who="#Margaret">“ He never came home last Saturday night because he wanted to be alone , and she thought he was with us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1249"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ With YOU ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1250"><said who="#Evie">“ Yes . ”</said><persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>tittered .<said who="#Evie">“ He has n't got the cosy home that you assumed . He needs outside interests . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1251"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Naughty young man ! ”</said>cried the girl .</p>
    <p n="1252"><said who="#Margaret">“ Naughty ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who hated naughtiness more than sin .<said who="#Margaret">“ When you 're married Miss Wilcox , wo n't you want outside interests ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1253"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ He has apparently got them , ”</said>put in<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>slyly .</p>
    <p n="1254"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , indeed , father . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1255"><said who="#Margaret">“ He was tramping in Surrey , if you mean that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, pacing away rather crossly .</p>
    <p n="1256"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Oh , I dare say ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1257"><said who="#Margaret">“ Miss Wilcox , he was ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1258"><said who="#Margaret">“ M — m — m — m ! ”</said>from<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, who thought the episode amusing , if risque . With most ladies he would not have discussed it , but he was trading on<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s reputation as an emancipated woman .</p>
    <p n="1259"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ He said so , and about such a thing he would n't lie . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1260">They both began to laugh .</p>
    <p n="1261"><said who="#Margaret">“ That 's where I differ from you . Men lie about their positions and prospects , but not about a thing of that sort . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1262">He shook his head .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, excuse me , but I know the type . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1263"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ I said before — he is n't a type . He cares about adventures rightly . He ‘ s certain that our smug existence is n't all . He 's vulgar and hysterical and bookish , but do n't think that sums him up . There 's manhood in him as well . Yes , that 's what I 'm trying to say . He 's a real man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1264">As she spoke their eyes met , and it was as if<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>'s defences fell . She saw back to the real man in him . Unwittingly she had touched his emotions .</p>
    <p n="1265">A woman and two men — they had formed the magic triangle of sex , and the male was thrilled to jealousy , in case the female was attracted by another male .<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>, say the ascetics , reveals our shameful kinship with the beasts . Be it so : one can bear that ; jealousy is the real shame . It is jealousy , not love , that connects us with the farmyard intolerably , and calls up visions of two angry cocks and a complacent hen .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>crushed complacency down because she was civilised .<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, uncivilised , continued to feel anger long after he had rebuilt his defences , and was again presenting a bastion to the world .</p>
    <p n="1266"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, you 're a pair of dear creatures , but you really MUST be careful in this uncharitable world . What does your brother say ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1267"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ I forget . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1268"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Surely he has some opinion ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1269"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ He laughs , if I remember correctly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1270"><said who="#Evie">“ He 's very clever , is n't he ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, who had met and detested<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>at Oxford .</p>
    <p n="1271"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Yes , pretty well — but I wonder what<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s doing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1272"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ She is very young to undertake this sort of thing , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1273"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>went out to the landing . She heard no sound , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>'s topper was missing from the hall .</p>
    <p n="1274"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>! ”</said>she called .</p>
    <p n="1275"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes ! ”</said>replied a voice from the library .</p>
    <p n="1276"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ You in there ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1277"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes — he 's gone some time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1278"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>went to her .<said who="#Mr._Bast">“ Why , you 're all alone , ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="1279"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes — it 's all right ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>. Poor , poor creature — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1280"><said who="#Margaret">“ Come back to the Wilcoxes and tell me later — Mr. W much concerned , and slightly titillated . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1281"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh , I 've no patience with him . I hate him . Poor dear<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>! he wanted to talk literature , and we would talk business . Such a muddle of a man , and yet so worth pulling through . I like him extraordinarily . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1282"><said who="#Margaret">“ Well done , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, kissing her ,<said who="#Margaret">“ but come into the drawing-room now , and do n't talk about him to the Wilcoxes . Make light of the whole thing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1283"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>came and behaved with a cheerfulness that reassured their visitor — this hen at all events was fancy-free .</p>
    <p n="1284"><said who="#Helen">“ He 's gone with my blessing , ”</said>she cried ,<said who="#Helen">“ and now for puppies . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1285">As they drove away ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>said to his daughter :</p>
    <p n="1286"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I am really concerned at the way those girls go on . They are as clever as you make ‘ em , but unpractical — God bless me ! One of these days they 'll go too far . Girls like that ought n't to live alone in London . Until they marry , they ought to have some one to look after them . We must look in more often — we 're better than no one . You like them , do n't you ,<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1287"><persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>replied :<said who="#Evie">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s right enough , but I can n't stand the toothy one . And I should n't have called either of them girls . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1288"><persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>had grown up handsome . Dark-eyed , with the glow of youth under sunburn , built firmly and firm-lipped , she was the best the Wilcoxes could do in the way of feminine beauty . For the present , puppies and her father were the only things she loved , but the net of matrimony was being prepared for her , and a few days later she was attracted to a Mr. Percy<persName corresp="#Cahill">Cahill</persName>, an uncle of Mrs.<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s , and he was attracted to her .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="17">
    <p n="1289">The Age of Property holds bitter moments even for a proprietor . When a move is imminent , furniture becomes ridiculous , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>now lay awake at nights wondering where , where on earth they and all their belongings would be deposited in September next . Chairs , tables , pictures , books , that had rumbled down to them through the generations , must rumble forward again like a slide of rubbish to which she longed to give the final push , and send toppling into the sea . But there were all their father 's books — they never read them , but they were their father 's , and must be kept . There was the marble-topped chiffonier — their mother had set store by it , they could not remember why . Round every knob and cushion in the house gathered a sentiment that was at times personal , but more often a faint piety to the dead , a prolongation of rites that might have ended at the grave .</p>
    <p n="1290">It was absurd , if you came to think of it ;<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>came to think of it ;<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was too busy with the house-agents . The feudal ownership of land did bring dignity , whereas the modern ownership of movables is reducing us again to a nomadic horde . We are reverting to the civilisation of luggage , and historians of the future will note how the middle classes accreted possessions without taking root in the earth , and may find in this the secret of their imaginative poverty . The Schlegels were certainly the poorer for the loss of Wickham Place . It had helped to balance their lives , and almost to counsel them . Nor is their ground-landlord spiritually the richer . He has built flats on its site , his motor-cars grow swifter , his exposures of<persName>Socialism</persName>more trenchant . But he has spilt the precious distillation of the years , and no chemistry of his can give it back to society again .</p>
    <p n="1291"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>grew depressed ; she was anxious to settle on a house before they left town to pay their annual visit to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>. She enjoyed this visit , and wanted to have her mind at ease for it . Swanage , though dull , was stable , and this year she longed more than usual for its fresh air and for the magnificent downs that guard it on the north . But London thwarted her ; in its atmosphere she could not concentrate . London only stimulates , it cannot sustain ; and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, hurrying over its surface for a house without knowing what sort of a house she wanted , was paying for many a thrilling sensation in the past . She could not even break loose from culture , and her time was wasted by concerts which it would be a sin to miss , and invitations which it would never do to refuse . At last she grew desperate ; she resolved that she would go nowhere and be at home to no one until she found a house , and broke the resolution in half an hour .</p>
    <p n="1292">Once she had humorously lamented that she had never been to<persName corresp="#Simpson">Simpson</persName>'s restaurant in the Strand . Now a note arrived from Miss Wilcox , asking her to lunch there . Mr<persName corresp="#Cahill">Cahill</persName>was coming and the three would have such a jolly chat , and perhaps end up at the Hippodrome .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had no strong regard for<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, and no desire to meet her fiance , and she was surprised that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who had been far funnier about<persName corresp="#Simpson">Simpson</persName>'s , had not been asked instead . But the invitation touched her by its intimate tone . She must know<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>Wilcox better than she supposed , and declaring that she “ simply must , ” she accepted .</p>
    <p n="1293">But when she saw<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>at the entrance of the restaurant , staring fiercely at nothing after the fashion of athletic women , her heart failed her anew . Miss Wilcox had changed perceptibly since her engagement . Her voice was gruffer , her manner more downright , and she was inclined to patronise the more foolish virgin .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was silly enough to be pained at this . Depressed at her isolation , she saw not only houses and furniture , but the vessel of life itself slipping past her , with people like<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>and Mr.<persName corresp="#Cahill">Cahill</persName>on board .</p>
    <p n="1294">There are moments when virtue and wisdom fail us , and one of them came to her at<persName corresp="#Simpson">Simpson</persName>'s in the Strand . As she trod the staircase , narrow , but carpeted thickly , as she entered the eating-room , where saddles of mutton were being trundled up to expectant clergymen , she had a strong , if erroneous , conviction of her own futility , and wished she had never come out of her backwater , where nothing happened except art and literature , and where no one ever got married or succeeded in remaining engaged . Then came a little surprise .<said who="#Cahill">“ Father might be of the party — yes , father was . ”</said>With a smile of pleasure she moved forward to greet him , and her feeling of loneliness vanished .</p>
    <p n="1295"><said who="#Simpson">“ I thought I 'd get round if I could , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Simpson">“<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>told me of her little plan , so I just slipped in and secured a table . Always secure a table first .<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, do n't pretend you want to sit by your old father , because you do n't .<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, come in my side , out of pity . My goodness , but you look tired ! Been worrying round after your young clerks ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1296"><said who="#Margaret">“ No , after houses , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, edging past him into the box .<said who="#Margaret">“ I 'm hungry , not tired ; I want to eat heaps . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1297"><said who="#Cahill">“ That 's good . What 'll you have ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1298"><said who="#Margaret">“ Fish pie , ”</said>said she , with a glance at the menu .</p>
    <p n="1299"><said who="#Cahill">“ Fish pie ! Fancy coming for fish pie to<persName corresp="#Simpson">Simpson</persName>'s . It 's not a bit the thing to go for here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1300"><said who="#Margaret">“ Go for something for me , then , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, pulling off her gloves . Her spirits were rising , and his reference to<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard Bast</persName>had warmed her curiously .</p>
    <p n="1301"><said who="#Cahill">“ Saddle of mutton , ”</said>said he after profound reflection ;<said who="#Cahill">“ and cider to drink . That 's the type of thing . I like this place , for a joke , once in a way . It is so thoroughly Old English . Do n't you agree ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1302"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who did n't . The order was given , the joint rolled up , and the carver , under<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>'s direction , cut the meat where it was succulent , and piled their plates high . Mr.<persName corresp="#Cahill">Cahill</persName>insisted on sirloin , but admitted that he had made a mistake later on . He and<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>soon fell into a conversation of the “ No , I did n't ; yes , you did ” type — conversation which , though fascinating to those who are engaged in it , neither desires nor deserves the attention of others .</p>
    <p n="1303"><said who="#Cahill">“ It 's a golden rule to tip the carver . Tip everywhere 's my motto . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1304"><said who="#Margaret">“ Perhaps it does make life more human . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1305"><said who="#Cahill">“ Then the fellows know one again . Especially in the East , if you tip , they remember you from year 's end to year 's end . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1306"><said who="#Margaret">“ Have you been in the East ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1307"><said who="#Cahill">“ Oh , Greece and the Levant . I used to go out for sport and business to Cyprus ; some military society of a sort there . A few piastres , properly distributed , help to keep one 's memory green . But you , of course , think this shockingly cynical . How 's your discussion society getting on ? Any new Utopias lately ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1308"><said who="#Margaret">“ No , I 'm house-hunting ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, as I 've already told you once . Do you know of any houses ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1309"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Afraid I do n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1310"><said who="#Margaret">“ Well , what 's the point of being practical if you can n't find two distressed females a house ? We merely want a small house with large rooms , and plenty of them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1311"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, I like that !<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>expects me to turn house-agent for her ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1312"><said who="#Evie">“ What 's that , father ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1313"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I want a new home in September , and some one must find it . I can n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1314"><said who="#Evie">“ Percy , do you know of anything ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1315"><said who="#Cahill">“ I can n't say I do , ”</said>said Mr.<persName corresp="#Cahill">Cahill</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1316"><said who="#Evie">“ How like you ! You 're never any good . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1317"><said who="#Cahill">“ Never any good . Just listen to her ! Never any good . Oh , come ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1318"><said who="#Evie">“ Well , you are n't .<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, is he ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1319">The torrent of their love , having splashed these drops at<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, swept away on its habitual course . She sympathised with it now , for a little comfort had restored her geniality . Speech and silence pleased her equally , and while<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>made some preliminary inquiries about cheese , her eyes surveyed the restaurant , and aired its well-calculated tributes to the solidity of our past . Though no more Old English than the works of Kipling , it had selected its reminiscences so adroitly that her criticism was lulled , and the guests whom it was nourishing for imperial purposes bore the outer semblance of Parson Adams or<persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>Jones . Scraps of their talk jarred oddly on the ear .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Right you are ! I 'll cable out to Uganda this evening , ”</said>came from the table behind .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Their Emperor wants war ; well , let him have it , ”</said>was the opinion of a clergyman . She smiled at such incongruities .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Next time , ”</said>she said to<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>,<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ you shall come to lunch with me at Mr. Eustace Miles 's . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1320"><said who="#Tom">“ With pleasure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1321"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ No , you 'd hate it , ”</said>she said , pushing her glass towards him for some more cider .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ It 's all proteids and body buildings , and people come up to you and beg your pardon , but you have such a beautiful aura . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1322"><said who="#Tom">“ A what ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1323"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Never heard of an aura ? Oh , happy , happy man ! I scrub at mine for hours . Nor of an astral plane ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1324">He had heard of astral planes , and censured them .</p>
    <p n="1325"><said who="#Tom">“ Just so . Luckily it was<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s aura , not mine , and she had to chaperone it and do the politenesses . I just sat with my handkerchief in my mouth till the man went . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1326"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Funny experiences seem to come to you two girls . No one 's ever asked me about my — what d'ye call it ? Perhaps I 've not got one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1327"><said who="#Tom">“ You 're bound to have one , but it may be such a terrible colour that no one dares mention it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1328"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Tell me , though ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, do you really believe in the supernatural and all that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1329"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Too difficult a question . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1330"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Why 's that ? Gruyere or Stilton ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1331"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Gruyere , please . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1332"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Better have Stilton .</said></p>
    <p n="1333"><said who="#Tom">“ Stilton . Because , though I do n't believe in auras , and think Theosophy 's only a halfway-house — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1334"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ — Yet there may be something in it all the same , ”</said>he concluded , with a frown .</p>
    <p n="1335"><said who="#Tom">“ Not even that . It may be halfway in the wrong direction . I can n't explain . I do n't believe in all these fads , and yet I do n't like saying that I do n't believe in them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1336">He seemed unsatisfied , and said :<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ So you would n't give me your word that you DON'T hold with astral bodies and all the rest of it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1337"><said who="#Margaret">“ I could , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, surprised that the point was of any importance to him .<said who="#Margaret">“ Indeed , I will .

    <p n="1340"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , I am , ”</said>“ No , you 're not , ” burst from the lovers opposite .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was silent for a moment , and then changed the subject .</p>
    <p n="1341"><said who="#Tom">“ How 's your house ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1342"><said who="#Margaret">“ Much the same as when you honoured it last week . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1345"><said who="#Tom">“ Ca n't you turn out your tenant and let it to us ? We 're nearly demented . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1346"><said who="#Margaret">“ Let me think . I wish I could help you . But I thought you wanted to be in town . One bit of advice : fix your district , then fix your price , and then do n't budge . That 's how I got both Ducie Street and<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>. I said to myself , ‘ I mean to be exactly here , ’ and I was , and<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>'s a place in a thousand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1347"><said who="#Tom">“ But I do budge . Gentlemen seem to mesmerise houses — cow them with an eye , and up they come , trembling . Ladies can n't . It 's the houses that are mesmerising me . I 've no control over the saucy things . Houses are alive . No ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1348"><said who="#Margaret">“ I 'm out of my depth , ”</said>he said , and added :<said who="#Margaret">“ Did n't you talk rather like that to your office boy ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1349"><said who="#Tom">“ Did I ?— I mean I did , more or less . I talk the same way to every one — or try to . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1350"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , I know . And how much of it do you suppose he understood ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1351"><said who="#Tom">“ That 's his lookout . I do n't believe in suiting my conversation to my company . One can doubtless hit upon some medium of exchange that seems to do well enough , but it 's no more like the real thing than money is like food . There 's no nourishment in it . You pass it to the lower classes , and they pass it back to you , and this you call ‘ social intercourse ’ or ‘ mutual endeavour , ’ when it 's mutual priggishness if it 's anything . Our friends at Chelsea do n't see this . They say one ought to be at all costs intelligible , and sacrifice — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1352"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Lower classes , ”</said>interrupted<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, as it were thrusting his hand into her speech .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Well , you do admit that there are rich and poor . That 's something . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1353"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>could not reply . Was he incredibly stupid , or did he understand her better than she understood herself ?</p>
    <p n="1354"><said who="#Margaret">“ You do admit that , if wealth was divided up equally , in a few years there would be rich and poor again just the same . The hard-working man would come to the top , the wastrel sink to the bottom . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1355"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Every one admits that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1356"><said who="#Margaret">“ Your Socialists do n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1357"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ My Socialists do . Yours may n't ; but I strongly suspect yours of being not Socialists , but ninepins , which you have constructed for your own amusement . I can n't imagine any living creature who would bowl over quite so easily . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1358">He would have resented this had she not been a woman . But women may say anything — it was one of his holiest beliefs — and he only retorted , with a gay smile :<said who="#Margaret">“ I do n't care . You 've made two damaging admissions , and I 'm heartily with you in both . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1359">In time they finished lunch , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who had excused herself from the Hippodrome , took her leave .<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>had scarcely addressed her , and she suspected that the entertainment had been planned by the father . He and she were advancing out of their respective families towards a more intimate acquaintance . It had begun long ago . She had been his wife 's friend and , as such , he had given her that silver vinaigrette as a memento . It was pretty of him to have given that vinaigrette , and he had always preferred her to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>— unlike most men . But the advance had been astonishing lately . They had done more in a week than in two years , and were really beginning to know each other .</p>
    <p n="1360">She did not forget his promise to sample Eustace Miles , and asked him as soon as she could secure<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>as his chaperon . He came , and partook of body-building dishes with humility .</p>
    <p n="1361">Next morning the Schlegels left for Swanage . They had not succeeded in finding a new home .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="18">
    <p n="1362">As they were seated at<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>'s breakfast-table at The Bays , parrying her excessive hospitality and enjoying the view of the bay , a letter came for<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and threw her into perturbation . It was from<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. It announced an “ important change ” in his plans . Owing to<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s marriage , he had decided to give up his house in Ducie Street , and was willing to let it on a yearly tenancy . It was a businesslike letter , and stated frankly what he would do for them and what he would not do . Also the rent . If they approved ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was to come up AT ONCE — the words were underlined , as is necessary when dealing with women — and to go over the house with him . If they disapproved , a wire would oblige , as he should put it into the hands of an agent .</p>
    <p n="1363">The letter perturbed , because she was not sure what it meant . If he liked her , if he had manoeuvred to get her to<persName corresp="#Simpson">Simpson</persName>'s , might this be a manoeuvre to get her to London , and result in an offer of marriage ? She put it to herself as indelicately as possible , in the hope that her brain would cry ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Rubbish , you 're a self-conscious fool ! ”</said>But her brain only tingled a little and was silent , and for a time she sat gazing at the mincing waves , and wondering whether the news would seem strange to the others .</p>
    <p n="1364">As soon as she began speaking , the sound of her own voice reassured her . There could be nothing in it . The replies also were typical , and in the burr of conversation her fears vanished .</p>
    <p n="1365"><said who="#Margaret">“ You need n't go though — ”</said>began her hostess .</p>
    <p n="1366"><said who="#Simpson">“ I need n't , but had n't I better ? It 's really getting rather serious . We let chance after chance slip , and the end of it is we shall be bundled out bag and baggage into the street . We do n't know what we WANT , that 's the mischief with us — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1367"><said who="#Helen">“ No , we have no real ties , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, helping herself to toast .</p>
    <p n="1368"><said who="#Helen">“ Sha n't I go up to town to-day , take the house if it 's the least possible , and then come down by the afternoon train to-morrow , and start enjoying myself . I shall be no fun to myself or to others until this business is off my mind .</said></p>
    <p n="1369"><said who="#Helen">“ But you wo n't do anything rash ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1370"><said who="#Margaret">“ There 's nothing rash to do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1371"><said who="#Tibby">“ Who ARE the Wilcoxes ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, a question that sounds silly , but was really extremely subtle as his aunt found to her cost when she tried to answer it .<said who="#Tibby">“ I do n't MANAGE the Wilcoxes ; I do n't see where they come IN . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1372"><said who="#Helen">“ No more do I , ”</said>agreed<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ It 's funny that we just do n't lose sight of them . Out of all our hotel acquaintances ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>is the only one who has stuck . It is now over three years , and we have drifted away from far more interesting people in that time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1373"><said who="#Tibby">“ Interesting people do n't get one houses . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1374"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, if you start in your honest-English vein , I shall throw the treacle at you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1375"><said who="#Margaret">“ It 's a better vein than the cosmopolitan , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, getting up .<said who="#Margaret">“ Now , children , which is it to be ? You know the Ducie Street house . Shall I say yes or shall I say no ?<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>love — which ? I 'm specially anxious to pin you both . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1376"><said who="#Helen">“ It all depends on what meaning you attach to the word ‘ possible ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="1377"><said who="#Margaret">“ It depends on nothing of the sort . Say ‘ yes . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="1378"><said who="#Helen">“ Say ‘ no . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="1379">Then<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>spoke rather seriously .<said who="#Margaret">“ I think , ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Margaret">“ that our race is degenerating . We cannot settle even this little thing ; what will it be like when we have to settle a big one ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1380"><said who="#Helen">“ It will be as easy as eating , ”</said>returned<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1381"><said who="#Margaret">“ I was thinking of father . How could he settle to leave Germany as he did , when he had fought for it as a young man , and all his feelings and friends were Prussian ? How could he break loose with Patriotism and begin aiming at something else ? It would have killed me . When he was nearly forty he could change countries and ideals — and we , at our age , can n't change houses . It 's humiliating . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1382"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Your father may have been able to change countries , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>with asperity ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ and that may or may not be a good thing . But he could change houses no better than you can , in fact , much worse . Never shall I forget what poor Emily suffered in the move from Manchester . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1383"><said who="#Helen">“ I knew it , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ I told you so . It is the little things one bungles at . The big , real ones are nothing when they come . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1384"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Bungle , my dear ! You are too little to recollect — in fact , you were n't there . But the furniture was actually in the vans and on the move before the lease for Wickham Place was signed , and Emily took train with baby — who was<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>then — and the smaller luggage for London , without so much as knowing where her new home would be . Getting away from that house may be hard , but it is nothing to the misery that we all went through getting you into it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1385"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, with her mouth full , cried :</p>
    <p n="1386"><said who="#Helen">“ And that 's the man who beat the Austrians , and the Danes , and the French , and who beat the Germans that were inside himself . And we 're like him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1387"><said who="#Tibby">“ Speak for yourself , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.<said who="#Tibby">“ Remember that I am cosmopolitan , please . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1388"><said who="#Tibby">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>may be right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1389"><said who="#Helen">“ Of course she 's right , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1390"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>might be right , but she did not go up to London .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>did that . An interrupted holiday is the worst of the minor worries , and one may be pardoned for feeling morbid when a business letter snatches one away from the sea and friends . She could not believe that her father had ever felt the same . Her eyes had been troubling her lately , so that she could not read in the train and it bored her to look at the landscape , which she had seen but yesterday . At Southampton she “ waved ” to<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>;<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>was on her way down to join them at Swanage , and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>had calculated that their trains would cross . But<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>was looking the other way , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>travelled on to town feeling solitary and old-maidish . How like an old maid to fancy that<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>was courting her ! She had once visited a spinster — poor , silly , and unattractive — whose mania it was that every man who approached her fell in love . How<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s heart had bled for the deluded thing ! How she had lectured , reasoned , and in despair acquiesced !<said who="#Tibby">“ I may have been deceived by the curate , my dear , but the young fellow who brings the midday post really is fond of me , and has , as a matter of fact — ”</said>It had always seemed to her the most hideous corner of old age , yet she might be driven into it herself by the mere pressure of virginity .</p>
    <p n="1391"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>met her at Waterloo himself . She felt certain that he was not the same as usual ; for one thing , he took offence at everything she said .</p>
    <p n="1392"><said who="#Margaret">“ This is awfully kind of you , ”</said>she began ,<said who="#Margaret">“ but I 'm afraid it 's not going to do . The house has not been built that suits the<persName corresp="#Schlegel">Schlegel</persName>family . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1393"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ What ! Have you come up determined not to deal ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1394"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not exactly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1395"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Not exactly ? In that case let 's be starting . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1396">She lingered to admire the motor , which was new , and a fairer creature than the vermilion giant that had borne<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>to her doom three years before .</p>
    <p n="1397"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ Presumably it 's very beautiful , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ How do you like it ,<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1398"><said who="#Crane">“ Come , let 's be starting , ”</said>repeated her host .<said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ How on earth did you know that my chauffeur was called<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1399"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Why , I know<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>; I 've been for a drive with<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>once . I know that you 've got a parlourmaid called Milton . I know all sorts of things . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1400"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>! ”</said>he echoed in injured tones .<said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ You wo n't see her . She 's gone out with<persName corresp="#Cahill">Cahill</persName>. It 's no fun , I can tell you , being left so much alone . I 've got my work all day — indeed , a great deal too much of it — but when I come home in the evening , I tell you , I can n't stand the house . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1401"><said who="#Margaret">“ In my absurd way , I 'm lonely too , ”</said><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>replied .<said who="#Margaret">“ It 's heart-breaking to leave one 's old home . I scarcely remember anything before Wickham Place , and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>were born there .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>says — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1402"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ You , too , feel lonely ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1403"><said who="#Margaret">“ Horribly . Hullo , Parliament 's back ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1404"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>glanced at Parliament contemptuously . The more important ropes of life lay elsewhere .<said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ Yes , they are talking again , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ But you were going to say — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1405"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Only some rubbish about furniture .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>says it alone endures while men and houses perish , and that in the end the world will be a desert of chairs and sofas — just imagine it !— rolling through infinity with no one to sit upon them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1406"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ Your sister always likes her little joke . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1407"><said who="#Margaret">“ She says ‘ Yes , ’ my brother says ` No , ’ to Ducie Street . It 's no fun helping us ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, I assure you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1408"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ You are not as unpractical as you pretend . I shall never believe it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1409"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>laughed . But she was — quite as unpractical . She could not concentrate on details . Parliament , the Thames , the irresponsive chauffeur , would flash into the field of house-hunting , and all demand some comment or response . It is impossible to see modern life steadily and see it whole , and she had chosen to see it whole .<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>saw steadily . He never bothered over the mysterious or the private . The Thames might run inland from the sea , the chauffeur might conceal all passion and philosophy beneath his unhealthy skin . They knew their own business , and he knew his .</p>
    <p n="1410">Yet she liked being with him . He was not a rebuke , but a stimulus , and banished morbidity . Some twenty years her senior , he preserved a gift that she supposed herself to have already lost — not youth 's creative power , but its self-confidence and optimism . He was so sure that it was a very pleasant world . His complexion was robust , his hair had receded but not thinned , the thick moustache and the eyes that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had compared to brandy-balls had an agreeable menace in them , whether they were turned towards the slums or towards the stars . Some day — in the millennium — there may be no need for his type . At present , homage is due to it from those who think themselves superior , and who possibly are .</p>
    <p n="1411"><said who="#Helen">“ At all events you responded to my telegram promptly , ”</said>he remarked .</p>
    <p n="1412"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Oh , even I know a good thing when I see it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1413"><said who="#Helen">“ I 'm glad you do n't despise the goods of this world . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1414"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Heavens , no ! Only idiots and prigs do that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1415"><said who="#Helen">“ I am glad , very glad , ”</said>he repeated , suddenly softening and turning to her , as if the remark had pleased him .<said who="#Helen">“ There is so much cant talked in would-be intellectual circles . I am glad you do n't share it . Self-denial is all very well as a means of strengthening the character . But I can n't stand those people who run down comforts . They have usually some axe to grind . Can you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1416"><said who="#Margaret">“ Comforts are of two kinds , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who was keeping herself in hand —<said who="#Margaret">“ those we can share with others , like fire , weather , or music ; and those we can n't — food , food , for instance . It depends . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1417"><said who="#Margaret">“ I mean reasonable comforts , of course . I should n't like to think that you — ”</said>He bent nearer ; the sentence died unfinished .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s head turned very stupid , and the inside of it seemed to revolve like the beacon in a lighthouse . He did not kiss her , for the hour was half-past twelve , and the car was passing by the stables of Buckingham Palace . But the atmosphere was so charged with emotion that people only seemed to exist on her account , and she was surprised that<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>did not realise this , and turn round . Idiot though she might be , surely<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>was more — how should one put it ?— more psychological than usual . Always a good judge of character for business purposes , he seemed this afternoon to enlarge his field , and to note qualities outside neatness , obedience , and decision .</p>
    <p n="1418"><said who="#Crane">“ I want to go over the whole house , ”</said>she announced when they arrived .<said who="#Crane">“ As soon as I get back to Swanage , which will be to-morrow afternoon , I 'll talk it over once more with<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, and wire you ‘ yes ’ or ‘ no . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="1419"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Right . The dining-room . ”</said>And they began their survey .</p>
    <p n="1420">The dining-room was big , but over-furnished . Chelsea would have moaned aloud .<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>had eschewed those decorative schemes that wince , and relent , and refrain , and achieve beauty by sacrificing comfort and pluck . After so much self-colour and self-denial ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>viewed with relief the sumptuous dado , the frieze , the gilded wall-paper , amid whose foliage parrots sang . It would never do with her own furniture , but those heavy chairs , that immense sideboard loaded with presentation plate , stood up against its pressure like men . The room suggested men , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, keen to derive the modern capitalist from the warriors and hunters of the past , saw it as an ancient guest-hall , where the lord sat at meat among his thanes . Even the Bible — the Dutch Bible that<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>had brought back from the Boer War — fell into position . Such a room admitted loot .</p>
    <p n="1421"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Now the entrance-hall . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1422">The entrance-hall was paved .</p>
    <p n="1423"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Here we fellows smoke . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1424">We fellows smoked in chairs of maroon leather . It was as if a motor-car had spawned .<said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , jolly ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, sinking into one of them .</p>
    <p n="1425"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ You do like it ? ”</said>he said , fixing his eyes on her upturned face , and surely betraying an almost intimate note .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ It 's all rubbish not making oneself comfortable . Is n't it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1426"><said who="#Margaret">“ Ye — es . Semi-rubbish . Are those Cruikshanks ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1427"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Gillrays . Shall we go on upstairs ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1428"><said who="#Margaret">“ Does all this furniture come from Howards End ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1429"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ The Howards End furniture has all gone to<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1430"><said who="#Margaret">“ Does — However , I 'm concerned with the house , not the furniture . How big is this smoking-room ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1431"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Thirty by fifteen . No , wait a minute . Fifteen and a half . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1432"><said who="#Margaret">“ Ah , well .<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, are n't you ever amused at the solemnity with which we middle classes approach the subject of houses ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1433">They proceeded to the drawing-room . Chelsea managed better here . It was sallow and ineffective . One could visualise the ladies withdrawing to it , while their lords discussed life 's realities below , to the accompaniment of cigars . Had<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s drawing-room at Howards End looked thus ? Just as this thought entered<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s brain ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>did ask her to be his wife , and the knowledge that she had been right so overcame her that she nearly fainted .</p>
    <p n="1434">But the proposal was not to rank among the world 's great love scenes .</p>
    <p n="1435"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>”</said>— his voice was firm —<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I have had you up on false pretences . I want to speak about a much more serious matter than a house . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1436"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>almost answered :<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ I know — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1437"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Could you be induced to share my — is it probable — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1438"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>! ”</said>she interrupted , taking hold of the piano and averting her eyes .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ I see , I see . I will write to you afterwards if I may . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1439">He began to stammer .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>—<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>you do n't understand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1440"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh yes ! Indeed , yes ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1441"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I am asking you to be my wife . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1442">So deep already was her sympathy , that when he said , “ I am asking you to be my wife , ” she made herself give a little start . She must show surprise if he expected it . An immense joy came over her . It was indescribable . It had nothing to do with humanity , and most resembled the all-pervading happiness of fine weather . Fine weather is due to the sun , but<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>could think of no central radiance here . She stood in his drawing-room happy , and longing to give happiness . On leaving him she realised that the central radiance had been love .</p>
    <p n="1443"><said who="#Margaret">“ You are n't offended ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1444"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ How could I be offended ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1445">There was a moment 's pause . He was anxious to get rid of her , and she knew it . She had too much intuition to look at him as he struggled for possessions that money cannot buy . He desired comradeship and affection , but he feared them , and she , who had taught herself only to desire , and could have clothed the struggle with beauty , held back , and hesitated with him .</p>
    <p n="1446"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Good-bye , ”</said>she continued .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ You will have a letter from me — I am going back to Swanage to-morrow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1447"><said who="#Margaret">“ Thank you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1448"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Good-bye , and it 's you I thank . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1449"><said who="#Margaret">“ I may order the motor round , may n't I ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1450"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ That would be most kind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1451"><said who="#Margaret">“ I wish I had written . Ought I to have written ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1452"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Not at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1453"><said who="#Margaret">“ There 's just one question — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1454">She shook her head . He looked a little bewildered as they parted .</p>
    <p n="1455">They parted without shaking hands ; she had kept the interview , for his sake , in tints of the quietest grey . She thrilled with happiness ere she reached her house . Others had loved her in the past , if one apply to their brief desires so grave a word , but the others had been “ ninnies ” — young men who had nothing to do , old men who could find nobody better . And she had often ‘ loved , ’ too , but only so far as the facts of sex demanded : mere yearnings for the masculine sex to be dismissed for what they were worth , with a sigh . Never before had her personality been touched . She was not young or very rich , and it amazed her that a man of any standing should take her seriously as she sat , trying to do accounts in her empty house , amidst beautiful pictures and noble books , waves of emotion broke , as if a tide of passion was flowing through the night air . She shook her head , tried to concentrate her attention , and failed . In vain did she repeat :<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ But I 've been through this sort of thing before . ”</said>She had never been through it ; the big machinery , as opposed to the little , had been set in motion , and the idea that<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>loved , obsessed her before she came to love him in return .</p>
    <p n="1456">She would come to no decision yet .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Oh , sir , this is so sudden ”</said>— that prudish phrase exactly expressed her when her time came . Premonitions are not preparation . She must examine more closely her own nature and his ; she must talk it over judicially with<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. It had been a strange love-scene — the central radiance unacknowledged from first to last . She , in his place , would have said Ich liebe dich , but perhaps it was not his habit to open the heart . He might have done it if she had pressed him — as a matter of duty , perhaps ; England expects every man to open his heart once ; but the effort would have jarred him , and never , if she could avoid it , should he lose those defences that he had chosen to raise against the world . He must never be bothered with emotional talk , or with a display of sympathy . He was an elderly man now , and it would be futile and impudent to correct him .</p>
    <p n="1457"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>strayed in and out , ever a welcome ghost ; surveying the scene , thought<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, without one hint of bitterness .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="19">
    <p n="1458">If one wanted to show a foreigner England , perhaps the wisest course would be to take him to the final section of the Purbeck Hills , and stand him on their summit , a few miles to the east of Corfe . Then system after system of our island would roll together under his feet . Beneath him is the valley of the Frome , and all the wild lands that come tossing down from Dorchester , black and gold , to mirror their gorse in the expanses of Poole . The valley of the Stour is beyond , unaccountable stream , dirty at Blandford , pure at Wimborne — the Stour , sliding out of fat fields , to marry the Avon beneath the tower of Christ church . The valley of the Avon — invisible , but far to the north the trained eye may see Clearbury Ring that guards it , and the imagination may leap beyond that on to Salisbury Plain itself , and beyond the Plain to all the glorious downs of Central England . Nor is Suburbia absent . Bournemouth 's ignoble coast cowers to the right , heralding the pine-trees that mean , for all their beauty , red houses , and the Stock Exchange , and extend to the gates of London itself . So tremendous is the City 's trail ! But the cliffs of Freshwater it shall never touch , and the island will guard the Island 's purity till the end of time . Seen from the west the Wight is beautiful beyond all laws of beauty . It is as if a fragment of England floated forward to greet the foreigner — chalk of our chalk , turf of our turf , epitome of what will follow . And behind the fragment lies Southampton , hostess to the nations , and Portsmouth , a latent fire , and all around it , with double and treble collision of tides , swirls the sea . How many villages appear in this view ! How many castles ! How many churches , vanished or triumphant ! How many ships , railways , and roads ! What incredible variety of men working beneath that lucent sky to what final end ! The reason fails , like a wave on the Swanage beach ; the imagination swells , spreads , and deepens , until it becomes geographic and encircles England .</p>
    <p n="1459">So<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>Mosebach , now Frau Architect Liesecke , and mother to her husband 's baby , was brought up to these heights to be impressed , and , after a prolonged gaze , she said that the hills were more swelling here than in Pomerania , which was true , but did not seem to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>apposite . Poole Harbour was dry , which led her to praise the absence of muddy foreshore at Friedrich Wilhelms Bad , Rugen , where beech-trees hang over the tideless Baltic , and cows may contemplate the brine . Rather unhealthy<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>thought this would be , water being safer when it moved about .</p>
    <p n="1460"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ And your English lakes — Vindermere , Grasmere they , then , unhealthy ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1461"><said who="#Frieda">“ No , Frau Liesecke ; but that is because they are fresh water , and different . Salt water ought to have tides , and go up and down a great deal , or else it smells . Look , for instance , at an aquarium . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1462"><said who="#Helen">“ An aquarium ! Oh , MEESIS<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Munt</persName>, you mean to tell me that fresh aquariums stink less than salt ? Why , then Victor , my brother-in-law , collected many tadpoles — ”</said>“ You are not to say ‘ stink , ’ ” interrupted<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>;<said who="#Helen">“ at least , you may say it , but you must pretend you are being funny while you say it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1463"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Then ‘ smell . ’ And the mud of your Pool down there — does it not smell , or may I say ‘ stink , ’ ha , ha ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1464"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ There always has been mud in Poole Harbour , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, with a slight frown .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ The rivers bring it down , and a most valuable oyster-fishery depends upon it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1465"><said who="#Frieda">“ Yes , that is so , ”</said>conceded<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>; and another international incident was closed .</p>
    <p n="1466"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ ‘ Bournemouth is , ’ ”</said>resumed their hostess , quoting a local rhyme to which she was much attached —<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ ‘ Bournemouth is , Poole was , and Swanage is to be the most important town of all and biggest of the three . ’ Now , Frau Liesecke , I have shown you Bournemouth , and I have shown you Poole , so let us walk backward a little , and look down again at Swanage . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1467"><said who="#Frieda">“<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, would n't that be<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>'s train ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1468">A tiny puff of smoke had been circling the harbour , and now was bearing southwards towards them over the black and the gold .</p>
    <p n="1469"><said who="#Frieda">“ Oh , dearest<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, I do hope she wo n't be overtired . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1470"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Oh , I do wonder — I do wonder whether she 's taken the house . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1471"><said who="#Frieda">“ I hope she has n't been hasty . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1472"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ So do I — oh , SO do I . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1473"><said who="#Frieda">“ Will it be as beautiful as Wickham Place ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>asked .</p>
    <p n="1474"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I should think it would . Trust<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>for doing himself proud . All those Ducie Street houses are beautiful in their modern way , and I can n't think why he does n't keep on with it . But it 's really for<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>that he went there , and now that<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s going to be married — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1475"><said who="#Frieda">“ Ah ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1476"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ You 've never seen Miss Wilcox ,<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>. How absurdly matrimonial you are ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1477"><said who="#Frieda">“ But sister to that<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1478"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1479"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ And to that<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>with feeling .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, what a time that was ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1480"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>laughed .<said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>and I have n't got such tender hearts . If there 's a chance of a cheap house , we go for it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1481"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Now look , Frau Liesecke , at my niece 's train . You see , it is coming towards us — coming , coming ; and , when it gets to Corfe , it will actually go THROUGH the downs , on which we are standing , so that , if we walk over , as I suggested , and look down on Swanage , we shall see it coming on the other side . Shall we ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1482"><persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>assented , and in a few minutes they had crossed the ridge and exchanged the greater view for the lesser . Rather a dull valley lay below , backed by the slope of the coastward downs . They were looking across the Isle of Purbeck and on to Swanage , soon to be the most important town of all , and ugliest of the three .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s train reappeared as promised , and was greeted with approval by her aunt . It came to a standstill in the middle distance , and there it had been planned that<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>should meet her , and drive her , and a tea-basket , up to join them .</p>
    <p n="1483"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ You see , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>to her cousin ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ the Wilcoxes collect houses as your Victor collects tadpoles . They have , one , Ducie Street ; two , Howards End , where my great rumpus was ; three , a country seat in Shropshire ; four ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>has a house in Hilton ; and five , another near Epsom ; and six ,<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>will have a house when she marries , and probably a pied-a-terre in the country — which makes seven . Oh yes , and<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>a hut in Africa makes eight . I wish we could get Howards End . That was something like a dear little house ! Did n't you think so ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1484"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I had too much to do , dear , to look at it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, with a gracious dignity .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I had everything to settle and explain , and<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles Wilcox</persName>to keep in his place besides . It is n't likely I should remember much . I just remember having lunch in your bedroom . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1485"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , so do I . But , oh dear , dear , how dreadful it all seems ! And in the autumn there began that anti-Pauline movement — you , and<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, all obsessed with the idea that I might yet marry<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1486"><said who="#Frieda">“ You yet may , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>despondently .</p>
    <p n="1487"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>shook her head .<said who="#Helen">“ The Great Wilcox Peril will never return . If I 'm certain of anything it 's of that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1488"><said who="#Frieda">“ One is certain of nothing but the truth of one 's own emotions . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1489">The remark fell damply on the conversation . But<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>slipped her arm round her cousin , somehow liking her the better for making it . It was not an original remark , nor had<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>appropriated it passionately , for she had a patriotic rather than a philosophic mind . Yet it betrayed that interest in the universal which the average Teuton possesses and the average Englishman does not . It was , however illogically , the good , the beautiful , the true , as opposed to the respectable , the pretty , the adequate . It was a landscape of Bocklin 's beside a landscape of Leader 's , strident and ill-considered , but quivering into supernatural life . It sharpened idealism , stirred the soul . It may have been a bad preparation for what followed .</p>
    <p n="1490"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ Look ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, hurrying away from generalities over the narrow summit of the down .<said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ Stand where I stand , and you will see the pony-cart coming . I see the pony-cart coming . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1491">They stood and saw the pony-cart coming .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>were presently seen coming in it . Leaving the outskirts of Swanage , it drove for a little through the budding lanes , and then began the ascent .</p>
    <p n="1492"><said who="#Tibby">“ Have you got the house ? ”</said>they shouted , long before she could possibly hear .</p>
    <p n="1493"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>ran down to meet her . The highroad passed over a saddle , and a track went thence at right angles alone the ridge of the down .</p>
    <p n="1494"><said who="#Helen">“ Have you got the house ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1495"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>shook her head .</p>
    <p n="1496"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , what a nuisance ! So we 're as we were ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1497"><said who="#Helen">“ Not exactly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1498">She got out , looking tired .</p>
    <p n="1499"><said who="#Tibby">“ Some mystery , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.<said who="#Tibby">“ We are to be enlightened presently . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1500"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>came close up to her and whispered that she had had a proposal of marriage from<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1501"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was amused . She opened the gate on to the downs so that her brother might lead the pony through .<said who="#Helen">“ It 's just like a widower , ”</said>she remarked .<said who="#Helen">“ They 've cheek enough for anything , and invariably select one of their first wife 's friends . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1502"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s face flashed despair .</p>
    <p n="1503"><said who="#Margaret">“ That type — ”</said>She broke off with a cry .<said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, not anything wrong with you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1504"><said who="#Margaret">“ Wait one minute , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, whispering always .</p>
    <p n="1505"><said who="#Helen">“ But you 've never conceivably — you 've never — ”</said>She pulled herself together .<said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, hurry up through ; I can n't hold this gate indefinitely .<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>! I say ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, make the tea , will you , and<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>; we 've got to talk houses , and will come on afterwards . ”</said>And then , turning her face to her sister 's , she burst into tears .</p>
    <p n="1506"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was stupefied . She heard herself saying ,<said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ Oh , really — ”</said>She felt herself touched with a hand that trembled .</p>
    <p n="1507"><said who="#Helen">“ Do n't , ”</said>sobbed<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>,<said who="#Helen">“ do n't , do n't ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, do n't ! ”</said>She seemed incapable of saying any other word .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, trembling herself , led her forward up the road , till they strayed through another gate on to the down .</p>
    <p n="1508"><said who="#Margaret">“ Do n't , do n't do such a thing ! I tell you not to — do n't ! I know — do n't ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1509"><said who="#Helen">“ What do you know ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1510"><said who="#Helen">“ Panic and emptiness , ”</said>sobbed<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ Do n't ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1511">Then<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>thought ,<said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>is a little selfish . I have never behaved like this when there has seemed a chance of her marrying . ”</said>She said :<said who="#Margaret">“ But we would still see each other very — often , and you — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1512"><said who="#Helen">“ It 's not a thing like that , ”</said>sobbed<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. And she broke right away and wandered distractedly upwards , stretching her hands towards the view and crying .</p>
    <p n="1513"><said who="#Margaret">“ What 's happened to you ? ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, following through the wind that gathers at sundown on the northern slopes of hills .<said who="#Helen">“ But it 's stupid ! ”</said>And suddenly stupidity seized her , and the immense landscape was blurred . But<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>turned back .</p>
    <p n="1514"><said who="#Margaret">“ I do n't know what 's happened to either of us , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, wiping her eyes .<said who="#Helen">“ We must both have done mad . ”</said>Then<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>wiped hers , and they even laughed a little .</p>
    <p n="1515"><said who="#Margaret">“ Look here , sit down . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1516"><said who="#Helen">“ All right ; I 'll sit down if you 'll sit down . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1517"><said who="#Margaret">“ There . ( One kiss . ) Now , whatever , whatever is the matter ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1518"><said who="#Helen">“ I do mean what I said . Do n't ; it would n't do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1519"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, stop saying ‘ do n't ’ ! It 's ignorant . It 's as if your head was n't out of the slime . ‘ Do n't ’ is probably what<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>says all the day to<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1520"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was silent .</p>
    <p n="1521"><said who="#Helen">“ Well ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1522"><said who="#Margaret">“ Tell me about it first , and meanwhile perhaps I 'll have got my head out of the slime . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1523"><said who="#Helen">“ That 's better . Well , where shall I begin ? When I arrived at Waterloo — no , I 'll go back before that , because I 'm anxious you should know everything from the first . The ‘ first ’ was about ten days ago . It was the day<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>came to tea and lost his temper . I was defending him , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>became jealous about me , however slightly . I thought it was the involuntary thing , which men can n't help any more than we can . You know — at least , I know in my own case — when a man has said to me , ‘ So-and-so 's a pretty girl , ’ I am seized with a momentary sourness against So-and-so , and long to tweak her ear . It 's a tiresome feeling , but not an important one , and one easily manages it . But it was n't only this in<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>'s case , I gather now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1524"><said who="#Margaret">“ Then you love him ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1525"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>considered .<said who="#Helen">“ It is wonderful knowing that a real man cares for you , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Helen">“ The mere fact of that grows more tremendous . Remember , I 've known and liked him steadily for nearly three years . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1526"><said who="#Margaret">“ But loved him ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1527"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>peered into her past . It is pleasant to analyse feelings while they are still only feelings , and unembodied in the social fabric . With her arm round<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, and her eyes shifting over the view , as if this country or that could reveal the secret of her own heart , she meditated honestly , and said ,<said who="#Helen">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1528"><said who="#Margaret">“ But you will ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1529"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>,<said who="#Margaret">“ of that I 'm pretty sure . Indeed , I began the moment he spoke to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1530"><said who="#Helen">“ And have settled to marry him ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1531"><said who="#Margaret">“ I had , but am wanting a long talk about it now . What is it against him ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>? You must try and say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1532"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, in her turn , looked outwards .<said who="#Helen">“ It is ever since<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>, ”</said>she said finally .</p>
    <p n="1533"><said who="#Margaret">“ But what has<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>to do with<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1534"><said who="#Helen">“ But he was there , they were all there that morning when I came down to breakfast , and saw that<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>was frightened — the man who loved me frightened and all his paraphernalia fallen , so that I knew it was impossible , because personal relations are the important thing for ever and ever , and not this outer life of telegrams and anger . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1535">She poured the sentence forth in one breath , but her sister understood it , because it touched on thoughts that were familiar between them .</p>
    <p n="1536">“ That 's foolish . In the first place , I disagree about the outer life . Well , we 've often argued that . The real point is that there is the widest gulf between my love-making and yours . Yours was romance ; mine will be prose . I 'm not running it down — a very good kind of prose , but well considered , well thought out . For instance , I know all<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>'s faults . He 's afraid of emotion . He cares too much about success , too little about the past . His sympathy lacks poetry , and so is n't sympathy really . I 'd even say “ — she looked at the shining lagoons —<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ that , spiritually , he 's not as honest as I am . Does n't that satisfy you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1537"><said who="#Helen">“ No , it does n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ It makes me feel worse and worse . You must be mad . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1538"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>made a movement of irritation .</p>
    <p n="1539"><said who="#Margaret">“ I do n't intend him , or any man or any woman , to be all my life — good heavens , no ! There are heaps of things in me that he does n't , and shall never , understand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1540">Thus she spoke before the wedding ceremony and the physical union , before the astonishing glass shade had fallen that interposes between married couples and the world . She was to keep her independence more than do most women as yet . Marriage was to alter her fortunes rather than her character , and she was not far wrong in boasting that she understood her future husband . Yet he did alter her character — a little . There was an unforeseen surprise , a cessation of the winds and odours of life , a social pressure that would have her think conjugally .</p>
    <p n="1541"><said who="#Margaret">“ So with him , ”</said>she continued .<said who="#Margaret">“ There are heaps of things in him — more especially things that he does that will always be hidden from me . He has all those public qualities which you so despise and which enable all this — ”</said>She waved her hand at the landscape , which confirmed anything .<said who="#Margaret">“ If<persName corresp="#Wilcoxes">Wilcoxes</persName>had n't worked and died in England for thousands of years , you and I could n't sit here without having our throats cut . There would be no trains , no ships to carry us literary people about in , no fields even . Just savagery . No — perhaps not even that . Without their spirit life might never have moved out of protoplasm . More and more do I refuse to draw my income and sneer at those who guarantee it . There are times when it seems to me — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1542"><said who="#Helen">“ And to me , and to all women . So one kissed<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1543"><said who="#Margaret">“ That 's brutal . ”</said>said ‘<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Mine is an absolutely different case . I 've thought things out . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1544"><said who="#Helen">“ It makes no difference thinking things out . They come to the same . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1545"><said who="#Margaret">“ Rubbish ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1546">There was a long silence , during which the tide returned into Poole Harbour .<said who="#Helen">“ One would lose something , ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, apparently to herself . The water crept over the mud-flats towards the gorse and the blackened heather . Branksea Island lost its immense foreshores , and became a sombre episode of trees . Frome was forced inward towards Dorchester , Stour against Wimborne , Avon towards Salisbury , and over the immense displacement the sun presided , leading it to triumph ere he sank to rest . England was alive , throbbing through all her estuaries , crying for joy through the mouths of all her gulls , and the north wind , with contrary motion , blew stronger against her rising seas . What did it mean ? For what end are her fair complexities , her changes of soil , her sinuous coast ? Does she belong to those who have moulded her and made her feared by other lands , or to those who have added nothing to her power , but have somehow seen her , seen the whole island at once , lying as a jewel in a silver sea , sailing as a ship of souls , with all the brave world 's fleet accompanying her towards eternity ?</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="20">
    <p n="1547"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had often wondered at the disturbance that takes place in the world 's waters , when<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>, who seems so tiny a pebble , slips in . Whom does<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>concern beyond the beloved and the lover ? Yet his impact deluges a hundred shores . No doubt the disturbance is really the spirit of the generations , welcoming the new generation , and chafing against the ultimate Fate , who holds all the seas in the palm of her hand . But<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>cannot understand this . He cannot comprehend another 's infinity ; he is conscious only of his own — flying sunbeam , falling rose , pebble that asks for one quiet plunge below the fretting interplay of space and time . He knows that he will survive at the end of things , and be gathered by Fate as a jewel from the slime , and be handed with admiration round the assembly of the gods . “ Men did produce this ” they will say , and , saying , they will give men immortality . But meanwhile — what agitations meanwhile ! The foundations of Property and Propriety are laid bare , twin rocks ; Family Pride flounders to the surface , puffing and blowing and refusing to be comforted ; Theology , vaguely ascetic , gets up a nasty ground swell . Then the lawyers are aroused — cold brood — and creep out of their holes . They do what they can ; they tidy up Property and Propriety , reassure Theology and Family Pride . Half-guineas are poured on the troubled waters , the lawyers creep back , and , if all has gone well ,<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>joins one man and woman together in Matrimony .</p>
    <p n="1548"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had expected the disturbance , and was not irritated by it . For a sensitive woman she had steady nerves , and could bear with the incongruous and the grotesque ; and , besides , there was nothing excessive about her love-affair . Good-humour was the dominant note of her relations with<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, or , as I must now call him ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>did not encourage romance , and she was no girl to fidget for it . An acquaintance had become a lover , might become a husband , but would retain all that she had noted in the acquaintance ; and love must confirm an old relation rather than reveal a new one .</p>
    <p n="1549">In this spirit she promised to marry him .</p>
    <p n="1550">He was in Swanage on the morrow bearing the engagement ring .</p>
    <p n="1551">They greeted one another with a hearty cordiality that impressed<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>.<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>dined at The Bays , but had engaged a bedroom in the principal hotel ; he was one of those men who know the principal hotel by instinct . After dinner he asked<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>if she would n't care for a turn on the Parade . She accepted , and could not repress a little tremor ; it would be her first real love scene . But as she put on her hat she burst out laughing .<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>was so unlike the article served up in books ; the joy , though genuine was different ; the mystery an unexpected mystery . For one thing ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>still seemed a stranger .</p>
    <p n="1552">For a time they talked about the ring ; then she said :<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Do you remember the Embankment at Chelsea ? It can n't be ten days ago . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1553"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Yes , ”</said>he said , laughing .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ And you and your sister were head and ears deep in some Quixotic scheme . Ah well ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1554"><said who="#Love">“ I little thought then , certainly . Did you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1555"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I do n't know about that ; I should n't like to say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1556"><said who="#Love">“ Why , was it earlier ? ”</said>she cried .<said who="#Love">“ Did you think of me this way earlier ! How extraordinarily interesting ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>! Tell me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1557">But<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>had no intention of telling . Perhaps he could not have told , for his mental states became obscure as soon as he had passed through them . He misliked the very word “ interesting , ” connoting it with wasted energy and even with morbidity . Hard facts were enough for him .</p>
    <p n="1558"><said who="#Henry">“ I did n't think of it , ”</said>she pursued .<said who="#Henry">“ No ; when you spoke to me in the drawing-room , that was practically the first . It was all so different from what it 's supposed to be . On the stage , or in books , a proposal is — how shall I put it ?— a full-blown affair , a hind of bouquet ; it loses its literal meaning . But in life a proposal really is a proposal — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1559"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ By the way — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1560"><said who="#Henry">“ Oh , very well . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1561"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I am so glad , ”</said>she answered , a little surprised .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ What did you talk about ? Me , presumably . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1562"><said who="#Henry">“ About Greece too . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1563"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Greece was a very good card ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>'s only a boy still , and one has to pick and choose subjects a little . Well done . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1564"><said who="#Henry">“ I was telling him I have shares in a currant-farm near Calamata . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1565"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ What a delightful thing to have shares in ! Ca n't we go there for our honeymoon ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1566"><said who="#Henry">“ What to do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1567"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ To eat the currants . And is n't there marvellous scenery ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1568"><said who="#Henry">“ Moderately , but it 's not the kind of place one could possibly go to with a lady . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1569"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Why not ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1570"><said who="#Henry">“ No hotels . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1571"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Some ladies do without hotels . Are you aware that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and I have walked alone over the Apennines , with our luggage on our backs ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1572"><said who="#Henry">“ I was n't aware , and , if I can manage it , you will never do such a thing again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1573">She said more gravely :<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ You have n't found time for a talk with<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>yet , I suppose ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1574"><said who="#Henry">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1575"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Do , before you go . I am so anxious you two should be friends . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1576"><said who="#Henry">“ Your sister and I have always hit it off , ”</said>he said negligently .<said who="#Henry">“ But we 're drifting away from our business . Let me begin at the beginning . You know that<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>is going to marry Percy<persName corresp="#Cahill">Cahill</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1577"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s uncle . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1578"><said who="#Henry">“ Exactly . The girl 's madly in love with him . A very good sort of fellow , but he demands — and rightly — a suitable provision with her . And in the second place you will naturally understand , there is<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. Before leaving town , I wrote<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>a very careful letter . You see , he has an increasing family and increasing expenses , and the I. and W. A. is nothing particular just now , though capable of development . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1579"><said who="#Margaret">“ Poor fellow ! ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, looking out to sea , and not understanding .</p>
    <p n="1580"><said who="#Henry">“<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>being the elder son , some day<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>will have Howards End ; but I am anxious , in my own happiness , not to be unjust to others . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1581"><said who="#Margaret">“ Of course not , ”</said>she began , and then gave a little cry .<said who="#Margaret">“ you mean money . How stupid I am ! Of course not ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1582">Oddly enough , he winced a little at the word .<said who="#Henry">“ Yes , Money , since you put it so frankly . I am determined to be just to all — just to you , just to them . I am determined that my children shall have me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1583"><said who="#Margaret">“ Be generous to them , ”</said>she said sharply .<said who="#Margaret">“ Bother justice ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1584"><said who="#Henry">“ I am determined — and have already written to<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>to that effect — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1585"><said who="#Margaret">“ But how much have you got ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1586"><said who="#Henry">“ What ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1587"><said who="#Margaret">“ How much have you a year ? I 've six hundred . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1588"><said who="#Henry">“ My income ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1589"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes . We must begin with how much you have , before we can settle how much you can give<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. Justice , and even generosity , depend on that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1590"><said who="#Henry">“ I must say you 're a downright young woman , ”</said>he observed , patting her arm and laughing a little .<said who="#Henry">“ What a question to spring on a fellow ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1591"><said who="#Margaret">“ Do n't you know your income ? Or do n't you want to tell it me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1592"><said who="#Henry">“ I — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1593"><said who="#Margaret">“ That 's all right ”</said>— now she patted him —<said who="#Margaret">“ do n't tell me . I do n't want to know . I can do the sum just as well by proportion . Divide your income into ten parts . How many parts would you give to<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, how many to<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, how many to<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1594"><said who="#Henry">“ The fact is , my dear , I had n't any intention of bothering you with details . I only wanted to let you know that — well , that something must be done for the others , and you 've understood me perfectly , so let 's pass on to the next point . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1595"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , we 've settled that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, undisturbed by his strategic blunderings .<said who="#Margaret">“ Go ahead ; give away all you can , bearing in mind that I 've a clear six hundred . What a mercy it is to have all this money about one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1596"><said who="#Henry">“ We 've none too much , I assure you ; you 're marrying a poor man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1597"><said who="#Henry">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>would n't agree with me here , ”</said>she continued .<said who="#Henry">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>dare n't slang the rich , being rich herself , but she would like to . There 's an odd notion , that I have n't yet got hold of , running about at the back of her brain , that poverty is somehow ‘ real . ’ She dislikes all organisation , and probably confuses wealth with the technique of wealth . Sovereigns in a stocking would n't bother her ; cheques do .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>is too relentless . One can n't deal in her high-handed manner with the world . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1598"><said who="#Margaret">“ There 's this other point , and then I must go back to my hotel and write some letters . What 's to be done now about the house in Ducie Street ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1599"><said who="#Henry">“ Keep it on — at least , it depends . When do you want to marry me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1600">She raised her voice , as too often , and some youths , who were also taking the evening air , overheard her .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Getting a bit hot , eh ? ”</said>said one .<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>turned on them , and said sharply ,<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I say ! ”</said>There was silence .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Take care I do n't report you to the police . ”</said>They moved away quietly enough , but were only biding their time , and the rest of the conversation was punctuated by peals of ungovernable laughter .</p>
    <p n="1601">Lowering his voice and infusing a hint of reproof into it , he said :<said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>will probably be married in September . We could scarcely think of anything before then . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1602"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ The earlier the nicer ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>. Females are not supposed to say such things , but the earlier the nicer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1603"><said who="#Henry">“ How about September for us too ? ”</said>he asked , rather dryly .</p>
    <p n="1604"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Right . Shall we go into Ducie Street ourselves in September ? Or shall we try to bounce<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>into it ? That 's rather an idea . They are so unbusinesslike , we could make them do anything by judicious management . Look here — yes . We 'll do that . And we ourselves could live at Howards End or Shropshire . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1605">He blew out his cheeks .<said who="#Henry">“ Heavens ! how you women do fly round ! My head 's in a whirl . Point by point ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. Howards End 's impossible . I let it to Hamar<persName corresp="#Bryce">Bryce</persName>on a three years ’ agreement last March . Do n't you remember ?<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>. Well , that is much , much too far away to rely on entirely . You will be able to be down there entertaining a certain amount , but we must have a house within easy reach of Town . Only Ducie Street has huge drawbacks . There 's a mews behind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1606"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>could not help laughing . It was the first she had heard of the mews behind Ducie Street . When she was a possible tenant it had suppressed itself , not consciously , but automatically . The breezy Wilcox manner , though genuine , lacked the clearness of vision that is imperative for truth . When<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>lived in Ducie Street he remembered the mews ; when he tried to let he forgot it ; and if any one had remarked that the mews must be either there or not , he would have felt annoyed , and afterwards have found some opportunity of stigmatising the speaker as academic . So does my grocer stigmatise me when I complain of the quality of his sultanas , and he answers in one breath that they are the best sultanas , and how can I expect the best sultanas at that price ? It is a flaw inherent in the business mind , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>may do well to be tender to it , considering all that the business mind has done for England .</p>
    <p n="1607"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , in summer especially , the mews is a serious nuisance . The smoking-room , too , is an abominable little den . The house opposite has been taken by operatic people . Ducie Street 's going down , it 's my private opinion . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1608"><said who="#Henry">“ How sad ! It 's only a few years since they built those pretty houses . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1609"><said who="#Margaret">“ Shows things are moving . Good for trade . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1610"><said who="#Henry">“ I hate this continual flux of London . It is an epitome of us at our worst — eternal formlessness ; all the qualities , good , bad , and indifferent , streaming away — streaming , streaming for ever . That 's why I dread it so . I mistrust rivers , even in scenery . Now , the sea — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1611"><said who="#Margaret">“ High tide , yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1612"><said who="#Henry">“ Hoy toid ”</said>— from the promenading youths .</p>
    <p n="1613"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ And these are the men to whom we give the vote , ”</said>observed<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, omitting to add that they were also the men to whom he gave work as clerks — work that scarcely encouraged them to grow into other men .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ However , they have their own lives and interests . Let 's get on . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1614">He turned as he spoke , and prepared to see her back to The Bays . The business was over . His hotel was in the opposite direction , and if he accompanied her his letters would be late for the post . She implored him not to come , but he was obdurate .</p>
    <p n="1615"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ A nice beginning , if your aunt saw you slip in alone ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1616"><said who="#Margaret">“ But I always do go about alone . Considering I 've walked over the Apennines , it 's common sense . You will make me so angry . I do n't the least take it as a compliment . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1617">He laughed , and lit a cigar .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ It is n't meant as a compliment , my dear . I just wo n't have you going about in the dark . Such people about too ! It 's dangerous . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1618"><said who="#Margaret">“ Ca n't I look after myself ? I do wish — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1619"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Come along ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>; no wheedling . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1620">A younger woman might have resented his masterly ways , but<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had too firm a grip of life to make a fuss . She was , in her own way , as masterly . If he was a fortress she was a mountain peak , whom all might tread , but whom the snows made nightly virginal . Disdaining the heroic outfit , excitable in her methods , garrulous , episodical , shrill , she misled her lover much as she had misled her aunt . He mistook her fertility for Weakness . He supposed her “ as clever as they make them , ” but no more , not realising that she was penetrating to the depths of his soul , and approving of what she found there .</p>
    <p n="1621">And if insight were sufficient , if the inner life were the whole of life , their happiness had been assured .</p>
    <p n="1622">They walked ahead briskly . The parade and the road after it were well lighted , but it was darker in<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>'s garden . As they were going up by the side-paths , through some rhododendrons ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, who was in front , said “<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>” rather huskily , turned , dropped his cigar , and took her in his arms .</p>
    <p n="1623">She was startled , and nearly screamed , but recovered herself at once , and kissed with genuine love the lips that were pressed against her own . It was their first kiss , and when it was over he saw her safely to the door and rang the bell for her but disappeared into the night before the maid answered it . On looking back , the incident displeased her . It was so isolated . Nothing in their previous conversation had heralded it , and , worse still , no tenderness had ensued . If a man cannot lead up to passion he can at all events lead down from it , and she had hoped , after her complaisance , for some interchange of gentle words . But he had hurried away as if ashamed , and for an instant she was reminded of<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>.</p>

    <p n="1640"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>greeted her lord with peculiar tenderness on the morrow . Mature as he was , she might yet be able to help him to the building of the rainbow bridge that should connect the prose in us with the passion . Without it we are meaningless fragments , half monks , half beasts , unconnected arches that have never joined into a man . With it love is born , and alights on the highest curve , glowing against the grey , sober against the fire . Happy the man who sees from either aspect the glory of these outspread wings . The roads of his soul lie clear , and he and his friends shall find easy-going .</p>
    <p n="1641">It was hard-going in the roads of<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>'s soul . From boyhood he had neglected them .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I am not a fellow who bothers about my own inside . ”</said>Outwardly he was cheerful , reliable , and brave ; but within , all had reverted to chaos , ruled , so far as it was ruled at all , by an incomplete asceticism . Whether as boy , husband , or widower , he had always the sneaking belief that bodily passion is bad , a belief that is desirable only when held passionately . Religion had confirmed him . The words that were read aloud on Sunday to him and to other respectable men were the words that had once kindled the souls of St. Catherine and St. Francis into a white-hot hatred of the carnal . He could not be as the saints and love the Infinite with a seraphic ardour , but he could be a little ashamed of loving a wife . Amabat , amare timebat . And it was here that<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>hoped to help him .</p>
    <p n="1642">It did not seem so difficult . She need trouble him with no gift of her own . She would only point out the salvation that was latent in his own soul , and in the soul of every man . Only connect ! That was the whole of her sermon . Only connect the prose and the passion , and both will be exalted , and human love will be seen at its height . Live in fragments no longer . Only connect and the beast and the monk , robbed of the isolation that is life to either , will die .</p>
    <p n="1643">Nor was the message difficult to give . It need not take the form of a good “ talking . ” By quiet indications the bridge would be built and span their lives with beauty .</p>
    <p n="1644">But she failed . For there was one quality in<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>for which she was never prepared , however much she reminded herself of it : his obtuseness . He simply did not notice things , and there was no more to be said . He never noticed that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>were hostile , or that<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was not interested in currant plantations ; he never noticed the lights and shades that exist in the greyest conversation , the finger-posts , the milestones , the collisions , the illimitable views . Once — on another occasion — she scolded him about it . He was puzzled , but replied with a laugh :<said who="#Tibby">“ My motto is Concentrate . I 've no intention of frittering away my strength on that sort of thing . ”</said>“ It is n't frittering away the strength , ” she protested .<said who="#Tibby">“ It 's enlarging the space in which you may be strong . ”</said>He answered :<said who="#Tibby">“ You 're a clever little woman , but my motto 's Concentrate . ”</said>And this morning he concentrated with a vengeance .</p>
    <p n="1645">They met in the rhododendrons of yesterday . In the daylight the bushes were inconsiderable and the path was bright in the morning sun . She was with<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who had been ominously quiet since the affair was settled .<said who="#Helen">“ Here we all are ! ”</said>she cried , and took him by one hand , retaining her sister 's in the other .</p>
    <p n="1646"><said who="#Tibby">“ Here we are . Good-morning ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1647"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>replied ,<said who="#Helen">“ Good-morning ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1648"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, she has had such a nice letter from the queer , cross boy . Do you remember him ? He had a sad moustache , but the back of his head was young . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1649"><said who="#Henry">“ I have had a letter too . Not a nice one — I want to talk it over with you ”</said>; for<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard Bast</persName>was nothing to him now that she had given him her word ; the triangle of sex was broken for ever .</p>
    <p n="1650"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Thanks to your hint , he 's clearing out of<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1651"><said who="#Henry">“ Not a bad business that Porphyrion , ”</said>he said absently , as he took his own letter out of his pocket .</p>
    <p n="1652"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Not a BAD — ”</said>she exclaimed , dropping his hand .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Surely , on Chelsea Embankment — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1653"><said who="#Helen">“ Here 's our hostess . Good-morning ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>. Fine rhododendrons . Good-morning , Frau Liesecke ; we manage to grow flowers in England , do n't we ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1654"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Not a BAD business ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1655"><said who="#Helen">“ No . My letter 's about Howards End .<persName corresp="#Bryce">Bryce</persName>has been ordered abroad , and wants to sublet it — I am far from sure that I shall give him permission . There was no clause in the agreement . In my opinion , subletting is a mistake . If he can find me another tenant , whom I consider suitable , I may cancel the agreement . Morning ,<persName corresp="#Schlegel">Schlegel</persName>. Do n't you think that 's better than subletting ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1656"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had dropped her hand now , and he had steered her past the whole party to the seaward side of the house . Beneath them was the bourgeois little bay , which must have yearned all through the centuries for just such a watering-place as Swanage to be built on its margin .</p>
    <p n="1657">The waves were colourless , and the Bournemouth steamer gave a further touch of insipidity , drawn up against the pier and hooting wildly for excursionists .</p>
    <p n="1658"><said who="#Helen">“ When there is a sublet I find that damage — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1659"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Do excuse me , but about<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>. I do n't feel easy — might I just bother you ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1660">Her manner was so serious that he stopped , and asked her a little sharply what she wanted .</p>
    <p n="1661"><said who="#Helen">“ You said on Chelsea Embankment , surely , that it was a bad concern , so we advised this clerk to clear out . He writes this morning that he 's taken our advice , and now you say it 's not a bad concern . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1662"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ A clerk who clears out of any concern , good or bad , without securing a berth somewhere else first , is a fool , and I 've no pity for him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1663"><said who="#Helen">“ He has not done that . He 's going into a bank in Camden Town , he says . The salary 's much lower , but he hopes to manage — a branch of Dempster 's Bank . Is that all right ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1664"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Dempster ! Why goodness me , yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1665"><said who="#Helen">“ More right than<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1666"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Yes , yes , yes ; safe as houses — safer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1667"><said who="#Helen">“ Very many thanks . I 'm sorry — if you sublet —? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1668"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ If he sublets , I sha n't have the same control . In theory there should be no more damage done at Howards End ; in practice there will be . Things may be done for which no money can compensate . For instance , I should n't want that fine wych-elm spoilt . It hangs —<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, we must go and see the old place some time . It 's pretty in its way . We 'll motor down and have lunch with<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1669"><said who="#Margaret">“ I should enjoy that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>bravely .</p>
    <p n="1670"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ What about next Wednesday ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1671"><said who="#Margaret">“ Wednesday ? No , I could n't well do that .<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>expects us to stop here another week at least . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1672"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ But you can give that up now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1673"><said who="#Margaret">“ Er — no , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, after a moment 's thought .</p>
    <p n="1674"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Oh , that 'll be all right . I 'll speak to her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1675"><said who="#Margaret">“ This visit is a high solemnity . My aunt counts on it year after year . She turns the house upside down for us ; she invites our special friends — she scarcely knows<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>, and we can n't leave her on her hands . I missed one day , and she would be so hurt if I did n't stay the full ten . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1676"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ But I 'll say a word to her . Do n't you bother . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1677"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, I wo n't go . Do n't bully me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1678"><said who="#Henry">“ You want to see the house , though ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1679"><said who="#Margaret">“ Very much — I 've heard so much about it , one way or the other . Are n't there pigs ’ teeth in the wych-elm ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1680"><said who="#Henry">“ PIGS TEETH ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1681"><said who="#Margaret">“ And you chew the bark for toothache . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1682"><said who="#Henry">“ What a rum notion ! Of course not ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1683"><said who="#Margaret">“ Perhaps I have confused it with some other tree . There are still a great number of sacred trees in England , it seems . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1684">But he left her to intercept<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, whose voice could be heard in the distance ; to be intercepted himself by<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1685"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh .<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, about<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>— ”</said>she began and went scarlet all over her face .</p>
    <p n="1686"><said who="#Margaret">“ It 's all right , ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, catching them up .<said who="#Margaret">“ Dempster 's Bank 's better . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1687"><said who="#Helen">“ But I think you told us<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>was bad , and would smash before Christmas . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1688"><said who="#Margaret">“ Did I ? It was still outside the Tariff Ring , and had to take rotten policies . Lately it came in — safe as houses now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1689"><said who="#Helen">“ In other words ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>need never have left it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1690"><said who="#Margaret">“ No , the fellow need n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1691"><said who="#Helen">“ — and need n't have started life elsewhere at a greatly reduced salary . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1692"><said who="#Margaret">“ He only says ‘ reduced , ’ ”</said>corrected<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, seeing trouble ahead .</p>
    <p n="1693"><said who="#Helen">“ With a man so poor , every reduction must be great . I consider it a deplorable misfortune . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1694"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, intent on his business with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, was going steadily on , but the last remark made him say :<said who="#Margaret">“ What ? What 's that ? Do you mean that I 'm responsible ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1695"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ You 're ridiculous ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1696"><said who="#Helen">“ You seem to think — ”</said>He looked at his watch .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Let me explain the point to you . It is like this . You seem to assume , when a business concern is conducting a delicate negotiation , it ought to keep the public informed stage by stage .<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">The Porphyrion</persName>, according to you , was bound to say , ‘ I am trying all I can to get into the Tariff Ring . I am not sure that I shall succeed , but it is the only thing that will save me from insolvency , and I am trying . ’ My dear<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="1697"><said who="#the_Porphyrion">“ Is that your point ? A man who had little money has less — that 's mine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1698"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I am grieved for your clerk . But it is all in the days work . It 's part of the battle of life . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1699"><said who="#the_Porphyrion">“ A man who had little money — ”</said>she repeated ,<said who="#the_Porphyrion">“ has less , owing to us . Under these circumstances I consider ‘ the battle of life ’ a happy expression .</said></p>
    <p n="1700"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Oh come , come ! ”</said>he protested pleasantly ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ you 're not to blame . No one 's to blame . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1701"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Is no one to blame for anything ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1702"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I would n't say that , but you 're taking it far too seriously . Who is this fellow ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1703"><said who="#Helen">“ We have told you about the fellow twice already , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ You have even met the fellow . He is very poor and his wife is an extravagant imbecile . He is capable of better things . We — we , the upper classes — thought we would help him from the height of our superior knowledge — and here 's the result ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1704">He raised his finger .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Now , a word of advice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1705"><said who="#Helen">“ I require no more advice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1706"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ A word of advice . Do n't take up that sentimental attitude over the poor . See that she does n't ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. The poor are poor , and one 's sorry for them , but there it is . As civilisation moves forward , the shoe is bound to pinch in places , and it 's absurd to pretend that any one is responsible personally . Neither you , nor I , nor my informant , nor the man who informed him , nor the directors of<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>, are to blame for this clerk 's loss of salary . It 's just the shoe pinching — no one can help it ; and it might easily have been worse . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1707"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>quivered with indignation .</p>
    <p n="1708"><said who="#Helen">“ By all means subscribe to charities — subscribe to them largely — but do n't get carried away by absurd schemes of Social Reform . I see a good deal behind the scenes , and you can take it from me that there is no Social Question — except for a few journalists who try to get a living out of the phrase . There are just rich and poor , as there always have been and always will be . Point me out a time when men have been equal — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1709"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I did n't say — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1710"><said who="#Helen">“ Point me out a time when desire for equality has made them happier . No , no . You can n't . There always have been rich and poor . I 'm no fatalist . Heaven forbid ! But our civilisation is moulded by great impersonal forces ”</said>( his voice grew complacent ; it always did when he eliminated the personal ) , “ and there always will be rich and poor . You can n't deny it ” ( and now it was a respectful voice ) —<said who="#Helen">“ and you can n't deny that , in spite of all , the tendency of civilisation has on the whole been upward . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1711"><said who="#Helen">“ Owing to God , I suppose , ”</said>flashed<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1712">He stared at her .</p>

    <p n="1714">It was no good instructing the girl if she was going to talk about God in that neurotic modern way .

He thought ,<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ She rather reminds me of<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1715"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>looked out at the sea .</p>

She saw that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s nerves were exasperated by the unlucky<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Bast</persName>business beyond the bounds of politeness . There might at any minute be a real explosion , which even<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>would notice .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>must be removed .</p>
    <p n="1722"><said who="#Henry">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>! ”</said>her aunt called .<said who="#Henry">“ Magsy ! It is n't true , surely , what<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>says , that you want to go away early next week ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1723"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not ‘ want , ’ ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s prompt reply ;<said who="#Margaret">“ but there is so much to be settled , and I do want to see the<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1724"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ But going away without taking the Weymouth trip , or even the Lulworth ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>, coming nearer .<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ Without going once more up Nine Barrows Down ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1725"><said who="#Margaret">“ I 'm afraid so . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1727">A wave of tenderness came over her . She put a hand on either shoulder , and looked deeply into the black , bright eyes . What was behind their competent stare ? She knew , but was not disquieted .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="23">
    <p n="1728"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had no intention of letting things slide , and the evening before she left Swanage she gave her sister a thorough scolding . She censured her , not for disapproving of the engagement , but for throwing over her disapproval a veil of mystery .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was equally frank .<said who="#Helen">“ Yes , ”</said>she said , with the air of one looking inwards ,<said who="#Helen">“ there is a mystery . I can n't help it . It 's not my fault . It 's the way life has been made . ”</said><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>in those days was over-interested in the subconscious self . She exaggerated the Punch and Judy aspect of life , and spoke of mankind as puppets , whom an invisible showman twitches into love and war .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>pointed out that if she dwelt on this she , too , would eliminate the personal .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was silent for a minute , and then burst into a queer speech , which cleared the air .<said who="#Margaret">“ Go on and marry him . I think you 're splendid ; and if any one can pull it off , you will . ”</said><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>denied that there was anything to “ pull off , ” but she continued :<said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , there is , and I was n't up to it with<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>. I can do only what 's easy . I can only entice and be enticed . I can n't , and wo n't , attempt difficult relations . If I marry , it will either be a man who 's strong enough to boss me or whom I 'm strong enough to boss . So I sha n't ever marry , for there are n't such men . And Heaven help any one whom I do marry , for I shall certainly run away from him before you can say ‘ Jack Robinson . ’ There ! Because I 'm uneducated . But you , you 're different ; you 're a heroine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1729"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>! Am I ? Will it be as dreadful for poor<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>as all that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1730"><said who="#Helen">“ You mean to keep proportion , and that 's heroic , it 's Greek , and I do n't see why it should n't succeed with you . Go on and fight with him and help him . Do n't ask me for help , or even for sympathy . Henceforward I 'm going my own way . I mean to be thorough , because thoroughness is easy . I mean to dislike your husband , and to tell him so . I mean to make no concessions to<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>. If<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>wants to live with me , he must lump me . I mean to love you more than ever . Yes , I do . You and I have built up something real , because it is purely spiritual . There 's no veil of mystery over us . Unreality and mystery begin as soon as one touches the body . The popular view is , as usual , exactly the wrong one . Our bothers are over tangible things — money , husbands , house-hunting . But Heaven will work of itself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1731"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was grateful for this expression of affection , and answered ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Perhaps . ”</said>All vistas close in the unseen — no one doubts it — but<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>closed them rather too quickly for her taste . At every turn of speech one was confronted with reality and the absolute . Perhaps<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>grew too old for metaphysics , perhaps<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>was weaning her from them , but she felt that there was something a little unbalanced in the mind that so readily shreds the visible . The business man who assumes that this life is everything , and the mystic who asserts that it is nothing , fail , on this side and on that , to hit the truth .<said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , I see , dear ; it 's about half-way between , ”</said>Aunt Juicy had hazarded in earlier years . No ; truth , being alive , was not half-way between anything . It was only to be found by continuous excursions into either realm , and though proportion is the final secret , to espouse it at the outset is to insure sterility .</p>
    <p n="1732"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, agreeing here , disagreeing there , would have talked till midnight , but<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, with her packing to do , focussed the conversation on<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>. She might abuse<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>behind his back , but please would she always be civil to him in company ?<said who="#Helen">“ I definitely dislike him , but I 'll do what I can , ”</said>promised<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ Do what you can with my friends in return . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1733">This conversation made<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>easier . Their inner life was so safe that they could bargain over externals in a way that would have been incredible to<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, and impossible for<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>or<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. There are moments when the inner life actually “ pays , ” when years of self-scrutiny , conducted for no ulterior motive , are suddenly of practical use . Such moments are still rare in the West ; that they come at all promises a fairer future .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, though unable to understand her sister , was assured against estrangement , and returned to London with a more peaceful mind .</p>
    <p n="1734">The following morning , at eleven o'clock , she presented herself at the offices of the Imperial and West African Rubber Company . She was glad to go there , for<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>had implied his business rather than described it , and the formlessness and vagueness that one associates with Africa itself had hitherto brooded over the main sources of his wealth . Not that a visit to the office cleared things up . There was just the ordinary surface scum of ledgers and polished counters and brass bars that began and stopped for no possible reason , of electric-light globes blossoming in triplets , of little rabbit-hutches faced with glass or wire , of little rabbits . And even when she penetrated to the inner depths , she found only the ordinary table and Turkey carpet , and though the map over the fireplace did depict a helping of West Africa , it was a very ordinary map . Another map hung opposite , on which the whole continent appeared , looking like a whale marked out for a blubber , and by its side was a door , shut , but<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>'s voice came through it , dictating a “ strong ” letter . She might have been at<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>, or Dempster 's Bank , or her own wine-merchant 's . Everything seems just alike in these days . But perhaps she was seeing the Imperial side of the company rather than its West African , and Imperialism always had been one of her difficulties .</p>
    <p n="1735"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ One minute ! ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>on receiving her name . He touched a bell , the effect of which was to produce<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1736"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>had written his father an adequate letter — more adequate than<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s , through which a girlish indignation throbbed . And he greeted his future stepmother with propriety .</p>
    <p n="1737"><said who="#Evie">“ I hope that my wife — how do you do ?— will give you a decent lunch , ”</said>was his opening .<said who="#Evie">“ I left instructions , but we live in a rough-and-ready way . She expects you back to tea , too , after you have had a look at Howards End . I wonder what you 'll think of the place . I would n't touch it with tongs myself . Do sit down ! It 's a measly little place . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1738"><said who="#Margaret">“ I shall enjoy seeing it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, feeling , for the first time , shy .</p>
    <p n="1739"><said who="#Evie">“ You 'll see it at its worst , for<persName corresp="#Bryce">Bryce</persName>decamped abroad last Monday without even arranging for a charwoman to clear up after him . I never saw such a disgraceful mess . It 's unbelievable . He was n't in the house a month . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1740"><said who="#Henry">“ I 've more than a little bone to pick with<persName corresp="#Bryce">Bryce</persName>, ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>from the inner chamber .</p>
    <p n="1741"><said who="#Evie">“ Why did he go so suddenly ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1742"><said who="#Henry">“ Invalid type ; could n't sleep . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1743"><said who="#Evie">“ Poor fellow ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1744"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Poor fiddlesticks ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, joining them .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ He had the impudence to put up notice-boards without as much as saying with your leave or by your leave .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>flung them down . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1745"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Yes , I flung them down , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>modestly .</p>
    <p n="1746"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I 've sent a telegram after him , and a pretty sharp one , too . He , and he in person , is responsible for the upkeep of that house for the next three years . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1747"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ The keys are at the farm ; we would n't have the keys . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1748"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Quite right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1749"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>would have taken them , but I was in , fortunately . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1750"><said who="#Margaret">“ What 's Mr.<persName corresp="#Bryce">Bryce</persName>like ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1751">But nobody cared . Mr.<persName corresp="#Bryce">Bryce</persName>was the tenant , who had no right to sublet ; to have defined him further was a waste of time . On his misdeeds they descanted profusely , until the girl who had been typing the strong letter game out with it .<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>added his signature .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Now we 'll be off , ”</said>said he .</p>
    <p n="1752">A motor-drive , a form of felicity detested by<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, awaited her .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>saw them in , civil to the last , and in a moment the offices of the Imperial and West African Rubber Company faded away . But it was not an impressive drive . Perhaps the weather was to blame , being grey and banked high with weary clouds . Perhaps Hertfordshire is scarcely intended for motorists . Did not a gentleman once motor so quickly through Westmoreland that he missed it ? and if Westmoreland can be missed , it will fare ill with a county whose delicate structure particularly needs the attentive eye . Hertfordshire is England at its quietest , with little emphasis of river and hill ; it is England meditative . If Drayton were with us again to write a new edition of his incomparable poem , he would sing the nymphs of Hertfordshire as indeterminate of feature , with hair obfuscated by the London smoke . Their eyes would be sad , and averted from their fate towards the Northern flats , their leader not Isis or Sabrina , but the slowly flowing Lea . No glory of raiment would be theirs , no urgency of dance ; but they would be real nymphs .</p>
    <p n="1753">The chauffeur could not travel as quickly as he had hoped , for the Great North Road was full of Easter traffic . But he went quite quick enough for<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, a poor-spirited creature , who had chickens and children on the brain .</p>
    <p n="1754"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ They 're all right , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ They 'll learn — like the swallows and the telegraph-wires . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1755"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Yes , but , while they 're learning — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1756"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ The motor 's come to stay , ”</said>he answered .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ One must get about . There 's a pretty church — oh , you are n't sharp enough . Well , look out , if the road worries you — right outward at the scenery . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1757">She looked at the scenery . It heaved and merged like porridge . Presently it congealed . They had arrived .</p>
    <p n="1758"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s house on the left ; on the right the swelling forms of the Six Hills . Their appearance in such a neighbourhood surprised her . They interrupted the stream of residences that was thickening up towards Hilton . Beyond them she saw meadows and a wood , and beneath them she settled that soldiers of the best kind lay buried . She hated war and liked soldiers — it was one of her amiable inconsistencies .</p>
    <p n="1759">But here was<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, dressed up to the nines , standing at the door to greet them , and here were the first drops of the rain . They ran in gaily , and after a long wait in the drawing-room , sat down to the rough-and-ready lunch , every dish of which concealed or exuded cream . Mr.<persName corresp="#Bryce">Bryce</persName>was the chief topic of conversation .<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>described his visit with the key , while her father-in-law gave satisfaction by chaffing her and contradicting all she said . It was evidently the custom to laugh at<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>. He chaffed<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>too , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>roused from a grave meditation was pleased and chaffed him back .<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>seemed surprised and eyed her curiously . After lunch the two children came down .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>disliked babies , but hit it off better with the two-year-old , and sent<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>into fits of laughter by talking sense to him .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Kiss them now , and come away , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. She came , but refused to kiss them ; it was such hard luck on the little things , she said , and though<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>proffered Chorly-worly and Porgly-woggles in turn , she was obdurate .</p>
    <p n="1760">By this time it was raining steadily . The car came round with the hood up , and again she lost all sense of space . In a few minutes they stopped , and<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>opened the door of the car .</p>
    <p n="1761"><said who="#Margaret">“ What 's happened ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1762"><said who="#Margaret">“ What do you suppose ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1763">A little porch was close up against her face .</p>
    <p n="1764"><said who="#Henry">“ Are we there already ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1765"><said who="#Margaret">“ We are . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1766"><said who="#Henry">“ Well , I never ! In years ago it seemed so far away . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1767">Smiling , but somehow disillusioned , she jumped out , and her impetus carried her to the front-door . She was about to open it , when<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>said :<said who="#Margaret">“ That 's no good ; it 's locked . Who 's got the key ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1768">As he had himself forgotten to call for the key at the farm , no one replied . He also wanted to know who had left the front gate open , since a cow had strayed in from the road , and was spoiling the croquet lawn . Then he said rather crossly :<said who="#Henry">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, you wait in the dry . I 'll go down for the key . It is n't a hundred yards . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1769"><said who="#Margaret">“ May n't I come too ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1770"><said who="#Henry">“ No ; I shall be back before I 'm gone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1771">Then the car turned away , and it was as if a curtain had risen . For the second time that day she saw the appearance of the earth .</p>
    <p n="1772">There were the greengage-trees that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had once described , there the tennis lawn , there the hedge that would be glorious with dog-roses in June , but the vision now was of black and palest green . Down by the dell-hole more vivid colours were awakening , and Lent lilies stood sentinel on its margin , or advanced in battalions over the grass . Tulips were a tray of jewels . She could not see the wych-elm tree , but a branch of the celebrated vine , studded with velvet knobs had covered the perch . She was struck by the fertility of the soil ; she had seldom been in a garden where the flowers looked so well , and even the weeds she was idly plucking out of the porch were intensely green . Why had poor Mr.<persName corresp="#Bryce">Bryce</persName>fled from all this beauty ? For she had already decided that the place was beautiful .</p>
    <p n="1773"><said who="#Margaret">“ Naughty cow ! Go away ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>to the cow , but without indignation .</p>
    <p n="1774">Harder came the rain , pouring out of a windless sky , and spattering up from the notice-boards of the house-agents , which lay in a row on the lawn where<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>had hurled them . She must have interviewed<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>in another world — where one did have interviews . How<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>would revel in such a notion !<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>dead , all people dead , nothing alive but houses and gardens . The obvious dead , the intangible alive , and no connection at all between them !<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>smiled . Would that her own fancies were as clear-cut ! Would that she could deal as high-handedly with the world ! Smiling and sighing , she laid her hand upon the door . It opened . The house was not locked up at all .</p>
    <p n="1775">She hesitated . Ought she to wait for<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>? He felt strongly about property , and might prefer to show her over himself . On the other hand , he had told her to keep in the dry , and the porch was beginning to drip . So she went in , and the draught from inside slammed the door behind .</p>
    <p n="1776">Desolation greeted her . Dirty finger-prints were on the hall-windows , flue and rubbish on its unwashed boards . The civilisation of luggage had been here for a month , and then decamped . Dining-room and drawing-room — right and left — were guessed only by their wallpapers . They were just rooms where one could shelter from the rain . Across the ceiling of each ran a great beam . The dining-room and hall revealed theirs openly , but the drawing-room 's was match-boarded — because the facts of life must be concealed from ladies ? Drawing-room , dining-room , and hall — how petty the names sounded ! Here were simply three rooms where children could play and friends shelter from the rain . Yes , and they were beautiful .</p>
    <p n="1777">Then she opened one of the doors opposite — there were two — and exchanged wall-papers for whitewash . It was the servants ’ part , though she scarcely realised that : just rooms again , where friends might shelter . The garden at the back was full of flowering cherries and plums . Farther on were hints of the meadow and a black cliff of pines . Yes , the meadow was beautiful .</p>
    <p n="1778">Penned in by the desolate weather , she recaptured the sense of space which the motor had tried to rob from her . She remembered again that ten square miles are not ten times as wonderful as one square mile , that a thousand square miles are not practically the same as heaven . The phantom of bigness , which London encourages , was laid for ever when she paced from the hall at Howards End to its kitchen and heard the rain run this way and that where the watershed of the roof divided it .</p>
    <p n="1779">Now<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>came to her mind , scrutinising half Wessex from the ridge of the Purbeck Downs , and saying :<said who="#Helen">“ You will have to lose something . ”</said>She was not so sure . For instance she would double her kingdom by opening the door that concealed the stairs .</p>
    <p n="1780">Now she thought of the map of Africa ; of empires ; of her father ; of the two supreme nations , streams of whose life warmed her blood , but , mingling , had cooled her brain . She paced back into the hall , and as she did so the house reverberated .</p>
    <p n="1781"><said who="#Helen">“ Is that you ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>? ”</said>she called .</p>
    <p n="1782">There was no answer , but the house reverberated again .</p>
    <p n="1783"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, have you got in ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1784">But it was the heart of the house beating , faintly at first , then loudly , martially . It dominated the rain .</p>
    <p n="1785">It is the starved imagination , not the well-nourished , that is afraid .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>flung open the door to the stairs . A noise as of drums seemed to deafen her . A woman , an old woman , was descending , with figure erect , with face impassive , with lips that parted and said dryly :</p>
    <p n="1786"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh ! Well , I took you for<persName corresp="#Ruth">Ruth</persName>Wilcox . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1787"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>stammered :<said who="#Helen">“ I —<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>— I ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1788"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ In fancy , of course — in fancy . You had her way of walking . Good-day . ”</said>And the old woman passed out into the rain .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="24">
    <p n="1789"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ It gave her quite a turn , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, when retailing the incident to<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>at tea-time .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ None of you girls have any nerves , really . Of course , a word from me put it all right , but silly old<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>— she frightened you , did n't she ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>? There you stood clutching a bunch of weeds . She might have said something , instead of coming down the stairs with that alarming bonnet on . I passed her as I came in . Enough to make the car shy . I believe<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>goes in for being a character ; some old maids do . ”</said>He lit a cigarette .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ It is their last resource . Heaven knows what she was doing in the place ; but that 's<persName corresp="#Bryce">Bryce</persName>'s business , not mine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1790"><said who="#Margaret">“ I was n't as foolish as you suggest , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>“ She only startled me , for the house had been silent so long . ”</p>
    <p n="1791"><said who="#Dolly">“ Did you take her for a spook ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, for whom “ spooks " ’ and “ going to church ” summarised the unseen .</p>
    <p n="1792"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not exactly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1793"><said who="#Henry">“ She really did frighten you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, who was far from discouraging timidity in females .<said who="#Henry">“ Poor<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>! And very naturally . Uneducated classes are so stupid . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1794"><said who="#Margaret">“ Is<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>uneducated classes ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>asked , and found herself looking at the decoration scheme of<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s drawing-room .</p>
    <p n="1795"><said who="#Henry">“ She 's just one of the crew at the farm . People like that always assume things . She assumed you 'd know who she was . She left all the Howards End keys in the front lobby , and assumed that you 'd seen them as you came in , that you 'd lock up the house when you 'd done , and would bring them on down to her . And there was her niece hunting for them down at the farm . Lack of education makes people very casual . Hilton was full of women like<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>once . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1796"><said who="#Margaret">“ I should n't have disliked it , perhaps . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1797"><said who="#Dolly">“ Or<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>giving me a wedding present , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1798">Which was illogical but interesting . Through<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was destined to learn a good deal .</p>
    <p n="1799"><said who="#Margaret">“ But<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>said I must try not to mind , because she had known his grandmother . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1800"><said who="#Dolly">“ As usual , you 've got the story wrong , my good Dorothea . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1801"><said who="#Margaret">“ I meant great-grandmother — the one who left<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>the house . Were n't both of them and<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>friends when Howards End , too , was a farm ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1802">Her father-in-law blew out a shaft of smoke . His attitude to his dead wife was curious . He would allude to her , and hear her discussed , but never mentioned her by name . Nor was he interested in the dim , bucolic past .<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>was — for the following reason .</p>
    <p n="1803"><said who="#Dolly">“ Then had n't<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>a brother — or was it an uncle ? Anyhow , he popped the question , and<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>, she said ` No . ’ Just imagine , if she 'd said ‘ Yes , ’ she would have been<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s aunt . ( Oh , I say , that 's rather good ! ‘ Charlie 's Aunt ’ ! I must chaff him about that this evening . ) And the man went out and was killed . Yes , I ‘ m certain I 've got it right now .<persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>Howard — he was the last of them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1804"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I believe so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>negligently .</p>
    <p n="1805"><said who="#Dolly">“ I say ! Howards End — Howards Ended ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>.<said who="#Dolly">“ I 'm rather on the spot this evening , eh ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1806"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I wish you 'd ask whether<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>'s ended . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1807"><said who="#Dolly">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, how can you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1808"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Because , if he has had enough tea , we ought to go —<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s a good little woman , ”</said>he continued ,<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ but a little of her goes a long way . I could n't live near her if you paid me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1809"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>smiled . Though presenting a firm front to outsiders , no Wilcox could live near , or near the possessions of , any other Wilcox . They had the colonial spirit , and were always making for some spot where the white man might carry his burden unobserved . Of course , Howards End was impossible , so long as the younger couple were established in Hilton . His objections to the house were plain as daylight now .</p>
    <p n="1810"><persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>had had enough tea , and was sent to the garage , where their car had been trickling muddy water over<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s . The downpour had surely penetrated the Six Hills by now , bringing news of our restless civilisation .<said who="#Henry">“ Curious mounds , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>,<said who="#Henry">“ but in with you now ; another time . ”</said>He had to be up in London by seven — if possible , by six-thirty . Once more she lost the sense of space ; once more trees , houses , people , animals , hills , merged and heaved into one dirtiness , and she was at Wickham Place .</p>
    <p n="1811">Her evening was pleasant . The sense of flux which had haunted her all the year disappeared for a time . She forgot the luggage and the motor-cars , and the hurrying men who know so much and connect so little . She recaptured the sense of space , which is the basis of all earthly beauty , and , starting from Howards End , she attempted to realise England . She failed — visions do not come when we try , though they may come through trying . But an unexpected love of the island awoke in her , connecting on this side with the joys of the flesh , on that with the inconceivable .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and her father had known this love , poor<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard Bast</persName>was groping after it , but it had been hidden from<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>till this afternoon . It had certainly come through the house and old<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>. Through them : the notion of “ through ” persisted ; her mind trembled towards a conclusion which only the unwise have put into words . Then , veering back into warmth , it dwelt on ruddy bricks , flowering plum-trees , and all the tangible joys of spring .</p>
    <p n="1812"><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, after allaying her agitation , had taken her over his property , and had explained to her the use and dimensions of the various rooms . He had sketched the history of the little estate .<said who="#Henry">“ It is so unlucky , ”</said>ran the monologue ,<said who="#Henry">“ that money was n't put into it about fifty years ago . Then it had four — five — times the land — thirty acres at least . One could have made something out of it then — a small park , or at all events shrubberies , and rebuilt the house farther away from the road . What 's the good of taking it in hand now ? Nothing but the meadow left , and even that was heavily mortgaged when I first had to do with things — yes , and the house too . Oh , it was no joke . ”</said>She saw two women as he spoke , one old , the other young , watching their inheritance melt away . She saw them greet him as a deliverer .<said who="#Henry">“ Mismanagement did it — besides , the days for small farms are over . It does n't pay — except with intensive cultivation . Small holdings , back to the land — ah ! philanthropic bunkum . Take it as a rule that nothing pays on a small scale . Most of the land you see ( they were standing at an upper window , the only one which faced west ) belongs to the people at the Park — they made their pile over copper — good chaps . Avery 's Farm , Sishe 's — what they call the Common , where you see that ruined oak — one after the other fell in , and so did this , as near as is no matter . ”</said>But<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>had saved it ; without fine feelings or deep insight , but he had saved it , and she loved him for the deed .<said who="#Henry">“ When I had more control I did what I could — sold off the two and a half animals , and the mangy pony , and the superannuated tools ; pulled down the outhouses ; drained ; thinned out I do n't know how many guelder-roses and elder-trees ; and inside the house I turned the old kitchen into a hall , and made a kitchen behind where the dairy was . Garage and so on came later . But one could still tell it 's been an old farm . And yet it is n't the place that would fetch one of your artistic crew . ”</said>No , it was n't ; and if he did not quite understand it , the artistic crew would still less ; it was English , and the wych-elm that she saw from the window was an English tree . No report had prepared her for its peculiar glory . It was neither warrior , nor lover , nor god ; in none of these roles do the English excel . It was a comrade bending over the house , strength and adventure in its roots , but in its utmost fingers tenderness , and the girth , that a dozen men could not have spanned , became in the end evanescent , till pale bud clusters seemed to float in the air . It was a comrade . House and tree transcended any similes of sex .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>thought of them now , and was to think of them through many a windy night and London day , but to compare either to man , to woman , always dwarfed the vision . Yet they kept within limits of the human . Their message was not of eternity , but of hope on this side of the grave . As she stood in the one , gazing at the other , truer relationship had gleamed .</p>
    <p n="1813">Another touch , and the account of her day is finished . They entered the garden for a minute , and to<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>'s surprise she was right . Teeth , pigs ’ teeth , could be seen in the bark of the wych-elm tree — just the white tips of them showing .<said who="#Margaret">“ Extraordinary ! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Margaret">“ Who told you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1814"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I heard of it one winter in London , ”</said>was her answer , for she , too , avoided mentioning<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>by name .</p>

    <p n="1815"><persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>heard of her father 's engagement when she was in for a tennis tournament , and her play went simply to pot . That she should marry and leave him had seemed natural enough ; that he , left alone , should do the same was deceitful ; and now<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>said that it was all her fault .<said who="#Dolly">“ But I never dreamt of such a thing , ”</said>she grumbled .<said who="#Evie">“ Dad took me to call now and then , and made me ask her to<persName corresp="#Simpson">Simpson</persName>'s . Well , I 'm altogether off dad . ”</said>It was also an insult to their mother 's memory ; there they were agreed , and<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>had the idea of returning<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s lace and jewellery “ as a protest . ” Against what it would protest she was not clear ; but being only eighteen , the idea of renunciation appealed to her , the more as she did not care for jewellery or lace .<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>then suggested that she and Uncle Percy should pretend to break off their engagement , and then perhaps<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>would quarrel with<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, and break off his ; or<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>might be cabled for . But at this point<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>told them not to talk nonsense . So<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>settled to marry as soon as possible ; it was no good hanging about with these Schlegels eyeing her . The date of her wedding was consequently put forward from September to August , and in the intoxication of presents she recovered much of her good-humour .</p>
    <p n="1816"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>found that she was expected to figure at this function , and to figure largely ; it would be such an opportunity , said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, for her to get to know his set . Sir James Bidder would be there , and all the Cahills and the Fussells , and his sister-in-law ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Warrington">Mrs. Warrington</persName>Wilcox , had fortunately got back from her tour round the world .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>she loved , but his set promised to be another matter . He had not the knack of surrounding himself with nice people — indeed , for a man of ability and virtue his choice had been singularly unfortunate ; he had no guiding principle beyond a certain preference for mediocrity ; he was content to settle one of the greatest things in life haphazard , and so , while his investments went right , his friends generally went wrong . She would be told , “ Oh , So-and-so 's a good sort — a thundering good sort , ” and find , on meeting him , that he was a brute or a bore . If<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>had shown real affection , she would have understood , for affection explains everything . But he seemed without sentiment . The “ thundering good sort ” might at any moment become “ a fellow for whom I never did have much use , and have less now , ” and be shaken off cheerily into oblivion .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had done the same as a schoolgirl . Now she never forgot any one for whom she had once cared ; she connected , though the connection might be bitter , and she hoped that some day<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>would do the same .</p>
    <p n="1817"><persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>was not to be married from Ducie Street . She had a fancy for something rural , and , besides , no one would be in London then , so she left her boxes for a few weeks at<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>Grange , and her banns were duly published in the parish church , and for a couple of days the little town , dreaming between the ruddy hills , was roused by the clang of our civilisation , and drew up by the roadside to let the motors pass .<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>had been a discovery of<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>'s — a discovery of which he was not altogether proud . It was up towards the Welsh border , and so difficult of access that he had concluded it must be something special . A ruined castle stood in the grounds . But having got there , what was one to do ? The shooting was bad , the fishing indifferent , and womenfolk reported the scenery as nothing much . The place turned out to be in the wrong part of Shropshire , and though he never ran down his own property to others , he was only waiting to get it off his hands , and then to let fly .<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s marriage was its last appearance in public . As soon as a tenant was found , it became a house for which he never had had much use , and had less now , and , like Howards End , faded into Limbo .</p>
    <p n="1818">But on<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName><persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>was destined to make a lasting impression . She regarded it as her future home , and was anxious to start straight with the clergy , etc ., and , if possible , to see something of the local life . It was a market-town — as tiny a one as England possesses — and had for ages served that lonely valley , and guarded our marches against the Celt . In spite of the occasion , in spite of the numbing hilarity that greeted her as soon as she got into the reserved saloon at Paddington , her senses were awake and watching , and though<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>was to prove one of her innumerable false starts , she never forgot it , or the things that happened there .</p>
    <p n="1819">The London party only numbered eight — the Fussells , father and son , two Anglo-Indian ladies named Mrs. Plynlimmon and Lady Edser ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Warrington">Mrs. Warrington</persName>Wilcox and her daughter , and , lastly , the little girl , very smart and quiet , who figures at so many weddings , and who kept a watchful eye on<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, the bride-elect .<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>was absent — a domestic event detained her at Hilton ;<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>had cabled a humorous message ;<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>was to meet them with a trio of motors at Shrewsbury ;<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had refused her invitation ;<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>had never answered his . The management was excellent , as was to be expected with anything that<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>undertook ; one was conscious of his sensible and generous brain in the background . They were his guests as soon as they reached the train ; a special label for their luggage ; a courier ; a special lunch ; they had only to look pleasant and , where possible , pretty .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>thought with dismay of her own nuptials — presumably under the management of<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.<said who="#Tibby">“ Mr. Theobald<persName corresp="#Schlegel">Schlegel</persName>and Miss<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName><persName corresp="#Schlegel">Schlegel</persName>request the pleasure of Mrs. Plynlimmon 's company on the occasion of the marriage of their sister<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. ”</said>The formula was incredible , but it must soon be printed and sent , and though Wickham Place need not compete with<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>, it must feed its guests properly , and provide them with sufficient chairs . Her wedding would either be ramshackly or bourgeois — she hoped the latter . Such an affair as the present , staged with a deftness that was almost beautiful , lay beyond her powers and those of her friends .</p>
    <p n="1820">The low rich purr of a Great Western express is not the worst background for conversation , and the journey passed pleasantly enough . Nothing could have exceeded the kindness of the two men . They raised windows for some ladies , and lowered them for others , they rang the bell for the servant , they identified the colleges as the train slipped past Oxford , they caught books or bag-purses in the act of tumbling on to the floor . Yet there was nothing finicking about their politeness — it had the public-school touch , and , though sedulous , was virile . More battles than Waterloo have been won on our playing-fields , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>bowed to a charm of which she did not wholly approve , and said nothing when the Oxford colleges were identified wrongly .<said who="#Margaret">“ Male and female created He them ”</said>; the journey to Shrewsbury confirmed this questionable statement , and the long glass saloon , that moved so easily and felt so comfortable , became a forcing-house for the idea of sex .</p>
    <p n="1821">At Shrewsbury came fresh air .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was all for sight-seeing , and while the others were finishing their tea at the Raven , she annexed a motor and hurried over the astonishing city . Her chauffeur was not the faithful<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>, but an Italian , who dearly loved making her late .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, watch in hand , though with a level brow , was standing in front of the hotel when they returned . It was perfectly all right , he told her ; she was by no means the last . And then he dived into the coffee-room , and she heard him say , “ For God 's sake , hurry the women up ; we shall never be off , ” and Albert Fussell reply , “ Not I ; I 've done my share , ” and Colonel Fussell opine that the ladies were getting themselves up to kill . Presently Myra (<persName corresp="#Mrs._Warrington">Mrs. Warrington</persName>'s daughter ) appeared , and as she was his cousin ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>blew her up a little ; she had been changing her smart travelling hat for a smart motor hat . Then<persName corresp="#Mrs._Warrington">Mrs. Warrington</persName>herself , leading the quiet child ; the two Anglo-Indian ladies were always last . Maids , courier , heavy luggage , had already gone on by a branch-line to a station nearer<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>, but there were five hat-boxes and four dressing-bags to be packed , and five dust-cloaks to be put on , and to be put off at the last moment , because<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>declared them not necessary . The men presided over everything with unfailing good-humour . By half-past five the party was ready , and went out of Shrewsbury by the Welsh Bridge .</p>
    <p n="1822">Shropshire had not the reticence of Hertfordshire . Though robbed of half its magic by swift movement , it still conveyed the sense of hills . They were nearing the buttresses that force the Severn eastward and make it an English stream , and the sun , sinking over the Sentinels of Wales , was straight in their eyes . Having picked up another guest , they turned southward , avoiding the greater mountains , but conscious of an occasional summit , rounded and mild , whose colouring differed in quality from that of the lower earth , and whose contours altered more slowly . Quiet mysteries were in progress behind those tossing horizons : the West , as ever , was retreating with some secret which may not be worth the discovery , but which no practical man will ever discover .</p>
    <p n="1823">They spoke of Tariff Reform .</p>
    <p n="1824"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Warrington">Mrs. Warrington</persName>was just back from the Colonies . Like many other critics of Empire , her mouth had been stopped with food , and she could only exclaim at the hospitality with which she had been received , and warn the Mother Country against trifling with young Titans .<said who="#Mrs._Warrington">“ They threaten to cut the painter , ”</said>she cried ,<said who="#Mrs._Warrington">“ and where shall we be then ?<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, you 'll undertake to keep<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>sound about Tariff Reform ? It is our last hope . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1825"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>playfully confessed herself on the other side , and they began to quote from their respective handbooks while the motor carried them deep into the hills . Curious these were rather than impressive , for their outlines lacked beauty , and the pink fields on their summits suggested the handkerchiefs of a giant spread out to dry . An occasional outcrop of rock , an occasional wood , an occasional “ forest , ” treeless and brown , all hinted at wildness to follow , but the main colour was an agricultural green . The air grew cooler ; they had surmounted the last gradient , and<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>lay below them with its church , its radiating houses , its castle , its river-girt peninsula . Close to the castle was a grey mansion unintellectual but kindly , stretching with its grounds across the peninsula 's neck — the sort of mansion that was built all over England in the beginning of the last century , while architecture was still an expression of the national character . That was the Grange , remarked Albert , over his shoulder , and then he jammed the brake on , and the motor slowed down and stopped .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ I 'm sorry , ”</said>said he , turning round .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Do you mind getting out — by the door on the right . Steady on . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1826"><said who="#Mrs._Warrington">“ What 's happened ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Mrs._Warrington">Mrs. Warrington</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1827">Then the car behind them drew up , and the voice of<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>was heard saying :<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Get the women out at once . ”</said>There was a concourse of males , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and her companions were hustled out and received into the second car . What had happened ? As it started off again , the door of a cottage opened , and a girl screamed wildly at them .</p>
    <p n="1828"><said who="#Mrs._Warrington">“ What is it ? ”</said>the ladies cried .</p>
    <p n="1829"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>drove them a hundred yards without speaking . Then he said :<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ It 's all right . Your car just touched a dog . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1830"><said who="#Margaret">“ But stop ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, horrified .</p>
    <p n="1831"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ It did n't hurt him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1832"><said who="#Margaret">“ Did n't really hurt him ? ”</said>asked Myra .</p>
    <p n="1833"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1834"><said who="#Margaret">“ Do PLEASE stop ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, leaning forward . She was standing up in the car , the other occupants holding her knees to steady her .<said who="#Margaret">“ I want to go back , please . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1835"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>took no notice .</p>
    <p n="1836"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ We 've left Mr. Fussell behind , ”</said>said another ;<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ and Angelo , and<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1837"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , but no woman . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1838">“ I expect a little of “ —<persName corresp="#Mrs._Warrington">Mrs. Warrington</persName>scratched her palm —<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ will be more to the point than one of us ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1839"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ The insurance company see to that , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>,<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ and Albert will do the talking . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1840"><said who="#Margaret">“ I want to go back , though , I say ! ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, getting angry .</p>
    <p n="1841"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>took no notice . The motor , loaded with refugees , continued to travel very slowly down the hill .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ The men are there , ”</said>chorused the others .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ They will see to it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1842"><said who="#Margaret">“ The men CAN'T see to it . Oh , this is ridiculous !<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, I ask you to stop . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1843"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Stopping 's no good , ”</said>drawled<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1844"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Is n't it ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, and jumped straight out of the car . She fell on her knees , cut her gloves , shook her hat over her ear . Cries of alarm followed her .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ You 've hurt yourself , ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, jumping after her .</p>
    <p n="1845"><said who="#Margaret">“ Of course I 've hurt myself ! ”</said>she retorted .</p>
    <p n="1846"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ May I ask what — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1847"><said who="#Margaret">“ There 's nothing to ask , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1848"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Your hand 's bleeding . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1849"><said who="#Margaret">“ I know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1850"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I 'm in for a frightful row from the pater . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1851"><said who="#Margaret">“ You should have thought of that sooner ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1852"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>had never been in such a position before . It was a woman in revolt who was hobbling away from him — and the sight was too strange to leave any room for anger . He recovered himself when the others caught them up : their sort he understood . He commanded them to go back .</p>
    <p n="1853">Albert Fussell was seen walking towards them .</p>
    <p n="1854"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ It 's all right ! ”</said>he called .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ It was a cat . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1855"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ There ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>triumphantly .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ It 's only a rotten cat . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1856"><said who="#Margaret">“ Got room in your car for a little un ? I cut as soon as I saw it was n't a dog ; the chauffeurs are tackling the girl . ”</said>But<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>walked forward steadily . Why should the chauffeurs tackle the girl ? Ladies sheltering behind men , men sheltering behind servants — the whole system 's wrong , and she must challenge it .</p>
    <p n="1857"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>! ‘ Pon my word , you 've hurt your hand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1858"><said who="#Margaret">“ I 'm just going to see , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Do n't you wait , Mr. Fussell . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1859">The second motor came round the corner .<said who="#Crane">“ It is all right , madam , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>in his turn . He had taken to calling her madam .</p>
    <p n="1860"><said who="#Margaret">“ What 's all right ? The cat ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1861"><said who="#Crane">“ Yes , madam . The girl will receive compensation for it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1862"><said who="#Margaret">“ She was a very ruda girla , ”</said>said Angelo from the third motor thoughtfully .</p>
    <p n="1863"><said who="#Crane">“ Would n't you have been rude ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1864">The Italian spread out his hands , implying that he had not thought of rudeness , but would produce it if it pleased her . The situation became absurd . The gentlemen were again buzzing round<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>with offers of assistance , and Lady Edser began to bind up her hand . She yielded , apologising slightly , and was led back to the car , and soon the landscape resumed its motion , the lonely cottage disappeared , the castle swelled on its cushion of turf , and they had arrived . No doubt she had disgraced herself . But she felt their whole journey from London had been unreal . They had no part with the earth and its emotions . They were dust , and a stink , and cosmopolitan chatter , and the girl whose cat had been killed had lived more deeply than they .</p>
    <p n="1865"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, ”</said>she exclaimed , “ I have been so naughty , ” for she had decided to take up this line .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ We ran over a cat .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>told me not to jump out , but I would , and look ! ”</said>She held out her bandaged hand .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Your poor<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>went such a flop . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1866"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>looked bewildered . In evening dress , he was standing to welcome his guests in the hall .</p>
    <p n="1867"><said who="#Mrs._Warrington">“ Thinking it was a dog . ”</said>added<persName corresp="#Mrs._Warrington">Mrs. Warrington</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1868"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Ah , a dog 's a companion ! ”</said>said Colonel Fussell “ A dog 'll remember you . ”</p>
    <p n="1869"><said who="#Mrs._Warrington">“ Have you hurt yourself ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1870"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not to speak about ; and it 's my left hand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1871"><said who="#Mrs._Warrington">“ Well , hurry up and change . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1872">She obeyed , as did the others .<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>then turned to his son .</p>
    <p n="1873"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Now ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, what 's happened ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1874"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>was absolutely honest . He described what he believed to have happened . Albert had flattened out a cat , and<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>had lost her nerve , as any woman might . She had been got safely into the other car , but when it was in motion had leapt out again , in spite of all that they could say . After walking a little on the road , she had calmed down and had said that she was sorry . His father accepted this explanation , and neither knew that<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had artfully prepared the way for it . It fitted in too well with their view of feminine nature . In the smoking-room , after dinner , the Colonel put forward the view that<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>had jumped it out of devilry . Well he remembered as a young man , in the harbour of Gibraltar once , how a girl — a handsome girl , too — had jumped overboard for a bet . He could see her now , and all the lads overboard after her . But<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>agreed it was much more probably nerves in<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>'s case .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>was depressed . That woman had a tongue . She would bring worse disgrace on his father before she had done with them . He strolled out on to the castle mound to think the matter over . The evening was exquisite . On three sides of him a little river whispered , full of messages from the West ; above his head the ruins made patterns against the sky . He carefully reviewed their dealings with this family , until he fitted<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>into an orderly conspiracy . Paternity had made him suspicious . He had two children to look after , and more coming , and day by day they seemed less likely to grow up rich men .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ It is all very well , ”</said>he reflected ,<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ the pater 's saying that he will be just to all , but one can n't be just indefinitely . Money is n't elastic . What 's to happen if<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>has a family ? And , come to that , so may the pater . There 'll not be enough to go round , for there 's none coming in , either through<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>or Percy . It 's damnable ! ”</said>He looked enviously at the Grange , whose windows poured light and laughter . First and last , this wedding would cost a pretty penny . Two ladies were strolling up and down the garden terrace , and as the syllables “ Imperialism ” were wafted to his ears , he guessed that one of them was his aunt . She might have helped him , if she too had not had a family to provide for .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Every one for himself , ”</said>he repeated — a maxim which had cheered him in the past , but which rang grimly enough among the ruins of<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>. He lacked his father 's ability in business , and so had an ever higher regard for money ; unless he could inherit plenty , he feared to leave his children poor .</p>
    <p n="1875">As he sat thinking , one of the ladies left the terrace and walked into the meadow ; he recognised her as<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>by the white bandage that gleamed on her arm , and put out his cigar , lest the gleam should betray him . She climbed up the mound in zigzags , and at times stooped down , as if she was stroking the turf . It sounds absolutely incredible , but for a moment<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>thought that she was in love with him , and had come out to tempt him .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>believed in temptresses , who are indeed the strong man 's necessary complement , and having no sense of humour , he could not purge himself of the thought by a smile .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who was engaged to his father , and his sister 's wedding-guest , kept on her way without noticing him , and he admitted that he had wronged her on this point . But what was she doing ? Why was she stumbling about amongst the rubble and catching her dress in brambles and burrs ? As she edged round the keep , she must have got to windward and smelt his cigar-smoke , for she exclaimed ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Hullo ! Who 's that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1876"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>made no answer .</p>
    <p n="1877"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Saxon or Celt ? ”</said>she continued , laughing in the darkness .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ But it does n't matter . Whichever you are , you will have to listen to me . I love this place . I love Shropshire . I hate London . I am glad that this will be my home . Ah , dear ”</said>— she was now moving back towards the house —<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ what a comfort to have arrived ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1878"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ That woman means mischief , ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, and compressed his lips . In a few minutes he followed her indoors , as the ground was getting damp . Mists were rising from the river , and presently it became invisible , though it whispered more loudly . There had been a heavy downpour in the Welsh hills .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="26">
    <p n="1879">Next morning a fine mist covered the peninsula . The weather promised well , and the outline of the castle mound grew clearer each moment that<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>watched it . Presently she saw the keep , and the sun painted the rubble gold , and charged the white sky with blue . The shadow of the house gathered itself together , and fell over the garden . A cat looked up at her window and mewed . Lastly the river appeared , still holding the mists between its banks and its overhanging alders , and only visible as far as a hill , which cut off its upper reaches .</p>
    <p n="1880"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was fascinated by<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>. She had said that she loved it , but it was rather its romantic tension that held her . The rounded Druids of whom she had caught glimpses in her drive , the rivers hurrying down from them to England , the carelessly modelled masses of the lower hills , thrilled her with poetry . The house was insignificant , but the prospect from it would be an eternal joy , and she thought of all the friends she would have to stop in it , and of the conversion of<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>himself to a rural life .<persName>Society</persName>, too , promised favourably . The rector of the parish had dined with them last night , and she found that he was a friend of her father 's , and so knew what to find in her . She liked him . He would introduce her to the town . While , on her other side , Sir James Bidder sat , repeating that she only had to give the word , and he would whip up the county families for twenty miles round . Whether Sir James , who was Garden Seeds , had promised what he could perform , she doubted , but so long as<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>mistook them for the county families when they did call , she was content .</p>
    <p n="1881"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles Wilcox</persName>and Albert Fussell now crossed the lawn . They were going for a morning dip , and a servant followed them with their bathing-suits . She had meant to take a stroll herself before breakfast , but saw that the day was still sacred to men , and amused herself by watching their contretemps . In the first place the key of the bathing-shed could not be found .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>stood by the riverside with folded hands , tragical , while the servant shouted , and was misunderstood by another servant in the garden . Then came a difficulty about a springboard , and soon three people were running backwards and forwards over the meadow , with orders and counter orders and recriminations and apologies . If<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>wanted to jump from a motor-car , she jumped ; if<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>thought paddling would benefit his ankles , he paddled ; if a clerk desired adventure , he took a walk in the dark . But these athletes seemed paralysed . They could not bathe without their appliances , though the morning sun was calling and the last mists were rising from the dimpling stream . Had they found the life of the body after all ? Could not the men whom they despised as milksops beat them , even on their own ground ?</p>
    <p n="1882">She thought of the bathing arrangements as they should be in her day — no worrying of servants , no appliances , beyond good sense . Her reflections were disturbed by the quiet child , who had come out to speak to the cat , but was now watching her watch the men . She called , “ Good-morning , dear , ” a little sharply . Her voice spread consternation .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>looked round , and though completely attired in indigo blue , vanished into the shed , and was seen no more .</p>
    <p n="1883"><said who="#the_child">“ Miss Wilcox is up — ”</said>the child whispered , and then became unintelligible .</p>
    <p n="1884"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ What is that ? ”</said>it sounded like ,<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ — cut-yoke — sack-back — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1885"><said who="#Tibby">“ I can n't hear . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1886"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ — On the bed — tissue-paper — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1887">Gathering that the wedding-dress was on view , and that a visit would be seemly , she went to<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s room . All was hilarity here .<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, in a petticoat , was dancing with one of the Anglo-Indian ladies , while the other was adoring yards of white satin . They screamed , they laughed , they sang , and the dog barked .</p>
    <p n="1888"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>screamed a little too , but without conviction . She could not feel that a wedding was so funny . Perhaps something was missing in her equipment .</p>
    <p n="1889"><persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>gasped :<said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>is a rotter not to be here ! Oh , we would rag just then ! ”</said>Then<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>went down to breakfast .</p>
    <p n="1890"><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>was already installed ; he ate slowly and spoke little , and was , in<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s eyes , the only member of their party who dodged emotion successfully . She could not suppose him indifferent either to the loss of his daughter or to the presence of his future wife . Yet he dwelt intact , only issuing orders occasionally — orders that promoted the comfort of his guests . He inquired after her hand ; he set her to pour out the coffee and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Warrington">Mrs. Warrington</persName>to pour out the tea . When<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>came down there was a moment 's awkwardness , and both ladies rose to vacate their places .<said who="#Henry">“ Burton , ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>,<said who="#Henry">“ serve tea and coffee from the sideboard ! ”</said>It was n't genuine tact , but it was tact , of a sort — the sort that is as useful as the genuine , and saves even more situations at Board meetings .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>treated a marriage like a funeral , item by item , never raising his eyes to the whole , and “<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>, where is thy sting ?<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>, where is thy victory ? ” one would exclaim at the close .</p>
    <p n="1891">After breakfast<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>claimed a few words with him . It was always best to approach him formally . She asked for the interview , because he was going on to shoot grouse to-morrow , and she was returning to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>in town .</p>
    <p n="1892"><said who="#Margaret">“ Certainly , dear , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Margaret">“ Of course , I have the time . What do you want ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1893"><said who="#Helen">“ Nothing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1894"><said who="#Margaret">“ I was afraid something had gone wrong . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1895"><said who="#Helen">“ No ; I have nothing to say , but you may talk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1896">Glancing at his watch , he talked of the nasty curve at the lych-gate . She heard him with interest . Her surface could always respond to his without contempt , though all her deeper being might be yearning to help him . She had abandoned any plan of action .<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>is the best , and the more she let herself love him , the more chance was there that he would set his soul in order . Such a moment as this , when they sat under fair weather by the walks of their future home , was so sweet to her that its sweetness would surely pierce to him . Each lift of his eyes , each parting of the thatched lip from the clean-shaven , must prelude the tenderness that kills the Monk and the Beast at a single blow . Disappointed a hundred times , she still hoped . She loved him with too clear a vision to fear his cloudiness . Whether he droned trivialities , as to-day , or sprang kisses on her in the twilight , she could pardon him , she could respond .</p>
    <p n="1897"><said who="#Love">“ If there is this nasty curve , ”</said>she suggested ,<said who="#Love">“ could n't we walk to the church ? Not , of course , you and<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>; but the rest of us might very well go on first , and that would mean fewer carriages . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1898"><said who="#Margaret">“ One can n't have ladies walking through the Market Square . The Fussells would n't like it ; they were awfully particular at<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s wedding . My — she — our party was anxious to walk , and certainly the church was just round the corner , and I should n't have minded ; but the Colonel made a great point of it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1899"><said who="#Margaret">“ You men should n't be so chivalrous , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>thoughtfully .</p>
    <p n="1900"><said who="#Love">“ Why not ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1901">She knew why not , but said that she did not know . He then announced that , unless she had anything special to say , he must visit the wine-cellar , and they went off together in search of Burton . Though clumsy and a little inconvenient ,<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>was a genuine country-house . They clattered down flagged passages , looking into room after room , and scaring unknown maids from the performance of obscure duties . The wedding-breakfast must be in readiness when they come back from church , and tea would be served in the garden . The sight of so many agitated and serious people made<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>smile , but she reflected that they were paid to be serious , and enjoyed being agitated . Here were the lower wheels of the machine that was tossing<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>up into nuptial glory . A little boy blocked their way with pig-pails . His mind could not grasp their greatness , and he said :<said who="#Henry">“ By your leave ; let me pass , please . ”</said><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>asked him where Burton was . But the servants were so new that they did not know one another 's names . In the still-room sat the band , who had stipulated for champagne as part of their fee , and who were already drinking beer . Scents of Araby came from the kitchen , mingled with cries .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>knew what had happened there , for it happened at Wickham Place . One of the wedding dishes had boiled over , and the cook was throwing cedar-shavings to hide the smell . At last they came upon the butler .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>gave him the keys , and handed<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>down the cellar-stairs . Two doors were unlocked . She , who kept all her wine at the bottom of the linen-cupboard , was astonished at the sight .<said who="#Henry">“ We shall never get through it ! ”</said>she cried , and the two men were suddenly drawn into brotherhood , and exchanged smiles . She felt as if she had again jumped out of the car while it was moving .</p>
    <p n="1902">Certainly<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>would take some digesting . It would be no small business to remain herself , and yet to assimilate such an establishment . She must remain herself , for his sake as well as her own , since a shadowy wife degrades the husband whom she accompanies ; and she must assimilate for reasons of common honesty , since she had no right to marry a man and make him uncomfortable . Her only ally was the power of Home . The loss of Wickham Place had taught her more than its possession . Howards End had repeated the lesson . She was determined to create new sanctities among these hills .</p>
    <p n="1903">After visiting the wine-cellar , she dressed , and then came the wedding , which seemed a small affair when compared with the preparations for it . Everything went like one o'clock . Mr.<persName corresp="#Cahill">Cahill</persName>materialised out of space , and was waiting for his bride at the church door . No one dropped the ring or mispronounced the responses , or trod on<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s train , or cried . In a few minutes the clergymen performed their duty , the register was signed , and they were back in their carriages , negotiating the dangerous curve by the lych-gate .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was convinced that they had not been married at all , and that the Norman church had been intent all the time on other business .</p>
    <p n="1904">There were more documents to sign at the house , and the breakfast to eat , and then a few more people dropped in for the garden party . There had been a great many refusals , and after all it was not a very big affair — not as big as<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s would be . She noted the dishes and the strips of red carpet , that outwardly she might give<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>what was proper . But inwardly she hoped for something better than this blend of Sunday church and fox-hunting . If only some one had been upset ! But this wedding had gone off so particularly well — “ quite like a durbar ” in the opinion of Lady Edser , and she thoroughly agreed with her .</p>
    <p n="1905">So the wasted day lumbered forward , the bride and bridegroom drove off , yelling with laughter , and for the second time the sun retreated towards the hills of Wales .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, who was more tired than he owned , came up to her in the castle meadow , and , in tones of unusual softness , said that he was pleased . Everything had gone off so well . She felt that he was praising her , too , and blushed ; certainly she had done all she could with his intractable friends , and had made a special point of kotowing to the men . They were breaking camp this evening ; only the Warringtons and quiet child would stay the night , and the others were already moving towards the house to finish their packing .<said who="#Henry">“ I think it did go off well , ”</said>she agreed .<said>“ Since I had to jump out of the motor , I 'm thankful I lighted on my left hand . I am so very glad about it ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>dear ; I only hope that the guests at ours may be half as comfortable . You must all remember that we have no practical person among us , except my aunt , and she is not used to entertainments on a large scale . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1906"><said who="#Henry">“ I know , ”</said>he said gravely .<said who="#Henry">“ Under the circumstances , it would be better to put everything into the hands of Harrods or Whiteley 's , or even to go to some hotel . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1907"><said who="#Margaret">“ You desire a hotel ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1908"><said who="#Henry">“ Yes , because — well , I must n't interfere with you . No doubt you want to be married from your old home . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1909"><said who="#Margaret">“ My old home 's falling into pieces ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>. I only want my new . Is n't it a perfect evening — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1910"><said who="#Henry">“ The Alexandrina is n't bad — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1911"><said who="#Margaret">“ The Alexandrina , ”</said>she echoed , more occupied with the threads of smoke that were issuing from their chimneys , and ruling the sunlit slopes with parallels of grey .</p>
    <p n="1912"><said who="#Henry">“ It 's off Curzon Street . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1913"><said who="#Margaret">“ Is it ? Let 's be married from off Curzon Street . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1914">Then she turned westward , to gaze at the swirling gold . Just where the river rounded the hill the sun caught it . Fairyland must lie above the bend , and its precious liquid was pouring towards them past<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s bathing-shed . She gazed so long that her eyes were dazzled , and when they moved back to the house , she could not recognise the faces of people who were coming out of it . A parlour-maid was preceding them .</p>
    <p n="1915"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Who are those people ? ”</said>she asked .</p>
    <p n="1916"><said who="#Henry">“ They 're callers ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.<said who="#Henry">“ It 's too late for callers . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1917"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Perhaps they 're town people who want to see the wedding presents . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1918"><said who="#Henry">“ I 'm not at home yet to townees . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1919"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Well , hide among the ruins , and if I can stop them , I will . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1920">He thanked her .</p>
    <p n="1921"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>went forward , smiling socially . She supposed that these were unpunctual guests , who would have to be content with vicarious civility , since<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>and<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>were gone ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>tired , and the others in their rooms . She assumed the airs of a hostess ; not for long . For one of the group was<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>—<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>in her oldest clothes , and dominated by that tense , wounding excitement that had made her a terror in their nursery days .</p>
    <p n="1922"><said who="#Helen">“ What is it ? ”</said>she called .<said who="#Helen">“ Oh , what 's wrong ? Is<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>ill ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1923"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>spoke to her two companions , who fell back . Then she bore forward furiously .</p>
    <p n="1924"><said who="#Helen">“ They 're starving ! ”</said>she shouted .<said who="#Helen">“ I found them starving ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1925"><said who="#Henry">“ Who ? Why have you come ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1926"><said who="#Helen">“ The Basts . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1927"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>! ”</said>moaned<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Whatever have you done now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1928"><said who="#Helen">“ He has lost his place . He has been turned out of his bank . Yes , he 's done for . We upper classes have ruined him , and I suppose you 'll tell me it 's the battle of life . Starving . His wife is ill . Starving . She fainted in the train . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1929"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, are you mad ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1930"><said who="#Helen">“ Perhaps . Yes . If you like , I 'm mad . But I 've brought them . I 'll stand injustice no longer . I 'll show up the wretchedness that lies under this luxury , this talk of impersonal forces , this cant about God doing what we 're too slack to do ourselves . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1931"><said who="#Margaret">“ Have you actually brought two starving people from London to Shropshire ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1932"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was checked . She had not thought of this , and her hysteria abated .<said who="#Helen">“ There was a restaurant car on the train , ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="1933"><said who="#Margaret">“ Do n't be absurd . They are n't starving , and you know it . Now , begin from the beginning . I wo n't have such theatrical nonsense . How dare you ! Yes , how dare you ! ”</said>she repeated , as anger filled her , “ bursting in to<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s wedding in this heartless way . My goodness ! but you 've a perverted notion of philanthropy . Look ” — she indicated the house —<said who="#Margaret">“ servants , people out of the windows . They think it 's some vulgar scandal , and I must explain , ‘ Oh no , it 's only my sister screaming , and only two hangers-on of ours , whom she has brought here for no conceivable reason . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="1934"><said who="#Helen">“ Kindly take back that word ‘ hangers-on , ’ ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, ominously calm .</p>
    <p n="1935"><said who="#Margaret">“ Very well , ”</said>conceded<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who for all her wrath was determined to avoid a real quarrel .<said who="#Margaret">“ I , too , am sorry about them , but it beats me why you 've brought them here , or why you 're here yourself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1936"><said who="#Helen">“ It 's our last chance of seeing<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1937"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>moved towards the house at this . She was determined not to worry<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1938"><said who="#Henry">“ He 's going to Scotland . I know he is . I insist on seeing him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1939"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , to-morrow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1940"><said who="#Henry">“ I knew it was our last chance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1941"><said who="#Margaret">“ How do you do ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, trying to control her voice .<said who="#Margaret">“ This is an odd business . What view do you take of it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1942"><said who="#Helen">“ There is<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>, too , ”</said>prompted<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1943"><persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>also shook hands . She , like her husband , was shy , and , furthermore , ill , and furthermore , so bestially stupid that she could not grasp what was happening . She only knew that the lady had swept down like a whirlwind last night , had paid the rent , redeemed the furniture , provided them with a dinner and a breakfast , and ordered them to meet her at Paddington next morning .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>had feebly protested , and when the morning came , had suggested that they should n't go . But she , half mesmerised , had obeyed . The lady had told them to , and they must , and their bed-sitting-room had accordingly changed into Paddington , and Paddington into a railway carriage , that shook , and grew hot , and grew cold , and vanished entirely , and reappeared amid torrents of expensive scent .<said who="#Margaret">“ You have fainted , ”</said>said the lady in an awe-struck voice .<said who="#Margaret">“ Perhaps the air will do you good . ”</said>And perhaps it had , for here she was , feeling rather better among a lot of flowers .</p>
    <p n="1944"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I 'm sure I do n't want to intrude , ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, in answer to<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s question .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ But you have been so kind to me in the past in warning me about<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>that I wondered — why , I wondered whether — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1945"><said who="#Helen">“ Whether we could get him back into<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>again , ”</said>supplied<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, this has been a cheerful business . A bright evening 's work that was on Chelsea Embankment . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1946"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>shook her head and returned to<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1947"><said who="#Margaret">“ I do n't understand . You left<persName corresp="#the_Porphyrion">the Porphyrion</persName>because we suggested it was a bad concern , did n't you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1948"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ That 's right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1949"><said who="#Margaret">“ And went into a bank instead ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1950"><said who="#Helen">“ I told you all that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>;<said who="#Helen">“ and they reduced their staff after he had been in a month , and now he 's penniless , and I consider that we and our informant are directly to blame . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1951"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I hate all this , ”</said><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>muttered .</p>
    <p n="1952"><said who="#Helen">“ I hope you do ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>. But it 's no good mincing matters . You have done yourself no good by coming here . If you intend to confront<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, and to call him to account for a chance remark , you will make a very great mistake . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1953"><said who="#Helen">“ I brought them . I did it all , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1954"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I can only advise you to go at once . My sister has put you in a false position , and it is kindest to tell you so . It 's too late to get to town , but you 'll find a comfortable hotel in<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>, where<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>can rest , and I hope you 'll be my guests there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1955"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ That is n't what I want ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>.<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ You 're very kind , and no doubt it 's a false position , but you make me miserable . I seem no good at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1956"><said who="#Helen">“ It 's work he wants , ”</said>interpreted<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ Ca n't you see ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1957">Then he said :<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>, let 's go . We 're more bother than we 're worth . We 're costing these ladies pounds and pounds already to get work for us , and they never will . There 's nothing we 're good enough to do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1958"><said who="#Margaret">“ We would like to find you work , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>rather conventionally .<said who="#Margaret">“ We want to — I , like my sister . You 're only down in your luck . Go to the hotel , have a good night 's rest , and some day you shall pay me back the bill , if you prefer it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1959">But<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>was near the abyss , and at such moments men see clearly .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ You do n't know what you 're talking about , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I shall never get work now . If rich people fail at one profession , they can try another . Not I. I had my groove , and I 've got out of it . I could do one particular branch of insurance in one particular office well enough to command a salary , but that 's all . Poetry 's nothing ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>. One 's thoughts about this and that are nothing . Your money , too , is nothing , if you 'll understand me . I mean if a man over twenty once loses his own particular job , it 's all over with him . I have seen it happen to others . Their friends gave them money for a little , but in the end they fall over the edge . It 's no good . It 's the whole world pulling . There always will be rich and poor . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1960">He ceased .<said who="#Margaret">“ Wo n't you have something to eat ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ I do n't know what to do . It is n't my house , and though<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>would have been glad to see you at any other time — as I say , I do n't know what to do , but I undertake to do what I can for you .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, offer them something . Do try a sandwich ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1961">They moved to a long table behind which a servant was still standing . Iced cakes , sandwiches innumerable , coffee , claret-cup , champagne , remained almost intact ; their overfed guests could do no more .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>refused .<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>thought she could manage a little .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>left them whispering together , and had a few more words with<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1962">She said :<said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, I like<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>. I agree that he 's worth helping . I agree that we are directly responsible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1963"><said who="#Helen">“ No , indirectly . Via<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1964"><said who="#Margaret">“ Let me tell you once for all that if you take up that attitude , I 'll do nothing . No doubt you 're right logically , and are entitled to say a great many scathing things about<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>. Only , I wo n't have it . So choose . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1965"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>looked at the sunset .</p>
    <p n="1966"><said who="#Helen">“ If you promise to take them quietly to the George I will speak to<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>about them — in my own way , mind ; there is to be none of this absurd screaming about justice . I have no use for justice . If it was only a question of money , we could do it ourselves . But he wants work , and that we can n't give him , but possibly<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>can . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1967"><said who="#Helen">“ It 's his duty to , ”</said>grumbled<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1968"><said who="#Margaret">“ Nor am I concerned with duty . I 'm concerned with the characters of various people whom we know , and how , things being as they are , things may be made a little better .<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>hates being asked favours ; all business men do . But I am going to ask him , at the risk of a rebuff , because I want to make things a little better . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1969"><said who="#Helen">“ Very well . I promise . You take it very calmly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1970"><said who="#Margaret">“ Take them off to the George , then , and I 'll try . Poor creatures ! but they look tired . ”</said>As they parted , she added :<said who="#Margaret">“ I have n't nearly done with you , though ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. You have been most self-indulgent . I can n't get over it . You have less restraint rather than more as you grow older . Think it over and alter yourself , or we sha n't have happy lives . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1971">She rejoined<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>. Fortunately he had been sitting down : these physical matters were important .<said who="#Helen">“ Was it townees ? ”</said>he asked , greeting her with a pleasant smile .</p>
    <p n="1972"><said who="#Margaret">“ You 'll never believe me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, sitting down beside him .<said who="#Margaret">“ It 's all right now , but it was my sister . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1973"><said who="#Henry">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>here ? ”</said>he cried , preparing to rise .<said who="#Henry">“ But she refused the invitation . I thought hated weddings . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1974"><said who="#Margaret">“ Do n't get up . She has not come to the wedding . I 've bundled her off to the George . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1975">Inherently hospitable , he protested .</p>
    <p n="1976"><said who="#Margaret">“ No ; she has two of her proteges with her and must keep with them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1977"><said who="#Henry">“ Let ‘ em all come . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1978"><said who="#Margaret">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, did you see them ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1979"><said who="#Henry">“ I did catch sight of a brown bunch of a woman , certainly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1980"><said who="#Margaret">“ The brown bunch was<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, but did you catch sight of a sea-green and salmon bunch ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1981"><said who="#Henry">“ What ! are they out bean-feasting ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1982"><said who="#Margaret">“ No ; business . They wanted to see me , and later on I want to talk to you about them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1983">She was ashamed of her own diplomacy . In dealing with a Wilcox , how tempting it was to lapse from comradeship , and to give him the kind of woman that he desired !<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>took the hint at once , and said :<said who="#Henry">“ Why later on ? Tell me now . No time like the present . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1984"><said who="#Margaret">“ Shall I ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1985"><said who="#Henry">“ If it is n't a long story . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1986"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , not five minutes ; but there 's a sting at the end of it , for I want you to find the man some work in your office . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1987"><said who="#Henry">“ What are his qualifications ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1988"><said who="#Margaret">“ I do n't know . He 's a clerk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1989"><said who="#Henry">“ How old ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1990"><said who="#Margaret">“ Twenty-five , perhaps . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1991"><said who="#Henry">“ What 's his name ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1992"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Bast</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, and was about to remind him that they had met at Wickham Place , but stopped herself . It had not been a successful meeting .</p>
    <p n="1993"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Where was he before ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1994"><said who="#Margaret">“ Dempster 's Bank . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1995"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Why did he leave ? ”</said>he asked , still remembering nothing .</p>
    <p n="1996"><said who="#Margaret">“ They reduced their staff . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1997"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ All right ; I 'll see him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1998">It was the reward of her tact and devotion through the day . Now she understood why some women prefer influence to rights . Mrs. Plynlimmon , when condemning suffragettes , had said :<said who="#Margaret">“ The woman who can n't influence her husband to vote the way she wants ought to be ashamed of herself . ”</said><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had winced , but she was influencing<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>now , and though pleased at her little victory , she knew that she had won it by the methods of the harem .</p>
    <p n="1999"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I should be glad if you took him , ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ but I do n't know whether he 's qualified . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2000"><said who="#Henry">“ I 'll do what I can . But ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, this must n't be taken as a precedent . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2001"><said who="#Margaret">“ No , of course — of course — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2002"><said who="#Henry">“ I can n't fit in your proteges every day . Business would suffer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2003"><said who="#Margaret">“ I can promise you he 's the last . He — he 's rather a special case . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2004"><said who="#Henry">“ Proteges always are . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2005">She let it stand at that . He rose with a little extra touch of complacency , and held out his hand to help her up . How wide the gulf between<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>as he was and<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>as<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>thought he ought to be ! And she herself — hovering as usual between the two , now accepting men as they are , now yearning with her sister for Truth .<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>and Truth — their warfare seems eternal perhaps the whole visible world rests on it , and if they were one , life itself , like the spirits when Prospero was reconciled to his brother , might vanish into air , into thin air .</p>
    <p n="2006"><said who="#Love">“ Your protege has made us late , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Love">“ The Fussells — will just be starting . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2007">On the whole she sided with men as they are .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>would save the Basts as he had saved Howards End , while<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and her friends were discussing the ethics of salvation . His was a slap-dash method , but the world has been built slap-dash , and the beauty of mountain and river and sunset may be but the varnish with which the unskilled artificer hides his joins .<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>, like herself , was imperfect . Its apple-trees were stunted , its castle ruinous . It , too , had suffered in the border warfare between the Anglo-Saxon and the Celt , between things as they are and as they ought to be . Once more the west was retreating , once again the orderly stars were dotting the eastern sky . There is certainly no rest for us on the earth . But there is happiness , and as<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>descended the mound on her lover 's arm , she felt that she was having her share .</p>
    <p n="2008">To her annoyance ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>was still in the garden ; the husband and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had left her there to finish her meal while they went to engage rooms .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>found this woman repellent . She had felt , when shaking her hand , an overpowering shame . She remembered the motive of her call at Wickham Place , and smelt again odours from the abyss — odours the more disturbing because they were involuntary . For there was no malice in<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>. There she sat , a piece of cake in one hand , an empty champagne glass in the other , doing no harm to anybody .</p>
    <p n="2009"><said who="#Margaret">“ She 's overtired , ”</said><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>whispered .</p>
    <p n="2010"><said who="#Henry">“ She 's something else , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.<said who="#Henry">“ This wo n't do . I can n't have her in my garden in this state . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2011"><said who="#Margaret">“ Is she — ”</said><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>hesitated to add “ drunk . ” Now that she was going to marry him , he had grown particular . He discountenanced risque conversations now .</p>
    <p n="2012"><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>went up to the woman . She raised her face , which gleamed in the twilight like a puff-ball .</p>
    <p n="2013"><said who="#Henry">“ Madam , you will be more comfortable at the hotel , ”</said>he said sharply .</p>
    <p n="2014"><persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>replied :<said who="#Jacky">“ If it is n't Hen ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2015"><said who="#Margaret">“ Ne crois pas que le mari lui ressemble , ”</said>apologised<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Il est tout a fait different . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2016"><said who="#Jacky">“<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>! ”</said>she repeated , quite distinctly .</p>
    <p n="2017"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>was much annoyed .<said who="#Henry">“ I congratulate you on your proteges , ”</said>he remarked .</p>
    <p n="2018"><said who="#Jacky">“ Hen , do n't go . You do love me , dear , do n't you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2019"><said who="#Margaret">“ Bless us , what a person ! ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, gathering up her skirts .</p>
    <p n="2020"><persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>pointed with her cake .<said who="#Jacky">“ You 're a nice boy , you are . ”</said>She yawned .<said who="#Jacky">“ There now , I love you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2021"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, I am awfully sorry . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2022"><said who="#Henry">“ And pray why ? ”</said>he asked , and looked at her so sternly that she feared he was ill . He seemed more scandalised than the facts demanded .</p>
    <p n="2023"><said who="#Margaret">“ To have brought this down on you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2024"><said who="#Henry">“ Pray do n't apologise . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2025">The voice continued .</p>
    <p n="2026"><said who="#Margaret">“ Why does she call you ‘ Hen ’ ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>innocently .<said who="#Margaret">“ Has she ever seen you before ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2027"><said who="#Jacky">“ Seen Hen before ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>.<said who="#Jacky">“ Who has n't seen Hen ? He 's serving you like me , my boys ! You wait — Still we love ‘ em . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2028"><said who="#Henry">“ Are you now satisfied ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>asked .</p>
    <p n="2029"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>began to grow frightened .<said who="#Jacky">“ I do n't know what it is all about , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Jacky">“ Let 's come in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2030">But he thought she was acting . He thought he was trapped . He saw his whole life crumbling .<said who="#Margaret">“ Do n't you indeed ? ”</said>he said bitingly .<said who="#Margaret">“ I do . Allow me to congratulate you on the success of your plan . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2031"><said who="#Henry">“ This is<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s plan , not mine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2032"><said who="#Henry">“ I now understand your interest in the Basts . Very well thought out . I am amused at your caution ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. You are quite right — it was necessary . I am a man , and have lived a man 's past . I have the honour to release you from your engagement . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2033">Still she could not understand . She knew of life 's seamy side as a theory ; she could not grasp it as a fact . More words from<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>were necessary — words unequivocal , undenied .</p>
    <p n="2034"><said who="#Margaret">“ So that — ”</said>burst from her , and she went indoors . She stopped herself from saying more .</p>
    <p n="2035"><said who="#Henry">“ So what ? ”</said>asked Colonel Fussell , who was getting ready to start in the hall .</p>
    <p n="2036"><said who="#Margaret">“ We were saying —<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>and I were just having the fiercest argument , my point being — ”</said>Seizing his fur coat from a footman , she offered to help him on . He protested , and there was a playful little scene .</p>
    <p n="2037"><said who="#Henry">“ No , let me do that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, following .</p>
    <p n="2038"><said who="#Margaret">“ Thanks so much ! You see — he has forgiven me ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2039">The Colonel said gallantly :<said who="#Henry">“ I do n't expect there 's much to forgive . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2040">He got into the car . The ladies followed him after an interval . Maids , courier , and heavier luggage had been sent on earlier by the branch-line . Still chattering , still thanking their host and patronising their future hostess , the guests were borne away .</p>
    <p n="2041">Then<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>continued :<said who="#Margaret">“ So that woman has been your mistress ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2042"><said who="#Henry">“ You put it with your usual delicacy , ”</said>he replied .</p>
    <p n="2043"><said who="#Margaret">“ When , please ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2044"><said who="#Henry">“ Why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2045"><said who="#Margaret">“ When , please ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2046"><said who="#Henry">“ Ten years ago . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2047">She left him without a word . For it was not her tragedy ; it was<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="27">
    <p n="2048"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>began to wonder why she had spent a matter of eight pounds in making some people ill and others angry . Now that the wave of excitement was ebbing , and had left her ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>stranded for the night in a Shropshire hotel , she asked herself what forces had made the wave flow . At all events , no harm was done .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>would play the game properly now , and though<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>disapproved of her sister 's methods , she knew that the Basts would benefit by them in the long-run .</p>
    <p n="2049"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>is so illogical , ”</said>she explained to<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, who had put his wife to bed , and was sitting with her in the empty coffee-room .<said who="#Helen">“ If we told him it was his duty to take you on , he might refuse to do it . The fact is , he is n't properly educated . I do n't want to set you against him , but you 'll find him a trial . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2050"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I can never thank you sufficiently ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, ”</said>was all that<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>felt equal to .</p>
    <p n="2051"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ I believe in personal responsibility . Do n't you ? And in personal everything . I hate — I suppose I ought n't to say that — but the Wilcoxes are on the wrong tack surely . Or perhaps it is n't their fault . Perhaps the little thing that says ‘ I ’ is missing out of the middle of their heads , and then it 's a waste of time to blame them . There 's a nightmare of a theory that says a special race is being born which will rule the rest of us in the future just because it lacks the little thing that says ‘ I . ’ Had you heard that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2052"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I get no time for reading . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2053"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Had you thought it , then ? That there are two kinds of people — our kind , who live straight from the middle of their heads , and the other kind who can n't , because their heads have no middle ? They can n't say ‘ I . ’ They AREN'T in fact , and so they 're supermen . Pierpont Morgan has never said ‘ I ’ in his life . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2054"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>roused himself . If his benefactress wanted intellectual conversation , she must have it . She was more important than his ruined past .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I never got on to Nietzsche , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ But I always understood that those supermen were rather what you may call egoists . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2055"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh no , that 's wrong , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ No superman ever said ‘ I want , ’ because ‘ I want ’ must lead to the question , ‘ Who am I ? ’ and so to Pity and to Justice . He only says ‘ want . ’ ‘ Want Europe , ’ if he 's Napoleon ; ‘ want wives , ’ if he 's Bluebeard ; ‘ want Botticelli , ’ if he 's Pierpont Morgan . Never the ‘ I ’ ; and if you could pierce through the superman , you 'd find panic and emptiness in the middle . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2056"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>was silent for a moment . Then he said :<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ May I take it ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, that you and I are both the sort that say ‘ I ’ ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2057"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Of course . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2058"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ And your sister , too ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2059"><said who="#Helen">“ Of course , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, a little sharply . She was annoyed with<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, but did not want her discussed .<said who="#Helen">“ All presentable people say ‘ I . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="2060"><said who="#Margaret">“ But<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>— he is not perhaps — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2061"><said who="#Helen">“ I do n't know that it 's any good discussing<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>either . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2062"><said who="#Helen">“ Quite so , quite so , ”</said>he agreed .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>asked herself why she had snubbed him . Once or twice during the day she had encouraged him to criticise , and then had pulled him up short . Was she afraid of him presuming ? If so , it was disgusting of her .</p>
    <p n="2063">But he was thinking the snub quite natural . Everything she did was natural , and incapable of causing offence . While the Miss Schlegels were together he had felt them scarcely human — a sort of admonitory whirligig . But a<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>alone was different . She was in<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s case unmarried , in<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s about to be married , in neither case an echo of her sister . A light had fallen at last into this rich upper world , and he saw that it was full of men and women , some of whom were more friendly to him than others .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had become “ his ”<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, who scolded him and corresponded with him , and had swept down yesterday with grateful vehemence .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, though not unkind , was severe and remote . He would not presume to help her , for instance . He had never liked her , and began to think that his original impression was true , and that her sister did not like her either .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was certainly lonely . She , who gave away so much , was receiving too little .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>was pleased to think that he could spare her vexation by holding his tongue and concealing what he knew about<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>.<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>had announced her discovery when he fetched her from the lawn . After the first shock , he did not mind for himself . By now he had no illusions about his wife , and this was only one new stain on the face of a love that had never been pure . To keep perfection perfect , that should be his ideal , if the future gave him time to have ideals .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>for<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s sake , must not know .</p>
    <p n="2064"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>disconcerted him by turning the conversation to his wife .<said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>— does she ever say ‘ I ’ ? ”</said>she asked , half mischievously , and then ,<said who="#Helen">“ Is she very tired ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2065"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ It 's better she stops in her room , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2066"><said who="#Helen">“ Shall I sit up with her ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2067"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ No , thank you ; she does not need company . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2068"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>, what kind of woman is your wife ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2069"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>blushed up to his eyes .</p>
    <p n="2070"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ You ought to know my ways by now . Does that question offend you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2071"><said who="#Helen">“ No , oh no ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>, no . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2072"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Because I love honesty . Do n't pretend your marriage has been a happy one . You and she can have nothing in common . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2073">He did not deny it , but said shyly :<said who="#Helen">“ I suppose that 's pretty obvious ; but<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>never meant to do anybody any harm . When things went wrong , or I heard things , I used to think it was her fault , but , looking back , it 's more mine . I need n't have married her , but as I have I must stick to her and keep her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2074"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ How long have you been married ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2075"><said who="#Helen">“ Nearly three years . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2076"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ What did your people say ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2077"><said who="#Helen">“ They will not have anything to do with us . They had a sort of family council when they heard I was married , and cut us off altogether . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2078"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>began to pace up and down the room .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ My good boy , what a mess ! ”</said>she said gently .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Who are your people ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2079">He could answer this . His parents , who were dead , had been in trade ; his sisters had married commercial travellers ; his brother was a lay-reader .</p>
    <p n="2080"><said who="#Helen">“ And your grandparents ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2081"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>told her a secret that he had held shameful up to now .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ They were just nothing at all , ”</said>he said “ agricultural labourers and that sort . ”</p>
    <p n="2082"><said who="#Helen">“ So ! From which part ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2083"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Lincolnshire mostly , but my mother 's father — he , oddly enough , came from these parts round here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2084"><said who="#Helen">“ From this very Shropshire . Yes , that is odd . My mother 's people were Lancashire . But why do your brother and your sisters object to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2085"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Oh , I do n't know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2086"><said who="#Helen">“ Excuse me , you do know . I am not a baby . I can bear anything you tell me , and the more you tell the more I shall be able to help . Have they heard anything against her ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2087">He was silent .</p>
    <p n="2088"><said who="#Helen">“ I think I have guessed now , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>very gravely .</p>
    <p n="2089"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I do n't think so ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>; I hope not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2090"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ We must be honest , even over these things . I have guessed . I am frightfully , dreadfully sorry , but it does not make the least difference to me . I shall feel just the same to both of you . I blame , not your wife for these things , but men . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2091"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>left it at that — so long as she did not guess the man . She stood at the window and slowly pulled up the blinds . The hotel looked over a dark square . The mists had begun . When she turned back to him her eyes were shining .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Do n't you worry , ”</said>he pleaded .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I can n't bear that . We shall be all right if I get work . If I could only get work — something regular to do . Then it would n't be so bad again . I do n't trouble after books as I used . I can imagine that with regular work we should settle down again . It stops one thinking . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2092"><said who="#Helen">“ Settle down to what ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2093"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Oh , just settle down . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2094"><said who="#Helen">“ And that 's to be life ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, with a catch in her throat .<said who="#Helen">“ How can you , with all the beautiful things to see and do — with music — with walking at night — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2095"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Walking is well enough when a man 's in work , ”</said>he answered .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Oh , I did talk a lot of nonsense once , but there 's nothing like a bailiff in the house to drive it out of you . When I saw him fingering my Ruskins and Stevensons , I seemed to see life straight and real , and it is n't a pretty sight . My books are back again , thanks to you , but they 'll never be the same to me again , and I sha n't ever again think night in the woods is wonderful . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2096"><said who="#Helen">“ Why not ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, throwing up the window .<said who="#Helen">“ Because I see one must have money . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2097"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Well , you 're wrong . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2098"><said who="#Helen">“ I wish I was wrong , but — the clergyman — he has money of his own , or else he 's paid ; the poet or the musician — just the same ; the tramp — he 's no different . The tramp goes to the workhouse in the end , and is paid for with other people 's money .<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>the real thing 's money , and all the rest is a dream . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2099"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ You 're still wrong . You 've forgotten<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2100"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>could not understand .</p>
    <p n="2101"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ If we lived forever , what you say would be true . But we have to die , we have to leave life presently . Injustice and greed would be the real thing if we lived for ever . As it is , we must hold to other things , because<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>is coming . I love<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>— not morbidly , but because He explains . He shows me the emptiness of Money .<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>and Money are the eternal foes . Not<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>and Life . Never mind what lies behind<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>,<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>, but be sure that the poet and the musician and the tramp will be happier in it than the man who has never learnt to say , ‘ I am I . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="2102"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ I wonder . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2103"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ We are all in a mist — I know , but I can help you this far — men like the Wilcoxes are deeper in the mist than any . Sane , sound Englishmen ! building up empires , levelling all the world into what they call common sense . But mention<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>to them and they 're offended , because<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>'s really Imperial , and He cries out against them for ever . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2104"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ I am as afraid of<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>as any one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2105"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ But not of the idea of<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2106"><said who="#Mr._Bast">“ But what is the difference ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2107"><said who="#Helen">“ Infinite difference , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, more gravely than before .</p>
    <p n="2108"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>looked at her wondering , and had the sense of great things sweeping out of the shrouded night . But he could not receive them , because his heart was still full of little things . As the lost umbrella had spoilt the concert at Queen 's Hall , so the lost situation was obscuring the diviner harmonies now .<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>, Life , and Materialism were fine words , but would<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>take him on as a clerk ? Talk as one would ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>was king of this world , the superman , with his own morality , whose head remained in the clouds .</p>
    <p n="2109"><said who="#Death">“ I must be stupid , ”</said>he said apologetically .</p>
    <p n="2110">While to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>the paradox became clearer and clearer .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>destroys a man : the idea of<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>saves him . ”</said>Behind the coffins and the skeletons that stay the vulgar mind lies something so immense that all that is great in us responds to it . Men of the world may recoil from the charnel-house that they will one day enter , but<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>knows better .<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>is his foe , but his peer , and in their age-long struggle the thews of<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>have been strengthened , and his vision cleared , until there is no one who can stand against him .</p>
    <p n="2111"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ So never give in , ”</said>continued the girl , and restated again and again the vague yet convincing plea that the Invisible lodges against the Visible . Her excitement grew as she tried to cut the rope that fastened<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>to the earth . Woven of bitter experience , it resisted her . Presently the waitress entered and gave her a letter from<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. Another note , addressed to<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, was inside . They read them , listening to the murmurings of the river .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="28">
    <p n="2112">For many hours<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>did nothing ; then she controlled herself , and wrote some letters . She was too bruised to speak to<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>; she could pity him , and even determine to marry him , but as yet all lay too deep in her heart for speech . On the surface the sense of his degradation was too strong . She could not command voice or look , and the gentle words that she forced out through her pen seemed to proceed from some other person .</p>
    <p n="2113"><said who="#Margaret">“ My dearest boy , ”</said>she began ,<said who="#Margaret">“ this is not to part us . It is everything or nothing , and I mean it to be nothing . It happened long before we ever met , and even if it had happened since , I should be writing the same , I hope . I do understand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2114">But she crossed out “ I do understand ” ; it struck a false note .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>could not bear to be understood . She also crossed out ,<said who="#Henry">“ It is everything or nothing . ”</said><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>would resent so strong a grasp of the situation . She must not comment ; comment is unfeminine .</p>
    <p n="2115"><said who="#Margaret">“ I think that 'll about do , ”</said>she thought .</p>
    <p n="2116">Then the sense of his degradation choked her . Was he worth all this bother ? To have yielded to a woman of that sort was everything , yes , it was , and she could not be his wife . She tried to translate his temptation into her own language , and her brain reeled . Men must be different even to want to yield to such a temptation . Her belief in comradeship was stifled , and she saw life as from that glass saloon on the Great Western which sheltered male and female alike from the fresh air . Are the sexes really races , each with its own code of morality , and their mutual love a mere device of<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>to keep things going ? Strip human intercourse of the proprieties , and is it reduced to this ? Her judgment told her no . She knew that out of<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>'s device we have built a magic that will win us immortality . Far more mysterious than the call of sex to sex is the tenderness that we throw into that call ; far wider is the gulf between us and the farmyard than between the farmyard and the garbage that nourishes it . We are evolving , in ways that Science cannot measure , to ends that Theology dares not contemplate .<said who="#Margaret">“ Men did produce one jewel , ”</said>the gods will say , and , saying , will give us immortality .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>knew all this , but for the moment she could not feel it , and transformed the marriage of<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>and Mr.<persName corresp="#Cahill">Cahill</persName>into a carnival of fools , and her own marriage — too miserable to think of that , she tore up the letter , and then wrote another :</p>
    <p>“ DEAR MR. BAST ,</p>
    <p n="2117"><said who="#Margaret">“ I have spoken to<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>about you , as I promised , and am sorry to say that he has no vacancy for you .</said></p>
    <p n="2118"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yours truly ,</said></p>
    <p n="2119"><said who="#Cahill">“ M. J. SCHLEGEL . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2120">She enclosed this in a note to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, over which she took less trouble than she might have done ; but her head was aching , and she could not stop to pick her words :</p>
    <p>“ DEAR HELEN ,</p>
    <p n="2121"><said who="#Cahill">“ Give him this . The Basts are no good .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>found the woman drunk on the lawn . I am having a room got ready for you here , and will you please come round at once on getting this ? The Basts are not at all the type we should trouble about . I may go round to them myself in the morning , and do anything that is fair .</said></p>
    <p n="2122"><said who="#Helen">“ M . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2123">In writing this ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>felt that she was being practical . Something might be arranged for the Basts later on , but they must be silenced for the moment . She hoped to avoid a conversation between the woman and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. She rang the bell for a servant , but no one answered it ;<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>and the Warringtons were gone to bed , and the kitchen was abandoned to Saturnalia . Consequently she went over to the George herself . She did not enter the hotel , for discussion would have been perilous , and , saying that the letter was important , she gave it to the waitress . As she recrossed the square she saw<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>looking out of the window of the coffee-room , and feared she was already too late . Her task was not yet over ; she ought to tell<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>what she had done .</p>
    <p n="2124">This came easily , for she saw him in the hall . The night wind had been rattling the pictures against the wall , and the noise had disturbed him .</p>
    <p n="2125"><said who="#Henry">“ Who 's there ? ”</said>he called , quite the householder .</p>
    <p n="2126"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>walked in and past him .</p>
    <p n="2127"><said who="#Margaret">“ I have asked<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>to sleep , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Margaret">“ She is best here ; so do n't lock the front-door . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2128"><said who="#Henry">“ I thought some one had got in , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2129"><said who="#Margaret">“ At the same time I told the man that we could do nothing for him . I do n't know about later , but now the Basts must clearly go . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2130"><said who="#Henry">“ Did you say that your sister is sleeping here , after all ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2131"><said who="#Margaret">“ Probably . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2132"><said who="#Henry">“ Is she to be shown up to your room ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2133"><said who="#Margaret">“ I have naturally nothing to say to her ; I am going to bed . Will you tell the servants about<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>? Could some one go to carry her bag ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2134">He tapped a little gong , which had been bought to summon the servants .</p>
    <p n="2135"><said who="#Henry">“ You must make more noise than that if you want them to hear . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2136"><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>opened a door , and down the corridor came shouts of laughter .<said who="#Henry">“ Far too much screaming there , ”</said>he said , and strode towards it .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>went upstairs , uncertain whether to be glad that they had met , or sorry . They had behaved as if nothing had happened , and her deepest instincts told her that this was wrong . For his own sake , some explanation was due .</p>
    <p n="2137">And yet — what could an explanation tell her ? A date , a place , a few details , which she could imagine all too clearly . Now that the first shock was over , she saw that there was every reason to premise a<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>.<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>'s inner life had long laid open to her — his intellectual confusion , his obtuseness to personal influence , his strong but furtive passions . Should she refuse him because his outer life corresponded ? Perhaps . Perhaps , if the dishonour had been done to her , but it was done long before her day . She struggled against the feeling . She told herself that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s wrong was her own . But she was not a barren theorist . As she undressed , her anger , her regard for the dead , her desire for a scene , all grew weak .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>must have it as he liked , for she loved him , and some day she would use her love to make him a better man .</p>
    <p n="2138">Pity was at the bottom of her actions all through this crisis . Pity , if one may generalise , is at the bottom of woman . When men like us , it is for our better qualities , and however tender their liking , we dare not be unworthy of it , or they will quietly let us go . But unworthiness stimulates woman . It brings out her deeper nature , for good or for evil .</p>
    <p n="2139">Here was the core of the question .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>must be forgiven , and made better by love ; nothing else mattered .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, that unquiet yet kindly ghost , must be left to her own wrong . To her everything was in proportion now , and she , too , would pity the man who was blundering up and down their lives . Had<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>known of his trespass ? An interesting question , but<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>fell asleep , tethered by affection , and lulled by the murmurs of the river that descended all the night from Wales . She felt herself at one with her future home , colouring it and coloured by it , and awoke to see , for the second time ,<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>Castle conquering the morning mists .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="29">
    <p n="2140">He had finished his breakfast , and was beginning the Times . His sister-in-law was packing .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>knelt by him and took the paper from him , feeling that it was unusually heavy and thick . Then , putting her face where it had been , she looked up in his eyes .</p>
    <p n="2141"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>dear , look at me . No , I wo n't have you shirking . Look at me . There . That 's all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2142"><said who="#Margaret">“ You 're referring to last evening , ”</said>he said huskily .<said who="#Margaret">“ I have released you from your engagement . I could find excuses , but I wo n't . No , I wo n't . A thousand times no . I 'm a bad lot , and must be left at that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2143">Expelled from his old fortress ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>was building a new one . He could no longer appear respectable to her , so he defended himself instead in a lurid past . It was not true repentance .</p>
    <p n="2144"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Leave it where you will , boy . It 's not going to trouble us ; I know what I 'm talking about , and it will make no difference . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2145"><said who="#Margaret">“ No difference ? ”</said>he inquired .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ No difference , when you find that I am not the fellow you thought ? ”</said>He was annoyed with<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>here . He would have preferred her to be prostrated by the blow , or even to rage . Against the tide of his sin flowed the feeling that she was not altogether womanly . Her eyes gazed too straight ; they had read books that are suitable for men only . And though he had dreaded a scene , and though she had determined against one , there was a scene , all the same . It was somehow imperative .</p>
    <p n="2146"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ I am unworthy of you , ”</said>he began .<said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Had I been worthy , I should not have released you from your engagement . I know what I am talking about . I can n't bear to talk of such things . We had better leave it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2147">She kissed his hand . He jerked it from her , and , rising to his feet , went on :<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ You , with your sheltered life , and refined pursuits , and friends , and books , you and your sister , and women like you — I say , how can you guess the temptations that lie round a man ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2148"><said who="#Margaret">“ It is difficult for us , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>;<said who="#Margaret">“ but if we are worth marrying , we do guess . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2149"><said who="#Miss_Schlegel">“ Cut off from decent society and family ties , what do you suppose happens to thousands of young fellows overseas ? Isolated . No one near . I know by bitter experience , and yet you say it makes ‘ no difference . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="2150"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2151">He laughed bitterly .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>went to the sideboard and helped herself to one of the breakfast dishes . Being the last down , she turned out the spirit-lamp that kept them warm . She was tender , but grave . She knew that<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>was not so much confessing his soul as pointing out the gulf between the male soul and the female , and she did not desire to hear him on this point .</p>
    <p n="2152"><said who="#Henry">“ Did<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>come ? ”</said>she asked .</p>
    <p n="2153">He shook his head .</p>
    <p n="2154"><said who="#Henry">“ But that wo n't do at all , at all ! We do n't want her gossiping with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2155"><said who="#Margaret">“ Good God ! no ! ”</said>he exclaimed , suddenly natural . Then he caught himself up .<said who="#Margaret">“ Let them gossip , my game 's up , though I thank you for your unselfishness — little as my thanks are worth . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2156"><said who="#Henry">“ Did n't she send me a message or anything ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2157"><said who="#Margaret">“ I heard of none . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2158"><said who="#Henry">“ Would you ring the bell , please ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2159"><said who="#Margaret">“ What to do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2160"><said who="#Henry">“ Why , to inquire . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2161">He swaggered up to it tragically , and sounded a peal .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>poured herself out some coffee . The butler came , and said that<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>had slept at the George , so far as he had heard . Should he go round to the George ?</p>
    <p n="2162"><said who="#Margaret">“ I 'll go , thank you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, and dismissed him .</p>
    <p n="2163"><said who="#Henry">“ It is no good , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.<said who="#Henry">“ Those things leak out ; you cannot stop a story once it has started . I have known cases of other men — I despised them once , I thought that I 'm different , I shall never be tempted . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>— ”</said>He came and sat down near her , improvising emotion . She could not bear to listen to him .<said who="#Henry">“ We fellows all come to grief once in our time . Will you believe that ? There are moments when the strongest man — ‘ Let him who standeth , take heed lest he fall . ’ That 's true , is n't it ? If you knew all , you would excuse me . I was far from good influences — far even from England . I was very , very lonely , and longed for a woman 's voice . That 's enough . I have told you too much already for you to forgive me now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2164"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , that 's enough , dear . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2165"><said who="#Henry">“ I have ”</said>— he lowered his voice —<said who="#Henry">“ I have been through hell . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2166">Gravely she considered this claim . Had he ? Had he suffered tortures of remorse , or had it been , “ There ! that 's over . Now for respectable life again ” ? The latter , if she read him rightly . A man who has been through hell does not boast of his virility . He is humble and hides it , if , indeed , it still exists . Only in legend does the sinner come forth penitent , but terrible , to conquer pure woman by his resistless power .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>was anxious to be terrible , but had not got it in him . He was a good average Englishman , who had slipped . The really culpable point — his faithlessness to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>— never seemed to strike him . She longed to mention<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2167">And bit by bit the story was told her . It was a very simple story . Ten years ago was the time , a garrison town in Cyprus the place . Now and then he asked her whether she could possibly forgive him , and she answered ,<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I have already forgiven you ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>. ”</said>She chose her words carefully , and so saved him from panic . She played the girl , until he could rebuild his fortress and hide his soul from the world . When the butler came to clear away ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>was in a very different mood — asked the fellow what he was in such a hurry for , complained of the noise last night in the servants ’ hall .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>looked intently at the butler . He , as a handsome young man , was faintly attractive to her as a woman — an attraction so faint as scarcely to be perceptible , yet the skies would have fallen if she had mentioned it to<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2168">On her return from the George the building operations were complete , and the old<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>fronted her , competent , cynical , and kind . He had made a clean breast , had been forgiven , and the great thing now was to forget his failure , and to send it the way of other unsuccessful investments .<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>rejoined Howards End and Dude Street , and the vermilion motor-car , and the Argentine Hard Dollars , and all the things and people for whom he had never had much use and had less now . Their memory hampered him . He could scarcely attend to<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who brought back disquieting news from the George .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and her clients had gone .</p>
    <p n="2169"><said who="#Helen">“ Well , let them go — the man and his wife , I mean , for the more we see of your sister the better . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2170"><said who="#Jacky">“ But they have gone separately —<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>very early , the Basts just before I arrived . They have left no message . They have answered neither of my notes . I do n't like to think what it all means . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2171"><said who="#Helen">“ What did you say in the notes ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2172"><said who="#Jacky">“ I told you last night . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2173"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh — ah — yes ! Dear , would you like one turn in the garden ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2174"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>took his arm . The beautiful weather soothed her . But the wheels of<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s wedding were still at work , tossing the guests outwards as deftly as they had drawn them in , and she could not be with him long . It had been arranged that they should motor to Shrewsbury , whence he would go north , and she back to London with the Warringtons . For a fraction of time she was happy . Then her brain recommenced .</p>
    <p n="2175"><said who="#Evie">“ I am afraid there has been gossiping of some kind at the George .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>would not have left unless she had heard something . I mismanaged that . It is wretched . I ought to have parted her from that woman at once . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2176"><said who="#Evie">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>! ”</said>he exclaimed , loosing her arm impressively .</p>
    <p n="2177"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes — yes ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2178"><said who="#Henry">“ I am far from a saint — in fact , the reverse — but you have taken me , for better or worse . Bygones must be bygones . You have promised to forgive me .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, a promise is a promise . Never mention that woman again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2179"><said who="#Margaret">“ Except for some practical reason — never . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2180"><said who="#Henry">“ Practical ! You practical ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2181"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , I 'm practical , ”</said>she murmured , stooping over the mowing-machine and playing with the grass which trickled through her fingers like sand .</p>
    <p n="2182">He had silenced her , but her fears made him uneasy . Not for the first time , he was threatened with blackmail . He was rich and supposed to be moral ; the Basts knew that he was not , and might find it profitable to hint as much .</p>
    <p n="2183"><said who="#Evie">“ At all events , you must n't worry , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Evie">“ This is a man 's business . ”</said>He thought intently .<said who="#Evie">“ On no account mention it to anybody . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2184"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>flushed at advice so elementary , but he was really paving the way for a lie . If necessary he would deny that he had ever known<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>, and prosecute her for libel . Perhaps he never had known her . Here was<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who behaved as if he had not . There the house . Round them were half a dozen gardeners , clearing up after his daughter 's wedding . All was so solid and spruce , that the past flew up out of sight like a spring-blind , leaving only the last five minutes unrolled .</p>
    <p n="2185">Glancing at these , he saw that the car would be round during the next five , and plunged into action . Gongs were tapped , orders issued ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was sent to dress , and the housemaid to sweep up the long trickle of grass that she had left across the hall . As is Man to the Universe , so was the mind of<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>to the minds of some men — a concentrated light upon a tiny spot , a little Ten Minutes moving self-contained through its appointed years . No Pagan he , who lives for the Now , and may be wiser than all philosophers . He lived for the five minutes that have past , and the five to come ; he had the business mind .</p>
    <p n="2186">How did he stand now , as his motor slipped out of<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>and breasted the great round hills ?<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had heard a certain rumour , but was all right . She had forgiven him , God bless her , and he felt the manlier for it .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>had not heard it , and never must hear . No more must<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>. Over his children he felt great tenderness , which he did not try to track to a cause ;<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>was too far back in his life . He did not connect her with the sudden aching love that he felt for<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>. Poor little<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>! he trusted that<persName corresp="#Cahill">Cahill</persName>would make her a decent husband .</p>
    <p n="2187">And<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>? How did she stand ?</p>
    <p n="2188">She had several minor worries . Clearly her sister had heard something . She dreaded meeting her in town . And she was anxious about<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, for whom they certainly were responsible . Nor ought<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>to starve . But the main situation had not altered . She still loved<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>. His actions , not his disposition , had disappointed her , and she could bear that . And she loved her future home . Standing up in the car , just where she had leapt from it two days before , she gazed back with deep emotion upon<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>. Besides the Grange and the Castle keep , she could now pick out the church and the black-and-white gables of the George . There was the bridge , and the river nibbling its green peninsula . She could even see the bathing-shed , but while she was looking for<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s new spring-board , the forehead of the hill rose and hid the whole scene .</p>
    <p n="2189">She never saw it again . Day and night the river flows down into England , day after day the sun retreats into the Welsh mountains , and the tower chimes , See the Conquering Hero . But the Wilcoxes have no part in the place , nor in any place . It is not their names that recur in the parish register . It is not their ghosts that sigh among the alders at evening . They have swept into the valley and swept out of it , leaving a little dust and a little money behind .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="30">
    <p n="2190"><persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was now approaching his last year at Oxford . He had moved out of college , and was contemplating the Universe , or such portions of it as concerned him , from his comfortable lodgings in Long Wall . He was not concerned with much . When a young man is untroubled by passions and sincerely indifferent to public opinion his outlook is necessarily limited .<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>wished neither to strengthen the position of the rich nor to improve that of the poor , and so was well content to watch the elms nodding behind the mildly embattled parapets of Magdalen . There are worse lives . Though selfish , he was never cruel ; though affected in manner , he never posed . Like<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, he disdained the heroic equipment , and it was only after many visits that men discovered<persName corresp="#Schlegel">Schlegel</persName>to possess a character and a brain . He had done well in Mods , much to the surprise of those who attended lectures and took proper exercise , and was now glancing disdainfully at Chinese in case he should some day consent to qualify as a Student Interpreter . To him thus employed<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>entered . A telegram had preceded her .</p>
    <p n="2191">He noticed , in a distant way , that his sister had altered .</p>
    <p n="2192">As a rule he found her too pronounced , and had never come across this look of appeal , pathetic yet dignified — the look of a sailor who has lost everything at sea .</p>
    <p n="2193"><said who="#Helen">“ I have come from<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>, ”</said>she began .<said who="#Helen">“ There has been a great deal of trouble there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2194"><said who="#Tibby">“ Who 's for lunch ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, picking up the claret , which was warming in the hearth .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>sat down submissively at the table .<said who="#Tibby">“ Why such an early start ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="2195"><said who="#Helen">“ Sunrise or something — when I could get away . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2196"><said who="#Tibby">“ So I surmise . Why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2197"><said who="#Helen">“ I do n't know what 's to be done ,<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>. I am very much upset at a piece of news that concerns<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, and do not want to face her , and I am not going back to Wickham Place . I stopped here to tell you this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2198">The landlady came in with the cutlets .<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>put a marker in the leaves of his Chinese Grammar and helped them . Oxford — the Oxford of the vacation — dreamed and rustled outside , and indoors the little fire was coated with grey where the sunshine touched it .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>continued her odd story .</p>
    <p n="2199"><said who="#Helen">“ Give<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>my love and say that I want to be alone . I mean to go to Munich or else Bonn . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2200"><said who="#Tibby">“ Such a message is easily given , ”</said>said her brother .</p>
    <p n="2201"><said who="#Helen">“ As regards Wickham Place and my share of the furniture , you and she are to do exactly as you like . My own feeling is that everything may just as well be sold . What does one want with dusty economic books , which have made the world no better , or with mother 's hideous chiffoniers ? I have also another commission for you . I want you to deliver a letter . ”</said>She got up .<said who="#Helen">“ I have n't written it yet . Why should n't I post it , though ? ”</said>She sat down again .<said who="#Helen">“ My head is rather wretched . I hope that none of your friends are likely to come in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2202"><persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>locked the door . His friends often found it in this condition . Then he asked whether anything had gone wrong at<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s wedding .</p>
    <p n="2203"><said who="#Helen">“ Not there , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, and burst into tears .</p>
    <p n="2204">He had known her hysterical — it was one of her aspects with which he had no concern — and yet these tears touched him as something unusual . They were nearer the things that did concern him , such as music . He laid down his knife and looked at her curiously . Then , as she continued to sob , he went on with his lunch .</p>
    <p n="2205">The time came for the second course , and she was still crying . Apple Charlotte was to follow , which spoils by waiting .<said who="#Helen">“ Do you mind Mrs. Martlett coming in ? ”</said>he asked ,<said who="#Helen">“ or shall I take it from her at the door ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2206"><said who="#Helen">“ Could I bathe my eyes ,<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2207">He took her to his bedroom , and introduced the pudding in her absence . Having helped himself , he put it down to warm in the hearth . His hand stretched towards the Grammar , and soon he was turning over the pages , raising his eyebrows scornfully , perhaps at human nature , perhaps at Chinese . To him thus employed<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>returned . She had pulled herself together , but the grave appeal had not vanished from her eyes .</p>
    <p n="2208"><said who="#Helen">“ Now for the explanation , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Helen">“ Why did n't I begin with it ? I have found out something about<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. He has behaved very wrongly indeed , and ruined two people 's lives . It all came on me very suddenly last night ; I am very much upset , and I do not know what to do .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="2209"><said who="#Mrs._Bast">“ Oh , those people ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2210"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>seemed silenced .</p>
    <p n="2211"><said who="#Helen">“ Shall I lock the door again ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2212"><said who="#Tibby">“ No thanks , Tibbikins . You 're being very good to me . I want to tell you the story before I go abroad , you must do exactly what you like — treat it as part of the furniture .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>cannot have heard it yet , I think . But I cannot face her and tell her that the man she is going to marry has misconducted himself . I do n't even know whether she ought to be told . Knowing as she does that I dislike him , she will suspect me , and think that I want to ruin her match . I simply do n't know what to make of such a thing . I trust your judgment . What would you do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2213"><said who="#Tibby">“ I gather he has had a mistress , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2214"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>flushed with shame and anger .<said who="#Helen">“ And ruined two people 's lives . And goes about saying that personal actions count for nothing , and there always will be rich and poor . He met her when he was trying to get rich out in Cyprus — I do n't wish to make him worse than he is , and no doubt she was ready enough to meet him . But there it is . They met . He goes his way and she goes hers . What do you suppose is the end of such women ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2215">He conceded that it was a bad business .</p>
    <p n="2216"><said who="#Helen">“ They end in two ways : Either they sink till the lunatic asylums and the workhouses are full of them , and cause<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>to write letters to the papers complaining of our national degeneracy , or else they entrap a boy into marriage before it is too late . She — I can n't blame her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2217"><said who="#Helen">“ But this is n't all , ”</said>she continued after a long pause , during which the landlady served them with coffee .<said who="#Helen">“ I come now to the business that took us to<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>. We went all three . Acting on<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>'s advice , the man throws up a secure situation and takes an insecure one , from which he is dismissed . There are certain excuses , but in the main<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>is to blame , as<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>herself admitted . It is only common justice that he should employ the man himself . But he meets the woman , and , like the cur that he is , he refuses , and tries to get rid of them . He makes<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>write . Two notes came from her late that evening — one for me , one for<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, dismissing him with barely a reason . I could n't understand . Then it comes out that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>had spoken to<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>on the lawn while we left her to get rooms , and was still speaking about him when<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>came back to her . This<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>knew all along . He thought it natural he should be ruined twice . Natural ! Could you have contained yourself ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2218"><said who="#Tibby">“ It is certainly a very bad business , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2219">His reply seemed to calm his sister .<said who="#Helen">“ I was afraid that I saw it out of proportion . But you are right outside it , and you must know . In a day or two — or perhaps a week — take whatever steps you think fit . I leave it in your hands . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2220">She concluded her charge .</p>
    <p n="2221"><said who="#Tibby">“ The facts as they touch<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>are all before you , ”</said>she added ; and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>sighed and felt it rather hard that , because of his open mind , he should be empanelled to serve as a juror . He had never been interested in human beings , for which one must blame him , but he had had rather too much of them at Wickham Place . Just as some people cease to attend when books are mentioned , so<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>'s attention wandered when “ personal relations ” came under discussion . Ought<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>to know what<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>knew the Basts to know ? Similar questions had vexed him from infancy , and at Oxford he had learned to say that the importance of human beings has been vastly overrated by specialists . The epigram , with its faint whiff of the eighties , meant nothing . But he might have let it off now if his sister had not been ceaselessly beautiful .</p>
    <p n="2222"><said who="#Margaret">“ You see ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>— have a cigarette — I do n't see what I 'm to do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2223"><said who="#Helen">“ Then there 's nothing to be done . I dare say you are right . Let them marry . There remains the question of compensation . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2224"><said who="#Margaret">“ Do you want me to adjudicate that too ? Had you not better consult an expert ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2225"><said who="#Helen">“ This part is in confidence , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ It has nothing to do with<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, and do not mention it to her . The compensation — I do not see who is to pay it if I do n't , and I have already decided on the minimum sum . As soon as possible I am placing it to your account , and when I am in Germany you will pay it over for me . I shall never forget your kindness , Tibbikins , if you do this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2226"><said who="#Margaret">“ What is the sum ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2227"><said who="#Helen">“ Five thousand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2228"><said who="#Tibby">“ Good God alive ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, and went crimson .</p>
    <p n="2229"><said who="#Helen">“ Now , what is the good of driblets ? To go through life having done one thing — to have raised one person from the abyss ; not these puny gifts of shillings and blankets — making the grey more grey . No doubt people will think me extraordinary . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2230"><said who="#Tibby">“ I do n't care an iota what people think ! ”</said>cried he , heated to unusual manliness of diction .<said who="#Tibby">“ But it 's half what you have . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2231"><said who="#Helen">“ Not nearly half . ”</said>She spread out her hands over her soiled skirt .<said who="#Helen">“ I have far too much , and we settled at Chelsea last spring that three hundred a year is necessary to set a man on his feet . What I give will bring in a hundred and fifty between two . It is n't enough . ”</said>He could not recover . He was not angry or even shocked , and he saw that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>would still have plenty to live on . But it amazed him to think what haycocks people can make of their lives . His delicate intonations would not work , and he could only blurt out that the five thousand pounds would mean a great deal of bother for him personally .</p>
    <p n="2232"><said who="#Tibby">“ I did n't expect you to understand me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2233"><said who="#Helen">“ I ? I understand nobody . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2234"><said who="#Tibby">“ But you 'll do it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2235"><said who="#Helen">“ Apparently . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2236"><said who="#Tibby">“ I leave you two commissions , then . The first concerns<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, and you are to use your discretion . The second concerns the money , and is to be mentioned to no one , and carried out literally . You will send a hundred pounds on account to-morrow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2237">He walked with her to the station , passing through those streets whose serried beauty never bewildered him and never fatigued . The lovely creature raised domes and spires into the cloudless blue , and only the ganglion of vulgarity round Carfax showed how evanescent was the phantom , how faint its claim to represent England .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, rehearsing her commission , noticed nothing ; the Basts were in her brain , and she retold the crisis in a meditative way , which might have made other men curious . She was seeing whether it would hold . He asked her once why she had taken the Basts right into the heart of<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s wedding . She stopped like a frightened animal and said ,<said who="#Helen">“ Does that seem to you so odd ? ”</said>Her eyes , the hand laid on the mouth , quite haunted him , until they were absorbed into the figure of St. Mary the Virgin , before whom he paused for a moment on the walk home .</p>
    <p n="2238">It is convenient to follow him in the discharge of his duties .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>summoned him the next day . She was terrified at<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s flight , and he had to say that she had called in at Oxford . Then she said :<said who="#Tibby">“ Did she seem worried at any rumour about<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>? ”</said>He answered ,<said who="#Tibby">“ Yes . ”</said><said who="#Tibby">“ I knew it was that ! ”</said>she exclaimed .<said who="#Tibby">“ I 'll write to her . ”</said><persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was relieved .</p>
    <p n="2239">He then sent the cheque to the address that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>gave him , and stated that he was instructed to forward later on five thousand pounds . An answer came back very civil and quiet in tone — such an answer as<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>himself would have given . The cheque was returned , the legacy refused , the writer being in no need of money .<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>forwarded this to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, adding in the fulness of his heart that<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard Bast</persName>seemed somewhat a monumental person after all .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s reply was frantic . He was to take no notice . He was to go down at once and say that she commanded acceptance . He went . A scurf of books and china ornaments awaited him . The Basts had just been evicted for not paying their rent , and had wandered no one knew whither .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had begun bungling with her money by this time , and had even sold out her shares in the Nottingham and Derby Railway . For some weeks she did nothing . Then she reinvested , and , owing to the good advice of her stockbrokers , became rather richer than she had been before .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="31">
    <p n="2240">Houses have their own ways of dying , falling as variously as the generations of men , some with a tragic roar , some quietly , but to an after-life in the city of ghosts , while from others — and thus was the death of Wickham Place — the spirit slips before the body perishes . It had decayed in the spring , disintegrating the girls more than they knew , and causing either to accost unfamiliar regions . By September it was a corpse , void of emotion , and scarcely hallowed by the memories of thirty years of happiness . Through its round-topped doorway passed furniture , and pictures , and books , until the last room was gutted and the last van had rumbled away . It stood for a week or two longer , open-eyed , as if astonished at its own emptiness . Then it fell . Navvies came , and spilt it back into the grey . With their muscles and their beery good temper , they were not the worst of undertakers for a house which had always been human , and had not mistaken culture for an end .</p>
    <p n="2241">The furniture , with a few exceptions , went down into Hertfordshire ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>having most kindly offered Howards End as a warehouse . Mr.<persName corresp="#Bryce">Bryce</persName>had died abroad — an unsatisfactory affair — and as there seemed little guarantee that the rent would be paid regularly , he cancelled the agreement , and resumed possession himself . Until he relet the house , the Schlegels were welcome to stack their furniture in the garage and lower rooms .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>demurred , but<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>accepted the offer gladly ; it saved him from coming to any decision about the future . The plate and the more valuable pictures found a safer home in London , but the bulk of the things went country-ways , and were entrusted to the guardianship of<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2242">Shortly before the move , our hero and heroine were married . They have weathered the storm , and may reasonably expect peace . To have no illusions and yet to love — what stronger surety can a woman find ? She had seen her husband 's past as well as his heart . She knew her own heart with a thoroughness that commonplace people believe impossible . The heart of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>was alone hidden , and perhaps it is superstitious to speculate on the feelings of the dead . They were warned quietly — really quietly , for as the day approached she refused to go through another<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>. Her brother gave her away , her aunt , who was out of health , presided over a few colourless refreshments . The Wilcoxes were represented by<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, who witnessed the marriage settlement , and by Mr.<persName corresp="#Cahill">Cahill</persName>.<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>did send a cablegram . In a few minutes , and without the aid of music , the clergyman made them man and wife , and soon the glass shade had fallen that cuts off married couples from the world . She , a monogamist , regretted the cessation of some of life 's innocent odours ; he , whose instincts were polygamous , felt morally braced by the change and less liable to the temptations that had assailed him in the past .</p>
    <p n="2243">They spent their honeymoon near Innsbruck .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>knew of a reliable hotel there , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>hoped for a meeting with her sister . In this she was disappointed . As they came south ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>retreated over the Brenner , and wrote an unsatisfactory post-card from the shores of the Lake of Garda , saying that her plans were uncertain and had better be ignored . Evidently she disliked meeting<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>. Two months are surely enough to accustom an outsider to a situation which a wife has accepted in two days , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had again to regret her sister 's lack of self-control . In a long letter she pointed out the need of charity in sexual matters ; so little is known about them ; it is hard enough for those who are personally touched to judge ; then how futile must be the verdict of<persName>Society</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ I do n't say there is no standard , for that would destroy morality ; only that there can be no standard until our impulses are classified and better understood . ”</said><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>thanked her for her kind letter — rather a curious reply . She moved south again , and spoke of wintering in Naples .</p>
    <p n="2244"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>was not sorry that the meeting failed .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>left him time to grow skin over his wound . There were still moments when it pained him . Had he only known that<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was awaiting him —<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, so lively and intelligent , and yet so submissive — he would have kept himself worthier of her . Incapable of grouping the past , he confused the episode of<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>with another episode that had taken place in the days of his bachelorhood . The two made one crop of wild oats , for which he was heartily sorry , and he could not see that those oats are of a darker stock which are rooted in another 's dishonour . Unchastity and infidelity were as confused to him as to the Middle Ages , his only moral teacher .<persName corresp="#Ruth">Ruth</persName>( poor old<persName corresp="#Ruth">Ruth</persName>! ) did not enter into his calculations at all , for poor old<persName corresp="#Ruth">Ruth</persName>had never found him out .</p>
    <p n="2245">His affection for his present wife grew steadily . Her cleverness gave him no trouble , and , indeed , he liked to see her reading poetry or something about social questions ; it distinguished her from the wives of other men . He had only to call , and she clapped the book up and was ready to do what he wished . Then they would argue so jollily , and once or twice she had him in quite a tight corner , but as soon as he grew really serious , she gave in . Man is for war , woman for the recreation of the warrior , but he does not dislike it if she makes a show of fight . She cannot win in a real battle , having no muscles , only nerves . Nerves make her jump out of a moving motor-car , or refuse to be married fashionably . The warrior may well allow her to triumph on such occasions ; they move not the imperishable plinth of things that touch his peace .</p>
    <p n="2246"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had a bad attack of these nerves during the honeymoon . He told her — casually , as was his habit — that<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>Grange was let . She showed her annoyance , and asked rather crossly why she had not been consulted .</p>
    <p n="2247"><said who="#Oniton">“ I did n't want to bother you , ”</said>he replied .<said who="#Oniton">“ Besides , I have only heard for certain this morning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2248"><said who="#Margaret">“ Where are we to live ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, trying to laugh .<said who="#Margaret">“ I loved the place extraordinarily . Do n't you believe in having a permanent home ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2249">He assured her that she misunderstood him . It is home life that distinguishes us from the foreigner . But he did not believe in a damp home .</p>
    <p n="2250"><said who="#Margaret">“ This is news . I never heard till this minute that<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>was damp . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2251"><said who="#Oniton">“ My dear girl ! ”</said>— he flung out his hand —<said who="#Oniton">“ have you eyes ? have you a skin ? How could it be anything but damp in such a situation ? In the first place , the Grange is on clay , and built where the castle moat must have been ; then there 's that detestable little river , steaming all night like a kettle . Feel the cellar walls ; look up under the eaves . Ask Sir James or any one . Those Shropshire valleys are notorious . The only possible place for a house in Shropshire is on a hill ; but , for my part , I think the country is too far from London , and the scenery nothing special . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2252"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>could not resist saying ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Why did you go there , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2253"><said who="#Oniton">“ I — because — ”</said>He drew his head back and grew rather angry .<said who="#Oniton">“ Why have we come to the Tyrol , if it comes to that ? One might go on asking such questions indefinitely . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2254">One might ; but he was only gaining time for a plausible answer . Out it came , and he believed it as soon as it was spoken .</p>
    <p n="2255"><said who="#Margaret">“ The truth is , I took<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>on account of<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>. Do n't let this go any further . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2256"><said who="#Oniton">“ Certainly not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2257"><said who="#Margaret">“ I should n't like her to know that she nearly let me in for a very bad bargain . No sooner did I sign the agreement than she got engaged . Poor little girl ! She was so keen on it all , and would n't even wait to make proper inquiries about the shooting . Afraid it would get snapped up — just like all of your sex . Well , no harm 's done . She has had her country wedding , and I 've got rid of my goose to some fellows who are starting a preparatory school . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2258"><said who="#Oniton">“ Where shall we live , then ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>? I should enjoy living somewhere . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2259"><said who="#Henry">“ I have not yet decided . What about Norfolk ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2260"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was silent . Marriage had not saved her from the sense of flux . London was but a foretaste of this nomadic civilisation which is altering human nature so profoundly , and throws upon personal relations a stress greater than they have ever borne before . Under cosmopolitanism , if it comes , we shall receive no help from the earth . Trees and meadows and mountains will only be a spectacle , and the binding force that they once exercised on character must be entrusted to<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>alone . May<persName corresp="#Love">Love</persName>be equal to the task !</p>
    <p n="2261"><said who="#Henry">“ It is now what ? ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.<said who="#Henry">“ Nearly October . Let us camp for the winter at Ducie Street , and look out for something in the spring . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2262"><said who="#Love">“ If possible , something permanent . I can n't be as young as I was , for these alterations do n't suit me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2263"><said who="#Henry">“ But , my dear , which would you rather have — alterations or rheumatism ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2264"><said who="#Margaret">“ I see your point , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, getting up .<said who="#Margaret">“ If<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>is really damp , it is impossible , and must be inhabited by little boys . Only , in the spring , let us look before we leap . I will take warning by<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>, and not hurry you . Remember that you have a free hand this time . These endless moves must be bad for the furniture , and are certainly expensive . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2265"><said who="#Henry">“ What a practical little woman it is ! What 's it been reading ? Theo — theo — how much ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2266"><said who="#Margaret">“ Theosophy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2267">So Ducie Street was her first fate — a pleasant enough fate . The house , being only a little larger than Wickham Place , trained her for the immense establishment that was promised in the spring . They were frequently away , but at home life ran fairly regularly . In the morning<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>went to business , and his sandwich — a relic this of some prehistoric craving — was always cut by her own hand . He did not rely upon the sandwich for lunch , but liked to have it by him in case he grew hungry at eleven . When he had gone , there was the house to look after , and the servants to humanise , and several kettles of<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s to keep on the boil . Her conscience pricked her a little about the Basts ; she was not sorry to have lost sight of them . No doubt<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>was worth helping , but being<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>'s wife , she preferred to help some one else . As for theatres and discussion societies , they attracted her less and less . She began to “ miss ” new movements , and to spend her spare time re-reading or thinking , rather to the concern of her Chelsea friends . They attributed the change to her marriage , and perhaps some deep instinct did warn her not to travel further from her husband than was inevitable . Yet the main cause lay deeper still ; she had outgrown stimulants , and was passing from words to things . It was doubtless a pity not to keep up with Wedekind or John , but some closing of the gates is inevitable after thirty , if the mind itself is to become a creative power .</p>

    <p n="2268">She was looking at plans one day in the following spring — they had finally decided to go down into Sussex and build — when Mrs.<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles Wilcox</persName>was announced .</p>
    <p n="2269"><said who="#Dolly">“ Have you heard the news ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>cried , as soon as she entered the room .<said who="#Dolly">“<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>is so ang — I mean he is sure you know about it , or , rather , that you do n't know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2270"><said who="#Margaret">“ Why ,<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, placidly kissing her .<said who="#Margaret">“ Here 's a surprise ! How are the boys and the baby ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2271">Boys and the baby were well , and in describing a great row that there had been at the Hilton Tennis Club ,<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>forgot her news . The wrong people had tried to get in . The rector , as representing the older inhabitants , had said —<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>had said — the tax-collector had said —<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>had regretted not saying — and she closed the description with ,<said who="#Dolly">“ But lucky you , with four courts of your own at Midhurst . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2272"><said who="#Margaret">“ It will be very jolly , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2273"><said who="#Dolly">“ Are those the plans ? Does it matter my seeing them ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2274"><said who="#Margaret">“ Of course not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2275"><said who="#Dolly">“<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>has never seen the plans . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2276"><said who="#Margaret">“ They have only just arrived . Here is the ground floor — no , that 's rather difficult . Try the elevation , We are to have a good many gables and a picturesque sky-line . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2277"><said who="#Dolly">“ What makes it smell so funny ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, after a moment 's inspection . She was incapable of understanding plans or maps .</p>
    <p n="2278"><said who="#Margaret">“ I suppose the paper . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2279"><said who="#Dolly">“ And WHICH way up is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2280"><said who="#Margaret">“ Just the ordinary way up . That 's the sky-line and the part that smells strongest is the sky . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2281"><said who="#Dolly">“ Well , ask me another .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>— oh — what was I going to say ? How 's<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2282"><said who="#Margaret">“ Quite well . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2283"><said who="#Dolly">“ Is she never coming back to England ? Every one thinks it 's awfully odd she does n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2284"><said who="#Margaret">“ So it is , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, trying to conceal her vexation . She was getting rather sore on this point .<said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>is odd , awfully . She has now been away eight months . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2285"><said who="#Dolly">“ But has n't she any address ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2286"><said who="#Margaret">“ A poste restante somewhere in Bavaria is her address . Do write her a line . I will look it up for you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2287"><said who="#Dolly">“ No , do n't bother . That 's eight months she has been away , surely ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2288"><said who="#Margaret">“ Exactly . She left just after<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s wedding . It would be eight months . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2289"><said who="#Dolly">“ Just when baby was born , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2290"><said who="#Margaret">“ Just so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2291"><persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>sighed , and stared enviously round the drawing-room . She was beginning to lose her brightness and good looks . The<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s were not well off , for<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, having brought up his children with expensive tastes , believed in letting them shift for themselves . After all , he had not treated them generously . Yet another baby was expected , she told<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, and they would have to give up the motor .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>sympathised , but in a formal fashion , and<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>little imagined that the stepmother was urging<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>to make them a more liberal allowance . She sighed again , and at last the particular grievance was remembered .<said who="#Dolly">“ Oh , yes , ”</said>she cried ,<said who="#Dolly">“ that is it :<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>has been unpacking your packing-cases . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2292"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Why has she done that ? How unnecessary ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2293"><said who="#Dolly">“ Ask another . I suppose you ordered her to . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2294"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I gave no such orders . Perhaps she was airing the things . She did undertake to light an occasional fire . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2295"><said who="#Dolly">“ It was far more than an air , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>solemnly .<said who="#Dolly">“ The floor sounds covered with books .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>sent me to know what is to be done , for he feels certain you do n't know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2296"><said who="#Margaret">“ Books ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, moved by the holy word .<said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, are you serious ? Has she been touching our books ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2297"><said who="#Dolly">“ Has n't she , though ! What used to be the hall 's full of them .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>thought for certain you knew of it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2298"><said who="#Margaret">“ I am very much obliged to you ,<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>. What can have come over<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>? I must go down about it at once . Some of the books are my brother 's , and are quite valuable . She had no right to open any of the cases . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2299"><said who="#Dolly">“ I say she 's dotty . She was the one that never got married , you know . Oh , I say , perhaps , she thinks your books are wedding-presents to herself . Old maids are taken that way sometimes .<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>hates us all like poison ever since her frightful dust-up with<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2300"><said who="#Margaret">“ I had n't heard of that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. A visit from<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>had its compensations .</p>
    <p n="2301"><said who="#Dolly">“ Did n't you know she gave<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>a present last August , and<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>returned it , and then — oh , goloshes ! You never read such a letter as<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>wrote . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2302"><said who="#Margaret">“ But it was wrong of<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>to return it . It was n't like her to do such a heartless thing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2303"><said who="#Dolly">“ But the present was so expensive . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2304"><said who="#Margaret">“ Why does that make any difference ,<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2305"><said who="#Dolly">“ Still , when it costs over five pounds — I did n't see it , but it was a lovely enamel pendant from a Bond Street shop . You can n't very well accept that kind of thing from a farm woman . Now , can you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2306"><said who="#Margaret">“ You accepted a present from<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>when you were married . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2307"><said who="#Dolly">“ Oh , mine was old earthenware stuff — not worth a halfpenny .<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s was quite different . You 'd have to ask any one to the wedding who gave you a pendant like that . Uncle Percy and Albert and father and<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>all said it was quite impossible , and when four men agree , what is a girl to do ?<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>did n't want to upset the old thing , so thought a sort of joking letter best , and returned the pendant straight to the shop to save<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>trouble . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2308"><said who="#Margaret">“ But<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>said — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2309"><persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s eyes grew round .<said who="#Dolly">“ It was a perfectly awful letter .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>said it was the letter of a madman . In the end she had the pendant back again from the shop and threw it into the duck-pond . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2310"><said who="#Margaret">“ Did she give any reasons ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2311"><said who="#Dolly">“ We think she meant to be invited to<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>, and so climb into society . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2312"><said who="#Margaret">“ She 's rather old for that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>pensively .</p>
    <p n="2313"><said who="#Dolly">“ May she not have given the present to<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>in remembrance of her mother ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2314"><said who="#Dolly">“ That 's a notion . Give every one their due , eh ? Well , I suppose I ought to be toddling . Come along , Mr. Muff — you want a new coat , but I do n't know who 'll give it you , I 'm sure ; ”</said>and addressing her apparel with mournful humour ,<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>moved from the room .</p>
    <p n="2315"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>followed her to ask whether<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>knew about<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>'s rudeness .</p>
    <p n="2316"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Oh yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2317"><said who="#Henry">“ I wonder , then , why he let me ask her to look after the house . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2318"><said who="#Dolly">“ But she 's only a farm woman , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, and her explanation proved correct .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>only censured the lower classes when it suited him . He bore with<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>as with<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>— because he could get good value out of them .<said who="#Dolly">“ I have patience with a man who knows his job , ”</said>he would say , really having patience with the job , and not the man . Paradoxical as it may sound , he had something of the artist about him ; he would pass over an insult to his daughter sooner than lose a good charwoman for his wife .</p>
    <p n="2319"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>judged it better to settle the little trouble herself . Parties were evidently ruffled . With<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>'s permission , she wrote a pleasant note to<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>, asking her to leave the cases untouched . Then , at the first convenient opportunity , she went down herself , intending to repack her belongings and store them properly in the local warehouse ; the plan had been amateurish and a failure .<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>promised to accompany her , but at the last moment begged to be excused . So , for the second time in her life , she entered the house alone .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="33">
    <p n="2320">The day of her visit was exquisite , and the last of unclouded happiness that she was to have for many months . Her anxiety about<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s extraordinary absence was still dormant , and as for a possible brush with Miss Avery-that only gave zest to the expedition . She had also eluded<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s invitation to luncheon . Walking straight up from the station , she crossed the village green and entered the long chestnut avenue that connects it with the church . The church itself stood in the village once . But it there attracted so many worshippers that the devil , in a pet , snatched it from its foundations , and poised it on an inconvenient knoll , three quarters of a mile away . If this story is true , the chestnut avenue must have been planted by the angels . No more tempting approach could be imagined for the lukewarm Christian , and if he still finds the walk too long , the devil is defeated all the same , Science having built Holy Trinity , a Chapel of Ease , near the<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s and roofed it with tin .</p>
    <p n="2321">Up the avenue<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>strolled slowly , stopping to watch the sky that gleamed through the upper branches of the chestnuts , or to finger the little horseshoes on the lower branches . Why has not England a great mythology ? our folklore has never advanced beyond daintiness , and the greater melodies about our country-side have all issued through the pipes of Greece . Deep and true as the native imagination can be , it seems to have failed here . It has stopped with the witches and the fairies . It cannot vivify one fraction of a summer field , or give names to half a dozen stars . England still waits for the supreme moment of her literature — for the great poet who shall voice her , or , better still for the thousand little poets whose voices shall pass into our common talk .</p>
    <p n="2322">At the church the scenery changed . The chestnut avenue opened into a road , smooth but narrow , which led into the untouched country . She followed it for over a mile . Its little hesitations pleased her . Having no urgent destiny , it strolled downhill or up as it wished , taking no trouble about the gradients , or about the view , which nevertheless expanded . The great estates that throttle the south of Hertfordshire were less obtrusive here , and the appearance of the land was neither aristocratic nor suburban . To define it was difficult , but<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>knew what it was not : it was not snobbish . Though its contours were slight , there was a touch of freedom in their sweep to which Surrey will never attain , and the distant brow of the Chilterns towered like a mountain .<said who="#Margaret">“ Left to itself , ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s opinion ,<said who="#Margaret">“ this county would vote Liberal . ”</said>The comradeship , not passionate , that is our highest gift as a nation , was promised by it , as by the low brick farm where she called for the key .</p>
    <p n="2323">But the inside of the farm was disappointing . A most finished young person received her .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Yes ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>; no ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>; oh yes ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, auntie received your letter quite duly . Auntie has gone up to your little place at the present moment . Shall I send the servant to direct you ? ”</said>Followed by :<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Of course , auntie does not generally look after your place ; she only does it to oblige a neighbour as something exceptional . It gives her something to do . She spends quite a lot of her time there . My husband says to me sometimes , ‘ Where 's auntie ? ’ I say , ‘ Need you ask ? She 's at Howards End . ’ Yes ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>.<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, could I prevail upon you to accept a piece of cake ? Not if I cut it for you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2324"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>refused the cake , but unfortunately this gave her gentility in the eyes of<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>'s niece .</p>
    <p n="2325"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ I cannot let you go on alone . Now do n't . You really must n't . I will direct you myself if it comes to that . I must get my hat . Now ”</said>— roguishly —<said who="#Miss_Avery">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, do n't you move while I 'm gone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2326">Stunned ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>did not move from the best parlour , over which the touch of art nouveau had fallen . But the other rooms looked in keeping , though they conveyed the peculiar sadness of a rural interior . Here had lived an elder race , to which we look back with disquietude . The country which we visit at week-ends was really a home to it , and the graver sides of life , the deaths , the partings , the yearnings for love , have their deepest expression in the heart of the fields . All was not sadness . The sun was shining without . The thrush sang his two syllables on the budding guelder-rose . Some children were playing uproariously in heaps of golden straw . It was the presence of sadness at all that surprised<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, and ended by giving her a feeling of completeness . In these English farms , if anywhere , one might see life steadily and see it whole , group in one vision its transitoriness and its eternal youth , connect — connect without bitterness until all men are brothers . But her thoughts were interrupted by the return of<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>'s niece , and were so tranquillising that she suffered the interruption gladly .</p>
    <p n="2327">It was quicker to go out by the back door , and , after due explanations , they went out by it . The niece was now mortified by innumerable chickens , who rushed up to her feet for food , and by a shameless and maternal sow . She did not know what animals were coming to . But her gentility withered at the touch of the sweet air . The wind was rising , scattering the straw and ruffling the tails of the ducks as they floated in families over<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s pendant . One of those delicious gales of spring , in which leaves still in bud seem to rustle , swept over the land and then fell silent .<said who="#Evie">“ Georgie , ”</said>sang the thrush .<said who="#Evie">“ Cuckoo , ”</said>came furtively from the cliff of pine-trees .<said who="#Evie">“ Georgie , pretty Georgie , ”</said>and the other birds joined in with nonsense . The hedge was a half-painted picture which would be finished in a few days . Celandines grew on its banks , lords and ladies and primroses in the defended hollows ; the wild rose-bushes , still bearing their withered hips , showed also the promise of blossom . Spring had come , clad in no classical garb , yet fairer than all springs ; fairer even than she who walks through the myrtles of Tuscany with the graces before her and the zephyr behind .</p>
    <p n="2328">The two women walked up the lane full of outward civility . But<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was thinking how difficult it was to be earnest about furniture on such a day , and the niece was thinking about hats . Thus engaged , they reached Howards End . Petulant cries of “ Auntie ! ” severed the air . There was no reply , and the front door was locked .</p>
    <p n="2329"><said who="#Margaret">“ Are you sure that<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>is up here ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2330"><said who="#Evie">“ Oh , yes ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, quite sure . She is here daily . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2331"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>tried to look in through the dining-room window , but the curtain inside was drawn tightly . So with the drawing-room and the hall . The appearance of these curtains was familiar , yet she did not remember their being there on her other visit ; her impression was that Mr.<persName corresp="#Bryce">Bryce</persName>had taken everything away . They tried the back . Here again they received no answer , and could see nothing ; the kitchen-window was fitted with a blind , while the pantry and scullery had pieces of wood propped up against them , which looked ominously like the lids of packing-cases .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>thought of her books , and she lifted up her voice also . At the first cry she succeeded .</p>
    <p n="2332"><said who="#Margaret">“ Well , well ! ”</said>replied some one inside the house .<said who="#Margaret">“ If it is n't<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>come at last ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2333"><said who="#Bryce">“ Have you got the key , auntie ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2334"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Madge</persName>, go away , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>, still invisible .</p>
    <p n="2335"><said who="#Margaret">“ Auntie , it 's<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="2336"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>supported her .<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Your niece and I have come together . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2337"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Madge</persName>, go away . This is no moment for your hat . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2338">The poor woman went red .<said who="#Margaret">“ Auntie gets more eccentric lately , ”</said>she said nervously .</p>
    <p n="2339"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>! ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ I have come about the furniture . Could you kindly let me in ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2340"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Yes ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, ”</said>said the voice ,<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ of course . ”</said>But after that came silence . They called again without response . They walked round the house disconsolately .</p>
    <p n="2341"><said who="#Margaret">“ I hope<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>is not ill , ”</said>hazarded<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2342"><said who="#Margaret">“ Well , if you 'll excuse me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Madge</persName>,<said who="#Margaret">“ perhaps I ought to be leaving you now . The servants need seeing to at the farm . Auntie is so odd at times . ”</said>Gathering up her elegancies , she retired defeated , and , as if her departure had loosed a spring , the front door opened at once .</p>
    <p n="2343"><persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>said ,<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Well , come right in ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>! ”</said>quite pleasantly and calmly .</p>
    <p n="2344"><said who="#Margaret">“ Thank you so much , ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, but broke off at the sight of an umbrella-stand . It was her own .</p>
    <p n="2345"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Come right into the hall first , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>. She drew the curtain , and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>uttered a cry of despair . For an appalling thing had happened . The hall was fitted up with the contents of the library from Wickham Place . The carpet had been laid , the big work-table drawn up near the window ; the bookcases filled the wall opposite the fireplace , and her father 's sword — this is what bewildered her particularly — had been drawn from its scabbard and hung naked amongst the sober volumes .<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>must have worked for days .</p>
    <p n="2346"><said who="#Margaret">“ I 'm afraid this is n't what we meant , ”</said>she began .<said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>and I never intended the cases to be touched . For instance , these books are my brother 's . We are storing them for him and for my sister , who is abroad . When you kindly undertook to look after things , we never expected you to do so much . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2347"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ The house has been empty long enough , ”</said>said the old woman .</p>
    <p n="2348"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>refused to argue .<said who="#Margaret">“ I dare say we did n't explain , ”</said>she said civilly .<said who="#Margaret">“ It has been a mistake , and very likely our mistake . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2349"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, it has been mistake upon mistake for fifty years . The house is<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s , and she would not desire it to stand empty any longer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2350">To help the poor decaying brain ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>said :</p>
    <p n="2351"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s house , the mother of Mr.<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2352"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Mistake upon mistake , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Mistake upon mistake . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2353"><said who="#Margaret">“ Well , I do n't know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, sitting down in one of her own chairs .<said who="#Margaret">“ I really do n't know what 's to be done . ”</said>She could not help laughing .</p>
    <p n="2354">The other said :<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Yes , it should be a merry house enough . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2355"><said who="#Margaret">“ I do n't know — I dare say . Well , thank you very much ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>. Yes , that 's all right . Delightful . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2356"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ There is still the parlour . ”</said>She went through the door opposite and drew a curtain . Light flooded the drawing-room furniture from Wickham Place .<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ And the dining-room . ”</said>More curtains were drawn , more windows were flung open to the spring .<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Then through here — ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>continued passing and reprising through the hall . Her voice was lost , but<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>heard her pulling up the kitchen blind .<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ I 've not finished here yet , ”</said>she announced , returning .<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ There 's still a deal to do . The farm lads will carry your great wardrobes upstairs , for there is no need to go into expense at Hilton . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2357"><said who="#Margaret">“ It is all a mistake , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, feeling that she must put her foot down .<said who="#Margaret">“ A misunderstanding .<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>and I are not going to live at Howards End . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2358"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Oh , indeed ! On account of his hay fever ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2359"><said who="#Margaret">“ We have settled to build a new home for ourselves in Sussex , and part of this furniture — my part — will go down there presently . ”</said>She looked at<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>intently , trying to understand the kink in her brain .</p>
    <p n="2360">Here was no maundering old woman . Her wrinkles were shrewd and humorous . She looked capable of scathing wit and also of high but unostentatious nobility .<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ You think that you wo n't come back to live here ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, but you will . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2361"><said who="#Margaret">“ That remains to be seen , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, smiling .<said who="#Margaret">“ We have no intention of doing so for the present . We happen to need a much larger house . Circumstances oblige us to give big parties . Of course , some day — one never knows , does one ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2362"><persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>retorted :<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Some day ! Tcha ! tcha ! Do n't talk about some day . You are living here now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2363"><said who="#Margaret">“ Am I ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2364"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ You are living here , and have been for the last ten minutes , if you ask me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2365">It was a senseless remark , but with a queer feeling of disloyalty<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>rose from her chair . She felt that<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>had been obscurely censured . They went into the dining-room , where the sunlight poured in upon her mother 's chiffonier , and upstairs , where many an old god peeped from a new niche . The furniture fitted extraordinarily well . In the central room — over the hall , the room that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had slept in four years ago —<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>had placed<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>'s old bassinette .</p>
    <p n="2366"><said who="#Tibby">“ The nursery , ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="2367"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>turned away without speaking .</p>
    <p n="2368">At last everything was seen . The kitchen and lobby were still stacked with furniture and straw , but , as far as she could make out , nothing had been broken or scratched . A pathetic display of ingenuity ! Then they took a friendly stroll in the garden . It had gone wild since her last visit . The gravel sweep was weedy , and grass had sprung up at the very jaws of the garage . And<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s rockery was only bumps . Perhaps<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>was responsible for<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>'s oddness . But<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>suspected that the cause lay deeper , and that the girl 's silly letter had but loosed the irritation of years .</p>
    <p n="2369"><said who="#Margaret">“ It 's a beautiful meadow , ”</said>she remarked . It was one of those open-air drawing-rooms that have been formed , hundreds of years ago , out of the smaller fields . So the boundary hedge zigzagged down the hill at right angles , and at the bottom there was a little green annex — a sort of powder-closet for the cows .</p>
    <p n="2370"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Yes , the maidy 's well enough , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>,<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ for those , that is , who do n't suffer from sneezing . ”</said>And she cackled maliciously .<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ I 've seen Charlie Wilcox go out to my lads in hay time — oh , they ought to do this — they must n't do that — he 'd learn them to be lads . And just then the tickling took him . He has it from his father , with other things . There 's not one Wilcox that can stand up against a field in June — I laughed fit to burst while he was courting<persName corresp="#Ruth">Ruth</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2371"><said who="#Margaret">“ My brother gets hay fever too , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2372"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ This house lies too much on the land for them . Naturally , they were glad enough to slip in at first . But<persName corresp="#Wilcoxes">Wilcoxes</persName>are better than nothing , as I see you 've found . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2373"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>laughed .</p>
    <p n="2374"><said who="#Margaret">“ They keep a place going , do n't they ? Yes , it is just that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2375"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ They keep England going , it is my opinion . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2376">But<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>upset her by replying :<said who="#Margaret">“ Ay , they breed like rabbits . Well , well , it 's a funny world . But He who made it knows what He wants in it , I suppose . If Mrs. Charlie is expecting her fourth , it is n't for us to repine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2377"><said who="#Margaret">“ They breed and they also work , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, conscious of some invitation to disloyalty , which was echoed by the very breeze and by the songs of the birds .<said who="#Margaret">“ It certainly is a funny world , but so long as men like my husband and his sons govern it , I think it 'll never be a bad one — never really bad . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2378"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ No , better'n nothing , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>, and turned to the wych-elm .</p>
    <p n="2379">On their way back to the farm she spoke of her old friend much more clearly than before . In the house<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had wondered whether she quite distinguished the first wife from the second . Now she said :<said who="#Margaret">“ I never saw much of<persName corresp="#Ruth">Ruth</persName>after her grandmother died , but we stayed civil . It was a very civil family . Old Mrs. Howard never spoke against anybody , nor let any one be turned away without food . Then it was never ‘ Trespassers will be prosecuted ’ in their land , but would people please not come in ? Mrs. Howard was never created to run a farm . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2380"><said who="#Margaret">“ Had they no men to help them ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>asked .</p>
    <p n="2381"><persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>replied :<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Things went on until there were no men . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2382"><said who="#Margaret">“ Until<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>came along , ”</said>corrected<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, anxious that her husband should receive his dues .</p>
    <p n="2383"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ I suppose so ; but<persName corresp="#Ruth">Ruth</persName>should have married a — no disrespect to you to say this , for I take it you were intended to get Wilcox any way , whether she got him first or no . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2384"><said who="#Margaret">“ Whom should she have married ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2385"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ A soldier ! ”</said>exclaimed the old woman .<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Some real soldier . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2386"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was silent . It was a criticism of<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>'s character far more trenchant than any of her own . She felt dissatisfied .</p>
    <p n="2387"><said who="#Henry">“ But that 's all over , ”</said>she went on .<said who="#Henry">“ A better time is coming now , though you 've kept me long enough waiting . In a couple of weeks I 'll see your light shining through the hedge of an evening . Have you ordered in coals ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2388"><said who="#Margaret">“ We are not coming , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>firmly . She respected<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>too much to humour her .<said who="#Margaret">“ No . Not coming . Never coming . It has all been a mistake . The furniture must be repacked at once , and I am very sorry , but I am making other arrangements , and must ask you to give me the keys . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2389"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Certainly ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>, and resigned her duties with a smile .</p>
    <p n="2390">Relieved at this conclusion , and having sent her compliments to<persName corresp="#Margaret">Madge</persName>,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>walked back to the station . She had intended to go to the furniture warehouse and give directions for removal , but the muddle had turned out more extensive than she expected , so she decided to consult<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>. It was as well that she did this . He was strongly against employing the local man whom he had previously recommended , and advised her to store in London after all .</p>
    <p n="2391">But before this could be done an unexpected trouble fell upon her .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="34">
    <p n="2392">It was not unexpected entirely .<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>'s health had been bad all winter . She had had a long series of colds and coughs , and had been too busy to get rid of them . She had scarcely promised her niece “ to really take my tiresome chest in hand , ” when she caught a chill and developed acute pneumonia .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>went down to Swanage .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was telegraphed for , and that spring party that after all gathered in that hospitable house had all the pathos of fair memories . On a perfect day , when the sky seemed blue porcelain , and the waves of the discreet little bay beat gentlest of tattoos upon the sand ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>hurried up through the rhododendrons , confronted again by the senselessness of<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>. One death may explain itself , but it throws no light upon another ; the groping inquiry must begin anew . Preachers or scientists may generalise , but we know that no generality is possible about those whom we love ; not one heaven awaits them , not even one oblivion .<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>, incapable of tragedy , slipped out of life with odd little laughs and apologies for having stopped in it so long . She was very weak ; she could not rise to the occasion , or realise the great mystery which all agree must await her ; it only seemed to her that she was quite done up — more done up than ever before ; that she saw and heard and felt less every moment ; and that , unless something changed , she would soon feel nothing . Her spare strength she devoted to plans : could not<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>take some steamer expeditions ? were mackerel cooked as<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>liked them ? She worried herself about<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s absence , and also that she should be the cause of<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s return . The nurses seemed to think such interests quite natural , and perhaps hers was an average approach to the Great Gate . But<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>saw<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>stripped of any false romance ; whatever the idea of<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>may contain , the process can be trivial and hideous .</p>
    <p n="2393"><said who="#Death">“ Important —<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>dear , take the Lulworth when<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>comes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2394"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>wo n't be able to stop ,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>. She has telegraphed that she can only get away just to see you . She must go back to Germany as soon as you are well . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2395"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ How very odd of<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>!<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="2396"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Yes , dear ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2397"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ Can he spare you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2398"><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>wished her to come , and had been very kind . Yet again<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>said so .</p>
    <p n="2399"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>did not die . Quite outside her will , a more dignified power took hold of her and checked her on the downward slope . She returned , without emotion , as fidgety as ever . On the fourth day she was out of danger .</p>
    <p n="2400"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>— important , ”</said>it went on :<said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ I should like you to have some companion to take walks with . Do try Miss Conder . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2401"><said who="#Margaret">“ I have been for a little walk with Miss Conder . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2402"><said who="#Mrs._Munt">“ But she is not really interesting . If only you had<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2403"><said who="#Margaret">“ I have<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>,<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2404"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ No , but he has to do his Chinese . Some real companion is what you need . Really ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>is odd . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2405"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>is odd , very , ”</said>agreed<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2406"><said who="#Aunt_Juley">“ Not content with going abroad , why does she want to go back there at once ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2407"><said who="#Margaret">“ No doubt she will change her mind when she sees us . She has not the least balance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2408">That was the stock criticism about<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, but<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s voice trembled as she made it . By now she was deeply pained at her sister 's behaviour . It may be unbalanced to fly out of England , but to stay away eight months argues that the heart is awry as well as the head . A sick-bed could recall<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, but she was deaf to more human calls ; after a glimpse at her aunt , she would retire into her nebulous life behind some poste restante . She scarcely existed ; her letters had become dull and infrequent ; she had no wants and no curiosity . And it was all put down to poor<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>'s account !<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, long pardoned by his wife , was still too infamous to be greeted by his sister-in-law . It was morbid , and , to her alarm ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>fancied that she could trace the growth of morbidity back in<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s life for nearly four years . The flight from<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>; the unbalanced patronage of the Basts ; the explosion of grief up on the Downs — all connected with<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>, an insignificant boy whose lips had kissed hers for a fraction of time .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>had feared that they might kiss again . Foolishly — the real danger was reaction . Reaction against the Wilcoxes had eaten into her life until she was scarcely sane . At twenty-five she had an idee fixe . What hope was there for her as an old woman ?</p>
    <p n="2409">The more<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>thought about it the more alarmed she became . For many months she had put the subject away , but it was too big to be slighted now . There was almost a taint of madness . Were all<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s actions to be governed by a tiny mishap , such as may happen to any young man or woman ? Can human nature be constructed on lines so insignificant ? The blundering little encounter at Howards End was vital . It propagated itself where graver intercourse lay barren ; it was stronger than sisterly intimacy , stronger than reason or books . In one of her moods<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had confessed that she still “ enjoyed ” it in a certain sense .<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>had faded , but the magic of his caress endured . And where there is enjoyment of the past there may also be reaction — propagation at both ends .</p>
    <p n="2410">Well , it is odd and sad that our minds should be such seed-beds , and we without power to choose the seed . But man is an odd , sad creature as yet , intent on pilfering the earth , and heedless of the growths within himself . He cannot be bored about psychology . He leaves it to the specialist , which is as if he should leave his dinner to be eaten by a steam-engine . He cannot be bothered to digest his own soul .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>have been more patient , and it is suggested that<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>has succeeded — so far as success is yet possible . She does understand herself , she has some rudimentary control over her own growth . Whether<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>has succeeded one cannot say .</p>
    <p n="2411">The day that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Munt">Mrs. Munt</persName>rallied<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s letter arrived . She had posted it at Munich , and would be in London herself on the morrow . It was a disquieting letter , though the opening was affectionate and sane .</p>
    <p>“ DEAREST MEG ,</p>
    <p n="2412"><said who="#Margaret">“ Give<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s love to<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>. Tell her that I love , and have loved her ever since I can remember . I shall be in London Thursday .</said></p>
    <p n="2413"><said who="#Margaret">“ My address will be care of the bankers . I have not yet settled on a hotel , so write or wire to me there and give me detailed news . If<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>is much better , or if , for a terrible reason , it would be no good my coming down to Swanage , you must not think it odd if I do not come . I have all sorts of plans in my head . I am living abroad at present , and want to get back as quickly as possible . Will you please tell me where our furniture is ? I should like to take out one or two books ; the rest are for you .</said></p>
    <p n="2414"><said who="#Helen">“ Forgive me , dearest<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>. This must read like rather a tiresome letter , but all letters are from your loving</said></p>
    <p n="2415"><said who="#Margaret">“ HELEN . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2416">It was a tiresome letter , for it tempted<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>to tell a lie . If she wrote that<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>was still in danger her sister would come . Unhealthiness is contagious . We cannot be in contact with those who are in a morbid state without ourselves deteriorating . To “ act for the best ” might do<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>good , but would do herself harm , and , at the risk of disaster , she kept her colours flying a little longer . She replied that their aunt was much better , and awaited developments .</p>
    <p n="2417"><persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>approved of her reply . Mellowing rapidly , he was a pleasanter companion than before . Oxford had done much for him . He had lost his peevishness , and could hide his indifference to people and his interest in food . But he had not grown more human . The years between eighteen and twenty-two , so magical for most , were leading him gently from boyhood to middle age . He had never known young-manliness , that quality which warms the heart till death , and gives<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>an imperishable charm . He was frigid , through no fault of his own , and without cruelty . He thought<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>wrong and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>right , but the family trouble was for him what a scene behind footlights is for most people . He had only one suggestion to make , and that was characteristic .</p>
    <p n="2418"><said who="#Margaret">“ Why do n't you tell<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2419"><said who="#Margaret">“ About<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2420"><said who="#Helen">“ Perhaps he has come across that sort of thing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2421"><said who="#Margaret">“ He would do all he could , but — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2422"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh , you know best . But he is practical . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2423">It was the student 's belief in experts .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>demurred for one or two reasons . Presently<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s answer came . She sent a telegram requesting the address of the furniture , as she would now return at once .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>replied ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Certainly not ; meet me at the bankers ’ at four . ”</said>She and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>went up to London .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was not at the bankers ’ , and they were refused her address .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had passed into chaos .</p>
    <p n="2424"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>put her arm round her brother . He was all that she had left , and never had he seemed more unsubstantial .</p>
    <p n="2425"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>love , what next ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2426">He replied :<said who="#Helen">“ It is extraordinary . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2427"><said who="#Margaret">“ Dear , your judgment 's often clearer than mine . Have you any notion what 's at the back ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2428"><said who="#Helen">“ None , unless it 's something mental . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2429"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh — that ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Quite impossible . ”</said>But the suggestion had been uttered , and in a few minutes she took it up herself . Nothing else explained . And London agreed with<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>. The mask fell off the city , and she saw it for what it really is — a caricature of infinity . The familiar barriers , the streets along which she moved , the houses between which she had made her little journeys for so many years , became negligible suddenly .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>seemed one with grimy trees and the traffic and the slowly-flowing slabs of mud . She had accomplished a hideous act of renunciation and returned to the One .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s own faith held firm . She knew the human soul will be merged , if it be merged at all , with the stars and the sea . Yet she felt that her sister had been going amiss for many years . It was symbolic the catastrophe should come now , on a London afternoon , while rain fell slowly .</p>
    <p n="2430"><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>was the only hope .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>was definite . He might know of some paths in the chaos that were hidden from them , and she determined to take<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>'s advice and lay the whole matter in his hands . They must call at his office . He could not well make it worse . She went for a few moments into<persName>St. Paul</persName>'s , whose dome stands out of the welter so bravely , as if preaching the gospel of form . But within ,<persName>St. Paul</persName>'s is as its surroundings — echoes and whispers , inaudible songs , invisible mosaics , wet footmarks , crossing and recrossing the floor . Si monumentum requiris , circumspice ; it points us back to London . There was no hope of<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>here .</p>
    <p n="2431"><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>was unsatisfactory at first . That she had expected . He was overjoyed to see her back from Swanage , and slow to admit the growth of a new trouble . When they told him of their search , he only chaffed<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>and the Schlegels generally , and declared that it was “ just like<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>” to lead her relatives a dance .</p>
    <p n="2432"><said who="#Margaret">“ That is what we all say , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ But why should it be just like<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>? Why should she be allowed to be so queer , and to grow queerer ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2433"><said who="#Helen">“ Do n't ask me . I 'm a plain man of business . I live and let live . My advice to you both is , do n't worry .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, you 've got black marks again under your eyes . You know that 's strictly forbidden . First your aunt — then your sister . No , we are n't going to have it . Are we , Theobald ? ”</said>He rang the bell .<said who="#Helen">“ I 'll give you some tea , and then you go straight to Ducie Street . I can n't have my girl looking as old as her husband . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2434"><said who="#Tibby">“ All the same , you have not quite seen our point , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2435"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, who was in good spirits , retorted ,<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I do n't suppose I ever shall . ”</said>He leant back , laughing at the gifted but ridiculous family , while the fire flickered over the map of Africa .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>motioned to her brother to go on . Rather diffident , he obeyed her .</p>
    <p n="2436"><said who="#Tibby">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s point is this , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Tibby">“ Our sister may be mad . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2437"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, who was working in the inner room , looked round .</p>
    <p n="2438"><said who="#Margaret">“ Come in ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>kindly .<said who="#Margaret">“ Could you help us at all ? We are again in trouble . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2439"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I 'm afraid I cannot . What are the facts ? We are all mad more or less , you know , in these days . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2440"><said who="#Tibby">“ The facts are as follows , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, who had at times a pedantic lucidity .<said who="#Tibby">“ The facts are that she has been in England for three days and will not see us . She has forbidden the bankers to give us her address . She refuses to answer questions .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>finds her letters colourless . There are other facts , but these are the most striking . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2441"><said who="#Henry">“ She has never behaved like this before , then ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2442"><said who="#Tibby">“ Of course not ! ”</said>said his wife , with a frown .</p>
    <p n="2443"><said who="#Henry">“ Well , my dear , how am I to know ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2444">A senseless spasm of annoyance came over her .<said who="#Tibby">“ You know quite well that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>never sins against affection , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Tibby">“ You must have noticed that much in her , surely . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2445"><said who="#Henry">“ Oh yes ; she and I have always hit it off together . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2446"><said who="#Tibby">“ No ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>— can n't you see ?— I do n't mean that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2447">She recovered herself , but not before<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>had observed her . Stupid and attentive , he was watching the scene .</p>
    <p n="2448"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I was meaning that when she was eccentric in the past , one could trace it back to the heart in the long-run . She behaved oddly because she cared for some one , or wanted to help them . There 's no possible excuse for her now . She is grieving us deeply , and that is why I am sure that she is not well . ‘ Mad ’ is too terrible a word , but she is not well . I shall never believe it . I should n't discuss my sister with you if I thought she was well — trouble you about her , I mean . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2449"><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>began to grow serious . Ill-health was to him something perfectly definite . Generally well himself , he could not realise that we sink to it by slow gradations . The sick had no rights ; they were outside the pale ; one could lie to them remorselessly . When his first wife was seized , he had promised to take her down into Hertfordshire , but meanwhile arranged with a nursing-home instead .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, too , was ill. And the plan that he sketched out for her capture , clever and well-meaning as it was , drew its ethics from the wolf-pack .</p>
    <p n="2450"><said who="#Helen">“ You want to get hold of her ? ”</said>he said .<said who="#Helen">“ That 's the problem , is n't it ? She has got to see a doctor . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2451"><said who="#Henry">“ For all I know she has seen one already . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2452"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , yes ; do n't interrupt . ”</said>He rose to his feet and thought intently . The genial , tentative host disappeared , and they saw instead the man who had carved money out of Greece and Africa , and bought forests from the natives for a few bottles of gin .<said who="#Helen">“ I 've got it , ”</said>he said at last .<said who="#Helen">“ It 's perfectly easy . Leave it to me . We 'll send her down to Howards End . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2453"><said who="#Henry">“ How will you do that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2454"><said who="#Helen">“ After her books . Tell her that she must unpack them herself . Then you can meet her there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2455"><said who="#Helen">“ But ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, that 's just what she wo n't let me do . It 's part of her — whatever it is — never to see me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2456"><said who="#Henry">“ Of course you wo n't tell her you 're going . When she is there , looking at the cases , you 'll just stroll in . If nothing is wrong with her , so much the better . But there 'll be the motor round the corner , and we can run her to a specialist in no time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2457"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>shook her head .<said who="#Helen">“ It 's quite impossible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2458"><said who="#Henry">“ Why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2459"><said who="#Tibby">“ It does n't seem impossible to me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>;<said who="#Tibby">“ it is surely a very tippy plan . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2460"><said who="#Margaret">“ It is impossible , because — ”</said>She looked at her husband sadly .<said who="#Margaret">“ It 's not the particular language that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and I talk , if you see my meaning . It would do splendidly for other people , whom I do n't blame . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2461"><said who="#Tibby">“ But<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>does n't talk , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.<said who="#Tibby">“ That 's our whole difficulty . She wo n't talk your particular language , and on that account you think she 's ill . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2462"><said who="#Margaret">“ No ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>; it 's sweet of you , but I could n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2463"><said who="#Henry">“ I see , ”</said>he said ;<said who="#Henry">“ you have scruples . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2464"><said who="#Tibby">“ I suppose so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2465"><said who="#Henry">“ And sooner than go against them you would have your sister suffer . You could have got her down to Swanage by a word , but you had scruples . And scruples are all very well . I am as scrupulous as any man alive , I hope ; but when it is a case like this , when there is a question of madness — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2466"><said who="#Tibby">“ I deny it 's madness . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2467"><said who="#Henry">“ You said just now — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2468"><said who="#Tibby">“ It 's madness when I say it , but not when you say it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2469"><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>shrugged his shoulders .<said who="#Henry">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>!<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>! ”</said>he groaned .<said who="#Henry">“ No education can teach a woman logic . Now , my dear , my time is valuable . Do you want me to help you or not ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2470"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not in that way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2471"><said who="#Henry">“ Answer my question . Plain question , plain answer . Do — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2472"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>surprised them by interrupting .<said who="#Margaret">“ Pater , we may as well keep Howards End out of it , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="2473"><said who="#Henry">“ Why ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2474"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>could give no reason ; but<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>felt as if , over tremendous distance , a salutation had passed between them .</p>
    <p n="2475"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ The whole house is at sixes and sevens , ”</said>he said crossly .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ We do n't want any more mess . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2476"><said who="#Margaret">“ Who 's ‘ we ’ ? ”</said>asked his father .<said who="#Margaret">“ My boy , pray who 's ‘ we ’ ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2477"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I am sure I beg your pardon , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>.<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I appear always to be intruding . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2478">By now<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>wished she had never mentioned her trouble to her husband . Retreat was impossible . He was determined to push the matter to a satisfactory conclusion , and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>faded as he talked . Her fair , flying hair and eager eyes counted for nothing , for she was ill , without rights , and any of her friends might hunt her . Sick at heart ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>joined in the chase . She wrote her sister a lying letter , at her husband 's dictation ; she said the furniture was all at Howards End , but could be seen on Monday next at 3 P. M ., when a charwoman would be in attendance . It was a cold letter , and the more plausible for that .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>would think she was offended . And on Monday next she and<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>were to lunch with<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, and then ambush themselves in the garden .</p>
    <p n="2479">After they had gone ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>said to his son :<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I can n't have this sort of behaviour , my boy .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s too sweet-natured to mind , but I mind for her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2480"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>made no answer .</p>
    <p n="2481"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Is anything wrong with you ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, this afternoon ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2482"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ No , pater ; but you may be taking on a bigger business than you reckon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2483"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ How ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2484"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Do n't ask me . ”</said></p>

    <p n="2485">One speaks of the moods of spring , but the days that are her true children have only one mood ; they are all full of the rising and dropping of winds , and the whistling of birds . New flowers may come out , the green embroidery of the hedges increase , but the same heaven broods overhead , soft , thick , and blue , the same figures , seen and unseen , are wandering by coppice and meadow . The morning that<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had spent with<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>, and the afternoon she set out to entrap<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, were the scales of a single balance . Time might never have moved , rain never have fallen , and man alone , with his schemes and ailments , was troubling<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>until he saw her through a veil of tears .</p>
    <p n="2486">She protested no more . Whether<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>was right or wrong , he was most kind , and she knew of no other standard by which to judge him . She must trust him absolutely . As soon as he had taken up a business , his obtuseness vanished . He profited by the slightest indications , and the capture of<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>promised to be staged as deftly as the marriage of<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2487">They went down in the morning as arranged , and he discovered that their victim was actually in Hilton . On his arrival he called at all the livery-stables in the village , and had a few minutes ’ serious conversation with the proprietors . What he said ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>did not know — perhaps not the truth ; but news arrived after lunch that a lady had come by the London train , and had taken a fly to Howards End .</p>
    <p n="2488"><said who="#Henry">“ She was bound to drive , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.<said who="#Henry">“ There will be her books . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2489"><said who="#Margaret">“ I cannot make it out , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>for the hundredth time .</p>
    <p n="2490"><said who="#Henry">“ Finish your coffee , dear . We must be off . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2491"><said who="#Dolly">“ Yes ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, you know you must take plenty , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2492"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>tried , but suddenly lifted her hand to her eyes .<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>stole glances at her father-in-law which he did not answer . In the silence the motor came round to the door .</p>
    <p n="2493"><said who="#Dolly">“ You 're not fit for it , ”</said>he said anxiously .<said who="#Dolly">“ Let me go alone . I know exactly what to do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2494"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh yes , I am fit , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, uncovering her face .<said who="#Dolly">“ Only most frightfully worried . I cannot feel that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>is really alive . Her letters and telegrams seem to have come from some one else . Her voice is n't in them . I do n't believe your driver really saw her at the station . I wish I 'd never mentioned it . I know that<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>is vexed . Yes , he is — ”</said>She seized<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s hand and kissed it .<said>“ There ,<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>will forgive me . There . Now we 'll be off . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2495"><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>had been looking at her closely . He did not like this breakdown .</p>
    <p n="2496"><said who="#Henry">“ Do n't you want to tidy yourself ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="2497"><said who="#Dolly">“ Have I time ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2498"><said who="#Henry">“ Yes , plenty . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2499">She went to the lavatory by the front door , and as soon as the bolt slipped ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>said quietly :</p>
    <p n="2500"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, I 'm going without her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2501"><persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s eyes lit up with vulgar excitement . She followed him on tiptoe out to the car .</p>
    <p n="2502"><said who="#Dolly">“ Tell her I thought it best . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2503"><said who="#Dolly">“ Yes ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, I see . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2504"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Say anything you like . All right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2505">The car started well , and with ordinary luck would have got away . But Porgly-woggles , who was playing in the garden , chose this moment to sit down in the middle of the path .<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>, in trying to pass him , ran one wheel over a bed of wallflowers .<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>screamed .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, hearing the noise , rushed out hatless , and was in time to jump on the footboard . She said not a single word ; he was only treating her as she had treated<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, and her rage at his dishonesty only helped to indicate what<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>would feel against them . She thought ,<said who="#Dolly">“ I deserve it ; I am punished for lowering my colours . ”</said>And she accepted his apologies with a calmness that astonished him .</p>
    <p n="2506"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I still consider you are not fit for it , ”</said>he kept saying .</p>
    <p n="2507"><said who="#Dolly">“ Perhaps I was not at lunch . But the whole thing is spread clearly before me now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2508"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I was meaning to act for the best . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2509"><said who="#Dolly">“ Just lend me your scarf , will you . This wind takes one 's hair so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2510"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Certainly , dear girl . Are you all right now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2511"><said who="#Dolly">“ Look ! My hands have stopped trembling . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2512"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ And have quite forgiven me ? Then listen . Her cab should already have arrived at Howards End . ( We 're a little late , but no matter . ) Our first move will be to send it down to wait at the farm , as , if possible , one does n't want a scene before servants . A certain gentleman ”</said>— he pointed at<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>'s back —<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ wo n't drive in , but will wait a little short of the front gate , behind the laurels . Have you still the keys of the house ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2513"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2514"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Well , they are n't wanted . Do you remember how the house stands ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2515"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2516"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ If we do n't find her in the porch , we can stroll round into the garden . Our object — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2517">Here they stopped to pick up the doctor .</p>
    <p n="2518"><said who="#Helen">“ I was just saying to my wife , Mansbridge , that our main object is not to frighten<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>. The house , as you know , is my property , so it should seem quite natural for us to be there . The trouble is evidently nervous — would n't you say so ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2519">The doctor , a very young man , began to ask questions about<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. Was she normal ? Was there anything congenital or hereditary ? Had anything occurred that was likely to alienate her from her family ?</p>
    <p n="2520"><said who="#Margaret">“ Nothing , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, wondering what would have happened if she had added :<said who="#Margaret">“ Though she did resent my husband 's immorality . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2521"><said who="#Henry">“ She always was highly strung , ”</said>pursued<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, leaning back in the car as it shot past the church .<said who="#Henry">“ A tendency to spiritualism and those things , though nothing serious . Musical , literary , artistic , but I should say normal — a very charming girl . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2522"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s anger and terror increased every moment . How dare these men label her sister ! What horrors lay ahead ! What impertinences that shelter under the name of science ! The pack was turning on<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, to deny her human rights , and it seemed to<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>that all Schlegels were threatened with her .<said who="#Helen">“ Were they normal ? ”</said>What a question to ask ! And it is always those who know nothing about human nature , who are bored by psychology — and shocked by physiology , who ask it . However piteous her sister 's state , she knew that she must be on her side . They would be mad together if the world chose to consider them so .</p>
    <p n="2523">It was now five minutes past three . The car slowed down by the farm , in the yard of which<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>was standing .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>asked her whether a cab had gone past . She nodded , and the next moment they caught sight of it , at the end of the lane . The car ran silently like a beast of prey . So unsuspicious was<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>that she was sitting in the porch , with her back to the road . She had come . Only her head and shoulders were visible . She sat framed in the vine , and one of her hands played with the buds . The wind ruffled her hair , the sun glorified it ; she was as she had always been .</p>
    <p n="2524"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was seated next to the door . Before her husband could prevent her , she slipped out . She ran to the garden gate , which was shut , passed through it , and deliberately pushed it in his face . The noise alarmed<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>saw her rise with an unfamiliar movement , and , rushing into the porch , learnt the simple explanation of all their fears — her sister was with child .</p>
    <p n="2525"><said who="#Henry">“ Is the truant all right ? ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2526">She had time to whisper :<said who="#Henry">“ Oh , my darling — ”</said>The keys of the house were in her hand . She unlocked Howards End and thrust<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>into it .<said who="#Henry">“ Yes , all right , ”</said>she said , and stood with her back to the door .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="36">
    <p n="2527">Mansbridge had followed .<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>was at the gate , and the flyman had stood up on the box .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>shook her head at them ; she could not speak any more . She remained clutching the keys , as if all their future depended on them .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>was asking more questions . She shook her head again . His words had no sense . She heard him wonder why she had let<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>in .<said who="#Helen">“ You might have given me a knock with the gate , ”</said>was another of his remarks . Presently she heard herself speaking . She , or someone for her , said ,<said who="#Henry">“ Go away . ”</said><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>came nearer . He repeated ,<said who="#Henry">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, you look upset again . My dear , give me the keys . What are you doing with<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2528"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , dearest , do go away , and I will manage it all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2529"><said who="#Henry">“ Manage what ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2530">He stretched out his hand for the keys . She might have obeyed if it had not been for the doctor .</p>
    <p n="2531"><said who="#Helen">“ Stop that at least , ”</said>she said piteously ; the doctor had turned back , and was questioning the driver of<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s cab . A new feeling came over her ; she was fighting for women against men . She did not care about rights , but if men came into Howards End , it should be over her body .</p>
    <p n="2532"><said who="#Henry">“ Come , this is an odd beginning , ”</said>said her husband .</p>
    <p n="2533">The doctor came forward now , and whispered two words to<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>— the scandal was out . Sincerely horrified ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>stood gazing at the earth .</p>
    <p n="2534"><said who="#Margaret">“ I cannot help it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Do wait . It 's not my fault . Please all four of you go away now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2535">Now the flyman was whispering to<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2536"><said who="#Margaret">“ We are relying on you to help us ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, ”</said>said the young doctor .<said who="#Margaret">“ Could you go in and persuade your sister to come out ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2537"><said who="#Margaret">“ On what grounds ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, suddenly looking him straight in the eyes .</p>
    <p n="2538">Thinking it professional to prevaricate , he murmured something about a nervous breakdown .</p>
    <p n="2539"><said who="#Margaret">“ I beg your pardon , but it is nothing of the sort . You are not qualified to attend my sister , Mr. Mansbridge . If we require your services , we will let you know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2540"><said who="#Margaret">“ I can diagnose the case more bluntly if you wish , ”</said>he retorted .</p>
    <p n="2541"><said who="#Crane">“ You could , but you have not . You are , therefore , not qualified to attend my sister . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2542"><said who="#Henry">“ Come , come ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, never raising his eyes .<said who="#Henry">“ This is a terrible business , an appalling business . It 's doctor 's orders . Open the door . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2543"><said who="#Margaret">“ Forgive me , but I will not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2544"><said who="#Henry">“ I do n't agree . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2545"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was silent .</p>
    <p n="2546"><said who="#Margaret">“ This business is as broad as it 's long , ”</said>contributed the doctor .<said who="#Margaret">“ We had better all work together . You need us ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, and we need you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2547"><said who="#Henry">“ Quite so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2548"><said who="#Margaret">“ I do not need you in the least , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2549">The two men looked at each other anxiously .</p>
    <p n="2550"><said who="#Margaret">“ No more does my sister , who is still many weeks from her confinement . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2551"><said who="#Henry">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2552"><said who="#Margaret">“ Well ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, send your doctor away . What possible use is he now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2553"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>ran his eye over the house . He had a vague feeling that he must stand firm and support the doctor . He himself might need support , for there was trouble ahead .</p>
    <p n="2554"><said who="#Margaret">“ It all turns on affection now , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Affection . Do n't you see ? ”</said>Resuming her usual methods , she wrote the word on the house with her finger .<said who="#Margaret">“ Surely you see . I like<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>very much , you not so much . Mr. Mansbridge does n't know her . That 's all . And affection , when reciprocated , gives rights . Put that down in your note-book , Mr. Mansbridge . It 's a useful formula . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2555"><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>told her to be calm .</p>
    <p n="2556"><said who="#Margaret">“ You do n't know what you want yourselves , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, folding her arms .<said who="#Margaret">“ For one sensible remark I will let you in . But you cannot make it . You would trouble my sister for no reason . I will not permit it . I 'll stand here all the day sooner . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2557"><said who="#Henry">“ Mansbridge , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>in a low voice ,<said who="#Henry">“ perhaps not now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2558">The pack was breaking up . At a sign from his master ,<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>also went back into the car .</p>
    <p n="2559"><said who="#Crane">“ Now ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, you , ”</said>she said gently . None of her bitterness had been directed at him .<said who="#Crane">“ Go away now , dear . I shall want your advice later , no doubt . Forgive me if I have been cross . But , seriously , you must go . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2560">He was too stupid to leave her . Now it was Mr. Mansbridge who called in a low voice to him .</p>
    <p n="2561"><said who="#Crane">“ I shall soon find you down at<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s , ”</said>she called , as the gate at last clanged between them . The fly moved out of the way , the motor backed , turned a little , backed again , and turned in the narrow road . A string of farm carts came up in the middle ; but she waited through all , for there was no hurry . When all was over and the car had started , she opened the door .<said who="#Crane">“ Oh , my darling ! ”</said>she said .<said who="#Helen">“ My darling , forgive me . ”</said><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was standing in the hall .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="37">
    <p n="2562"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>bolted the door on the inside . Then she would have kissed her sister , but<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, in a dignified voice , that came strangely from her , said :</p>
    <p n="2563"><said who="#Helen">“ Convenient ! You did not tell me that the books were unpacked . I have found nearly everything that I want . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2564"><said who="#Margaret">“ I told you nothing that was true . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2565"><said who="#Helen">“ It has been a great surprise , certainly . Has<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>been ill ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2566"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, you would n't think I 'd invent that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2567"><said who="#Helen">“ I suppose not , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, turning away , and crying a very little .<said who="#Helen">“ But one loses faith in everything after this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2568"><said who="#Margaret">“ We thought it was illness , but even then — I have n't behaved worthily . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2569"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>selected another book .</p>
    <p n="2570"><said who="#Helen">“ I ought not to have consulted any one . What would our father have thought of me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2571">She did not think of questioning her sister , or of rebuking her . Both might be necessary in the future , but she had first to purge a greater crime than any that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>could have committed — that want of confidence that is the work of the devil .</p>
    <p n="2572"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , I am annoyed , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ My wishes should have been respected . I would have gone through this meeting if it was necessary , but after<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>recovered , it was not necessary . Planning my life , as I now have to do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2573"><said who="#Margaret">“ Come away from those books , ”</said>called<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, do talk to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2574"><said who="#Helen">“ I was just saying that I have stopped living haphazard . One can n't go through a great deal of — ”</said>— she left out the noun —<said who="#Helen">“ without planning one 's actions in advance . I am going to have a child in June , and in the first place conversations , discussions , excitement , are not good for me . I will go through them if necessary , but only then . In the second place I have no right to trouble people . I cannot fit in with England as I know it . I have done something that the English never pardon . It would not be right for them to pardon it . So I must live where I am not known . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2575"><said who="#Margaret">“ But why did n't you tell me , dearest ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2576"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>judicially .<said who="#Helen">“ I might have , but decided to wait . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2577"><said who="#Margaret">“ I believe you would never have told me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2578"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh yes , I should . We have taken a flat in Munich . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2579"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>glanced out of the window .</p>
    <p n="2580"><said who="#Margaret">“ By ‘ we ’ I mean myself and<persName corresp="#Monica">Monica</persName>. But for her , I am and have been and always wish to be alone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2581"><said who="#Helen">“ I have not heard of<persName corresp="#Monica">Monica</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2582"><said who="#Margaret">“ You would n't have . She 's an Italian — by birth at least . She makes her living by journalism . I met her originally on Garda .<persName corresp="#Monica">Monica</persName>is much the best person to see me through . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2583"><said who="#Helen">“ You are very fond of her , then . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2584"><said who="#Margaret">“ She has been extraordinarily sensible with me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2585"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>guessed at<persName corresp="#Monica">Monica</persName>'s type — “ Italiano Inglesiato ” they had named it — the crude feminist of the South , whom one respects but avoids . And<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had turned to it in her need !</p>
    <p n="2586"><said who="#Helen">“ You must not think that we shall never meet , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, with a measured kindness .<said who="#Helen">“ I shall always have a room for you when you can be spared , and the longer you can be with me the better . But you have n't understood yet ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, and of course it is very difficult for you . This is a shock to you . It is n't to me , who have been thinking over our futures for many months , and they wo n't be changed by a slight contretemps , such as this . I cannot live in England . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2587"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, you 've not forgiven me for my treachery . You COULDN'T talk like this to me if you had . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2588"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>dear , why do we talk at all ? ”</said>She dropped a book and sighed wearily . Then , recovering herself , she said :<said who="#Helen">“ Tell me , how is it that all the books are down here ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2589"><said who="#Margaret">“ Series of mistakes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2590"><said who="#Helen">“ And a great deal of furniture has been unpacked . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2591"><said who="#Margaret">“ All . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2592"><said who="#Helen">“ Who lives here , then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2593"><said who="#Margaret">“ No one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2594"><said who="#Helen">“ I suppose you are letting it , though . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2595"><said who="#Margaret">“ The house is dead , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, with a frown .<said who="#Margaret">“ Why worry on about it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2596"><said who="#Margaret">“ But I am interested . You talk as if I had lost all my interest in life . I am still<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, I hope . Now this has n't the feel of a dead house . The hall seems more alive even than in the old days , when it held the Wilcoxes ’ own things . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2597"><said who="#Helen">“ Interested , are you ? Very well , I must tell you , I suppose . My husband lent it on condition we — but by a mistake all our things were unpacked , and<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>, instead of — ”</said>She stopped .<said who="#Margaret">“ Look here , I can n't go on like this . I warn you I wo n't .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, why should you be so miserably unkind to me , simply because you hate<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2598"><said who="#Helen">“ I do n't hate him now , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ I have stopped being a schoolgirl , and ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, once again , I 'm not being unkind . But as for fitting in with your English life — no , put it out of your head at once . Imagine a visit from me at Ducie Street ! It 's unthinkable . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2599"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>could not contradict her . It was appalling to see her quietly moving forward with her plans , not bitter or excitable , neither asserting innocence nor confessing guilt , merely desiring freedom and the company of those who would not blame her . She had been through — how much ?<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>did not know . But it was enough to part her from old habits as well as old friends .</p>
    <p n="2600"><said who="#Helen">“ Tell me about yourself , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, who had chosen her books , and was lingering over the furniture .</p>
    <p n="2601"><said who="#Margaret">“ There 's nothing to tell . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2602"><said who="#Helen">“ But your marriage has been happy ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2603"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , but I do n't feel inclined to talk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2604"><said who="#Helen">“ You feel as I do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2605"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not that , but I can n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2606"><said who="#Helen">“ No more can I . It is a nuisance , but no good trying . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2607">Something had come between them . Perhaps it was<persName>Society</persName>, which henceforward would exclude<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. Perhaps it was a third life , already potent as a spirit . They could find no meeting-place . Both suffered acutely , and were not comforted by the knowledge that affection survived .</p>
    <p n="2608"><said who="#Helen">“ Look here ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, is the coast clear ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2609"><said who="#Margaret">“ You mean that you want to go away from me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2610"><said who="#Helen">“ I suppose so — dear old lady ! it is n't any use . I knew we should have nothing to say . Give my love to<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, and take more yourself than I can say . Promise to come and see me in Munich later . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2611"><said who="#Margaret">“ Certainly , dearest . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2612"><said who="#Helen">“ For that is all we can do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2613">It seemed so . Most ghastly of all was<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s common sense ;<persName corresp="#Monica">Monica</persName>had been extraordinarily good for her .</p>
    <p n="2614"><said who="#Monica">“ I am glad to have seen you and the things . ”</said>She looked at the bookcase lovingly , as if she was saying farewell to the past .</p>
    <p n="2615"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>unbolted the door . She remarked :<said who="#Margaret">“ The car has gone , and here 's your cab . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2616">She led the way to it , glancing at the leaves and the sky . The spring had never seemed more beautiful . The driver , who was leaning on the gate , called out , “ Please , lady , a message , ” and handed her<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>'s visiting-card through the bars .</p>
    <p n="2617"><said who="#Henry">“ How did this come ? ”</said>she asked .</p>
    <p n="2618"><persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>had returned with it almost at once .</p>
    <p n="2619">She read the card with annoyance . It was covered with instructions in domestic French . When she and her sister had talked she was to come back for the night to<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s .<said who="#Helen">“ Il faut dormir sur ce sujet . ”</said>while<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was to be found une comfortable chambre a l'hotel . The final sentence displeased her greatly until she remembered that the<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s had only one spare room , and so could not invite a third guest .</p>
    <p n="2620"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>would have done what he could , ”</said>she interpreted .</p>
    <p n="2621"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had not followed her into the garden . The door once open , she lost her inclination to fly . She remained in the hall , going from bookcase to table . She grew more like the old<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, irresponsible and charming .</p>
    <p n="2622"><said who="#Helen">“ This IS<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>'s house ? ”</said>she inquired .</p>
    <p n="2623"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Surely you remember Howards End ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2624"><said who="#Helen">“ Remember ? I who remember everything ! But it looks to be ours now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2625"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>was extraordinary , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, her own spirits lightening a little . Again she was invaded by a slight feeling of disloyalty . But it brought her relief , and she yielded to it .<said who="#Margaret">“ She loved<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, and would rather furnish her home with our things than think of it empty . In consequence here are all the library books . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2626"><said who="#Helen">“ Not all the books . She has n't unpacked the<persName corresp="#Art">Art</persName>books , in which she may show her sense . And we never used to have the sword here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2627"><said who="#Margaret">“ The sword looks well , though . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2628"><said who="#Helen">“ Magnificent . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2629"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , does n't it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2630"><said who="#Helen">“ Where 's the piano ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2631"><said who="#Margaret">“ I warehoused that in London . Why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2632"><said who="#Helen">“ Nothing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2633"><said who="#Margaret">“ Curious , too , that the carpet fits . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2634"><said who="#Helen">“ The carpet 's a mistake , ”</said>announced<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ I know that we had it in London , but this floor ought to be bare . It is far too beautiful . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2635"><said who="#Helen">“ You still have a mania for under-furnishing . Would you care to come into the dining-room before you start ? There 's no carpet there . They went in , and each minute their talk became more natural .</said></p>
    <p n="2636"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh , WHAT a place for mother 's chiffonier ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2637"><said who="#Margaret">“ Look at the chairs , though . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2638"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh , look at them ! Wickham Place faced north , did n't it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2639"><said who="#Margaret">“ North-west . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2640"><said who="#Helen">“ Anyhow , it is thirty years since any of those chairs have felt the sun . Feel . Their dear little backs are quite warm . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2641"><said who="#Margaret">“ But why has<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>made them set to partners ? I shall just — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2642"><said who="#Helen">“ Over here ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>. Put it so that any one sitting will see the lawn . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2643"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>moved a chair .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>sat down in it .</p>
    <p n="2644"><said who="#Helen">“ Ye — es . The window 's too high . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2645"><said who="#Margaret">“ Try a drawing-room chair . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2646"><said who="#Helen">“ No , I do n't like the drawing-room so much . The beam has been match-boarded . It would have been so beautiful otherwise . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2647"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, what a memory you have for some things ! You 're perfectly right . It 's a room that men have spoilt through trying to make it nice for women . Men do n't know what we want — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2648"><said who="#Helen">“ And never will . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2649"><said who="#Margaret">“ I do n't agree . In two thousand years they 'll know . Look where<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>spilt the soup . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2650"><said who="#Helen">“ Coffee . It was coffee surely . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2651"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>shook her head .<said who="#Margaret">“ Impossible .<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was far too young to be given coffee at that time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2652"><said who="#Helen">“ Was father alive ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2653"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2654"><said who="#Helen">“ Then you 're right and it must have been soup . I thinking of much later — that unsuccessful visit of<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>'s , when she did n't realise that<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>had grown up . It was coffee then , for he threw it down on purpose . There was some rhyme , ‘ Tea , coffee — coffee tea , ’ that she said to him every morning at breakfast . Wait a minute — how did it go ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2655"><said who="#Margaret">“ I know — no , I do n't . What a detestable boy<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2656"><said who="#Helen">“ But the rhyme was simply awful . No decent person could put up with it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2657"><said who="#Helen">“ Ah , that greengage-tree , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, as if the garden was also part of their childhood .<said who="#Helen">“ Why do I connect it with dumb-bells ? And there come the chickens . The grass wants cutting . I love yellow-hammers . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2658"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>interrupted her .<said who="#Margaret">“ I have got it , ”</said>she announced .</p>
    <p n="2659"><said who="#Margaret">“ ‘ Tea , tea , coffee , tea , Or chocolaritee . ’</said></p>
    <p n="2660"><said who="#Helen">“ That every morning for three weeks . No wonder<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was wild . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2661"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>is moderately a dear now , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2662"><said who="#Margaret">“ There ! I knew you 'd say that in the end . Of course he 's a dear . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2663">A bell rang .</p>
    <p n="2664"><said who="#Helen">“ Listen ! what 's that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2665"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>said ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Perhaps the Wilcoxes are beginning the siege . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2666"><said who="#Helen">“ What nonsense — listen ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2667">And the triviality faded from their faces , though it left something behind — the knowledge that they never could be parted because their love was rooted in common things . Explanations and appeals had failed ; they had tried for a common meeting-ground , and had only made each other unhappy . And all the time their salvation was lying round them — the past sanctifying the present ; the present , with wild heart-throb , declaring that there would after all be a future with laughter and the voices of children .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, still smiling , came up to her sister . She said ,<said who="#Helen">“ It is always<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>. ”</said>They looked into each other 's eyes . The inner life had paid .</p>
    <p n="2668">Solemnly the clapper tolled . No one was in the front .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>went to the kitchen , and struggled between packing-cases to the window . Their visitor was only a little boy with a tin can . And triviality returned .</p>
    <p n="2669"><said who="#Margaret">“ Little boy , what do you want ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2670"><said who="#Helen">“ Please , I am the milk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2671"><said who="#Margaret">“ Did<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>send you ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, rather sharply .</p>
    <p n="2672"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , please . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2673"><said who="#Margaret">“ Then take it back and say we require no milk . ”</said>While she called to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>,<said who="#Margaret">“ No , it 's not the siege , but possibly an attempt to provision us against one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2674"><said who="#Helen">“ But I like milk , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ Why send it away ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2675"><said who="#Margaret">“ Do you ? Oh , very well . But we 've nothing to put it in , and he wants the can . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2676"><said who="#Helen">“ Please , I 'm to call in the morning for the can , ”</said>said the boy .</p>
    <p n="2677"><said who="#Margaret">“ The house will be locked up then . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2678"><said who="#Helen">“ In the morning would I bring eggs too ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2679"><said who="#Margaret">“ Are you the boy whom I saw playing in the stacks last week ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2680">The child hung his head .</p>
    <p n="2681"><said who="#Helen">“ Well , run away and do it again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2682"><said who="#Helen">“ Nice little boy , ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said>“ I say , what 's your name ? Mine 's<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2683"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2684">That was<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>all over . The Wilcoxes , too , would ask a child its name , but they never told their names in return .</p>
    <p n="2685"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>, this one here is<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. And at home we 've another called<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2686"><said who="#Tom">“ Mine are lop-eareds , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>, supposing<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>to be a rabbit .</p>
    <p n="2687"><said who="#Helen">“ You 're a very good and rather a clever little boy . Mind you come again .— Is n't he charming ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2688"><said who="#Margaret">“ Undoubtedly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said>“ He is probably the son of<persName corresp="#Margaret">Madge</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Madge</persName>is dreadful . But this place has wonderful powers . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2689"><said who="#Margaret">“ What do you mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2690"><said who="#Tibby">“ I do n't know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2691"><said who="#Margaret">“ Because I probably agree with you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2692"><said who="#Tibby">“ It kills what is dreadful and makes what is beautiful live . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2693"><said who="#Helen">“ I do agree , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, as she sipped the milk .<said who="#Helen">“ But you said that the house was dead not half an hour ago . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2694"><said who="#Margaret">“ Meaning that I was dead . I felt it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2695"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , the house has a surer life than we , even if it was empty , and , as it is , I can n't get over that for thirty years the sun has never shone full on our furniture . After all , Wickham Place was a grave .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, I 've a startling idea . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2696"><said who="#Margaret">“ What is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2697"><said who="#Helen">“ Drink some milk to steady you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2698"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>obeyed .</p>
    <p n="2699"><said who="#Helen">“ No , I wo n't tell you yet , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>,<said who="#Helen">“ because you may laugh or be angry . Let 's go upstairs first and give the rooms an airing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2700">They opened window after window , till the inside , too , was rustling to the spring . Curtains blew , picture frames tapped cheerfully .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>uttered cries of excitement as she found this bed obviously in its right place , that in its wrong one . She was angry with<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>for not having moved the wardrobes up .<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Then one would see really . ”</said>She admired the view . She was the<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>who had written the memorable letters four years ago . As they leant out , looking westward , she said :<said who="#Miss_Avery">“ About my idea . Could n't you and I camp out in this house for the night ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2701"><said who="#Margaret">“ I do n't think we could well do that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2702"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Here are beds , tables , towels — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2703"><said who="#Margaret">“ I know ; but the house is n't supposed to be slept in , and<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>'s suggestion was — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2704"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ I require no suggestions . I shall not alter anything in my plans . But it would give me so much pleasure to have one night here with you . It will be something to look back on . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>lovey , do let 's ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2705"><said who="#Margaret">“ But ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, my pet , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>,<said who="#Margaret">“ we can n't without getting<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>'s leave . Of course , he would give it , but you said yourself that you could n't visit at Ducie Street now , and this is equally intimate . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2706"><said who="#Helen">“ Ducie Street is his house . This is ours . Our furniture , our sort of people coming to the door . Do let us camp out , just one night , and<persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>shall feed us on eggs and milk . Why not ? It 's a moon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2707"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>hesitated .<said who="#Margaret">“ I feel<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>would n't like it , ”</said>she said at last .<said who="#Margaret">“ Even our furniture annoyed him , and I was going to clear it out when<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>'s illness prevented me . I sympathise with<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. He feels it 's his mother 's house . He loves it in rather an untaking way .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>I could answer for — not<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2708"><said who="#Helen">“ I know he wo n't like it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ But I am going to pass out of their lives . What difference will it make in the long run if they say , ‘ And she even spent the night at Howards End ’ ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2709"><said who="#Margaret">“ How do you know you 'll pass out of their lives ? We have thought that twice before . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2710"><said who="#Helen">“ Because my plans — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2711"><said who="#Margaret">“ — which you change in a moment . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2712"><said who="#Helen">“ Then because my life is great and theirs are little , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, taking fire .<said who="#Helen">“ I know of things they can n't know of , and so do you . We know that there 's poetry . We know that there 's death . They can only take them on hearsay . We know this is our house , because it feels ours . Oh , they may take the title-deeds and the door-keys , but for this one night we are at home . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2713"><said who="#Margaret">“ It would be lovely to have you once more alone , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ It may be a chance in a thousand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2714"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , and we could talk . ”</said>She dropped her voice .<said who="#Helen">“ It wo n't be a very glorious story . But under that wych-elm — honestly , I see little happiness ahead . Cannot I have this one night with you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2715"><said who="#Margaret">“ I need n't say how much it would mean to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2716"><said who="#Helen">“ Then let us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2717"><said who="#Margaret">“ It is no good hesitating . Shall I drive down to Hilton now and get leave ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2718"><said who="#Helen">“ Oh , we do n't want leave . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2719">But<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was a loyal wife . In spite of imagination and poetry — perhaps on account of them — she could sympathise with the technical attitude that<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>would adopt . If possible , she would be technical , too . A night 's lodging — and they demanded no more — need not involve the discussion of general principles .</p>
    <p n="2720"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>may say no , ”</said>grumbled<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2721"><said who="#Henry">“ We sha n't consult him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2722"><said who="#Helen">“ Go if you like ; I should have stopped without leave . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2723">It was the touch of selfishness , which was not enough to mar<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s character , and even added to its beauty . She would have stopped without leave and escaped to Germany the next morning .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>kissed her .</p>
    <p n="2724"><said who="#Margaret">“ Expect me back before dark . I am looking forward to it so much . It is like you to have thought of such a beautiful thing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2725"><said who="#Helen">“ Not a thing , only an ending , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>rather sadly ; and the sense of tragedy closed in on<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>again as soon as she left the house .</p>
    <p n="2726">She was afraid of<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>. It is disquieting to fulfil a prophecy , however superficially . She was glad to see no watching figure as she drove past the farm , but only little<persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>, turning somersaults in the straw .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="38">
    <p n="2727">The tragedy began quietly enough , and , like many another talk , by the man 's deft assertion of his superiority .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>heard her arguing with the driver , stepped out and settled the fellow , who was inclined to be rude , and then led the way to some chairs on the lawn .<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, who had not been “ told , ” ran out with offers of tea . He refused them , and ordered them to wheel baby 's perambulator away , as they desired to be alone .</p>
    <p n="2728"><said who="#Dolly">“ But the diddums can n't listen ; he is n't nine months old , ”</said>she pleaded .</p>
    <p n="2729"><said who="#Henry">“ That 's not what I was saying , ”</said>retorted her father-in-law .</p>
    <p n="2730">Baby was wheeled out of earshot , and did not hear about the crisis till later years . It was now the turn of<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2731"><said who="#Margaret">“ Is it what we feared ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="2732"><said who="#Dolly">“ It is . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2733"><said who="#Margaret">“ Dear girl , ”</said>he began ,<said who="#Margaret">“ there is a troublesome business ahead of us , and nothing but the most absolute honesty and plain speech will see us through . ”</said><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>bent her head .<said who="#Margaret">“ I am obliged to question you on subjects we 'd both prefer to leave untouched . As you know , I am not one of your Bernard Shaws who consider nothing sacred . To speak as I must will pain me , but there are occasions — We are husband and wife , not children . I am a man of the world , and you are a most exceptional woman . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2734">All<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s senses forsook her . She blushed , and looked past him at the Six Hills , covered with spring herbage . Noting her colour , he grew still more kind .</p>
    <p n="2735"><said who="#Margaret">“ I see that you feel as I felt when — My poor little wife ! Oh , be brave ! Just one or two questions , and I have done with you . Was your sister wearing a wedding-ring ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2736"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>stammered a “ No . ”</p>
    <p n="2737">There was an appalling silence .</p>
    <p n="2738"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, I really came to ask a favour about Howards End . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2739"><said who="#Henry">“ One point at a time . I am now obliged to ask for the name of her seducer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2740">She rose to her feet and held the chair between them . Her colour had ebbed , and she was grey . It did not displease him that she should receive his question thus .</p>
    <p n="2741"><said who="#Margaret">“ Take your time , ”</said>he counselled her .<said who="#Margaret">“ Remember that this is far worse for me than for you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2742">She swayed ; he feared she was going to faint . Then speech came , and she said slowly :<said who="#Dolly">“ Seducer ? No ; I do not know her seducer 's name . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2743"><said who="#Margaret">“ Would she not tell you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2744"><said who="#Margaret">“ I never even asked her who seduced her , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, dwelling on the hateful word thoughtfully .</p>
    <p n="2745"><said who="#Dolly">“ That is singular . ”</said>Then he changed his mind .<said who="#Dolly">“ Natural perhaps , dear girl , that you should n't ask . But until his name is known , nothing can be done . Sit down . How terrible it is to see you so upset ! I knew you were n't fit for it . I wish I had n't taken you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2746"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>answered ,<said who="#Margaret">“ I like to stand , if you do n't mind , for it gives me a pleasant view of the Six Hills . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2747"><said who="#Dolly">“ As you like . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2748"><said who="#Margaret">“ Have you anything else to ask me ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2749"><said who="#Henry">“ Next you must tell me whether you have gathered anything . I have often noticed your insight , dear . I only wish my own was as good . You may have guessed something , even though your sister said nothing . The slightest hint would help us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2750"><said who="#Margaret">“ Who is ‘ we ’ ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2751"><said who="#Henry">“ I thought it best to ring up<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2752"><said who="#Margaret">“ That was unnecessary , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, growing warmer .<said who="#Margaret">“ This news will give<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>disproportionate pain . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2753"><said who="#Dolly">“ He has at once gone to call on your brother . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2754"><said who="#Margaret">“ That too was unnecessary . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2755"><said who="#Dolly">“ Let me explain , dear , how the matter stands . You do n't think that I and my son are other than gentlemen ? It is in<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s interests that we are acting . It is still not too late to save her name . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2756">Then<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>hit out for the first time .<said who="#Margaret">“ Are we to make her seducer marry her ? ”</said>she asked .</p>
    <p n="2757"><said who="#Dolly">“ If possible , yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2758"><said who="#Margaret">“ But ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, suppose he turned out to be married already ? One has heard of such cases . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2759"><said who="#Henry">“ In that case he must pay heavily for his misconduct , and be thrashed within an inch of his life . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2760">So her first blow missed . She was thankful of it . What had tempted her to imperil both of their lives .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>'s obtuseness had saved her as well as himself . Exhausted with anger , she sat down again , blinking at him as he told her as much as he thought fit . At last she said :<said who="#Margaret">“ May I ask you my question now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2761"><said who="#Henry">“ Certainly , my dear . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2762"><said who="#Margaret">“ To-morrow<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>goes to Munich — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2763"><said who="#Henry">“ Well , possibly she is right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2764"><said who="#Margaret">“<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, let a lady finish . To-morrow she goes ; to-night , with your permission , she would like to sleep at Howards End . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2765">It was the crisis of his life . Again she would have recalled the words as soon as they were uttered . She had not led up to them with sufficient care . She longed to warn him that they were far more important than he supposed . She saw him weighing them , as if they were a business proposition .</p>
    <p n="2766"><said who="#Henry">“ Why Howards End ? ”</said>he said at last .<said who="#Henry">“ Would she not be more comfortable , as I suggested , at the hotel ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2767"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>hastened to give him reasons .<said who="#Margaret">“ It is an odd request , but you know what<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>is and what women in her state are . ”</said>He frowned , and moved irritably .<said who="#Margaret">“ She has the idea that one night in your house would give her pleasure and do her good . I think she 's right . Being one of those imaginative girls , the presence of all our books and furniture soothes her . This is a fact . It is the end of her girlhood . Her last words to me were , ‘ A beautiful ending . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="2768"><said who="#Henry">“ She values the old furniture for sentimental reasons , in fact . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2769"><said who="#Margaret">“ Exactly . You have quite understood . It is her last hope of being with it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2770"><said who="#Henry">“ I do n't agree there , my dear !<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>will have her share of the goods wherever she goes — possibly more than her share , for you are so fond of her that you 'd give her anything of yours that she fancies , would n't you ? and I 'd raise no objection . I could understand it if it was her old home , because a home , or a house , ”</said>he changed the word , designedly ; he had thought of a telling point —<said who="#Henry">“ because a house in which one has once lived becomes in a sort of way sacred , I do n't know why . Associations and so on . Now<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>has no associations with Howards End , though I and<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>have . I do not see why she wants to stay the night there . She will only catch cold . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2771"><said who="#Margaret">“ Leave it that you do n't see , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Call it fancy . But realise that fancy is a scientific fact .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>is fanciful , and wants to . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2772">Then he surprised her — a rare occurrence . He shot an unexpected bolt .<said who="#Henry">“ If she wants to sleep one night she may want to sleep two . We shall never get her out of the house , perhaps . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2773"><said who="#Margaret">“ Well ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, with the precipice in sight .<said who="#Margaret">“ And suppose we do n't get her out of the house ? Would it matter ? She would do no one any harm . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2774">Again the irritated gesture .</p>
    <p n="2775"><said who="#Margaret">“ No ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, ”</said>she panted , receding .<said who="#Margaret">“ I did n't mean that . We will only trouble Howards End for this one night . I take her to London to-morrow — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2776"><said who="#Henry">“ Do you intend to sleep in a damp house , too ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2777"><said who="#Margaret">“ She cannot be left alone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2778"><said who="#Henry">“ That 's quite impossible ! Madness . You must be here to meet<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2779"><said who="#Margaret">“ I have already told you that your message to<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>was unnecessary , and I have no desire to meet him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2780"><said who="#Henry">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>— my<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2781"><said who="#Margaret">“ What has this business to do with<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>? If it concerns me little , it concerns you less , and<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>not at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2782"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ As the future owner of Howards End , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>arching his fingers ,<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I should say that it did concern<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2783"><said who="#Margaret">“ In what way ? Will<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s condition depreciate the property ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2784"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ My dear , you are forgetting yourself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2785"><said who="#Margaret">“ I think you yourself recommended plain speaking . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2786">They looked at each other in amazement . The precipice was at their feet now .</p>
    <p n="2787"><said who="#Henry">“<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>commands my sympathy , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.<said who="#Henry">“ As your husband , I shall do all for her that I can , and I have no doubt that she will prove more sinned against than sinning . But I cannot treat her as if nothing has happened . I should be false to my position in society if I did . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2788">She controlled herself for the last time .<said who="#Henry">“ No , let us go back to<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s request , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Henry">“ It is unreasonable , but the request of an unhappy girl . Tomorrow she will go to Germany , and trouble society no longer . To-night she asks to sleep in your empty house — a house which you do not care about , and which you have not occupied for over a year . May she ? Will you give my sister leave ? Will you forgive her as you hope to be forgiven , and as you have actually been forgiven ? Forgive her for one night only . That will be enough . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2789"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ As I have actually been forgiven —? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2790"><said who="#Margaret">“ Never mind for the moment what I mean by that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Answer my question . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2791">Perhaps some hint of her meaning did dawn on him . If so , he blotted it out . Straight from his fortress he answered :<said who="#Henry">“ I seem rather unaccommodating , but I have some experience of life , and know how one thing leads to another . I am afraid that your sister had better sleep at the hotel . I have my children and the memory of my dear wife to consider . I am sorry , but see that she leaves my house at once . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2792"><said who="#Margaret">“ You have mentioned<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2793"><said who="#Henry">“ I beg your pardon ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2794"><said who="#Margaret">“ A rare occurrence . In reply , may I mention<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2795"><said who="#Henry">“ You have not been yourself all day , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, and rose from his seat with face unmoved .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>rushed at him and seized both his hands . She was transfigured .</p>
    <p n="2796"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not any more of this ! ”</said>she cried .<said who="#Margaret">“ You shall see the connection if it kills you ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>! You have had a mistress — I forgave you . My sister has a lover — you drive her from the house . Do you see the connection ? Stupid , hypocritical , cruel — oh , contemptible !— a man who insults his wife when she 's alive and cants with her memory when she 's dead . A man who ruins a woman for his pleasure , and casts her off to ruin other men . And gives bad financial advice , and then says he is not responsible . These men are you . You can n't recognise them , because you cannot connect . I 've had enough of your unneeded kindness . I 've spoilt you long enough . All your life you have been spoiled .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>spoiled you . No one has ever told what you are — muddled , criminally muddled . Men like you use repentance as a blind , so do n't repent . Only say to yourself , ‘ What<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>has done , I 've done . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="2797"><said who="#Henry">“ The two cases are different , ”</said><persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>stammered . His real retort was not quite ready . His brain was still in a whirl , and he wanted a little longer .</p>
    <p n="2798"><said who="#Margaret">“ In what way different ? You have betrayed<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>only herself . You remain in society ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>can n't . You have had only pleasure , she may die . You have the insolence to talk to me of differences ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2799">Oh , the uselessness of it !<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>'s retort came .</p>
    <p n="2800"><said who="#Henry">“ I perceive you are attempting blackmail . It is scarcely a pretty weapon for a wife to use against her husband . My rule through life has been never to pay the least attention to threats , and I can only repeat what I said before : I do not give you and your sister leave to sleep at Howards End . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2801"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>loosed his hands . He went into the house , wiping first one and then the other on his handkerchief . For a little she stood looking at the Six Hills , tombs of warriors , breasts of the spring . Then she passed out into what was now the evening .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="39">
    <p n="2802"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>met at Ducie Street , where the latter was staying . Their interview was short and absurd . They had nothing in common but the English language , and tried by its help to express what neither of them understood .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>saw in<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>the family foe . He had singled her out as the most dangerous of the Schlegels , and , angry as he was , looked forward to telling his wife how right he had been . His mind was made up at once ; the girl must be got out of the way before she disgraced them farther . If occasion offered she might be married to a villain , or , possibly , to a fool . But this was a concession to morality , it formed no part of his main scheme . Honest and hearty was<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s dislike , and the past spread itself out very clearly before him ; hatred is a skilful compositor . As if they were heads in a note-book , he ran through all the incidents of the Schlegels ’ campaign : the attempt to compromise his brother , his mother 's legacy , his father 's marriage , the introduction of the furniture , the unpacking of the same . He had not yet heard of the request to sleep at Howards End ; that was to be their master-stroke and the opportunity for his . But he already felt that Howards End was the objective , and , though he disliked the house , was determined to defend it .</p>
    <p n="2803"><persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>, on the other hand , had no opinions . He stood above the conventions : his sister had a right to do what she thought right . It is not difficult to stand above the conventions when we leave no hostages among them ; men can always be more unconventional than women , and a bachelor of independent means need encounter no difficulties at all . Unlike<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>,<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>had money enough ; his ancestors had earned it for him , and if he shocked the people in one set of lodgings he had only to move into another . His was the leisure without sympathy — an attitude as fatal as the strenuous ; a little cold culture may be raised on it , but no art . His sisters had seen the family danger , and had never forgotten to discount the gold islets that raised them from the sea .<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>gave all the praise to himself , and so despised the struggling and the submerged .</p>
    <p n="2804">Hence the absurdity of the interview ; the gulf between them was economic as well as spiritual . But several facts passed ;<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>pressed for them with an impertinence that the undergraduate could not withstand . On what date had<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>gone abroad ? To whom ? (<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>was anxious to fasten the scandal on Germany . ) Then , changing his tactics , he said roughly :<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I suppose you realise that you are your sister 's protector ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2805"><said who="#Helen">“ In what sense ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2806"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ If a man played about with my sister , I 'd send a bullet through him , but perhaps you do n't mind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2807"><said who="#Tibby">“ I mind very much , ”</said>protested<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2808"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Who d'ye suspect , then ? Speak out man . One always suspects some one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2809"><said who="#Tibby">“ No one . I do n't think so . ”</said>Involuntarily he blushed . He had remembered the scene in his Oxford rooms .</p>
    <p n="2810"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ You are hiding something , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. As interviews go , he got the best of this one .<said who="#Tibby">“ When you saw her last , did she mention any one 's name ? Yes or no ! ”</said>he thundered , so that<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>started .</p>
    <p n="2811"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ In my rooms she mentioned some friends , called the Basts . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2812"><said who="#Tibby">“ Who are the Basts ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2813"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ People — friends of hers at<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s wedding . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2814"><said who="#Tibby">“ I do n't remember . But , by great Scott , I do ! My aunt told me about some rag-tsag . Was she full of them when you saw her ? Is there a man ? Did she speak of the man ? Or — look here — have you had any dealings with him ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2815"><persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was silent . Without intending it , he had betrayed his sister 's confidence ; he was not enough interested in human life to see where things will lead to . He had a strong regard for honesty , and his word , once given , had always been kept up to now . He was deeply vexed , not only for the harm he had done<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, but for the flaw he had discovered in his own equipment .</p>
    <p n="2816"><said who="#Helen">“ I see — you are in his confidence . They met at your rooms . Oh , what a family , what a family ! God help the poor pater — s . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2817">And<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>found himself alone .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="40">
    <p n="2818"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>— he would figure at length in a newspaper report , but that evening he did not count for much . The foot of the tree was in shadow , since the moon was still hidden behind the house . But above , to right , to left , down the long meadow the moonlight was streaming .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>seemed not a man , but a cause .</p>
    <p n="2819">Perhaps it was<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s way of falling in love — a curious way to<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, whose agony and whose contempt of<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>were yet imprinted with his image .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>forgot people . They were husks that had enclosed her emotion . She could pity , or sacrifice herself , or have instincts , but had she ever loved in the noblest way , where man and woman , having lost themselves in sex , desire to lose sex itself in comradeship ?</p>
    <p n="2820"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>wondered , but said no word of blame . This was<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s evening . Troubles enough lay ahead of her — the loss of friends and of social advantages , the agony , the supreme agony , of motherhood , which is not even yet a matter of common knowledge . For the present let the moon shine brightly and the breezes of the spring blow gently , dying away from the gale of the day , and let the earth , that brings increase , bring peace . Not even to herself dare she blame<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2821">She could not assess her trespass by any moral code ; it was everything or nothing . Morality can tell us that murder is worse than stealing , and group most sins in an order all must approve , but it cannot group<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. The surer its pronouncements on this point , the surer may we be that morality is not speaking . Christ was evasive when they questioned Him . It is those that cannot connect who hasten to cast the first stone .</p>
    <p n="2822">This was<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s evening — won at what cost , and not to be marred by the sorrows of others . Of her own tragedy<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>never uttered a word .</p>
    <p n="2823"><said who="#Helen">“ One isolates , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>slowly .<said who="#Helen">“ I isolated<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>from the other forces that were pulling<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>downhill . Consequently , I was full of pity , and almost of revenge . For weeks I had blamed<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>only , and so , when your letters came — ”</said></p>
    <p n="2824"><said who="#Margaret">“ I need never have written them , ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ They never shielded<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>. How hopeless it is to tidy away the past , even for others ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2825"><said who="#Helen">“ I did not know that it was your own idea to dismiss the Basts . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2826"><said who="#Margaret">“ Looking back , that was wrong of me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2827"><said who="#Helen">“ Looking back , darling , I know that it was right . It is right to save the man whom one loves . I am less enthusiastic about justice now . But we both thought you wrote at his dictation . It seemed the last touch of his callousness . Being very much wrought up by this time — and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>was upstairs . I had not seen her , and had talked for a long time to<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>— I had snubbed him for no reason , and that should have warned me I was in danger . So when the notes came I wanted us to go to you for an explanation . He said that he guessed the explanation — he knew of it , and you must n't know . I pressed him to tell me . He said no one must know ; it was something to do with his wife . Right up to the end we were<persName corresp="#Mr._Bast">Mr. Bast</persName>and<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>. I was going to tell him that he must be frank with me when I saw his eyes , and guessed that<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>had ruined him in two ways , not one . I drew him to me . I made him tell me . I felt very lonely myself . He is not to blame . He would have gone on worshipping me . I want never to see him again , though it sounds appalling . I wanted to give him money and feel finished . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, the little that is known about these things ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2828">She laid her face against the tree .</p>
    <p n="2829"><said who="#Margaret">“ The little , too , that is known about growth ! Both times it was loneliness , and the night , and panic afterwards . Did<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>grow out of<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2830"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>did not speak for a moment . So tired was she that her attention had actually wandered to the teeth — the teeth that had been thrust into the tree 's bark to medicate it . From where she sat she could see them gleam . She had been trying to count them .<said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>is a better growth than madness , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Helen">“ I was afraid that you would react against<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>until you went over the verge . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2831"><said>“ I did react until I found poor<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>. I am steady now . I sha n't ever like your<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, dearest<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, or even speak kindly about him , but all that blinding hate is over . I shall never rave against<persName corresp="#Wilcoxes">Wilcoxes</persName>any more . I understand how you married him , and you will now be very happy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2832"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>did not reply .</p>
    <p n="2833"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, her voice growing more tender ,<said who="#Helen">“ I do at last understand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2834"><said who="#Margaret">“ Except<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, dearest , no one understands our little movements . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2835"><said who="#Helen">“ Because in death — I agree . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2836"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not quite . I feel that you and I and<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>are only fragments of that woman 's mind . She knows everything . She is everything . She is the house , and the tree that leans over it . People have their own deaths as well as their own lives , and even if there is nothing beyond death , we shall differ in our nothingness . I cannot believe that knowledge such as hers will perish with knowledge such as mine . She knew about realities . She knew when people were in love , though she was not in the room . I do n't doubt that she knew when<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>deceived her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2837"><said who="#Helen">“ Good-night ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, ”</said>called a voice .</p>
    <p n="2838"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Oh , good-night ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2839"><said who="#Helen">“ Why should<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>work for us ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>murmured .</p>
    <p n="2840"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Why , indeed ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2841"><persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>crossed the lawn and merged into the hedge that divided it from the farm . An old gap , which<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>had filled up , had reappeared , and her track through the dew followed the path that he had turfed over , when he improved the garden and made it possible for games .</p>
    <p n="2842"><said who="#Helen">“ This is not quite our house yet , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ When<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>called , I felt we are only a couple of tourists . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2843"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ We shall be that everywhere , and for ever . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2844"><said who="#Helen">“ But affectionate tourists . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2845"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ But tourists who pretend each hotel is their home . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2846"><said who="#Helen">“ I can n't pretend very long , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ Sitting under this tree one forgets , but I know that to-morrow I shall see the moon rise out of Germany . Not all your goodness can alter the facts of the case . Unless you will come with me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2847"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>thought for a moment . In the past year she had grown so fond of England that to leave it was a real grief . Yet what detained her ? No doubt<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>would pardon her outburst , and go on blustering and muddling into a ripe old age . But what was the good ? She had just as soon vanish from his mind .</p>
    <p n="2848"><said who="#Henry">“ Are you serious in asking me ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>? Should I get on with your<persName corresp="#Monica">Monica</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2849"><said who="#Helen">“ You would not , but I am serious in asking you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2850"><said who="#Henry">“ Still , no more plans now . And no more reminiscences . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2851">They were silent for a little . It was<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s evening .</p>
    <p n="2852">The present flowed by them like a stream . The tree rustled . It had made music before they were born , and would continue after their deaths , but its song was of the moment . The moment had passed . The tree rustled again . Their senses were sharpened , and they seemed to apprehend life . Life passed . The tree rustled again .</p>
    <p n="2853"><said who="#Margaret">“ Sleep now , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2854">The peace of the country was entering into her . It has no commerce with memory , and little with hope . Least of all is it concerned with the hopes of the next five minutes . It is the peace of the present , which passes understanding . Its murmur came “ now , ” and “ now ” once more as they trod the gravel , and “ now , ” as the moonlight fell upon their father 's sword . They passed upstairs , kissed , and amidst the endless iterations fell asleep . The house had enshadowed the tree at first , but as the moon rose higher the two disentangled , and were clear fur a few moments at midnight .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>awoke and looked into the garden . How incomprehensible that<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard Bast</persName>should have won her this night of peace ! Was he also part of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>'s mind ?</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="41">
    <p n="2855">Far different was<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>'s development . The months after<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>, whatever minor troubles they might bring him , were all overshadowed by Remorse . When<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>looked back she could philosophise , or she could look into the future and plan for her child . But the father saw nothing beyond his own sin . Weeks afterwards , in the midst of other occupations , he would suddenly cry out ,<said who="#Jacky">“ Brute — you brute , I could n't have — ”</said>and be rent into two people who held dialogues . Or brown rain would descend , blotting out faces and the sky . Even<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>noticed the change in him . Most terrible were his sufferings when he awoke from sleep . Sometimes he was happy at first , but grew conscious of a burden hanging to him and weighing down his thoughts when they would move . Or little irons scorched his body . Or a sword stabbed him . He would sit at the edge of his bed , holding his heart and moaning ,<said who="#Jacky">“ Oh what SHALL I do , whatever SHALL I do ? ”</said>Nothing brought ease . He could put distance between him and the trespass , but it grew in his soul .</p>
    <p n="2856">Remorse is not among the eternal verities . The Greeks were right to dethrone her . Her action is too capricious , as though the Erinyes selected for punishment only certain men and certain sins . And of all means to regeneration Remorse is surely the most wasteful . It cuts away healthy tissues with the poisoned . It is a knife that probes far deeper than the evil .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>was driven straight through its torments and emerged pure , but enfeebled — a better man , who would never lose control of himself again , but also a smaller man , who had less to control . Nor did purity mean peace . The use of the knife can become a habit as hard to shake off as passion itself , and<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>continued to start with a cry out of dreams .</p>
    <p n="2857">He built up a situation that was far enough from the truth . It never occurred to him that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was to blame . He forgot the intensity of their talk , the charm that had been lent him by sincerity , the magic of<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>under darkness and of the whispering river .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>loved the absolute .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>had been ruined absolutely , and had appeared to her as a man apart , isolated from the world . A real man , who cared for adventure and beauty , who desired to live decently and pay his way , who could have travelled more gloriously through life than the juggernaut car that was crushing him . Memories of<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s wedding had warped her , the starched servants , the yards of uneaten food , the rustle of overdressed women , motor-cars oozing grease on the gravel , a pretentious band . She had tasted the lees of this on her arrival ; in the darkness , after failure , they intoxicated her . She and the victim seemed alone in a world of unreality , and she loved him absolutely , perhaps for half an hour .</p>
    <p n="2858">In the morning she was gone . The note that she left , tender and hysterical in tone , and intended to be most kind , hurt her lover terribly . It was as if some work of art had been broken by him , some picture in the National Gallery slashed out of its frame . When he recalled her talents and her social position , he felt that the first passer-by had a right to shoot him down . He was afraid of the waitress and the porters at the railway-station . He was afraid at first of his wife , though later he was to regard her with a strange new tenderness , and to think ,<said who="#Evie">“ There is nothing to choose between us , after all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2859">The expedition to Shropshire crippled the Basts permanently .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>in her flight forgot to settle the hotel bill , and took their return tickets away with her ; they had to pawn<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>'s bangles to get home , and the smash came a few days afterwards . It is true that<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>offered him five thousand pounds , but such a sum meant nothing to him . He could not see that the girl was desperately righting herself , and trying to save something out of the disaster , if it was only five thousand pounds . But he had to live somehow . He turned to his family , and degraded himself to a professional beggar . There was nothing else for him to do .</p>
    <p n="2860"><said who="#Helen">“ A letter from<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, ”</said>thought Blanche , his sister ;<said who="#Helen">“ and after all this time . ”</said>She hid it , so that her husband should not see , and when he had gone to his work read it with some emotion , and sent the prodigal a little money out of her dress allowance .</p>
    <p n="2861"><said who="#Jacky">“ A letter from<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>! ”</said>said the other sister , Laura , a few days later . She showed it to her husband . He wrote a cruel , insolent reply , but sent more money than Blanche , so<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>soon wrote to him again .</p>
    <p n="2862">And during the winter the system was developed .</p>
    <p n="2863"><persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>realised that they need never starve , because it would be too painful for his relatives .<persName>Society</persName>is based on the family , and the clever wastrel can exploit this indefinitely . Without a generous thought on either side , pounds and pounds passed . The donors disliked<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, and he grew to hate them intensely . When Laura censured his immoral marriage , he thought bitterly ,<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ She minds that ! What would she say if she knew the truth ? ”</said>When Blanche 's husband offered him work , he found some pretext for avoiding it . He had wanted work keenly at<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>, but too much anxiety had shattered him , he was joining the unemployable . When his brother , the lay-reader , did not reply to a letter , he wrote again , saying that he and<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>would come down to his village on foot . He did not intend this as blackmail . Still the brother sent a postal order , and it became part of the system . And so passed his winter and his spring .</p>
    <p n="2864">In the horror there are two bright spots . He never confused the past . He remained alive , and blessed are those who live , if it is only to a sense of sinfulness . The anodyne of muddledom , by which most men blur and blend their mistakes , never passed<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>'s lips —</p>
    <p n="2865"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ And if I drink oblivion of a day , So shorten I the stature of my soul . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2866">It is a hard saying , and a hard man wrote it , but it lies at the root of all character .</p>
    <p n="2867">And the other bright spot was his tenderness for<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>. He pitied her with nobility now — not the contemptuous pity of a man who sticks to a woman through thick and thin . He tried to be less irritable . He wondered what her hungry eyes desired — nothing that she could express , or that he or any man could give her . Would she ever receive the justice that is mercy — the justice for by-products that the world is too busy to bestow ? She was fond of flowers , generous with money , and not revengeful . If she had borne him a child he might have cared for her . Unmarried ,<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>would never have begged ; he would have flickered out and died . But the whole of life is mixed . He had to provide for<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>, and went down dirty paths that she might have a few feathers and the dishes of food that suited her .</p>
    <p n="2868">One day he caught sight of<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and her brother . He was in<persName>St. Paul</persName>'s . He had entered the cathedral partly to avoid the rain and partly to see a picture that had educated him in former years . But the light was bad , the picture ill placed , and Time and judgment were inside him now .<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>alone still charmed him , with her lap of poppies , on which all men shall sleep . He took one glance , and turned aimlessly away towards a chair . Then down the nave he saw<persName corresp="#Miss_Schlegel">Miss Schlegel</persName>and her brother . They stood in the fairway of passengers , and their faces were extremely grave . He was perfectly certain that they were in trouble about their sister .</p>
    <p n="2869">Once outside — and he fled immediately — he wished that he had spoken to them . What was his life ? What were a few angry words , or even imprisonment ? He had done wrong — that was the true terror . Whatever they might know , he would tell them everything he knew . He re-entered<persName>St. Paul</persName>'s . But they had moved in his absence , and had gone to lay their difficulties before<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>and<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2870">The sight of<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>turned remorse into new channels . He desired to confess , and though the desire is proof of a weakened nature , which is about to lose the essence of human intercourse , it did not take an ignoble form . He did not suppose that confession would bring him happiness . It was rather that he yearned to get clear of the tangle . So does the suicide yearn . The impulses are akin , and the crime of suicide lies rather in its disregard for the feelings of those whom we leave behind . Confession need harm no one — it can satisfy that test — and though it was un-English , and ignored by our Anglican cathedral ,<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>had a right to decide upon it .</p>
    <p n="2871">Moreover , he trusted<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. He wanted her hardness now . That cold , intellectual nature of hers would be just , if unkind . He would do whatever she told him , even if he had to see<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. That was the supreme punishment she would exact . And perhaps she would tell him how<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was . That was the supreme reward .</p>
    <p n="2872">He knew nothing about<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, not even whether she was married to<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, and tracking her out took several days . That evening he toiled through the wet to Wickham Place , where the new flats were now appearing . Was he also the cause of their move ? Were they expelled from society on his account ? Thence to a public library , but could find no satisfactory<persName corresp="#Schlegel">Schlegel</persName>in the directory . On the morrow he searched again . He hung about outside<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>'s office at lunch time , and , as the clerks came out said ,<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Excuse me , sir , but is your boss married ? ”</said>Most of them stared , some said ,<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ What 's that to you ? ”</said>but one , who had not yet acquired reticence , told him what he wished .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>could not learn the private address . That necessitated more trouble with directories and tubes . Ducie Street was not discovered till the Monday , the day that<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>and her husband went down on their hunting expedition to Howards End .</p>
    <p n="2873">He called at about four o'clock . The weather had changed , and the sun shone gaily on the ornamental steps — black and white marble in triangles .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>lowered his eyes to them after ringing the bell . He felt in curious health ; doors seemed to be opening and shutting inside his body , and he had been obliged to sleep sitting up in bed , with his back propped against the wall . When the parlourmaid came he could not see her face ; the brown rain had descended suddenly .</p>
    <p n="2874"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Does<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>live here ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="2875"><said who="#Margaret">“ She 's out , ”</said>was the answer .</p>
    <p n="2876"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ When will she be back ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2877"><said who="#the_parlourmaid">“ I 'll ask , ”</said>said the parlourmaid .</p>
    <p n="2878"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had given instructions that no one who mentioned her name should ever be rebuffed . Putting the door on the chain — for<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>'s appearance demanded this — she went through to the smoking-room , which was occupied by<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>.<persName corresp="#Tibby">Tibby</persName>was asleep . He had had a good lunch .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles Wilcox</persName>had not yet rung him up for the distracting interview . He said drowsily :<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I do n't know . Hilton . Howards End . Who is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2879"><said who="#the_parlourmaid">“ I 'll ask , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2880"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ No , do n't bother . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2881"><said who="#the_parlourmaid">“ They have taken the car to Howards End , ”</said>said the parlourmaid to<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2882">He thanked her , and asked whereabouts that place was .</p>
    <p n="2883"><said who="#Margaret">“ You appear to want to know a good deal , ”</said>she remarked . But<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had forbidden her to be mysterious . She told him against her better judgment that Howards End was in Hertfordshire .</p>
    <p n="2884"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Is it a village , please ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2885"><said who="#Margaret">“ Village ! It 's<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>'s private house — at least , it 's one of them .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>keeps her furniture there . Hilton is the village . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2886"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Yes . And when will they be back ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2887"><said who="#Margaret">“ Mr.<persName corresp="#Schlegel">Schlegel</persName>does n't know . We can n't know everything , can we ? ”</said>She shut him out , and went to attend to the telephone , which was ringing furiously .</p>
    <p n="2888">He loitered away another night of agony . Confession grew more difficult . As soon as possible he went to bed . He watched a patch of moonlight cross the floor of their lodging , and , as sometimes happens when the mind is overtaxed , he fell asleep for the rest of the room , but kept awake for the patch of moonlight . Horrible ! Then began one of those disintegrating dialogues . Part of him said :<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Why horrible ? It 's ordinary light from the moon . ”</said><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ But it moves . ”</said><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ So does the moon . ”</said><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ But it is a clenched fist . ”</said><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Why not ? ”</said><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ But it is going to touch me . ”</said><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Let it . ”</said>And , seeming to gather motion , the patch ran up his blanket . Presently a blue snake appeared ; then another parallel to it .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Is there life in the moon ? ”</said><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Of course . ”</said><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ But I thought it was uninhabited . ”</said><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Not by Time ,<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>, Judgment , and the smaller snakes . ”</said><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ Smaller snakes ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>indignantly and aloud .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ What a notion ! ”</said>By a rending effort of the will he woke the rest of the room up .<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>, the bed , their food , their clothes on the chair , gradually entered his consciousness , and the horror vanished outwards , like a ring that is spreading through water .</p>
    <p n="2889"><said who="#Death">“ I say ,<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>, I 'm going out for a bit . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2890">She was breathing regularly . The patch of light fell clear of the striped blanket , and began to cover the shawl that lay over her feet . Why had he been afraid ? He went to the window , and saw that the moon was descending through a clear sky . He saw her volcanoes , and the bright expanses that a gracious error has named seas . They paled , for the sun , who had lit them up , was coming to light the earth . Sea of Serenity , Sea of Tranquillity , Ocean of the Lunar Storms , merged into one lucent drop , itself to slip into the sempiternal dawn . And he had been afraid of the moon !</p>
    <p n="2891">He dressed among the contending lights , and went through his money . It was running low again , but enough for a return ticket to Hilton . As it clinked ,<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>opened her eyes .</p>
    <p n="2892"><said who="#Jacky">“ Hullo ,<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Len</persName>! What ho ,<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Len</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2893"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ What ho ,<persName corresp="#Jacky">Jacky</persName>! see you again later . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2894">She turned over and slept .</p>
    <p n="2895">The house was unlocked , their landlord being a salesman at Covent Garden .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>passed out and made his way down to the station . The train , though it did not start for an hour , was already drawn up at the end of the platform , and he lay down in it and slept . With the first jolt he was in daylight ; they had left the gateways of King 's Cross , and were under blue sky . Tunnels followed , and after each the sky grew bluer , and from the embankment at Finsbury Park he had his first sight of the sun . It rolled along behind the eastern smokes — a wheel , whose fellow was the descending moon — and as yet it seemed the servant of the blue sky , not its lord . He dozed again . Over Tewin Water it was day . To the left fell the shadow of the embankment and its arches ; to the right<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>saw up into the Tewin Woods and towards the church , with its wild legend of immortality . Six forest trees — that is a fact — grow out of one of the graves in Tewin churchyard . The grave 's occupant — that is the legend — is an atheist , who declared that if God existed , six forest trees would grow out of her grave . These things in Hertfordshire ; and farther afield lay the house of a hermit —<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>had known him — who barred himself up , and wrote prophecies , and gave all he had to the poor . While , powdered in between , were the villas of business men , who saw life more steadily , though with the steadiness of the half-closed eye . Over all the sun was streaming , to all the birds were singing , to all the primroses were yellow , and the speedwell blue , and the country , however they interpreted her , was uttering her cry of “ now . ” She did not free<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>yet , and the knife plunged deeper into his heart as the train drew up at Hilton . But remorse had become beautiful .</p>
    <p n="2896">Hilton was asleep , or at the earliest , breakfasting .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>noticed the contrast when he stepped out of it into the country . Here men had been up since dawn . Their hours were ruled , not by a London office , but by the movements of the crops and the sun . That they were men of the finest type only the sentimentalists can declare . But they kept to the life of daylight . They are England 's hope . Clumsily they carry forward the torch of the sun , until such time as the nation sees fit to take it up . Half clodhopper , half board-school prig , they can still throw back to a nobler stock , and breed yeomen .</p>
    <p n="2897">At the chalk pit a motor passed him . In it was another type , whom<persName corresp="#Nature">Nature</persName>favours — the Imperial . Healthy , ever in motion , it hopes to inherit the earth . It breeds as quickly as the yeoman , and as soundly ; strong is the temptation to acclaim it as a super-yeoman , who carries his country 's virtue overseas . But the Imperialist is not what he thinks or seems . He is a destroyer . He prepares the way for cosmopolitanism , and though his ambitions may be fulfilled , the earth that he inherits will be grey .</p>
    <p n="2898">To<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, intent on his private sin , there came the conviction of innate goodness elsewhere . It was not the optimism which he had been taught at school . Again and again must the drums tap , and the goblins stalk over the universe before joy can be purged of the superficial . It was rather paradoxical , and arose from his sorrow .<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>destroys a man , but the idea of death saves him — that is the best account of it that has yet been given . Squalor and tragedy can beckon to all that is great in us , and strengthen the wings of love . They can beckon ; it is not certain that they will , for they are not love 's servants . But they can beckon , and the knowledge of this incredible truth comforted him .</p>
    <p n="2899">As he approached the house all thought stopped . Contradictory notions stood side by side in his mind . He was terrified but happy , ashamed , but had done no sin . He knew the confession : “<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, I have done wrong , ” but sunrise had robbed its meaning , and he felt rather on a supreme adventure .</p>
    <p n="2900">He entered a garden , steadied himself against a motor-car that he found in it , found a door open and entered a house . Yes , it would be very easy . From a room to the left he heard voices ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s amongst them . His own name was called aloud , and a man whom he had never seen said ,<said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , is he there ? I am not surprised . I now thrash him within an inch of his life . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2901"><said who="#Leonard_Bast">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>,<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ I have done wrong . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2902">The man took him by the collar and cried ,<said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Bring me a stick . ”</said>Women were screaming . A stick , very bright , descended . It hurt him , not where it descended , but in the heart . Books fell over him in a shower . Nothing had sense .</p>
    <p n="2903"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Get some water , ”</said>commanded<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, who had all through kept very calm .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ He 's shamming . Of course I only used the blade . Here , carry him out into the air . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2904">Thinking that he understood these things ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>obeyed him . They laid<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>, who was dead , on the gravel ;<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>poured water over him .</p>
    <p n="2905"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ That 's enough , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2906"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ Yes , murder 's enough , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>, coming out of the house with the sword .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="42">
    <p n="2907">When<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>left Ducie Street he had caught the first train home , but had no inkling of the newest development until late at night . Then his father , who had dined alone , sent for him , and in very grave tones inquired for<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2908">“ I do n't know where she is , pater ” said<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>.<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>kept back dinner nearly an hour for her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2909"><said who="#Margaret">“ Tell me when she comes in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2910">Another hour passed . The servants went to bed , and<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>visited his father again , to receive further instructions .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>had still not returned .</p>
    <p n="2911"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ I 'll sit up for her as late as you like , but she can hardly be coming . Is n't she stopping with her sister at the hotel ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2912"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Perhaps , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>thoughtfully —<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ perhaps . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2913"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Can I do anything for you , sir ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2914"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Not to-night , my boy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2915"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>liked being called sir . He raised his eyes , and gave his son more open a look of tenderness than he usually ventured . He saw<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>as little boy and strong man in one . Though his wife had proved unstable his children were left to him .</p>
    <p n="2916">After midnight he tapped on<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s door .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I can n't sleep , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I had better have a talk with you and get it over . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2917">He complained of the heat .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>took him out into the garden , and they paced up and down in their dressing-gowns .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>became very quiet as the story unrolled ; he had known all along that<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was as bad as her sister .</p>
    <p n="2918"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ She will feel differently in the morning , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, who had of course said nothing about<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bast">Mrs. Bast</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ But I cannot let this kind of thing continue without comment . I am morally certain that she is with her sister at Howards End . The house is mine — and ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, it will be yours — and when I say that no one is to live there , I mean that no one is to live there . I wo n't have it . ”</said>He looked angrily at the moon .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ To my mind this question is connected with something far greater , the rights of property itself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2919"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Undoubtedly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2920"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>linked his arm in his son 's , but somehow liked him less as he told him more .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I do n't want you to conclude that my wife and I had anything of the nature of a quarrel . She was only overwrought , as who would not be ? I shall do what I can for<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, but on the understanding that they clear out of the house at once . Do you see ? That is a sine qua non . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2921"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Then at eight to-morrow I may go up in the car ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2922"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Eight or earlier . Say that you are acting as my representative , and , of course , use no violence ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2923">On the morrow , as<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>returned , leaving<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>dead upon the gravel , it did not seem to him that he had used violence .<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>was due to heart disease . His stepmother herself had said so , and even<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>had acknowledged that he only used the flat of the sword . On his way through the village he informed the police , who thanked him , and said there must be an inquest . He found his father in the garden shading his eyes from the sun .</p>
    <p n="2924"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ It has been pretty horrible , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>gravely .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ They were there , and they had the man up there with them too . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2925"><said who="#Miss_Avery">“ What — what man ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2926"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I told you last night . His name was<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Bast</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="2927"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ My God ! is it possible ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ In your mother 's house !<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, in your mother 's house ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2928"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I know , pater . That was what I felt . As a matter of fact , there is no need to trouble about the man . He was in the last stages of heart disease , and just before I could show him what I thought of him he went off . The police are seeing about it at this moment . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2929"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>listened attentively .</p>
    <p n="2930"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I got up there — oh , it could n't have been more than half-past seven . The Avery woman was lighting a fire for them . They were still upstairs . I waited in the drawing-room . We were all moderately civil and collected , though I had my suspicions . I gave them your message , and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>said , ‘ Oh yes , I see ; yes , ’ in that way of hers . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2931"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Nothing else ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2932"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ I promised to tell you , ‘ with her love , ’ that she was going to Germany with her sister this evening . That was all we had time for . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2933"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>seemed relieved .</p>
    <p n="2934"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Because by then I suppose the man got tired of hiding , for suddenly<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>screamed out his name . I recognised it , and I went for him in the hall . Was I right , pater ? I thought things were going a little too far . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2935"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Right , my dear boy ? I do n't know . But you would have been no son of mine if you had n't . Then did he just — just — crumple up as you said ? ”</said>He shrunk from the simple word .</p>
    <p n="2936"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ He caught hold of the bookcase , which came down over him . So I merely put the sword down and carried him into the garden . We all thought he was shamming . However , he 's dead right enough . Awful business ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="2937"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Sword ? ”</said>cried his father , with anxiety in his voice .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ What sword ? Whose sword ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2938"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ A sword of theirs . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2939"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ What were you doing with it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2940"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Well , did n't you see , pater , I had to snatch up the first thing handy . I had n't a riding-whip or stick . I caught him once or twice over the shoulders with the flat of their old German sword . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2941"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Then what ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2942"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ He pulled over the bookcase , as I said , and fell , ”</said>aid<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, with a sigh . It was no fun doing errands for his father , who was never quite satisfied .</p>
    <p n="2943"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ But the real cause was heart disease ? Of that you 're sure ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2944"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ That or a fit . However , we shall hear more than enough at the inquest on such unsavoury topics . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2945">They went in to breakfast .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>had a racking headache , consequent on motoring before food . He was also anxious about the future , reflecting that the police must detain<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>for the inquest and ferret the whole thing out . He saw himself obliged to leave Hilton . One could not afford to live near the scene of a scandal — it was not fair on one 's wife . His comfort was that the pater 's eyes were opened at last . There would be a horrible smash-up , and probably a separation from<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>; then they would all start again , more as they had been in his mother 's time .</p>
    <p n="2946"><said who="#Margaret">“ I think I 'll go round to the police-station , ”</said>said his father when breakfast was over .</p>
    <p n="2947"><said who="#Dolly">“ What for ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, who had still not been “ told . ”</p>
    <p n="2948"><said who="#Margaret">“ Very well , sir . Which car will you have ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2949"><said who="#Dolly">“ I think I 'll walk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2950"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ It 's a good half-mile , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>, stepping into the garden .<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ The sun 's very hot for April . Sha n't I take you up , and then , perhaps , a little spin round by Tewin ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2951"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ You go on as if I did n't know my own mind , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>fretfully .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>hardened his mouth .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ You young fellows ’ one idea is to get into a motor . I tell you , I want to walk ; I 'm very fond of walking . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2952"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ Oh , all right ; I 'm about the house if you want me for anything . I thought of not going up to the office to-day , if that is your wish . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2953"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ It is , indeed , my boy , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>, and laid a hand on his sleeve .</p>
    <p n="2954"><persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>did not like it ; he was uneasy about his father , who did not seem himself this morning . There was a petulant touch about him — more like a woman . Could it be that he was growing old ? The Wilcoxes were not lacking in affection ; they had it royally , but they did not know how to use it . It was the talent in the napkin , and , for a warm-hearted man ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>had conveyed very little joy . As he watched his father shuffling up the road , he had a vague regret — a wish that something had been different somewhere — a wish ( though he did not express it thus ) that he had been taught to say “ I ” in his youth . He meant to make up for<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>'s defection , but knew that his father had been very happy with her until yesterday . How had she done it ? By some dishonest trick , no doubt — but how ?</p>
    <p n="2955"><persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>reappeared at eleven , looking very tired . There was to be an inquest on<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>'s body to-morrow , and the police required his son to attend .</p>
    <p n="2956"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I expected that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>.<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I shall naturally be the most important witness there . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="43">
    <p n="2957">Out of the turmoil and horror that had begun with<persName corresp="#Aunt_Juley">Aunt Juley</persName>'s illness and was not even to end with<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>'s death , it seemed impossible to<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>that healthy life should re-emerge . Events succeeded in a logical , yet senseless , train . People lost their humanity , and took values as arbitrary as those in a pack of playing-cards . It was natural that<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>should do this and cause<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>to do that , and then think her wrong for doing it ; natural that she herself should think him wrong ; natural that<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>should want to know how<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was , and come , and<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>be angry with him for coming — natural , but unreal . In this jangle of causes and effects what had become of their true selves ? Here<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>lay dead in the garden , from natural causes ; yet life was a deep , deep river , death a blue sky , life was a house , death a wisp of hay , a flower , a tower , life and death were anything and everything , except this ordered insanity , where the king takes the queen , and the ace the king . Ah , no ; there was beauty and adventure behind , such as the man at her feet had yearned for ; there was hope this side of the grave ; there were truer relationships beyond the limits that fetter us now . As a prisoner looks up and sees stars beckoning , so she , from the turmoil and horror of those days , caught glimpses of the diviner wheels .</p>
    <p n="2958">And<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, dumb with fright , but trying to keep calm for the child 's sake , and<persName corresp="#Miss_Avery">Miss Avery</persName>, calm , but murmuring tenderly , “ No one ever told the lad he 'll have a child ” — they also reminded her that horror is not the end . To what ultimate harmony we tend she did not know , but there seemed great chance that a child would be born into the world , to take the great chances of beauty and adventure that the world offers . She moved through the sunlit garden , gathering narcissi , crimson-eyed and white . There was nothing else to be done ; the time for telegrams and anger was over and it seemed wisest that the hands of<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>should be folded on his breast and be filled with flowers . Here was the father ; leave it at that . Let Squalor be turned into Tragedy , whose eyes are the stars , and whose hands hold the sunset and the dawn .</p>
    <p n="2959">And even the influx of officials , even the return of the doctor , vulgar and acute , could not shake her belief in the eternity of beauty . Science explained people , but could not understand them . After long centuries among the bones and muscles it might be advancing to knowledge of the nerves , but this would never give understanding . One could open the heart to Mr. Mansbridge and his sort without discovering its secrets to them , for they wanted everything down in black and white , and black and white was exactly what they were left with .</p>
    <p n="2960">They questioned her closely about<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. She never suspected why .<persName corresp="#Death">Death</persName>had come , and the doctor agreed that it was due to heart disease . They asked to see her father 's sword . She explained that<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s anger was natural , but mistaken . Miserable questions about<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>followed , all of which she answered unfalteringly . Then back to<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>again .<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ No doubt<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>may have induced death , ”</said>she said ;<said who="#Leonard_Bast">“ but if it was n't one thing it would have been another as you know . ”</said>At last they thanked her and took the sword and the body down to Hilton . She began to pick up the books from the floor .</p>
    <p n="2961"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>had gone to the farm . It was the best place for her , since she had to wait for the inquest . Though , as if things were not hard enough ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Madge</persName>and her husband had raised trouble ; they did not see why they should receive the offscourings of Howards End . And , of course , they were right . The whole world was going to be right , and amply avenge any brave talk against the conventions .<said who="#Margaret">“ Nothing matters , ”</said>the Schlegels had said in the past ,<said who="#Margaret">“ except one 's self-respect and that of one 's friends . ”</said>When the time came , other things mattered terribly . However ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Madge</persName>had yielded , and<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>was assured of peace for one day and night , and to-morrow she would return to Germany .</p>
    <p n="2962">As for herself , she determined to go too . No message came from<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>; perhaps he expected her to apologise . Now that she had time to think over her own tragedy , she was unrepentant . She neither forgave him for his behaviour nor wished to forgive him . Her speech to him seemed perfect . She would not have altered a word . It had to be uttered once in a life , to adjust the lopsidedness of the world . It was spoken not only to her husband , but to thousands of men like him — a protest against the inner darkness in high places that comes with a commercial age . Though he would build up his life without hers , she could not apologise . He had refused to connect , on the clearest issue that can be laid before a man , and their love must take the consequences .</p>
    <p n="2963">No , there was nothing more to be done . They had tried not to go over the precipice , but perhaps the fall was inevitable . And it comforted her to think that the future was certainly inevitable ; cause and effect would go jangling forward to some goal doubtless , but to none that she could imagine . At such moments the soul retires within , to float upon the bosom of a deeper stream , and has communion with the dead , and sees the world 's glory not diminished , but different in kind to what she has supposed . She alters her focus until trivial things are blurred .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>had been tending this way all the winter .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>'s death brought her to the goal . Alas ! that<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>should fade away as reality emerged , and only her love for him should remain clear , stamped with his image like the cameos we rescue out of dreams .</p>
    <p n="2964">With unfaltering eye she traced his future . He would soon present a healthy mind to the world again , and what did he or the world care if he was rotten at the core ? He would grow into a rich , jolly old man , at times a little sentimental about women , but emptying his glass with anyone . Tenacious of power , he would keep<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>and the rest dependent , and retire from business reluctantly and at an advanced age . He would settle down — though she could not realise this . In her eyes<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>was always moving and causing others to move , until the ends of the earth met . But in time he must get too tired to move , and settle down . What next ? The inevitable word . The release of the soul to its appropriate Heaven .</p>
    <p n="2965">Would they meet in it ?<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>believed in immortality for herself . An eternal future had always seemed natural to her . And<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>believed in it for himself . Yet , would they meet again ? Are there not rather endless levels beyond the grave , as the theory that he had censured teaches ? And his level , whether higher or lower , could it possibly be the same as hers ?</p>
    <p n="2966">Thus gravely meditating , she was summoned by him . He sent up<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>in the motor . Other servants passed like water , but the chauffeur remained , though impertinent and disloyal .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>disliked<persName corresp="#Crane">Crane</persName>, and he knew it .</p>
    <p n="2967"><said who="#Crane">“ Is it the keys that<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>wants ? ”</said>she asked .</p>
    <p n="2968"><said who="#Margaret">“ He did n't say , madam . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2969"><said who="#Crane">“ You have n't any note for me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2970"><said who="#Margaret">“ He did n't say , madam . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2971">After a moment 's thought she locked up Howards End . It was pitiable to see in it the stirrings of warmth that would be quenched for ever . She raked out the fire that was blazing in the kitchen , and spread the coals in the gravelled yard . She closed the windows and drew the curtains .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>would probably sell the place now .</p>
    <p n="2972">She was determined not to spare him , for nothing new had happened as far as they were concerned . Her mood might never have altered from yesterday evening . He was standing a little outside<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s gate , and motioned the car to stop . When his wife got out he said hoarsely :<said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ I prefer to discuss things with you outside . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2973"><said who="#Margaret">“ It will be more appropriate in the road , I am afraid , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ Did you get my message ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2974"><said who="#Charles_Wilcox">“ What about ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2975"><said who="#Margaret">“ I am going to Germany with my sister . I must tell you now that I shall make it my permanent home . Our talk last night was more important than you have realised . I am unable to forgive you and am leaving you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2976"><said who="#Henry">“ I am extremely tired , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, in injured tones .<said who="#Henry">“ I have been walking about all the morning , and wish to sit down . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2977"><said who="#Margaret">“ Certainly , if you will consent to sit on the grass . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2978">The Great North Road should have been bordered all its length with glebe .<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>'s kind had filched most of it . She moved to the scrap opposite , wherein were the Six Hills . They sat down on the farther side , so that they could not be seen by<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>or<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>.</p>
    <p n="2979"><said who="#Margaret">“ Here are your keys , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>. She tossed them towards him . They fell on the sunlit slope of grass , and he did not pick them up .</p>
    <p n="2980"><said who="#Margaret">“ I have something to tell you , ”</said>he said gently .</p>
    <p n="2981">She knew this superficial gentleness , this confession of hastiness , that was only intended to enhance her admiration of the male .</p>
    <p n="2982"><said who="#Margaret">“ I do n't want to hear it , ”</said>she replied .<said who="#Margaret">“ My sister is going to be ill. My life is going to be with her now . We must manage to build up something , she and I and her child . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2983"><said who="#Dolly">“ Where are you going ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2984"><said who="#Margaret">“ Munich . We start after the inquest , if she is not too ill . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2985"><said who="#Dolly">“ After the inquest ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2986"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2987"><said who="#Dolly">“ Have you realised what the verdict at the inquest will be ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2988"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , heart disease . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2989"><said who="#Dolly">“ No , my dear ; manslaughter . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2990"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>drove her fingers through the grass . The hill beneath her moved as if it were alive .</p>
    <p n="2991"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Manslaughter , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>may go to prison . I dare not tell him . I do n't know what to do — what to do . I 'm broken — I 'm ended . ”</said></p>
    <p n="2992">No sudden warmth arose in her . She did not see that to break him was her only hope . She did not enfold the sufferer in her arms . But all through that day and the next a new life began to move . The verdict was brought in .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>was committed for trial . It was against all reason that he should be punished , but the law , notwithstanding , sentenced him to three years ’ imprisonment . Then<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>'s fortress gave way . He could bear no one but his wife ; he shambled up to<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>afterwards and asked her to do what she could with him . She did what seemed easiest — she took him down to recruit at Howards End .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="44">
    <p n="2993"><persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>'s father was cutting the big meadow . He passed again and again amid whirring blades and sweet odours of grass , encompassing with narrowing circles the sacred centre of the field .<persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>was negotiating with<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ I have n't any idea , ”</said>she replied .<said who="#Helen">“ Do you suppose baby may ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2994"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>put down her work and regarded them absently .<said who="#Margaret">“ What was that ? ”</said>she asked .</p>
    <p n="2995"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>wants to know whether baby is old enough to play with hay ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2996"><said who="#Margaret">“ I have n't the least notion , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, and took up her work again .</p>
    <p n="2997"><said who="#Helen">“ Now ,<persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>, baby is not to stand ; he is not to lie on his face ; he is not to lie so that his head wags ; he is not to be teased or tickled ; and he is not to be cut into two or more pieces by the cutter . Will you be as careful as all that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="2998"><persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>held out his arms .</p>
    <p n="2999"><said who="#Margaret">“ That child is a wonderful nursemaid , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="3000"><said who="#Margaret">“ He is fond of baby . That 's why he does it ! ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s answer .<said who="#Margaret">“ They 're going to be lifelong friends . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3001"><said who="#Helen">“ Starting at the ages of six and one ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="3002"><said who="#Margaret">“ Of course . It will be a great thing for<persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="3003"><said who="#Helen">“ It may be a greater thing for baby . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3004">Fourteen months had passed , but<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>still stopped at Howards End . No better plan had occurred to her . The meadow was being recut , the great red poppies were reopening in the garden . July would follow with the little red poppies among the wheat , August with the cutting of the wheat . These little events would become part of her year after year . Every summer she would fear lest the well should give out , every winter lest the pipes should freeze ; every westerly gale might blow the wych-elm down and bring the end of all things , and so she could not read or talk during a westerly gale . The air was tranquil now . She and her sister were sitting on the remains of<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>'s rockery , where the lawn merged into the field .</p>
    <p n="3005"><said who="#Helen">“ What a time they all are ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ What can they be doing inside ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, who was growing less talkative , made no answer . The noise of the cutter came intermittently , like the breaking of waves . Close by them a man was preparing to scythe out one of the dell-holes .</p>
    <p n="3006"><said who="#Helen">“ I wish<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>was out to enjoy this , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ This lovely weather and to be shut up in the house ! It 's very hard . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3007"><said who="#Margaret">“ It has to be , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ The hay fever is his chief objection against living here , but he thinks it worth while . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3008"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, is or is n't he ill ? I can n't make out . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3009"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not ill. Eternally tired . He has worked very hard all his life , and noticed nothing . Those are the people who collapse when they do notice a thing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3010"><said who="#Helen">“ I suppose he worries dreadfully about his part of the tangle . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3011"><said who="#Margaret">“ Dreadfully . That is why I wish<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>had not come , too , to-day . Still , he wanted them all to come . It has to be . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3012"><said who="#Helen">“ Why does he want them ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="3013"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>did not answer .</p>
    <p n="3014"><said who="#Helen">“<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, may I tell you something ? I like<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="3015"><said who="#Margaret">“ You 'd be odd if you did n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="3016"><said who="#Helen">“ I use n't to . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3017"><said who="#Margaret">“ Use n't ! ”</said>She lowered her eyes a moment to the black abyss of the past . They had crossed it , always excepting<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>and<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>. They were building up a new life , obscure , yet gilded with tranquillity .<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>was dead ;<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>had two years more in prison . One use n't always to see clearly before that time . It was different now .</p>
    <p n="3018"><said who="#Helen">“ I like<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>because he does worry . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3019"><said who="#Margaret">“ And he likes you because you do n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3020"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>sighed . She seemed humiliated , and buried her face in her hands . After a time she said : “ About love , ” a transition less abrupt than it appeared .</p>
    <p n="3021"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>never stopped working .</p>
    <p n="3022"><said who="#Margaret">“ I mean a woman 's love for a man . I supposed I should hang my life on to that once , and was driven up and down and about as if something was worrying through me . But everything is peaceful now ; I seem cured . That Herr Forstmeister , whom<persName corresp="#Frieda">Frieda</persName>keeps writing about , must be a noble character , but he does n't see that I shall never marry him or anyone . It is n't shame or mistrust of myself . I simply could n't . I 'm ended . I used to be so dreamy about a man 's love as a girl , and think that for good or evil love must be the great thing . But it has n't been ; it has been itself a dream . Do you agree ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="3023"><said who="#Helen">“ I do not agree . I do not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3024"><said who="#Helen">“ I ought to remember<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>as my lover , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, stepping down into the field .<said who="#Helen">“ I tempted him , and killed him , and it is surely the least I can do . I would like to throw out all my heart to<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>on such an afternoon as this . But I cannot . It is no good pretending . I am forgetting him . ”</said>Her eyes filled with tears .<said who="#Helen">“ How nothing seems to match — how , my darling , my precious — ”</said>She broke off .<said who="#Helen">“ Tommy ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="3025"><said who="#Margaret">“ Yes , please ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="3026"><said who="#Helen">“ Baby 's not to try and stand .— There 's something wanting in me . I see you loving<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, and understanding him better daily , and I know that death would n't part you in the least . But I — Is it some awful , appalling , criminal defect ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="3027"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>silenced her . She said :<said who="#Margaret">“ It is only that people are far more different than is pretended . All over the world men and women are worrying because they cannot develop as they are supposed to develop . Here and there they have the matter out , and it comforts them . Do n't fret yourself ,<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>. Develop what you have ; love your child . I do not love children . I am thankful to have none . I can play with their beauty and charm , but that is all — nothing real , not one scrap of what there ought to be . And others — others go farther still , and move outside humanity altogether . A place , as well as a person , may catch the glow . Do n't you see that all this leads to comfort in the end ? It is part of the battle against sameness . Differences , eternal differences , planted by God in a single family , so that there may always be colour ; sorrow perhaps , but colour in the daily grey . Then I can n't have you worrying about<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>. Do n't drag in the personal when it will not come . Forget him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3028"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , yes , but what has<persName corresp="#Leonard_Bast">Leonard</persName>got out of life ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="3029"><said who="#Margaret">“ Perhaps an adventure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3030"><said who="#Helen">“ Is that enough ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="3031"><said who="#Margaret">“ Not for us . But for him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3032"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>took up a bunch of grass . She looked at the sorrel , and the red and white and yellow clover , and the quaker grass , and the daisies , and the bents that composed it . She raised it to her face .</p>
    <p n="3033"><said who="#Margaret">“ Is it sweetening yet ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.</p>
    <p n="3034"><said who="#Helen">“ No , only withered . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3035"><said who="#Margaret">“ It will sweeten to-morrow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3036"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>smiled .<said who="#Helen">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>, you are a person , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Helen">“ Think of the racket and torture this time last year . But now I could n't stop unhappy if I tried . What a change — and all through you ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="3037"><said who="#Margaret">“ Oh , we merely settled down . You and<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>learnt to understand one another and to forgive , all through the autumn and the winter . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3038"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , but who settled us down ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="3039"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>did not reply . The scything had begun , and she took off her pince-nez to watch it .</p>
    <p n="3040"><said who="#Helen">“ You ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>.<said who="#Helen">“ You did it all , sweetest , though you 're too stupid to see . Living here was your plan — I wanted you ; he wanted you ; and everyone said it was impossible , but you knew . Just think of our lives without you ,<persName corresp="#Margaret">Meg</persName>— I and baby with<persName corresp="#Monica">Monica</persName>, revolting by theory , he handed about from<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>to<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>. But you picked up the pieces , and made us a home . Ca n't it strike you — even for a moment — that your life has been heroic ? Ca n't you remember the two months after<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>'s arrest , when you began to act , and did all ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="3041"><said who="#Margaret">“ You were both ill at the time , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>.<said who="#Margaret">“ I did the obvious things . I had two invalids to nurse . Here was a house , ready furnished and empty . It was obvious . I did n't know myself it would turn into a permanent home . No doubt I have done a little towards straightening the tangle , but things that I can n't phrase have helped me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3042"><said who="#Helen">“ I hope it will be permanent , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>, drifting away to other thoughts .</p>
    <p n="3043"><said who="#Margaret">“ I think so . There are moments when I feel Howards End peculiarly our own . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3044"><said who="#Helen">“ All the same , London 's creeping . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3045">She pointed over the meadow — over eight or nine meadows , but at the end of them was a red rust .</p>
    <p n="3046"><said who="#Helen">“ You see that in Surrey and even Hampshire now , ”</said>she continued .<said who="#Helen">“ I can see it from the Purbeck Downs . And London is only part of something else , I 'm afraid . Life 's going to be melted down , all over the world . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3047"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>knew that her sister spoke truly . Howards End ,<persName corresp="#Oniton">Oniton</persName>, the Purbeck Downs , the Oderberge , were all survivals , and the melting-pot was being prepared for them . Logically , they had no right to be alive . One 's hope was in the weakness of logic . Were they possibly the earth beating time ?</p>
    <p n="3048"><said who="#Margaret">“ Because a thing is going strong now , it need not go strong for ever , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Margaret">“ This craze for motion has only set in during the last hundred years . It may be followed by a civilisation that wo n't be a movement , because it will rest on the earth . All the signs are against it now , but I can n't help hoping , and very early in the morning in the garden I feel that our house is the future as well as the past . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3049">They turned and looked at it . Their own memories coloured it now , for<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>'s child had been born in the central room of the nine . Then<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>said , “ Oh , take care —! ” for something moved behind the window of the hall , and the door opened .</p>
    <p n="3050"><said who="#Margaret">“ The conclave 's breaking at last . I 'll go . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3051">It was<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>.</p>
    <p n="3052"><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>retreated with the children far into the field . Friendly voices greeted her .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>rose , to encounter a man with a heavy black moustache .</p>
    <p n="3053"><said who="#Margaret">“ My father has asked for you , ”</said>he said with hostility .</p>
    <p n="3054">She took her work and followed him .</p>
    <p n="3055"><said who="#Margaret">“ We have been talking business , ”</said>he continued ,<said who="#Margaret">“ but I dare say you knew all about it beforehand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3056"><said who="#Helen">“ Yes , I did . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3057">Clumsy of movement — for he had spent all his life in the saddle —<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>drove his foot against the paint of the front door .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>gave a little cry of annoyance . She did not like anything scratched ; she stopped in the hall to take<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s boa and gloves out of a vase .</p>
    <p n="3058">Her husband was lying in a great leather chair in the dining-room , and by his side , holding his hand rather ostentatiously , was<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>.<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>, dressed in purple , sat near the window . The room was a little dark and airless ; they were obliged to keep it like this until the carting of the hay .<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>joined the family without speaking ; the five of them had met already at tea , and she knew quite well what was going to be said . Averse to wasting her time , she went on sewing . The clock struck six .</p>
    <p n="3059"><said who="#Henry">“ Is this going to suit everyone ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>in a weary voice . He used the old phrases , but their effect was unexpected and shadowy .<said who="#Henry">“ Because I do n't want you all coming here later on and complaining that I have been unfair . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3060"><said who="#Paul">“ It 's apparently got to suit us , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>.</p>
    <p n="3061"><said who="#Henry">“ I beg your pardon , my boy . You have only to speak , and I will leave the house to you instead . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3062"><persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>frowned ill-temperedly , and began scratching at his arm .<said who="#Paul">“ As I 've given up the outdoor life that suited me , and I have come home to look after the business , it 's no good my settling down here , ”</said>he said at last .<said who="#Paul">“ It 's not really the country , and it 's not the town . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3063"><said who="#Henry">“ Very well . Does my arrangement suit you ,<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="3064"><said who="#Evie">“ Of course , father . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3065"><said who="#Henry">“ And you ,<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="3066"><persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>raised her faded little face , which sorrow could wither but not steady .<said who="#Dolly">“ Perfectly splendidly , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Dolly">“ I thought<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>wanted it for the boys , but last time I saw him he said no , because we cannot possibly live in this part of England again .<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>says we ought to change our name , but I cannot think what to , for Wilcox just suits<persName corresp="#Charles_Wilcox">Charles</persName>and me , and I can n't think of any other name . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3067">There was a general silence .<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>looked nervously round , fearing that she had been inappropriate .<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>continued to scratch his arm .</p>
    <p n="3068"><said who="#Henry">“ Then I leave Howards End to my wife absolutely , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.<said who="#Henry">“ And let everyone understand that ; and after I am dead let there be no jealousy and no surprise . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3069"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>did not answer . There was something uncanny in her triumph . She , who had never expected to conquer anyone , had charged straight through these<persName corresp="#Wilcoxes">Wilcoxes</persName>and broken up their lives .</p>
    <p n="3070"><said who="#Henry">“ In consequence , I leave my wife no money , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>.<said who="#Henry">“ That is her own wish . All that she would have had will be divided among you . I am also giving you a great deal in my lifetime , so that you may be independent of me . That is her wish , too . She also is giving away a great deal of money . She intends to diminish her income by half during the next ten years ; she intends when she dies to leave the house to her nephew , down in the field . Is all that clear ? Does everyone understand ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="3071"><persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>rose to his feet . He was accustomed to natives , and a very little shook him out of the Englishman . Feeling manly and cynical , he said :<said who="#Paul">“ Down in the field ? Oh , come ! I think we might have had the whole establishment , piccaninnies included . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3072">Mrs.<persName corresp="#Cahill">Cahill</persName>whispered :<said who="#Henry">“ Do n't ,<persName corresp="#Paul">Paul</persName>. You promised you 'd take care . ”</said>Feeling a woman of the world , she rose and prepared to take her leave .</p>
    <p n="3073">Her father kissed her .<said who="#Paul">“ Good-bye , old girl , ”</said>he said ;<said who="#Paul">“ do n't you worry about me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3074"><said who="#Cahill">“ Good-bye , dad . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3075">Then it was<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s turn . Anxious to contribute , she laughed nervously , and said :<said who="#Paul">“ Good-bye ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Wilcox">Mr. Wilcox</persName>. It does seem curious that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>should have left<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>Howards End , and yet she get it , after all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3076">From<persName corresp="#Evie">Evie</persName>came a sharply-drawn breath .<said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Goodbye , ”</said>she said to<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>, and kissed her .</p>
    <p n="3077">And again and again fell the word , like the ebb of a dying sea .</p>
    <p n="3078"><said who="#Evie">“ Good-bye . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3079"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Good-bye ,<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="3080"><said who="#Dolly">“ So long , father . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3081"><said who="#Mr._Wilcox">“ Good-bye , my boy ; always take care of yourself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3082"><said who="#Dolly">“ Good-bye ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="3083"><said who="#Mrs._Wilcox">“ Good-bye . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3084"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>saw their visitors to the gate . Then she returned to her husband and laid her head in his hands . He was pitiably tired . But<persName corresp="#Dolly">Dolly</persName>'s remark had interested her . At last she said :<said who="#Dolly">“ Could you tell me ,<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, what was that about<persName corresp="#Mrs._Wilcox">Mrs. Wilcox</persName>having left me Howards End ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="3085">Tranquilly he replied :<said who="#Henry">“ Yes , she did . But that is a very old story . When she was ill and you were so kind to her she wanted to make you some return , and , not being herself at the time , scribbled ‘ Howards End ’ on a piece of paper . I went into it thoroughly , and , as it was clearly fanciful , I set it aside , little knowing what my<persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>would be to me in the future . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3086"><persName corresp="#Margaret">Margaret</persName>was silent . Something shook her life in its inmost recesses , and she shivered .</p>
    <p n="3087"><said who="#Margaret">“ I did n't do wrong , did I ? ”</said>he asked , bending down .</p>
    <p n="3088"><said who="#Dolly">“ You did n't , darling . Nothing has been done wrong . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3089">From the garden came laughter .<said who="#Henry">“ Here they are at last ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Henry">Henry</persName>, disengaging himself with a smile .<persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>rushed into the gloom , holding<persName corresp="#Tom">Tom</persName>by one hand and carrying her baby on the other . There were shouts of infectious joy .</p>
    <p n="3090"><said who="#Helen">“ The field 's cut ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Helen">Helen</persName>cried excitedly —<said who="#Helen">“ the big meadow ! We 've seen to the very end , and it 'll be such a crop of hay as never ! ”</said></p>
