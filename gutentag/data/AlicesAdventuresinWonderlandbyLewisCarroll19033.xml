    <p>Alice in the Room of the Duchess .</p>
    <p>THE “ STORYLAND ” SERIES</p>
     <p>SAM'L GABRIEL SONS &amp; COMPANY</p>
     <p>Illustration</p>
  <body>
   <p n="1"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank , and of having nothing to do . Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , “ and what is the use of a book , ” thought<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>,<said who="#Alice">“ without pictures or conversations ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="2">So she was considering in her own mind ( as well as she could , for the day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ) , whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies , when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .</p>
   <p n="3">There was nothing so very remarkable in that , nor did<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>think it so very much out of the way to hear<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>say to itself ,<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be too late ! ”</said>But when<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on ,<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>started to her feet , for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket , or a watch to take out of it , and , burning with curiosity , she ran across the field after it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole , under the hedge . In another moment , down went<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>after it !</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p n="4">The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down , so suddenly that<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well .</p>
   <p n="5">Either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time , as she went down , to look about her . First , she tried to make out what she was coming to , but it was too dark to see anything ; then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves ; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs . She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed . It was labeled “ ORANGE MARMALADE , ” but , to her great disappointment , it was empty ; she did not like to drop the jar , so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it .</p>
   <p n="6">Down , down , down ! Would the fall never come to an end ? There was nothing else to do , so<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>soon began talking to herself .<said who="#Alice">“ Dinah 'll miss me very much to-night , I should think ! ”</said>( Dinah was the cat . )<said who="#Alice">“ I hope they 'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time . Dinah , my dear , I wish you were down here with me ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>felt that she was dozing off , when suddenly , thump ! thump ! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves , and the fall was over .</p>
   <p n="7"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up in a moment . She looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage and<persName corresp="#the_White_Rabbit">the White Rabbit</persName>was still in sight , hurrying down it . There was not a moment to be lost . Away went<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>like the wind and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner ,<said who="#Alice">“ Oh , my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! ”</said>She was close behind it when she turned the corner , but<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>was no longer to be seen .</p>
   <p n="8">She found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . There were doors all ‘ round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .</p>
   <p n="9">Suddenly she came upon a little table , all made of solid glass . There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key , and<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>'s first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but , at any rate , it would not open any of them . However , on the second time ‘ round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high . She tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight , it fitted !</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p n="10"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat-hole ; she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw . How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway .<said who="#Alice">“ Oh , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>,<said who="#Alice">“ how I wish I could shut up like a telescope ! I think I could , if I only knew how to begin . ”</said></p>
   <p n="11"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate , a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes . This time she found a little bottle on it ( “ which certainly was not here before , ” said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>) , and tied ‘ round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words “ DRINK ME ” beautifully printed on it in large letters .</p>
   <p n="12"><said who="#Alice">“ No , I 'll look first , ”</said>she said , “ and see whether it 's marked ‘ poison ’ or not , ” for she had never forgotten that , if you drink from a bottle marked “ poison , ” it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later . However , this bottle was not marked “ poison , ” so<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>ventured to taste it , and , finding it very nice ( it had a sort of mixed flavor of cherry-tart , custard , pineapple , roast turkey , toffy and hot buttered toast ) , she very soon finished it off .</p>
   <p n="13"><said who="#Alice">“ What a curious feeling ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.<said who="#Alice">“ I must be shutting up like a telescope ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="14">And so it was indeed ! She was now only ten inches high , and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden .</p>
   <p n="15">After awhile , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>! When she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery , and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .</p>
   <p n="16"><said who="#Alice">“ Come , there 's no use in crying like that ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>to herself rather sharply .<said who="#Alice">“ I advise you to leave off this minute ! ”</said>She generally gave herself very good advice ( though she very seldom followed it ) , and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes .</p>
   <p n="17">Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it and found in it a very small cake , on which the words “ EAT ME ” were beautifully marked in currants .<said who="#Alice">“ Well , I 'll eat it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>,<said who="#Alice">“ and if it makes me grow larger , I can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller , I can creep under the door : so either way I 'll get into the garden , and I do n't care which happens ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="18">She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself ,<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ Which way ? Which way ? ”</said>holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing ; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size . So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake .</p>

   <p>II — THE POOL OF TEARS</p>
   <p n="19"><said who="#Alice">“ Curiouser and curiouser ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>( she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English ) .<said who="#Alice">“ Now I 'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was ! Good-by , feet ! Oh , my poor little feet , I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now , dears ? I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you . ”</said></p>
   <p n="20">Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall ; in fact , she was now rather more than nine feet high , and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door .</p>
   <p n="21">Poor<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>! It was as much as she could do , lying down on one side , to look through into the garden with one eye ; but to get through was more hopeless than ever . She sat down and began to cry again .</p>
   <p n="22">She went on shedding gallons of tears , until there was a large pool all ‘ round her and reaching half down the hall .</p>
   <p n="23">After a time , she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming . It was<persName corresp="#the_White_Rabbit">the White Rabbit</persName>returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid-gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other . He came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself ,<said who="#the_White_Rabbit">“ Oh !<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>,<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>! Oh ! wo n't she be savage if I 've kept her waiting ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="24">When<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>came near her ,<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>began , in a low , timid voice ,<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ If you please , sir — ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">The Rabbit</persName>started violently , dropped the white kid-gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p n="25"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking .<said who="#the_White_Rabbit">“ Dear , dear ! How queer everything is to-day ! And yesterday things went on just as usual . Was I the same when I got up this morning ? But if I 'm not the same , the next question is , ‘ Who in the world am I ? ’ Ah , that 's the great puzzle ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="26">As she said this , she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>'s little white kid-gloves while she was talking .<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ How can I have done that ? ”</said>she thought .<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ I must be growing small again . ”</said>She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly . She soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily , just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether .</p>
   <p n="27"><said who="#Alice">“ That was a narrow escape ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, a good deal frightened at the sudden change , but very glad to find herself still in existence .<said who="#Alice">“ And now for the garden ! ”</said>And she ran with all speed back to the little door ; but , alas ! the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before .<said who="#Alice">“ Things are worse than ever , ”</said>thought the poor child ,<said who="#Alice">“ for I never was so small as this before , never ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="28">As she said these words , her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash ! she was up to her chin in salt-water . Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea . However , she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p n="29">Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to see what it was : she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself .</p>
   <p n="30"><said who="#Alice">“ Would it be of any use , now , ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>,<said who="#Alice">“ to speak to this mouse ? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here that I should think very likely it can talk ; at any rate , there 's no harm in trying . ”</said>So she began ,<said who="#the_Mouse">“ O Mouse , do you know the way out of this pool ? I am very tired of swimming about here , O Mouse ! ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Mouse">The Mouse</persName>looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes , but it said nothing .</p>
   <p n="31"><said who="#Alice">“ Perhaps it does n't understand English , ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.<said who="#Alice">“ I dare say it 's a French mouse , come over with William the Conqueror . ”</said>So she began again :<said who="#the_Mouse">“ Où est ma chatte ? ”</said>which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book .<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">The Mouse</persName>gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright .<said who="#Alice">“ Oh , I beg your pardon ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal 's feelings .<said who="#Alice">“ I quite forgot you did n't like cats . ”</said></p>
   <p n="32"><said who="#the_Mouse">“ Not like cats ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>in a shrill , passionate voice .<said who="#the_Mouse">“ Would you like cats , if you were me ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="33"><said who="#Alice">“ Well , perhaps not , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>in a soothing tone ;<said who="#Alice">“ do n't be angry about it . And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah . I think you 'd take a fancy to cats , if you could only see her . She is such a dear , quiet thing . ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Mouse">The Mouse</persName>was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended .<said who="#Alice">“ We wo n't talk about her any more , if you 'd rather not . ”</said></p>
   <p n="34"><said who="#the_Mouse">“ We , indeed ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>, who was trembling down to the end of its tail .<said who="#the_Mouse">“ As if I would talk on such a subject ! Our family always hated cats — nasty , low , vulgar things ! Do n't let me hear the name again ! ”</said></p>

    <p>Alice at the Mad Tea Party .</p>
   </figure>
   <p n="35"><said who="#Alice">“ I wo n't indeed ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation .<said who="#Alice">“ Are you — are you fond — of — of dogs ? There is such a nice little dog near our house , I should like to show you ! It kills all the rats and — oh , dear ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>in a sorrowful tone .<said who="#the_Mouse">“ I 'm afraid I 've offended it again ! ”</said>For<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>was swimming away from her as hard as it could go , and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went .</p>
   <p n="36">So she called softly after it ,<said who="#the_Mouse">“ Mouse dear ! Do come back again , and we wo n't talk about cats , or dogs either , if you do n't like them ! ”</said>When<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>heard this , it turned ‘ round and swam slowly back to her ; its face was quite pale , and it said , in a low , trembling voice ,<said who="#the_Mouse">“ Let us get to the shore and then I 'll tell you my history and you 'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs . ”</said></p>
   <p n="37">It was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it ; there were a Duck and a Dodo , a Lory and an Eaglet , and several other curious creatures .<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>led the way and the whole party swam to the shore .</p>

   <p>III — A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE</p>
   <p n="38">They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank — the birds with draggled feathers , the animals with their fur clinging close to them , and all dripping wet , cross and uncomfortable .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p n="39">The first question , of course , was how to get dry again . They had a consultation about this and after a few minutes , it seemed quite natural to<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>to find herself talking familiarly with them , as if she had known them all her life .</p>
   <p n="40">At last<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>, who seemed to be a person of some authority among them , called out ,<said who="#the_Mouse">“ Sit down , all of you , and listen to me ! I 'll soon make you dry enough ! ”</said>They all sat down at once , in a large ring , with<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>in the middle .</p>
   <p n="41"><said who="#the_Mouse">“ Ahem ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>with an important air .<said who="#the_Mouse">“ Are you all ready ? This is the driest thing I know . Silence all ‘ round , if you please ! ‘ William the Conqueror , whose cause was favored by the pope , was soon submitted to by the English , who wanted leaders , and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest . Edwin and Morcar , the Earls of Mercia and Northumbria ’ — ”</said></p>
   <p n="42"><said who="#Alice">“ Ugh ! ”</said>said the Lory , with a shiver .</p>
   <p n="43"><said who="#the_Mouse">“ — ‘ And even Stigand , the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury , found it advisable ’ — ”</said></p>
   <p n="44"><said who="#Alice">“ Found what ? ”</said>said the Duck .</p>
   <p n="45"><said who="#the_Mouse">“ Found it , ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>replied rather crossly ;<said who="#the_Mouse">“ of course , you know what ‘ it ’ means . ”</said></p>
   <p n="46"><said who="#Alice">“ I know what ‘ it ’ means well enough , when I find a thing , ”</said>said the Duck ;<said who="#Alice">“ it 's generally a frog or a worm . The question is , what did the archbishop find ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="47"><persName corresp="#the_Mouse">The Mouse</persName>did not notice this question , but hurriedly went on ,<said who="#the_Mouse">“ ‘ — found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown . ’ — How are you getting on now , my dear ? ”</said>it continued , turning to<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>as it spoke .</p>
   <p n="48"><said who="#Alice">“ As wet as ever , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>in a melancholy tone ;<said who="#Alice">“ it does n't seem to dry me at all . ”</said></p>
   <p n="49"><said who="#the_Dodo">“ In that case , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Dodo">the Dodo</persName>solemnly , rising to its feet ,<said who="#the_Dodo">“ I move that the meeting adjourn , for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies — ”</said></p>
   <p n="50"><said who="#Alice">“ Speak English ! ”</said>said the Eaglet .<said who="#Alice">“ I do n't know the meaning of half those long words , and , what 's more , I do n't believe you do either ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="51"><said who="#the_Dodo">“ What I was going to say , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Dodo">the Dodo</persName>in an offended tone ,<said who="#the_Dodo">“ is that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race . ”</said></p>
   <p n="52"><said who="#Alice">“ What is a Caucus-race ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p n="53"><said who="#the_Dodo">“ Why , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Dodo">the Dodo</persName>,<said who="#the_Dodo">“ the best way to explain it is to do it . ”</said>First it marked out a race-course , in a sort of circle , and then all the party were placed along the course , here and there . There was no “ One , two , three and away ! ” but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked , so that it was not easy to know when the race was over . However , when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again ,<persName corresp="#the_Dodo">the Dodo</persName>suddenly called out ,<said who="#the_Dodo">“ The race is over ! ”</said>and they all crowded ‘ round it , panting and asking ,<said who="#the_Dodo">“ But who has won ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="54">This question<persName corresp="#the_Dodo">the Dodo</persName>could not answer without a great deal of thought . At last it said ,<said who="#Alice">“ Everybody has won , and all must have prizes . ”</said></p>
   <p n="55"><said who="#the_Dodo">“ But who is to give the prizes ? ”</said>quite a chorus of voices asked .</p>
   <p n="56"><said who="#the_Dodo">“ Why , she , of course , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Dodo">the Dodo</persName>, pointing to<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>with one finger ; and the whole party at once crowded ‘ round her , calling out , in a confused way ,<said who="#the_Dodo">“ Prizes ! Prizes ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="57"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>had no idea what to do , and in despair she put her hand into her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits ( luckily the salt-water had not got into it ) and handed them ‘ round as prizes . There was exactly one a-piece , all ‘ round .</p>
   <p n="58">The next thing was to eat the comfits ; this caused some noise and confusion , as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs , and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back . However , it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>to tell them something more .</p>
   <p n="59"><said who="#the_Mouse">“ You promised to tell me your history , you know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, “ and why it is you hate — C and D , ” she added in a whisper , half afraid that it would be offended again .</p>
   <p n="60"><said who="#the_Mouse">“ Mine is a long and a sad tale ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>, turning to<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>and sighing .</p>
   <p n="61"><said who="#Alice">“ It is a long tail , certainly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, looking down with wonder at<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>'s tail ,<said who="#Alice">“ but why do you call it sad ? ”</said>And she kept on puzzling about it while<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>was speaking , so that her idea of the tale was something like this :—</p>
   <p n="62"><said who="#the_Mouse">“ Fury said to a mouse , That he met in the house , ‘ Let us both go to law : I will prosecute you .— Come , I 'll take no denial : We must have the trial ; For really this morning I 've nothing to do . ’ Said the mouse to the cur , ‘ Such a trial , dear sir , With no jury or judge , would be wasting our breath . ’ ‘ I 'll be judge , I 'll be jury , ’ said cunning old Fury ; ‘ I 'll try the whole cause , and condemn you to death . ’ ”</said></p>
   <p n="63"><said who="#the_Mouse">“ You are not attending ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>to<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, severely .<said who="#the_Mouse">“ What are you thinking of ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="64"><said who="#Alice">“ I beg your pardon , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>very humbly ,<said who="#Alice">“ you had got to the fifth bend , I think ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="65"><said who="#the_Mouse">“ You insult me by talking such nonsense ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>, getting up and walking away .</p>
   <p n="66"><said who="#Alice">“ Please come back and finish your story ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>called after it . And the others all joined in chorus ,<said who="#the_Mouse">“ Yes , please do ! ”</said>But<persName corresp="#the_Mouse">the Mouse</persName>only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker .</p>
   <p n="67"><said who="#Alice">“ I wish I had Dinah , our cat , here ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>. This caused a remarkable sensation among the party . Some of the birds hurried off at once , and a Canary called out in a trembling voice , to its children ,<said who="#Alice">“ Come away , my dears ! It 's high time you were all in bed ! ”</said>On various pretexts they all moved off and<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>was soon left alone .</p>
   <p n="68"><said who="#Alice">“ I wish I had n't mentioned Dinah ! Nobody seems to like her down here and I 'm sure she 's the best cat in the world ! ”</said>Poor<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>began to cry again , for she felt very lonely and low-spirited . In a little while , however , she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly .</p>

   <p>IV — THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL</p>
   <p n="69">It was<persName corresp="#the_White_Rabbit">the White Rabbit</persName>, trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went , as if it had lost something ;<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>heard it muttering to itself ,<said who="#Alice">“<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">The Duchess</persName>!<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">The Duchess</persName>! Oh , my dear paws ! Oh , my fur and whiskers ! She 'll get me executed , as sure as ferrets are ferrets ! Where can I have dropped them , I wonder ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid-gloves and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them , but they were nowhere to be seen — everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool , and the great hall , with the glass table and the little door , had vanished completely .</p>
   <p n="70">Very soon<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>noticed<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, and called to her , in an angry tone ,<said who="#the_Duchess">“ Why , Mary Ann , what are you doing out here ? Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan ! Quick , now ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="71"><said who="#Alice">“ He took me for his housemaid ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, as she ran off .<said who="#Alice">“ How surprised he 'll be when he finds out who I am ! ”</said>As she said this , she came upon a neat little house , on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name “ W. RABBIT ” engraved upon it . She went in without knocking and hurried upstairs , in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves .</p>
   <p n="72">By this time ,<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window , and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid-gloves ; she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room , when her eyes fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass . She uncorked it and put it to her lips , saying to herself ,<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ I do hope it 'll make me grow large again , for , really , I 'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="73">Before she had drunk half the bottle , she found her head pressing against the ceiling , and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken . She hastily put down the bottle , remarking ,<said who="#Alice">“ That 's quite enough — I hope I sha'n ' t grow any more . ”</said></p>
   <p n="74">Alas ! It was too late to wish that ! She went on growing and growing and very soon she had to kneel down on the floor . Still she went on growing , and , as a last resource , she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney , and said to herself ,<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ Now I can do no more , whatever happens . What will become of me ? ”</said></p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p n="75">Luckily for<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger . After a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen .</p>
   <p n="76"><said who="#Alice">“ Mary Ann ! Mary Ann ! ”</said>said the voice .<said who="#Alice">“ Fetch me my gloves this moment ! ”</said>Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs .<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>knew it was<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house , quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>and had no reason to be afraid of it .</p>
   <p n="77">Presently<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>came up to the door and tried to open it ; but as the door opened inwards and<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>'s elbow was pressed hard against it , that attempt proved a failure .<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>heard it say to itself ,<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ Then I 'll go ‘ round and get in at the window . ”</said></p>
   <p n="78"><said who="#Alice">“ That you wo n't ! ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>; and after waiting till she fancied she heard<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>just under the window , she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air . She did not get hold of anything , but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass , from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame or something of that sort .</p>
   <p n="79">Next came an angry voice —<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>'s —<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ Pat ! Pat ! Where are you ? ”</said>And then a voice she had never heard before ,<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ Sure then , I 'm here ! Digging for apples , yer honor ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="80"><said who="#Alice">“ Here ! Come and help me out of this ! Now tell me , Pat , what 's that in the window ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="81"><said who="#the_Rabbit">“ Sure , it 's an arm , yer honor ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="82"><said who="#Alice">“ Well , it 's got no business there , at any rate ; go and take it away ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="83">There was a long silence after this and<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>could only hear whispers now and then , and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air . This time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass .<said who="#Alice">“ I wonder what they 'll do next ! ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.<said who="#Alice">“ As for pulling me out of the window , I only wish they could ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="84">She waited for some time without hearing anything more . At last came a rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together . She made out the words :<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ Where 's the other ladder ? Bill 's got the other — Bill ! Here , Bill ! Will the roof bear ?— Who 's to go down the chimney ?— Nay , I sha'n ' t ! You do it ! Here , Bill ! The master says you 've got to go down the chimney ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="85"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her ; then she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next .</p>
   <p n="86">The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “ There goes Bill ! ” then<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>'s voice alone —<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ Catch him , you by the hedge ! ”</said>Then silence and then another confusion of voices —<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ Hold up his head — Brandy now — Do n't choke him — What happened to you ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="87">Last came a little feeble , squeaking voice ,<said who="#Alice">“ Well , I hardly know — No more , thank ye . I 'm better now — all I know is , something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box and up I goes like a sky-rocket ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="88">After a minute or two of silence , they began moving about again , and<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>heard<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>say ,<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ A barrowful will do , to begin with . ”</said></p>
   <p n="89"><said who="#Alice">“ A barrowful of what ? ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>. But she had not long to doubt , for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face .<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>noticed , with some surprise , that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head .<said who="#Alice">“ If I eat one of these cakes , ”</said>she thought ,<said who="#Alice">“ it 's sure to make some change in my size . ”</said></p>
   <p n="90">So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly . As soon as she was small enough to get through the door , she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside . They all made a rush at<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>the moment she appeared , but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood .</p>

    <p>“ The Duchess tucked her arm affectionately into Alice 's . ”</p>

   <p n="91"><said who="#Alice">“ The first thing I 've got to do , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>to herself , as she wandered about in the wood ,<said who="#Alice">“ is to grow to my right size again ; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden . I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other , but the great question is ‘ What ? ’ ”</said></p>
   <p n="92"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>looked all around her at the flowers and the blades of grass , but she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances . There was a large mushroom growing near her , about the same height as herself . She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar , that was sitting on the top , with its arms folded , quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else .</p>

   <p>V — ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR</p>
   <p n="93">At last<persName corresp="#the_Caterpillar">the Caterpillar</persName>took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>in a languid , sleepy voice .</p>
   <p n="94"><said who="#the_Caterpillar">“ Who are you ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Caterpillar">the Caterpillar</persName>.</p>

   <p n="95"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>replied , rather shyly ,<said who="#Alice">“ I — I hardly know , sir , just at present — at least I know who I was when I got up this morning , but I think I must have changed several times since then . ”</said></p>
   <p n="96"><said who="#the_Caterpillar">“ What do you mean by that ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Caterpillar">the Caterpillar</persName>, sternly .<said who="#the_Caterpillar">“ Explain yourself ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="97"><said who="#Alice">“ I can n't explain myself , I 'm afraid , sir , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>,<said who="#Alice">“ because I 'm not myself , you see — being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing . ”</said>She drew herself up and said very gravely ,<said who="#Alice">“ I think you ought to tell me who you are , first . ”</said></p>
   <p n="98"><said who="#the_Caterpillar">“ Why ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Caterpillar">the Caterpillar</persName>.</p>
   <p n="99">As<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>could not think of any good reason and<persName corresp="#the_Caterpillar">the Caterpillar</persName>seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind , she turned away .</p>
   <p n="100"><said who="#the_Caterpillar">“ Come back ! ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Caterpillar">the Caterpillar</persName>called after her .<said who="#Alice">“ I 've something important to say ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>turned and came back again .</p>
   <p n="101"><said who="#the_Caterpillar">“ Keep your temper , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Caterpillar">the Caterpillar</persName>.</p>
   <p n="102"><said who="#the_Caterpillar">“ Is that all ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, swallowing down her anger as well as she could .</p>
   <p n="103"><said who="#the_Caterpillar">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Caterpillar">the Caterpillar</persName>.</p>
   <p n="104">It unfolded its arms , took the hookah out of its mouth again , and said ,<said who="#Alice">“ So you think you 're changed , do you ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="105"><said who="#Alice">“ I 'm afraid , I am , sir , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.<said who="#Alice">“ I can n't remember things as I used — and I do n't keep the same size for ten minutes together ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="106"><said who="#the_Caterpillar">“ What size do you want to be ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Caterpillar">the Caterpillar</persName>.</p>
   <p n="107"><said who="#Alice">“ Oh , I 'm not particular as to size , ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>hastily replied , “ only one does n't like changing so often , you know . I should like to be a little larger , sir , if you would n't mind , ” said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.<said who="#Alice">“ Three inches is such a wretched height to be . ”</said></p>
   <p n="108"><said who="#the_Caterpillar">“ It is a very good height indeed ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Caterpillar">the Caterpillar</persName>angrily , rearing itself upright as it spoke ( it was exactly three inches high ) .</p>
   <p n="109">In a minute or two ,<persName corresp="#the_Caterpillar">the Caterpillar</persName>got down off the mushroom and crawled away into the grass , merely remarking , as it went ,<said who="#Alice">“ One side will make you grow taller , and the other side will make you grow shorter . ”</said></p>
   <p n="110"><said who="#Alice">“ One side of what ? The other side of what ? ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>to herself .</p>
   <p n="111"><said who="#the_Caterpillar">“ Of the mushroom , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Caterpillar">the Caterpillar</persName>, just as if she had asked it aloud ; and in another moment , it was out of sight .</p>
   <p n="112"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute , trying to make out which were the two sides of it . At last she stretched her arms ‘ round it as far as they would go , and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand .</p>
   <p n="113"><said who="#Alice">“ And now which is which ? ”</said>she said to herself , and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect . The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin — it had struck her foot !</p>
   <p n="114">She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change , as she was shrinking rapidly ; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit . Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth ; but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit ....</p>
   <p n="115"><said who="#Alice">“ Come , my head 's free at last ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>; but all she could see , when she looked down , was an immense length of neck , which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her .</p>
   <p n="116"><said who="#the_Caterpillar">“ Where have my shoulders got to ? And oh , my poor hands , how is it I can n't see you ? ”</said>She was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction , like a serpent . She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry — a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings .</p>

   <p n="117"><said who="#the_Pigeon">“ Serpent ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#the_Pigeon">the Pigeon</persName>.</p>
   <p n="118"><said who="#the_Pigeon">“ I 'm not a serpent ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>indignantly .<said who="#the_Pigeon">“ Let me alone ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="119"><said who="#the_Pigeon">“ I 've tried the roots of trees , and I 've tried banks , and I 've tried hedges , ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Pigeon">the Pigeon</persName>went on ,<said who="#the_Pigeon">“ but those serpents ! There 's no pleasing them ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="120"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>was more and more puzzled .</p>
   <p n="121"><said who="#the_Pigeon">“ As if it was n't trouble enough hatching the eggs , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Pigeon">the Pigeon</persName>, “ but I must be on the look-out for serpents , night and day ! And just as I 'd taken the highest tree in the wood , ” continued<persName corresp="#the_Pigeon">the Pigeon</persName>, raising its voice to a shriek ,<said who="#the_Pigeon">“ and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last , they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ! Ugh , Serpent ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="122"><said who="#Alice">“ But I 'm not a serpent , I tell you ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.<said who="#Alice">“ I 'm a — I 'm a — I 'm a little girl , ”</said>she added rather doubtfully , as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day .</p>
   <p n="123"><said who="#the_Pigeon">“ You 're looking for eggs , I know that well enough , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Pigeon">the Pigeon</persName>;<said who="#the_Pigeon">“ and what does it matter to me whether you 're a little girl or a serpent ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="124"><said who="#Alice">“ It matters a good deal to me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>hastily ;<said who="#Alice">“ but I 'm not looking for eggs , as it happens , and if I was , I should n't want yours — I do n't like them raw . ”</said></p>
   <p n="125"><said who="#the_Pigeon">“ Well , be off , then ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Pigeon">the Pigeon</persName>in a sulky tone , as it settled down again into its nest .<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>crouched down among the trees as well as she could , for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches , and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it . After awhile she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands , and she set to work very carefully , nibbling first at one and then at the other , and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter , until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height .</p>
   <p n="126">It was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first .<said who="#Alice">“ The next thing is to get into that beautiful garden — how is that to be done , I wonder ? ”</said>As she said this , she came suddenly upon an open place , with a little house in it about four feet high .<said who="#Alice">“ Whoever lives there , ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>,<said who="#Alice">“ it 'll never do to come upon them this size ; why , I should frighten them out of their wits ! ”</said>She did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high .</p>
   <p>VI — PIG AND PEPPER</p>
   <p n="127">For a minute or two she stood looking at the house , when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood ( judging by his face only , she would have called him a fish ) — and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles . It was opened by another footman in livery , with a round face and large eyes like a frog .</p>
   <figure>
    <p>Illustration</p>
   </figure>
   <p n="128">The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter , and this he handed over to the other , saying , in a solemn tone ,<said who="#Alice">“ For<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>. An invitation from<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>to play croquet . ”</said>The Frog-Footman repeated , in the same solemn tone ,<said who="#Alice">“ From<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>. An invitation for<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>to play croquet . ”</said>Then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled together .</p>
   <p n="129">When<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>next peeped out , the Fish-Footman was gone , and the other was sitting on the ground near the door , staring stupidly up into the sky .<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>went timidly up to the door and knocked .</p>
   <p n="130"><said who="#Alice">“ There 's no sort of use in knocking , ”</said>said the Footman ,<said who="#Alice">“ and that for two reasons . First , because I 'm on the same side of the door as you are ; secondly , because they 're making such a noise inside , no one could possibly hear you . ”</said>And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within — a constant howling and sneezing , and every now and then a great crash , as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces .</p>
   <p n="131"><said who="#Alice">“ How am I to get in ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.</p>
   <p n="132"><said who="#the_Pigeon">“ Are you to get in at all ? ”</said>said the Footman .<said who="#the_Pigeon">“ That 's the first question , you know . ”</said></p>
   <p n="133"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>opened the door and went in . The door led right into a large kitchen , which was full of smoke from one end to the other ;<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle , nursing a baby ; the cook was leaning over the fire , stirring a large caldron which seemed to be full of soup .</p>
   <p n="134"><said who="#Alice">“ There 's certainly too much pepper in that soup ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>said to herself , as well as she could for sneezing . Even<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>sneezed occasionally ; and as for the baby , it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment 's pause . The only two creatures in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat , which was grinning from ear to ear .</p>
   <p n="135"><said who="#Alice">“ Please would you tell me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, a little timidly ,<said who="#Alice">“ why your cat grins like that ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="136"><said who="#the_Duchess">“ It 's a Cheshire-Cat , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>,<said who="#the_Duchess">“ and that 's why . ”</said></p>
   <p n="137"><said who="#Alice">“ I did n't know that Cheshire-Cats always grinned ; in fact , I did n't know that cats could grin , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.</p>
   <p n="138"><said who="#the_Duchess">“ You do n't know much , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>,<said who="#the_Duchess">“ and that 's a fact . ”</said></p>
   <p n="139">Just then the cook took the caldron of soup off the fire , and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>and the baby — the fire-irons came first ; then followed a shower of saucepans , plates and dishes .<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">The Duchess</persName>took no notice of them , even when they hit her , and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not .</p>
   <p n="140"><said who="#Alice">“ Oh , please mind what you 're doing ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, jumping up and down in an agony of terror .</p>
   <p n="141"><said who="#the_Duchess">“ Here ! You may nurse it a bit , if you like ! ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>said to<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, flinging the baby at her as she spoke .<said who="#the_Duchess">“ I must go and get ready to play croquet with<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>, ”</said>and she hurried out of the room .</p>
   <p n="142"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>caught the baby with some difficulty , as it was a queer-shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions .<said who="#Alice">“ If I do n't take this child away with me , ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>,<said who="#Alice">“ they 're sure to kill it in a day or two . Would n't it be murder to leave it behind ? ”</said>She said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply .</p>
   <p n="143"><said who="#Alice">“ If you 're going to turn into a pig , my dear , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>,<said who="#Alice">“ I 'll have nothing more to do with you . Mind now ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="144"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>was just beginning to think to herself ,<said who="#Alice">“ Now , what am I to do with this creature , when I get it home ? ”</said>when it grunted again so violently that<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>looked down into its face in some alarm . This time there could be no mistake about it — it was neither more nor less than a pig ; so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood .</p>
   <p n="145"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire-Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off .<persName corresp="#the_Cat">The Cat</persName>only grinned when it saw her .<said who="#Alice">“ Cheshire-Puss , ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, rather timidly ,<said who="#Alice">“ would you please tell me which way I ought to go from here ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="146"><said who="#the_Cat">“ In that direction , ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Cat">the Cat</persName>said , waving the right paw ‘ round , “ lives a Hatter ; and in that direction , ” waving the other paw ,<said who="#the_Cat">“ lives a March<persName corresp="#Hare">Hare</persName>. Visit either you like ; they 're both mad . ”</said></p>
   <p n="147"><said who="#Alice">“ But I do n't want to go among mad people , ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>remarked .</p>
   <p n="148"><said who="#the_Cat">“ Oh , you can n't help that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Cat">the Cat</persName>;<said who="#the_Cat">“ we 're all mad here . Do you play croquet with<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>to-day ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="149"><said who="#Alice">“ I should like it very much , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>,<said who="#Alice">“ but I have n't been invited yet . ”</said></p>
   <p n="150"><said who="#the_Cat">“ You 'll see me there , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Cat">the Cat</persName>, and vanished .</p>
   <p n="151"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March<persName corresp="#Hare">Hare</persName>; it was so large a house that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom .</p>
   <p>VII — A MAD TEA-PARTY</p>
   <p n="152">There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house , and the March<persName corresp="#Hare">Hare</persName>and<persName corresp="#the_Hatter">the Hatter</persName>were having tea at it ; a Dormouse was sitting between them , fast asleep .</p>
   <p n="153">The table was a large one , but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it .<said who="#Alice">“ No room ! No room ! ”</said>they cried out when they saw<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>coming .<said who="#Alice">“ There 's plenty of room ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>indignantly , and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table .</p>
   <p n="154"><persName corresp="#the_Hatter">The Hatter</persName>opened his eyes very wide on hearing this , but all he said was “ Why is a raven like a writing-desk ? ”</p>
   <p n="155"><said who="#Alice">“ I 'm glad they 've begun asking riddles — I believe I can guess that , ”</said>she added aloud .</p>
   <p n="156"><said who="#Hare">“ Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it ? ”</said>said the March<persName corresp="#Hare">Hare</persName>.</p>
   <p n="157"><said who="#Alice">“ Exactly so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.</p>
   <p n="158"><said who="#Hare">“ Then you should say what you mean , ”</said>the March<persName corresp="#Hare">Hare</persName>went on .</p>
   <p n="159"><said who="#Alice">“ I do , ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>hastily replied ;<said who="#Alice">“ at least — at least I mean what I say — that 's the same thing , you know . ”</said></p>
   <p n="160"><said who="#Hare">“ You might just as well say , ”</said>added the Dormouse , which seemed to be talking in its sleep ,<said who="#Hare">“ that ‘ I breathe when I sleep ’ is the same thing as ‘ I sleep when I breathe ! ’ ”</said></p>
   <p n="161"><said who="#the_Hatter">“ It is the same thing with you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Hatter">the Hatter</persName>, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose . The Dormouse shook its head impatiently and said , without opening its eyes ,<said who="#the_Hatter">“ Of course , of course ; just what I was going to remark myself . ”</said></p>

   <p n="162"><said who="#the_Hatter">“ Have you guessed the riddle yet ? ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Hatter">the Hatter</persName>said , turning to<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>again .</p>
   <p n="163"><said who="#Alice">“ No , I give it up , ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>replied .<said who="#Alice">“ What 's the answer ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="164"><said who="#the_Hatter">“ I have n't the slightest idea , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Hatter">the Hatter</persName>.</p>
   <p n="165"><said who="#Hare">“ Nor I , ”</said>said the March<persName corresp="#Hare">Hare</persName>.</p>
   <p n="166"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>gave a weary sigh .<said who="#the_Hatter">“ I think you might do something better with the time , ”</said>she said ,<said who="#the_Hatter">“ than wasting it in asking riddles that have no answers . ”</said></p>
   <p n="167"><said who="#Hare">“ Take some more tea , ”</said>the March<persName corresp="#Hare">Hare</persName>said to<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, very earnestly .</p>
   <p n="168"><said who="#Alice">“ I 've had nothing yet , ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>replied in an offended tone ,<said who="#Alice">“ so I can n't take more . ”</said></p>
   <p n="169"><said who="#the_Hatter">“ You mean you can n't take less , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Hatter">the Hatter</persName>;<said who="#the_Hatter">“ it 's very easy to take more than nothing . ”</said></p>
   <p n="170">At this ,<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>got up and walked off . The Dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going , though she looked back once or twice ; the last time she saw them , they were trying to put the Dormouse into the tea-pot .</p>

    <p>The Trial of the Knave of Hearts .</p>
   </figure>
   <p n="171"><said who="#Alice">“ At any rate , I 'll never go there again ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, as she picked her way through the wood .<said who="#Alice">“ It 's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life ! ”</said>Just as she said this , she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it .<said who="#Alice">“ That 's very curious ! ”</said>she thought .<said who="#Alice">“ I think I may as well go in at once . ”</said>And in she went .</p>
   <p n="172">Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table . Taking the little golden key , she unlocked the door that led into the garden . Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom ( she had kept a piece of it in her pocket ) till she was about a foot high ; then she walked down the little passage ; and then — she found herself at last in the beautiful garden , among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains .</p>
   <p>VIII — THE QUEEN 'S CROQUET GROUND</p>
   <p n="173">A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden ; the roses growing on it were white , but there were three gardeners at it , busily painting them red . Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, as she stood watching them .<said who="#Alice">“ Would you tell me , please , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, a little timidly ,<said who="#Alice">“ why you are painting those roses ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="174">Five and Seven said nothing , but looked at Two . Two began , in a low voice ,<said who="#the_Hatter">“ Why , the fact is , you see , Miss , this here ought to have been a red rose-tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and , if<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know . So you see , Miss , we 're doing our best , afore she comes , to — ”</said>At this moment , Five , who had been anxiously looking across the garden , called out ,<said who="#Alice">“<persName corresp="#the_Queen">The Queen</persName>!<persName corresp="#the_Queen">The Queen</persName>! ”</said>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces . There was a sound of many footsteps and<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>looked ‘ round , eager to see<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>.</p>
   <p n="175">First came ten soldiers carrying clubs , with their hands and feet at the corners : next the ten courtiers ; these were ornamented all over with diamonds . After these came the royal children ; there were ten of them , all ornamented with hearts . Next came the guests , mostly Kings and Queens , and among them<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>recognized<persName corresp="#the_White_Rabbit">the White Rabbit</persName>. Then followed the Knave of Hearts , carrying<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>'s crown on a crimson velvet cushion ; and last of all this grand procession came THE KING AND THE QUEEN OF HEARTS .</p>
   <p n="176">When the procession came opposite to<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, they all stopped and looked at her , and<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>said severely ,<said who="#the_Queen">“ Who is this ? ”</said>She said it to the Knave of Hearts , who only bowed and smiled in reply .</p>
   <p n="177"><said who="#the_Queen">“ My name is<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, so please Your Majesty , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>very politely ; but she added to herself ,<said who="#the_Queen">“ Why , they 're only a pack of cards , after all ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="178"><said who="#the_Queen">“ Can you play croquet ? ”</said>shouted<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>. The question was evidently meant for<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.</p>
   <p n="179"><said who="#Alice">“ Yes ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>loudly .</p>
   <p n="180"><said who="#the_Queen">“ Come on , then ! ”</said>roared<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>.</p>
   <p n="181"><said who="#the_Queen">“ It 's — it 's a very fine day ! ”</said>said a timid voice to<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>. She was walking by<persName corresp="#the_White_Rabbit">the White Rabbit</persName>, who was peeping anxiously into her face .</p>
   <p n="182"><said who="#Alice">“ Very , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.<said who="#Alice">“ Where 's<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>? ”</said></p>
   <p n="183"><said who="#the_Rabbit">“ Hush ! Hush ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>.<said who="#the_Rabbit">“ She 's under sentence of execution . ”</said></p>
   <p n="184"><said who="#Alice">“ What for ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.</p>
   <p n="185"><said who="#the_Rabbit">“ She boxed<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>'s ears — ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Rabbit">the Rabbit</persName>began .</p>
   <p n="186"><said who="#the_Queen">“ Get to your places ! ”</said>shouted<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>in a voice of thunder , and people began running about in all directions , tumbling up against each other . However , they got settled down in a minute or two , and the game began .</p>
   <p n="187"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life ; it was all ridges and furrows . The croquet balls were live hedgehogs , and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to double themselves up and stand on their hands and feet , to make the arches .</p>
   <p n="188">The players all played at once , without waiting for turns , quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs ; and in a very short time ,<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting ,<said who="#the_Queen">“ Off with his head ! ”</said>or “ Off with her head ! ” about once in a minute .</p>
   <p n="189"><said who="#Alice">“ They 're dreadfully fond of beheading people here , ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>;<said who="#Alice">“ the great wonder is that there 's anyone left alive ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="190">She was looking about for some way of escape , when she noticed a curious appearance in the air .<said who="#the_Queen">“ It 's the Cheshire-Cat , ”</said>she said to herself ;<said who="#the_Queen">“ now I shall have somebody to talk to . ”</said></p>
   <p n="191"><said who="#the_Cat">“ How are you getting on ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Cat">the Cat</persName>.</p>
   <p n="192"><said who="#Alice">“ I do n't think they play at all fairly , ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>said , in a rather complaining tone ;<said who="#Alice">“ and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can n't hear oneself speak — and they do n't seem to have any rules in particular . ”</said></p>
   <p n="193"><said who="#the_Cat">“ How do you like<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Cat">the Cat</persName>in a low voice .</p>
   <p n="194"><said who="#Alice">“ Not at all , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.</p>

   </figure>
   <p n="195"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on . So she went off in search of her hedgehog . The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog , which seemed to<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other ; the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden , where<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>could see it trying , in a helpless sort of way , to fly up into a tree . She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under her arm , that it might not escape again .</p>
   <p n="196">Just then<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>ran across<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>( who was now out of prison ) . She tucked her arm affectionately into<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>'s and they walked off together .<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper . She was a little startled , however , when she heard the voice of<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>close to her ear .<said who="#the_Duchess">“ You 're thinking about something , my dear , and that makes you forget to talk . ”</said></p>
   <p n="197"><said who="#Alice">“ The game 's going on rather better now , ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>said , by way of keeping up the conversation a little .</p>
   <p n="198"><said who="#the_Duchess">“ ‘ Tis so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>;<said who="#the_Duchess">“ and the moral of that is — ‘ Oh , ‘ tis love , ‘ tis love that makes the world go ‘ round ! ’ ”</said></p>
   <p n="199"><said who="#Alice">“ Somebody said , ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>whispered ,<said who="#Alice">“ that it 's done by everybody minding his own business ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="200"><said who="#Alice">“ Ah , well ! It means much the same thing , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>, digging her sharp little chin into<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>'s shoulder , as she added “ and the moral of that is — ‘ Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves . ’ ”</p>
   <p n="201">To<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>'s great surprise ,<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>'s arm that was linked into hers began to tremble .<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>looked up and there stood<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>in front of them , with her arms folded , frowning like a thunderstorm !</p>
   <p n="202"><said who="#the_Queen">“ Now , I give you fair warning , ”</said>shouted<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>, stamping on the ground as she spoke ,<said who="#the_Queen">“ either you or your head must be off , and that in about half no time . Take your choice ! ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Duchess">The Duchess</persName>took her choice , and was gone in a moment .</p>
   <p n="203"><said who="#the_Queen">“ Let 's go on with the game , ”</said><persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>said to<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>; and<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>was too much frightened to say a word , but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground .</p>
   <p n="204">All the time they were playing ,<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>never left off quarreling with the other players and shouting ,<said who="#the_Queen">“ Off with his head ! ”</said>or “ Off with her head ! ” By the end of half an hour or so , all the players , except<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>,<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>and<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>, were in custody of the soldiers and under sentence of execution .</p>
   <p n="205">Then<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>left off , quite out of breath , and walked away with<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.</p>
   <p n="206"><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>heard<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>say in a low voice to the company generally ,<said who="#the_King">“ You are all pardoned . ”</said></p>
   <p n="207">Suddenly the cry “ The Trial 's beginning ! ” was heard in the distance , and<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>ran along with the others .</p>
   <p>IX — WHO STOLE THE TARTS ?</p>
   <p n="208"><persName corresp="#the_King">The King</persName>and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived , with a great crowd assembled about them — all sorts of little birds and beasts , as well as the whole pack of cards : the Knave was standing before them , in chains , with a soldier on each side to guard him ; and near<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>was<persName corresp="#the_White_Rabbit">the White Rabbit</persName>, with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other . In the very middle of the court was a table , with a large dish of tarts upon it .<said who="#Alice">“ I wish they 'd get the trial done , ”</said><persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>thought ,<said who="#Alice">“ and hand ‘ round the refreshments ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="209">The judge , by the way , was<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>and he wore his crown over his great wig .<said who="#Alice">“ That 's the jury-box , ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>;<said who="#Alice">“ and those twelve creatures ( some were animals and some were birds ) I suppose they are the jurors . ”</said></p>
   <p n="210">Just then<persName corresp="#the_White_Rabbit">the White Rabbit</persName>cried out “ Silence in the court ! ”</p>
   <p n="211"><said who="#the_King">“ Herald , read the accusation ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>.</p>

   </figure>
   <p n="212">On this ,<persName corresp="#the_White_Rabbit">the White Rabbit</persName>blew three blasts on the trumpet , then unrolled the parchment-scroll and read as follows :</p>
   <p n="213"><said who="#the_White_Rabbit">“<persName corresp="#the_Queen">The Queen</persName>of Hearts , she made some tarts , All on a summer day ; The Knave of Hearts , he stole those tarts And took them quite away ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="214"><said who="#the_King">“ Call the first witness , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>; and<persName corresp="#the_White_Rabbit">the White Rabbit</persName>blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out ,<said who="#the_King">“ First witness ! ”</said></p>
   <p n="215">The first witness was<persName corresp="#the_Hatter">the Hatter</persName>. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other .</p>
   <p n="216"><said who="#the_King">“ You ought to have finished , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>.<said who="#the_King">“ When did you begin ? ”</said></p>
   <p n="217"><persName corresp="#the_Hatter">The Hatter</persName>looked at the March<persName corresp="#Hare">Hare</persName>, who had followed him into the court , arm in arm with the Dormouse .<said who="#Hare">“ Fourteenth of March , I think it was , ”</said>he said .</p>
   <p n="218"><said who="#the_King">“ Give your evidence , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>,<said who="#the_King">“ and do n't be nervous , or I 'll have you executed on the spot . ”</said></p>
   <p n="219">This did not seem to encourage the witness at all ; he kept shifting from one foot to the other , looking uneasily at<persName corresp="#the_Queen">the Queen</persName>, and , in his confusion , he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread and butter .</p>
   <p n="220">Just at this moment<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>felt a very curious sensation — she was beginning to grow larger again .</p>
   <p n="221">The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter and went down on one knee .<said who="#the_King">“ I 'm a poor man , Your Majesty , ”</said>he began .</p>
   <p n="222"><said who="#the_King">“ You 're a very poor speaker , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>.</p>
   <p n="223"><said who="#the_King">“ You may go , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>, and<persName corresp="#the_Hatter">the Hatter</persName>hurriedly left the court .</p>
   <p n="224"><said who="#the_King">“ Call the next witness ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>.</p>
   <p n="225">The next witness was<persName corresp="#the_Duchess">the Duchess</persName>'s cook . She carried the pepper-box in her hand and the people near the door began sneezing all at once .</p>
   <p n="226"><said who="#the_King">“ Give your evidence , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>.</p>
   <p n="227"><said who="#the_cook">“ Sha'n ' t , ”</said>said the cook .</p>
   <p n="228"><persName corresp="#the_King">The King</persName>looked anxiously at<persName corresp="#the_White_Rabbit">the White Rabbit</persName>, who said , in a low voice ,<said who="#the_King">“ Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness . ”</said></p>

   <p n="230"><said who="#the_cook">“ Pepper , mostly , ”</said>said the cook .</p>

   <p n="234"><said who="#Alice">“ Here ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>. She jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box , upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below .</p>
   <p n="235"><said who="#the_White_Rabbit">“ Oh , I beg your pardon ! ”</said>she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay .</p>
   <p n="236"><said who="#Alice">“ The trial cannot proceed , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>, “ until all the jurymen are back in their proper places — all , ” he repeated with great emphasis , looking hard at<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>.</p>

   <p n="243"><persName corresp="#the_King">The King</persName>turned pale and shut his note-book hastily .<said who="#the_Queen">“ Consider your verdict , ”</said>he said to the jury , in a low , trembling voice .</p>

   <p n="245"><said who="#the_King">“ Please , Your Majesty , ”</said>said the Knave ,<said who="#the_King">“ I did n't write it and they can n't prove that I did ; there 's no name signed at the end . ”</said></p>

   <p n="247"><said who="#the_King">“ Read them , ”</said>he added , turning to<persName corresp="#the_White_Rabbit">the White Rabbit</persName>.</p>
   <p n="248">There was dead silence in the court whilst<persName corresp="#the_White_Rabbit">the White Rabbit</persName>read out the verses .</p>
   <p n="249"><said who="#the_King">“ That 's the most important piece of evidence we 've heard yet , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_King">the King</persName>.</p>

   <p n="258">At this , the whole pack rose up in the air and came flying down upon her ; she gave a little scream , half of fright and half of anger , and tried to beat them off , and found herself lying on the bank , with her head in the lap of her sister , who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face .</p>
   <p n="259"><said>“ Wake up ,<persName corresp="#Alice">Alice</persName>dear ! ”</said>said her sister .<said who="#Alice">“ Why , what a long sleep you 've had ! ”</said></p>
