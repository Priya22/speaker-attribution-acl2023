  <body>
   <div type="part" n="1">
    <p n="1">At the little town of Vevey , in Switzerland , there is a particularly comfortable hotel . There are , indeed , many hotels , for the entertainment of tourists is the business of the place , which , as many travelers will remember , is seated upon the edge of a remarkably blue lake — a lake that it behooves every tourist to visit . The shore of the lake presents an unbroken array of establishments of this order , of every category , from the “ grand hotel ” of the newest fashion , with a chalk-white front , a hundred balconies , and a dozen flags flying from its roof , to the little Swiss pension of an elder day , with its name inscribed in German-looking lettering upon a pink or yellow wall and an awkward summerhouse in the angle of the garden . One of the hotels at Vevey , however , is famous , even classical , being distinguished from many of its upstart neighbors by an air both of luxury and of maturity . In this region , in the month of June , American travelers are extremely numerous ; it may be said , indeed , that Vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics of an American watering place . There are sights and sounds which evoke a vision , an echo , of Newport and Saratoga . There is a flitting hither and thither of “ stylish ” young girls , a rustling of muslin flounces , a rattle of dance music in the morning hours , a sound of high-pitched voices at all times . You receive an impression of these things at the excellent inn of the “ Trois Couronnes ” and are transported in fancy to the Ocean House or to Congress Hall . But at the “ Trois Couronnes , ” it must be added , there are other features that are much at variance with these suggestions : neat German waiters , who look like secretaries of legation ; Russian princesses sitting in the garden ; little Polish boys walking about held by the hand , with their governors ; a view of the sunny crest of the Dent du Midi and the picturesque towers of the Castle of Chillon .</p>
    <p n="2">I hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were uppermost in the mind of a young American , who , two or three years ago , sat in the garden of the “ Trois Couronnes , ” looking about him , rather idly , at some of the graceful objects I have mentioned . It was a beautiful summer morning , and in whatever fashion the young American looked at things , they must have seemed to him charming . He had come from Geneva the day before by the little steamer , to see his aunt , who was staying at the hotel — Geneva having been for a long time his place of residence . But his aunt had a headache — his aunt had almost always a headache — and now she was shut up in her room , smelling camphor , so that he was at liberty to wander about . He was some seven-and-twenty years of age ; when his friends spoke of him , they usually said that he was at Geneva “ studying . ” When his enemies spoke of him , they said — but , after all , he had no enemies ; he was an extremely amiable fellow , and universally liked . What I should say is , simply , that when certain persons spoke of him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so much time at Geneva was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who lived there — a foreign lady — a person older than himself . Very few Americans — indeed , I think none — had ever seen this lady , about whom there were some singular stories . But<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>had an old attachment for the little metropolis of Calvinism ; he had been put to school there as a boy , and he had afterward gone to college there — circumstances which had led to his forming a great many youthful friendships . Many of these he had kept , and they were a source of great satisfaction to him .</p>
    <p n="3">After knocking at his aunt 's door and learning that she was indisposed , he had taken a walk about the town , and then he had come in to his breakfast . He had now finished his breakfast ; but he was drinking a small cup of coffee , which had been served to him on a little table in the garden by one of the waiters who looked like an attache . At last he finished his coffee and lit a cigarette . Presently a small boy came walking along the path — an urchin of nine or ten . The child , who was diminutive for his years , had an aged expression of countenance , a pale complexion , and sharp little features . He was dressed in knickerbockers , with red stockings , which displayed his poor little spindle-shanks ; he also wore a brilliant red cravat . He carried in his hand a long alpenstock , the sharp point of which he thrust into everything that he approached — the flowerbeds , the garden benches , the trains of the ladies ’ dresses . In front of<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>he paused , looking at him with a pair of bright , penetrating little eyes .</p>
    <p n="4"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Will you give me a lump of sugar ? ”</said>he asked in a sharp , hard little voice — a voice immature and yet , somehow , not young .</p>
    <p n="5"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>glanced at the small table near him , on which his coffee service rested , and saw that several morsels of sugar remained .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Yes , you may take one , ”</said>he answered ;<said who="#Winterbourne">“ but I do n't think sugar is good for little boys . ”</said></p>
    <p n="6">This little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of the coveted fragments , two of which he buried in the pocket of his knickerbockers , depositing the other as promptly in another place . He poked his alpenstock , lance-fashion , into<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s bench and tried to crack the lump of sugar with his teeth .</p>
    <p n="7"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Oh , blazes ; it 's har-r-d ! ”</said>he exclaimed , pronouncing the adjective in a peculiar manner .</p>
    <p n="8"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of claiming him as a fellow countryman .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Take care you do n't hurt your teeth , ”</said>he said , paternally .</p>
    <p n="9"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I have n't got any teeth to hurt . They have all come out . I have only got seven teeth . My mother counted them last night , and one came out right afterward . She said she 'd slap me if any more came out . I can n't help it . It 's this old Europe . It 's the climate that makes them come out . In America they did n't come out . It 's these hotels . ”</said></p>
    <p n="10"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was much amused .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ If you eat three lumps of sugar , your mother will certainly slap you , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="11"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ She 's got to give me some candy , then , ”</said>rejoined his young interlocutor .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I can n't get any candy here — any American candy . American candy 's the best candy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="12"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ And are American little boys the best little boys ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="13"><said who="#the_child">“ I do n't know . I 'm an American boy , ”</said>said the child .</p>
    <p n="14"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I see you are one of the best ! ”</said>laughed<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="15"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Are you an American man ? ”</said>pursued this vivacious infant . And then , on<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s affirmative reply — “ American men are the best , ” he declared .</p>
    <p n="16">His companion thanked him for the compliment , and the child , who had now got astride of his alpenstock , stood looking about him , while he attacked a second lump of sugar .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>wondered if he himself had been like this in his infancy , for he had been brought to Europe at about this age .</p>
    <p n="17"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Here comes my sister ! ”</said>cried the child in a moment .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ She 's an American girl . ”</said></p>
    <p n="18"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ American girls are the best girls , ”</said>he said cheerfully to his young companion .</p>
    <p n="19"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ My sister ai n't the best ! ”</said>the child declared .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ She 's always blowing at me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="20"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I imagine that is your fault , not hers , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>. The young lady meanwhile had drawn near . She was dressed in white muslin , with a hundred frills and flounces , and knots of pale-colored ribbon . She was bareheaded , but she balanced in her hand a large parasol , with a deep border of embroidery ; and she was strikingly , admirably pretty .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ How pretty they are ! ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, straightening himself in his seat , as if he were prepared to rise .</p>
    <p n="21">The young lady paused in front of his bench , near the parapet of the garden , which overlooked the lake . The little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole , by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little .</p>
    <p n="22"><said who="#Winterbourne">“<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>, ”</said>said the young lady ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ what ARE you doing ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="23"><said who="#Randolph">“ I 'm going up the Alps , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>.<said who="#Randolph">“ This is the way ! ”</said>And he gave another little jump , scattering the pebbles about<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s ears .</p>
    <p n="24"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ That 's the way they come down , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="25"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ He 's an American man ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>, in his little hard voice .</p>
    <p n="26">The young lady gave no heed to this announcement , but looked straight at her brother .<said who="#Randolph">“ Well , I guess you had better be quiet , ”</said>she simply observed .</p>
    <p n="27">It seemed to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>that he had been in a manner presented . He got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl , throwing away his cigarette .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ This little boy and I have made acquaintance , ”</said>he said , with great civility . In Geneva , as he had been perfectly aware , a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions ; but here at Vevey , what conditions could be better than these ?— a pretty American girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden . This pretty American girl , however , on hearing<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s observation , simply glanced at him ; she then turned her head and looked over the parapet , at the lake and the opposite mountains . He wondered whether he had gone too far , but he decided that he must advance farther , rather than retreat . While he was thinking of something else to say , the young lady turned to the little boy again .</p>
    <p n="28"><said who="#Randolph">“ I should like to know where you got that pole , ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="29"><said who="#Randolph">“ I bought it , ”</said>responded<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>.</p>
    <p n="30"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ You do n't mean to say you 're going to take it to Italy ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="31"><said who="#the_child">“ Yes , I am going to take it to Italy , ”</said>the child declared .</p>
    <p n="32">The young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon . Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Well , I guess you had better leave it somewhere , ”</said>she said after a moment .</p>
    <p n="33"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Are you going to Italy ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>inquired in a tone of great respect .</p>
    <p n="34">The young lady glanced at him again .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Yes , sir , ”</said>she replied . And she said nothing more .</p>
    <p n="35"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Are you — a — going over the Simplon ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>pursued , a little embarrassed .</p>
    <p n="36"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I do n't know , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I suppose it 's some mountain .<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>, what mountain are we going over ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="37"><said who="#Randolph">“ Going where ? ”</said>the child demanded .</p>
    <p n="38"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ To Italy , ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>explained .</p>
    <p n="39"><said who="#Randolph">“ I do n't know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>.<said who="#Randolph">“ I do n't want to go to Italy . I want to go to America . ”</said></p>
    <p n="40"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Oh , Italy is a beautiful place ! ”</said>rejoined the young man .</p>
    <p n="41"><said who="#Randolph">“ Can you get candy there ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>loudly inquired .</p>
    <p n="42"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I hope not , ”</said>said his sister .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I guess you have had enough candy , and mother thinks so too . ”</said></p>
    <p n="43"><said who="#Randolph">“ I have n't had any for ever so long — for a hundred weeks ! ”</said>cried the boy , still jumping about .</p>
    <p n="44">The young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again ; and<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view . He was ceasing to be embarrassed , for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself . There had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion ; she was evidently neither offended nor flattered . If she looked another way when he spoke to her , and seemed not particularly to hear him , this was simply her habit , her manner . Yet , as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest in the view , with which she appeared quite unacquainted , she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance ; and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking . It was not , however , what would have been called an immodest glance , for the young girl 's eyes were singularly honest and fresh . They were wonderfully pretty eyes ; and , indeed ,<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywoman 's various features — her complexion , her nose , her ears , her teeth . He had a great relish for feminine beauty ; he was addicted to observing and analyzing it ; and as regards this young lady 's face he made several observations . It was not at all insipid , but it was not exactly expressive ; and though it was eminently delicate ,<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>mentally accused it — very forgivingly — of a want of finish . He thought it very possible that Master<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>'s sister was a coquette ; he was sure she had a spirit of her own ; but in her bright , sweet , superficial little visage there was no mockery , no irony . Before long it became obvious that she was much disposed toward conversation . She told him that they were going to Rome for the winter — she and her mother and<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>. She asked him if he was a “ real American ” ; she should n't have taken him for one ; he seemed more like a German — this was said after a little hesitation — especially when he spoke .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, laughing , answered that he had met Germans who spoke like Americans , but that he had not , so far as he remembered , met an American who spoke like a German . Then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted . She answered that she liked standing up and walking about ; but she presently sat down . She told him she was from New York State —<said who="#Winterbourne">“ if you know where that is . ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>learned more about her by catching hold of her small , slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes by his side .</p>
    <p n="45"><said who="#Randolph">“ Tell me your name , my boy , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="46"><said who="#Winterbourne">“<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>C.<persName corresp="#Miller">Miller</persName>, ”</said>said the boy sharply .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ And I 'll tell you her name ; ”</said>and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister .</p>
    <p n="47"><said who="#Randolph">“ You had better wait till you are asked ! ”</said>said this young lady calmly .</p>
    <p n="48"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I should like very much to know your name , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="49"><said who="#Randolph">“ Her name is<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy Miller</persName>! ”</said>cried the child .<said who="#Randolph">“ But that is n't her real name ; that is n't her name on her cards . ”</said></p>
    <p n="50"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“ It 's a pity you have n't got one of my cards ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>.</p>
    <p n="51"><said who="#Randolph">“ Her real name is Annie P.<persName corresp="#Miller">Miller</persName>, ”</said>the boy went on .</p>
    <p n="52"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Ask him HIS name , ”</said>said his sister , indicating<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="53">But on this point<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>seemed perfectly indifferent ; he continued to supply information with regard to his own family .<said who="#Randolph">“ My father 's name is Ezra B.<persName corresp="#Miller">Miller</persName>, ”</said>he announced .<said who="#Randolph">“ My father ai n't in Europe ; my father 's in a better place than Europe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="54"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the child had been taught to intimate that Mr.<persName corresp="#Miller">Miller</persName>had been removed to the sphere of celestial reward . But<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>immediately added ,<said who="#Miller">“ My father 's in Schenectady . He 's got a big business . My father 's rich , you bet ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="55"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“ Well ! ”</said>ejaculated<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>, lowering her parasol and looking at the embroidered border .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>presently released the child , who departed , dragging his alpenstock along the path .<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ He does n't like Europe , ”</said>said the young girl .<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ He wants to go back . ”</said></p>
    <p n="56"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ To Schenectady , you mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="57"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“ Yes ; he wants to go right home . He has n't got any boys here . There is one boy here , but he always goes round with a teacher ; they wo n't let him play . ”</said></p>
    <p n="58"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ And your brother has n't any teacher ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>inquired .</p>
    <p n="59"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“<persName>Mother</persName>thought of getting him one , to travel round with us . There was a lady told her of a very good teacher ; an American lady — perhaps you know her — Mrs. Sanders . I think she came from Boston . She told her of this teacher , and we thought of getting him to travel round with us . But<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>said he did n't want a teacher traveling round with us . He said he would n't have lessons when he was in the cars . And we ARE in the cars about half the time . There was an English lady we met in the cars — I think her name was Miss Featherstone ; perhaps you know her . She wanted to know why I did n't give<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>lessons — give him ‘ instruction , ’ she called it . I guess he could give me more instruction than I could give him . He 's very smart . ”</said></p>
    <p n="60"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>;<said who="#Winterbourne">“ he seems very smart . ”</said></p>
    <p n="61"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“<persName>Mother</persName>'s going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to Italy . Can you get good teachers in Italy ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="62"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Very good , I should think , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="63"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Or else she 's going to find some school . He ought to learn some more . He 's only nine . He 's going to college . ”</said>And in this way<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>continued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other topics . She sat there with her extremely pretty hands , ornamented with very brilliant rings , folded in her lap , and with her pretty eyes now resting upon those of<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, now wandering over the garden , the people who passed by , and the beautiful view . She talked to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>as if she had known him a long time . He found it very pleasant . It was many years since he had heard a young girl talk so much . It might have been said of this unknown young lady , who had come and sat down beside him upon a bench , that she chattered . She was very quiet ; she sat in a charming , tranquil attitude ; but her lips and her eyes were constantly moving . She had a soft , slender , agreeable voice , and her tone was decidedly sociable . She gave<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>a history of her movements and intentions and those of her mother and brother , in Europe , and enumerated , in particular , the various hotels at which they had stopped .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ That English lady in the cars , ”</said>she said —<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ Miss Featherstone — asked me if we did n't all live in hotels in America . I told her I had never been in so many hotels in my life as since I came to Europe . I have never seen so many — it 's nothing but hotels . ”</said>But<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>did not make this remark with a querulous accent ; she appeared to be in the best humor with everything . She declared that the hotels were very good , when once you got used to their ways , and that Europe was perfectly sweet . She was not disappointed — not a bit . Perhaps it was because she had heard so much about it before . She had ever so many intimate friends that had been there ever so many times . And then she had had ever so many dresses and things from Paris . Whenever she put on a Paris dress she felt as if she were in Europe .</p>
    <p n="64"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ It was a kind of a wishing cap , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="65"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>without examining this analogy ; “ it always made me wish I was here . But I need n't have done that for dresses . I am sure they send all the pretty ones to America ; you see the most frightful things here . The only thing I do n't like , ” she proceeded , “ is the society . There is n't any society ; or , if there is , I do n't know where it keeps itself . Do you ? I suppose there is some society somewhere , but I have n't seen anything of it . I 'm very fond of society , and I have always had a great deal of it . I do n't mean only in Schenectady , but in New York . I used to go to New York every winter . In New York I had lots of society . Last winter I had seventeen dinners given me ; and three of them were by gentlemen , ” added<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy Miller</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ I have more friends in New York than in Schenectady — more gentleman friends ; and more young lady friends too , ”</said>she resumed in a moment . She paused again for an instant ; she was looking at<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and in her light , slightly monotonous smile .<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ I have always had , ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ a great deal of gentlemen 's society . ”</said></p>
    <p n="66">Poor<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was amused , perplexed , and decidedly charmed . He had never yet heard a young girl express herself in just this fashion ; never , at least , save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of demonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment . And yet was he to accuse<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>of actual or potential inconduite , as they said at Geneva ? He felt that he had lived at Geneva so long that he had lost a good deal ; he had become dishabituated to the American tone . Never , indeed , since he had grown old enough to appreciate things , had he encountered a young American girl of so pronounced a type as this . Certainly she was very charming , but how deucedly sociable ! Was she simply a pretty girl from New York State ? Were they all like that , the pretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemen 's society ? Or was she also a designing , an audacious , an unscrupulous young person ?<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>had lost his instinct in this matter , and his reason could not help him .<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>looked extremely innocent . Some people had told him that , after all , American girls were exceedingly innocent ; and others had told him that , after all , they were not . He was inclined to think<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>was a flirt — a pretty American flirt . He had never , as yet , had any relations with young ladies of this category . He had known , here in Europe , two or three women — persons older than<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>, and provided , for respectability 's sake , with husbands — who were great coquettes — dangerous , terrible women , with whom one 's relations were liable to take a serious turn . But this young girl was not a coquette in that sense ; she was very unsophisticated ; she was only a pretty American flirt .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was almost grateful for having found the formula that applied to<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>. He leaned back in his seat ; he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had ever seen ; he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations of one 's intercourse with a pretty American flirt . It presently became apparent that he was on the way to learn .</p>
    <p n="67"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Have you been to that old castle ? ”</said>asked the young girl , pointing with her parasol to the far-gleaming walls of the Chateau de Chillon .</p>
    <p n="68"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Yes , formerly , more than once , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.<said who="#Winterbourne">“ You too , I suppose , have seen it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="69"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ No ; we have n't been there . I want to go there dreadfully . Of course I mean to go there . I would n't go away from here without having seen that old castle . ”</said></p>
    <p n="70"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ It 's a very pretty excursion , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ and very easy to make . You can drive , you know , or you can go by the little steamer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="71"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“ You can go in the cars , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>.</p>
    <p n="72"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Yes ; you can go in the cars , ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>assented .</p>
    <p n="73"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Our courier says they take you right up to the castle , ”</said>the young girl continued .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ We were going last week , but my mother gave out . She suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia . She said she could n't go .<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>would n't go either ; he says he does n't think much of old castles . But I guess we 'll go this week , if we can get<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="74"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Your brother is not interested in ancient monuments ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>inquired , smiling .</p>
    <p n="75"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“ He says he do n't care much about old castles . He 's only nine . He wants to stay at the hotel .<persName>Mother</persName>'s afraid to leave him alone , and the courier wo n't stay with him ; so we have n't been to many places . But it will be too bad if we do n't go up there . ”</said>And<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>pointed again at the Chateau de Chillon .</p>
    <p n="76"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I should think it might be arranged , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Could n't you get some one to stay for the afternoon with<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="77"><persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>looked at him a moment , and then , very placidly ,<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ I wish YOU would stay with him ! ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="78"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>hesitated a moment .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I should much rather go to Chillon with you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="79"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“ With me ? ”</said>asked the young girl with the same placidity .</p>
    <p n="80">She did n't rise , blushing , as a young girl at Geneva would have done ; and yet<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, conscious that he had been very bold , thought it possible she was offended .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ With your mother , ”</said>he answered very respectfully .</p>
    <p n="81">But it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ I guess my mother wo n't go , after all , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ She do n't like to ride round in the afternoon . But did you really mean what you said just now — that you would like to go up there ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="82"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Most earnestly , ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>declared .</p>
    <p n="83"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“ Then we may arrange it . If mother will stay with<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>, I guess<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>will . ”</said></p>
    <p n="84"><said who="#Winterbourne">“<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>? ”</said>the young man inquired .</p>
    <p n="85"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>'s our courier . He does n't like to stay with<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>; he 's the most fastidious man I ever saw . But he 's a splendid courier . I guess he 'll stay at home with<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>if mother does , and then we can go to the castle . ”</said></p>
    <p n="86"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>reflected for an instant as lucidly as possible — “ we ” could only mean<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>and himself . This program seemed almost too agreeable for credence ; he felt as if he ought to kiss the young lady 's hand . Possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project , but at this moment another person , presumably<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>, appeared . A tall , handsome man , with superb whiskers , wearing a velvet morning coat and a brilliant watch chain , approached<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>, looking sharply at her companion .<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>with the friendliest accent .</p>
    <p n="87"><persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>had looked at<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>from head to foot ; he now bowed gravely to the young lady .<said who="#Eugenio">“ I have the honor to inform mademoiselle that luncheon is upon the table . ”</said></p>
    <p n="88"><persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>slowly rose .<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ See here ,<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>! ”</said>she said ;<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ I 'm going to that old castle , anyway . ”</said></p>
    <p n="89"><said who="#Eugenio">“ To the Chateau de Chillon , mademoiselle ? ”</said>the courier inquired .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Mademoiselle has made arrangements ? ”</said>he added in a tone which struck<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>as very impertinent .</p>
    <p n="90"><persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>'s tone apparently threw , even to<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>'s own apprehension , a slightly ironical light upon the young girl 's situation . She turned to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, blushing a little — a very little .<said who="#Eugenio">“ You wo n't back out ? ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="91"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I shall not be happy till we go ! ”</said>he protested .</p>
    <p n="92"><said who="#Eugenio">“ And you are staying in this hotel ? ”</said>she went on .<said who="#Eugenio">“ And you are really an American ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="93">The courier stood looking at<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>offensively . The young man , at least , thought his manner of looking an offense to<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>; it conveyed an imputation that she “ picked up ” acquaintances .<said who="#Eugenio">“ I shall have the honor of presenting to you a person who will tell you all about me , ”</said>he said , smiling and referring to his aunt .</p>
    <p n="94"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“ Oh , well , we 'll go some day , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>. And she gave him a smile and turned away . She put up her parasol and walked back to the inn beside<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>.<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>stood looking after her ; and as she moved away , drawing her muslin furbelows over the gravel , said to himself that she had the tournure of a princess .</p>
    <p n="95">He had , however , engaged to do more than proved feasible , in promising to present his aunt ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>, to<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>. As soon as the former lady had got better of her headache , he waited upon her in her apartment ; and , after the proper inquiries in regard to her health , he asked her if she had observed in the hotel an American family — a mamma , a daughter , and a little boy .</p>
    <p n="96"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ And a courier ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ Oh yes , I have observed them . Seen them — heard them — and kept out of their way . ”</said><persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>was a widow with a fortune ; a person of much distinction , who frequently intimated that , if she were not so dreadfully liable to sick headaches , she would probably have left a deeper impress upon her time . She had a long , pale face , a high nose , and a great deal of very striking white hair , which she wore in large puffs and rouleaux over the top of her head . She had two sons married in New York and another who was now in Europe . This young man was amusing himself at Hamburg , and , though he was on his travels , was rarely perceived to visit any particular city at the moment selected by his mother for her own appearance there . Her nephew , who had come up to Vevey expressly to see her , was therefore more attentive than those who , as she said , were nearer to her . He had imbibed at Geneva the idea that one must always be attentive to one 's aunt .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>had not seen him for many years , and she was greatly pleased with him , manifesting her approbation by initiating him into many of the secrets of that social sway which , as she gave him to understand , she exerted in the American capital . She admitted that she was very exclusive ; but , if he were acquainted with New York , he would see that one had to be . And her picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of that city , which she presented to him in many different lights , was , to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s imagination , almost oppressively striking .</p>
    <p n="97">He immediately perceived , from her tone , that<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>'s place in the social scale was low .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I am afraid you do n't approve of them , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="98"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ They are very common , ”</said><persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>declared .<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ They are the sort of Americans that one does one 's duty by not — not accepting . ”</said></p>
    <p n="99"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Ah , you do n't accept them ? ”</said>said the young man .</p>
    <p n="100"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ I can n't , my dear Frederick . I would if I could , but I can n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="101"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ The young girl is very pretty , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>in a moment .</p>
    <p n="102"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ Of course she 's pretty . But she is very common . ”</said></p>
    <p n="103"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I see what you mean , of course , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>after another pause .</p>
    <p n="104"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ She has that charming look that they all have , ”</said>his aunt resumed .<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ I can n't think where they pick it up ; and she dresses in perfection — no , you do n't know how well she dresses . I can n't think where they get their taste . ”</said></p>
    <p n="105"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ But , my dear aunt , she is not , after all , a Comanche savage . ”</said></p>
    <p n="106"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ She is a young lady , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>,<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ who has an intimacy with her mamma 's courier . ”</said></p>
    <p n="107"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ An intimacy with the courier ? ”</said>the young man demanded .</p>
    <p n="108"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ Oh , the mother is just as bad ! They treat the courier like a familiar friend — like a gentleman . I should n't wonder if he dines with them . Very likely they have never seen a man with such good manners , such fine clothes , so like a gentleman . He probably corresponds to the young lady 's idea of a count . He sits with them in the garden in the evening . I think he smokes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="109"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>listened with interest to these disclosures ; they helped him to make up his mind about<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy</persName>. Evidently she was rather wild .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Well , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I am not a courier , and yet she was very charming to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="110"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ You had better have said at first , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>with dignity ,<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ that you had made her acquaintance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="111"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ We simply met in the garden , and we talked a bit . ”</said></p>
    <p n="112"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ Tout bonnement ! And pray what did you say ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="113"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I said I should take the liberty of introducing her to my admirable aunt . ”</said></p>
    <p n="114"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ I am much obliged to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="115"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ It was to guarantee my respectability , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="116"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ And pray who is to guarantee hers ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="117"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Ah , you are cruel ! ”</said>said the young man .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ She 's a very nice young girl . ”</said></p>
    <p n="118"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ You do n't say that as if you believed it , ”</said><persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>observed .</p>
    <p n="119"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ She is completely uncultivated , ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>went on .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ But she is wonderfully pretty , and , in short , she is very nice . To prove that I believe it , I am going to take her to the Chateau de Chillon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="120"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ You two are going off there together ? I should say it proved just the contrary . How long had you known her , may I ask , when this interesting project was formed ? You have n't been twenty-four hours in the house . ”</said></p>
    <p n="121"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I have known her half an hour ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, smiling .</p>
    <p n="122"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ Dear me ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ What a dreadful girl ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="123">Her nephew was silent for some moments .<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ You really think , then , ”</said>he began earnestly , and with a desire for trustworthy information —<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ you really think that — ”</said>But he paused again .</p>
    <p n="124"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Think what , sir ? ”</said>said his aunt .</p>
    <p n="125"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ That she is the sort of young lady who expects a man , sooner or later , to carry her off ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="126"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I have n't the least idea what such young ladies expect a man to do . But I really think that you had better not meddle with little American girls that are uncultivated , as you call them . You have lived too long out of the country . You will be sure to make some great mistake . You are too innocent . ”</said></p>
    <p n="127"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ My dear aunt , I am not so innocent , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, smiling and curling his mustache .</p>
    <p n="128"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ You are guilty too , then ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="129"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>continued to curl his mustache meditatively .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ You wo n't let the poor girl know you then ? ”</said>he asked at last .</p>
    <p n="130"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ Is it literally true that she is going to the Chateau de Chillon with you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="131"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I think that she fully intends it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="132"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ Then , my dear Frederick , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>,<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ I must decline the honor of her acquaintance . I am an old woman , but I am not too old , thank Heaven , to be shocked ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="133"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ But do n't they all do these things — the young girls in America ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>inquired .</p>
    <p n="134"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>stared a moment .<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ I should like to see my granddaughters do them ! ”</said>she declared grimly .</p>
    <p n="135">This seemed to throw some light upon the matter , for<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>remembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in New York were “ tremendous flirts . ” If , therefore ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>exceeded the liberal margin allowed to these young ladies , it was probable that anything might be expected of her .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was impatient to see her again , and he was vexed with himself that , by instinct , he should not appreciate her justly .</p>
    <p n="136">Though he was impatient to see her , he hardly knew what he should say to her about his aunt 's refusal to become acquainted with her ; but he discovered , promptly enough , that with<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>there was no great need of walking on tiptoe . He found her that evening in the garden , wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph , and swinging to and fro the largest fan he had ever beheld . It was ten o'clock . He had dined with his aunt , had been sitting with her since dinner , and had just taken leave of her till the morrow .<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>seemed very glad to see him ; she declared it was the longest evening she had ever passed .</p>
    <p n="137"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Have you been all alone ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="138"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I have been walking round with mother . But mother gets tired walking round , ”</said>she answered .</p>
    <p n="139"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Has she gone to bed ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="140"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ No ; she does n't like to go to bed , ”</said>said the young girl .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ She does n't sleep — not three hours . She says she does n't know how she lives . She 's dreadfully nervous . I guess she sleeps more than she thinks . She 's gone somewhere after<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>; she wants to try to get him to go to bed . He does n't like to go to bed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="141"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Let us hope she will persuade him , ”</said>observed<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="142"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ She will talk to him all she can ; but he does n't like her to talk to him , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy</persName>, opening her fan .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ She 's going to try to get<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>to talk to him . But he is n't afraid of<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>.<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>'s a splendid courier , but he can n't make much impression on<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>! I do n't believe he 'll go to bed before eleven . ”</said>It appeared that<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>'s vigil was in fact triumphantly prolonged , for<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>strolled about with the young girl for some time without meeting her mother .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I have been looking round for that lady you want to introduce me to , ”</said>his companion resumed .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ She 's your aunt . ”</said>Then , on<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s admitting the fact and expressing some curiosity as to how she had learned it , she said she had heard all about<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>from the chambermaid . She was very quiet and very comme il faut ; she wore white puffs ; she spoke to no one , and she never dined at the table d'hote . Every two days she had a headache .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I think that 's a lovely description , headache and all ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy</persName>, chattering along in her thin , gay voice .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I want to know her ever so much . I know just what YOUR aunt would be ; I know I should like her . She would be very exclusive . I like a lady to be exclusive ; I 'm dying to be exclusive myself . Well , we ARE exclusive , mother and I . We do n't speak to everyone — or they do n't speak to us . I suppose it 's about the same thing . Anyway , I shall be ever so glad to know your aunt . ”</said></p>
    <p n="143"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was embarrassed .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ She would be most happy , ”</said>he said ;<said who="#Winterbourne">“ but I am afraid those headaches will interfere . ”</said></p>
    <p n="144">The young girl looked at him through the dusk .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ But I suppose she does n't have a headache every day , ”</said>she said sympathetically .</p>
    <p n="145"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was silent a moment .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ She tells me she does , ”</said>he answered at last , not knowing what to say .</p>
    <p n="146"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>stopped and stood looking at him . Her prettiness was still visible in the darkness ; she was opening and closing her enormous fan .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ She does n't want to know me ! ”</said>she said suddenly .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Why do n't you say so ? You need n't be afraid . I 'm not afraid ! ”</said>And she gave a little laugh .</p>
    <p n="147"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>fancied there was a tremor in her voice ; he was touched , shocked , mortified by it .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ My dear young lady , ”</said>he protested ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ she knows no one . It 's her wretched health . ”</said></p>
    <p n="148">The young girl walked on a few steps , laughing still .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ You need n't be afraid , ”</said>she repeated .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Why should she want to know me ? ”</said>Then she paused again ; she was close to the parapet of the garden , and in front of her was the starlit lake . There was a vague sheen upon its surface , and in the distance were dimly seen mountain forms .<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy Miller</persName>looked out upon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Gracious ! she IS exclusive ! ”</said>she said .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>wondered whether she was seriously wounded , and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her . He had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes . He felt then , for the instant , quite ready to sacrifice his aunt , conversationally ; to admit that she was a proud , rude woman , and to declare that they need n't mind her . But before he had time to commit himself to this perilous mixture of gallantry and impiety , the young lady , resuming her walk , gave an exclamation in quite another tone .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Well , here 's<persName>Mother</persName>! I guess she has n't got<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>to go to bed . ”</said>The figure of a lady appeared at a distance , very indistinct in the darkness , and advancing with a slow and wavering movement . Suddenly it seemed to pause .</p>
    <p n="149"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Are you sure it is your mother ? Can you distinguish her in this thick dusk ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>asked .</p>
    <p n="150"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>with a laugh ;<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I guess I know my own mother . And when she has got on my shawl , too ! She is always wearing my things . ”</said></p>
    <p n="151">The lady in question , ceasing to advance , hovered vaguely about the spot at which she had checked her steps .</p>
    <p n="152"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I am afraid your mother does n't see you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Or perhaps , ”</said>he added , thinking , with<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>, the joke permissible —<said who="#Winterbourne">“ perhaps she feels guilty about your shawl . ”</said></p>
    <p n="153"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“ Oh , it 's a fearful old thing ! ”</said>the young girl replied serenely .<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ I told her she could wear it . She wo n't come here because she sees you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="154"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Ah , then , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I had better leave you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="155"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Oh , no ; come on ! ”</said>urged<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>.</p>
    <p n="156"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I 'm afraid your mother does n't approve of my walking with you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="157"><persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>gave him a serious glance .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ It is n't for me ; it 's for you — that is , it 's for HER . Well , I do n't know who it 's for ! But mother does n't like any of my gentlemen friends . She 's right down timid . She always makes a fuss if I introduce a gentleman . But I DO introduce them — almost always . If I did n't introduce my gentlemen friends to<persName>Mother</persName>, ”</said>the young girl added in her little soft , flat monotone ,<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I should n't think I was natural . ”</said></p>
    <p n="158"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ To introduce me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ you must know my name . ”</said>And he proceeded to pronounce it .</p>
    <p n="159"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“ Oh , dear , I can n't say all that ! ”</said>said his companion with a laugh . But by this time they had come up to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>, who , as they drew near , walked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it , looking intently at the lake and turning her back to them .<said who="#Miss_Miller">“<persName>Mother</persName>! ”</said>said the young girl in a tone of decision . Upon this the elder lady turned round .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>, introducing the young man very frankly and prettily .<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ Common , ”</said>she was , as<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>had pronounced her ; yet it was a wonder to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>that , with her commonness , she had a singularly delicate grace .</p>
    <p n="160">Her mother was a small , spare , light person , with a wandering eye , a very exiguous nose , and a large forehead , decorated with a certain amount of thin , much frizzled hair . Like her daughter ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>was dressed with extreme elegance ; she had enormous diamonds in her ears . So far as<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>could observe , she gave him no greeting — she certainly was not looking at him .<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>was near her , pulling her shawl straight .<said who="#Mr._Winterbourne">“ What are you doing , poking round here ? ”</said>this young lady inquired , but by no means with that harshness of accent which her choice of words may imply .</p>
    <p n="161"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ I do n't know , ”</said>said her mother , turning toward the lake again .</p>
    <p n="162"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I should n't think you 'd want that shawl ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>exclaimed .</p>
    <p n="163"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ Well I do ! ”</said>her mother answered with a little laugh .</p>
    <p n="164"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Did you get<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>to go to bed ? ”</said>asked the young girl .</p>
    <p n="165"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ No ; I could n't induce him , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>very gently .<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ He wants to talk to the waiter . He likes to talk to that waiter . ”</said></p>
    <p n="166"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I was telling<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>, ”</said>the young girl went on ; and to the young man 's ear her tone might have indicated that she had been uttering his name all her life .</p>
    <p n="167"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Oh , yes ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>;<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I have the pleasure of knowing your son . ”</said></p>
    <p n="168"><persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>'s mamma was silent ; she turned her attention to the lake . But at last she spoke .<said who="#Randolph">“ Well , I do n't see how he lives ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="169"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Anyhow , it is n't so bad as it was at Dover , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy Miller</persName>.</p>
    <p n="170"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ And what occurred at Dover ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>asked .</p>
    <p n="171"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ He would n't go to bed at all . I guess he sat up all night in the public parlor . He was n't in bed at twelve o'clock : I know that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="172"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ It was half-past twelve , ”</said>declared<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>with mild emphasis .</p>
    <p n="173"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Does he sleep much during the day ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>demanded .</p>
    <p n="174"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I guess he does n't sleep much , ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>rejoined .</p>
    <p n="175"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I wish he would ! ”</said>said her mother .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ It seems as if he could n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="176"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I think he 's real tiresome , ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>pursued .</p>
    <p n="177">Then , for some moments , there was silence .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Well ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy Miller</persName>, ”</said>said the elder lady , presently ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I should n't think you 'd want to talk against your own brother ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="178"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , he IS tiresome ,<persName>Mother</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>, quite without the asperity of a retort .</p>
    <p n="179"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ He 's only nine , ”</said>urged<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>.</p>
    <p n="180"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , he would n't go to that castle , ”</said>said the young girl .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I 'm going there with<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="181">To this announcement , very placidly made ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s mamma offered no response .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>took for granted that she deeply disapproved of the projected excursion ; but he said to himself that she was a simple , easily managed person , and that a few deferential protestations would take the edge from her displeasure .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Yes , ”</said>he began ;<said who="#Winterbourne">“ your daughter has kindly allowed me the honor of being her guide . ”</said></p>
    <p n="182"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>'s wandering eyes attached themselves , with a sort of appealing air , to<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>, who , however , strolled a few steps farther , gently humming to herself .<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ I presume you will go in the cars , ”</said>said her mother .</p>
    <p n="183"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Yes , or in the boat , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="184"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ Well , of course , I do n't know , ”</said><persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>rejoined .<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ I have never been to that castle . ”</said></p>
    <p n="185"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ It is a pity you should n't go , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, beginning to feel reassured as to her opposition . And yet he was quite prepared to find that , as a matter of course , she meant to accompany her daughter .</p>
    <p n="186"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ We 've been thinking ever so much about going , ”</said>she pursued ; “ but it seems as if we could n't . Of course<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>— she wants to go round . But there 's a lady here — I do n't know her name — she says she should n't think we 'd want to go to see castles HERE ; she should think we 'd want to wait till we got to Italy . It seems as if there would be so many there , ” continued<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>with an air of increasing confidence .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Of course we only want to see the principal ones . We visited several in England , ”</said>she presently added .</p>
    <p n="187"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Ah yes ! in England there are beautiful castles , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.<said who="#Winterbourne">“ But Chillon here , is very well worth seeing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="188"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ Well , if<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>feels up to it — ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>, in a tone impregnated with a sense of the magnitude of the enterprise .<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ It seems as if there was nothing she would n't undertake . ”</said></p>
    <p n="189"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Oh , I think she 'll enjoy it ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>declared . And he desired more and more to make it a certainty that he was to have the privilege of a tete-a-tete with the young lady , who was still strolling along in front of them , softly vocalizing .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ You are not disposed , madam , ”</said>he inquired ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ to undertake it yourself ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="190"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s mother looked at him an instant askance , and then walked forward in silence . Then — “ I guess she had better go alone , ” she said simply .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>observed to himself that this was a very different type of maternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the forefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of the lake . But his meditations were interrupted by hearing his name very distinctly pronounced by<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>'s unprotected daughter .</p>
    <p n="191"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>! ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.</p>
    <p n="192"><said who="#Mr._Winterbourne">“ Mademoiselle ! ”</said>said the young man .</p>
    <p n="193"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Do n't you want to take me out in a boat ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="194"><said who="#Mr._Winterbourne">“ At present ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="195"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Of course ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.</p>
    <p n="196"><said who="#Mr._Winterbourne">“ Well , Annie<persName corresp="#Miller">Miller</persName>! ”</said>exclaimed her mother .</p>
    <p n="197"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I beg you , madam , to let her go , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>ardently ; for he had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer starlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl .</p>
    <p n="198"><said who="#Mr._Winterbourne">“ I should n't think she 'd want to , ”</said>said her mother .<said who="#Mr._Winterbourne">“ I should think she 'd rather go indoors . ”</said></p>
    <p n="199"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I 'm sure<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>wants to take me , ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>declared .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ He 's so awfully devoted ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="200"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I will row you over to Chillon in the starlight . ”</said></p>
    <p n="201"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I do n't believe it ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.</p>
    <p n="202"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Well ! ”</said>ejaculated the elder lady again .</p>
    <p n="203"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ You have n't spoken to me for half an hour , ”</said>her daughter went on .</p>
    <p n="204"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I have been having some very pleasant conversation with your mother , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="205"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , I want you to take me out in a boat ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>repeated . They had all stopped , and she had turned round and was looking at<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>. Her face wore a charming smile , her pretty eyes were gleaming , she was swinging her great fan about . No ; it 's impossible to be prettier than that , thought<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="206"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ There are half a dozen boats moored at that landing place , ”</said>he said , pointing to certain steps which descended from the garden to the lake .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ If you will do me the honor to accept my arm , we will go and select one of them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="207"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>stood there smiling ; she threw back her head and gave a little , light laugh .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I like a gentleman to be formal ! ”</said>she declared .</p>
    <p n="208"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I assure you it 's a formal offer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="209"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I was bound I would make you say something , ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>went on .</p>
    <p n="210"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ You see , it 's not very difficult , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.<said who="#Winterbourne">“ But I am afraid you are chaffing me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="211"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ I think not , sir , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>very gently .</p>
    <p n="212"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Do , then , let me give you a row , ”</said>he said to the young girl .</p>
    <p n="213"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ It 's quite lovely , the way you say that ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.</p>
    <p n="214"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ It will be still more lovely to do it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="215"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Yes , it would be lovely ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>. But she made no movement to accompany him ; she only stood there laughing .</p>
    <p n="216"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I should think you had better find out what time it is , ”</said>interposed her mother .</p>
    <p n="217"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ It is eleven o'clock , madam , ”</said>said a voice , with a foreign accent , out of the neighboring darkness ; and<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, turning , perceived the florid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies . He had apparently just approached .</p>
    <p n="218"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>,<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I am going out in a boat ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="219"><persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>bowed .<said who="#Eugenio">“ At eleven o'clock , mademoiselle ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="220"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I am going with<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>— this very minute . ”</said></p>
    <p n="221"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ Do tell her she can n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>to the courier .</p>
    <p n="222"><said who="#Eugenio">“ I think you had better not go out in a boat , mademoiselle , ”</said><persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>declared .</p>
    <p n="223"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>wished to Heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with her courier ; but he said nothing .</p>
    <p n="224"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I suppose you do n't think it 's proper ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>exclaimed .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>does n't think anything 's proper . ”</said></p>
    <p n="225"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I am at your service , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="226"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Does mademoiselle propose to go alone ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>.</p>
    <p n="227"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ Oh , no ; with this gentleman ! ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s mamma .</p>
    <p n="228">The courier looked for a moment at<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>— the latter thought he was smiling — and then , solemnly , with a bow ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ As mademoiselle pleases ! ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="229"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Oh , I hoped you would make a fuss ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I do n't care to go now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="230"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I myself shall make a fuss if you do n't go , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="231"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ That 's all I want — a little fuss ! ”</said>And the young girl began to laugh again .</p>
    <p n="232"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Mr.<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>has gone to bed ! ”</said>the courier announced frigidly .</p>
    <p n="233"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>; now we can go ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>.</p>
    <p n="234"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>turned away from<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, looking at him , smiling and fanning herself .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Good night , ”</said>she said ;<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I hope you are disappointed , or disgusted , or something ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="235">He looked at her , taking the hand she offered him .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I am puzzled , ”</said>he answered .</p>
    <p n="236"><said who="#Eugenio">“ Well , I hope it wo n't keep you awake ! ”</said>she said very smartly ; and , under the escort of the privileged<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>, the two ladies passed toward the house .</p>
    <p n="237"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>stood looking after them ; he was indeed puzzled . He lingered beside the lake for a quarter of an hour , turning over the mystery of the young girl 's sudden familiarities and caprices . But the only very definite conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy deucedly “ going off ” with her somewhere .</p>
    <p n="238">Two days afterward he went off with her to the Castle of Chillon . He waited for her in the large hall of the hotel , where the couriers , the servants , the foreign tourists , were lounging about and staring . It was not the place he should have chosen , but she had appointed it . She came tripping downstairs , buttoning her long gloves , squeezing her folded parasol against her pretty figure , dressed in the perfection of a soberly elegant traveling costume .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was a man of imagination and , as our ancestors used to say , sensibility ; as he looked at her dress and , on the great staircase , her little rapid , confiding step , he felt as if there were something romantic going forward . He could have believed he was going to elope with her . He passed out with her among all the idle people that were assembled there ; they were all looking at her very hard ; she had begun to chatter as soon as she joined him .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s preference had been that they should be conveyed to Chillon in a carriage ; but she expressed a lively wish to go in the little steamer ; she declared that she had a passion for steamboats . There was always such a lovely breeze upon the water , and you saw such lots of people . The sail was not long , but<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s companion found time to say a great many things . To the young man himself their little excursion was so much of an escapade — an adventure — that , even allowing for her habitual sense of freedom , he had some expectation of seeing her regard it in the same way . But it must be confessed that , in this particular , he was disappointed .<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy Miller</persName>was extremely animated , she was in charming spirits ; but she was apparently not at all excited ; she was not fluttered ; she avoided neither his eyes nor those of anyone else ; she blushed neither when she looked at him nor when she felt that people were looking at her . People continued to look at her a great deal , and<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>took much satisfaction in his pretty companion 's distinguished air . He had been a little afraid that she would talk loud , laugh overmuch , and even , perhaps , desire to move about the boat a good deal . But he quite forgot his fears ; he sat smiling , with his eyes upon her face , while , without moving from her place , she delivered herself of a great number of original reflections . It was the most charming garrulity he had ever heard . He had assented to the idea that she was “ common ” ; but was she so , after all , or was he simply getting used to her commonness ? Her conversation was chiefly of what metaphysicians term the objective cast , but every now and then it took a subjective turn .</p>
    <p n="239"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ What on EARTH are you so grave about ? ”</said>she suddenly demanded , fixing her agreeable eyes upon<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s .</p>
    <p n="240"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Am I grave ? ”</said>he asked .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I had an idea I was grinning from ear to ear . ”</said></p>
    <p n="241"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ You look as if you were taking me to a funeral . If that 's a grin , your ears are very near together . ”</said></p>
    <p n="242"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Should you like me to dance a hornpipe on the deck ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="243"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Pray do , and I 'll carry round your hat . It will pay the expenses of our journey . ”</said></p>
    <p n="244"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I never was better pleased in my life , ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="245">She looked at him a moment and then burst into a little laugh .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I like to make you say those things ! You 're a queer mixture ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="246">In the castle , after they had landed , the subjective element decidedly prevailed .<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>tripped about the vaulted chambers , rustled her skirts in the corkscrew staircases , flirted back with a pretty little cry and a shudder from the edge of the oubliettes , and turned a singularly well-shaped ear to everything that<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>told her about the place . But he saw that she cared very little for feudal antiquities and that the dusky traditions of Chillon made but a slight impression upon her . They had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without other companionship than that of the custodian ; and<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>arranged with this functionary that they should not be hurried — that they should linger and pause wherever they chose . The custodian interpreted the bargain generously —<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, on his side , had been generous — and ended by leaving them quite to themselves .<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>'s observations were not remarkable for logical consistency ; for anything she wanted to say she was sure to find a pretext . She found a great many pretexts in the rugged embrasures of Chillon for asking<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>sudden questions about himself — his family , his previous history , his tastes , his habits , his intentions — and for supplying information upon corresponding points in her own personality . Of her own tastes , habits , and intentions<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>was prepared to give the most definite , and indeed the most favorable account .</p>
    <p n="247"><said who="#Miss_Miller">“ Well , I hope you know enough ! ”</said>she said to her companion , after he had told her the history of the unhappy Bonivard .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I never saw a man that knew so much ! ”</said>The history of Bonivard had evidently , as they say , gone into one ear and out of the other . But<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>went on to say that she wished<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>would travel with them and “ go round ” with them ; they might know something , in that case .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Do n't you want to come and teach<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>? ”</said>she asked .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>said that nothing could possibly please him so much , but that he unfortunately other occupations .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Other occupations ? I do n't believe it ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ What do you mean ? You are not in business . ”</said>The young man admitted that he was not in business ; but he had engagements which , even within a day or two , would force him to go back to Geneva .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Oh , bother ! ”</said>she said ;<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I do n't believe it ! ”</said>and she began to talk about something else . But a few moments later , when he was pointing out to her the pretty design of an antique fireplace , she broke out irrelevantly ,<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ You do n't mean to say you are going back to Geneva ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="248"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ It is a melancholy fact that I shall have to return to Geneva tomorrow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="249"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>,<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I think you 're horrid ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="250"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Oh , do n't say such dreadful things ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>—<said who="#Winterbourne">“ just at the last ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="251"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ The last ! ”</said>cried the young girl ;<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I call it the first . I have half a mind to leave you here and go straight back to the hotel alone . ”</said>And for the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid . Poor<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was fairly bewildered ; no young lady had as yet done him the honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements . His companion , after this , ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of Chillon or the beauties of the lake ; she opened fire upon the mysterious charmer in Geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for granted that he was hurrying back to see . How did<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>know that there was a charmer in Geneva ?<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, who denied the existence of such a person , was quite unable to discover , and he was divided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her persiflage . She seemed to him , in all this , an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Does she never allow you more than three days at a time ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>ironically .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Does n't she give you a vacation in summer ? There 's no one so hard worked but they can get leave to go off somewhere at this season . I suppose , if you stay another day , she 'll come after you in the boat . Do wait over till Friday , and I will go down to the landing to see her arrive ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>began to think he had been wrong to feel disappointed in the temper in which the young lady had embarked . If he had missed the personal accent , the personal accent was now making its appearance . It sounded very distinctly , at last , in her telling him she would stop “ teasing ” him if he would promise her solemnly to come down to Rome in the winter .</p>
    <p n="252"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ That 's not a difficult promise to make , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.<said who="#Winterbourne">“ My aunt has taken an apartment in Rome for the winter and has already asked me to come and see her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="253"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I do n't want you to come for your aunt , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>;<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I want you to come for me . ”</said>And this was the only allusion that the young man was ever to hear her make to his invidious kinswoman . He declared that , at any rate , he would certainly come . After this<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>stopped teasing .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>took a carriage , and they drove back to Vevey in the dusk ; the young girl was very quiet .</p>
    <p n="254">In the evening<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>mentioned to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>that he had spent the afternoon at Chillon with<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>.</p>
    <p n="255"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ The Americans — of the courier ? ”</said>asked this lady .</p>
    <p n="256"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Ah , happily , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ the courier stayed at home . ”</said></p>
    <p n="257"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ She went with you all alone ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="258"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ All alone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="259"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>sniffed a little at her smelling bottle .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ And that , ”</said>she exclaimed ,<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ is the young person whom you wanted me to know ! ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="part" n="2">
    <p n="260"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, who had returned to Geneva the day after his excursion to Chillon , went to Rome toward the end of January . His aunt had been established there for several weeks , and he had received a couple of letters from her .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Those people you were so devoted to last summer at Vevey have turned up here , courier and all , ”</said>she wrote .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ They seem to have made several acquaintances , but the courier continues to be the most intime . The young lady , however , is also very intimate with some third-rate Italians , with whom she rackets about in a way that makes much talk . Bring me that pretty novel of Cherbuliez 's — Paule Mere — and do n't come later than the 23rd . ”</said></p>
    <p n="261">In the natural course of events ,<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, on arriving in Rome , would presently have ascertained<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>'s address at the American banker 's and have gone to pay his compliments to<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ After what happened at Vevey , I think I may certainly call upon them , ”</said>he said to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>.</p>
    <p n="262"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ If , after what happens — at Vevey and everywhere — you desire to keep up the acquaintance , you are very welcome . Of course a man may know everyone . Men are welcome to the privilege ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="263"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Pray what is it that happens — here , for instance ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>demanded .</p>
    <p n="264"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ The girl goes about alone with her foreigners . As to what happens further , you must apply elsewhere for information . She has picked up half a dozen of the regular Roman fortune hunters , and she takes them about to people 's houses . When she comes to a party she brings with her a gentleman with a good deal of manner and a wonderful mustache . ”</said></p>
    <p n="265"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ And where is the mother ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="266"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ I have n't the least idea . They are very dreadful people . ”</said></p>
    <p n="267"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>meditated a moment .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ They are very ignorant — very innocent only . Depend upon it they are not bad . ”</said></p>
    <p n="268"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ They are hopelessly vulgar , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ Whether or no being hopelessly vulgar is being ‘ bad ’ is a question for the metaphysicians . They are bad enough to dislike , at any rate ; and for this short life that is quite enough . ”</said></p>
    <p n="269">The news that<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy Miller</persName>was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful mustaches checked<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s impulse to go straightway to see her . He had , perhaps , not definitely flattered himself that he had made an ineffaceable impression upon her heart , but he was annoyed at hearing of a state of affairs so little in harmony with an image that had lately flitted in and out of his own meditations ; the image of a very pretty girl looking out of an old Roman window and asking herself urgently when<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>would arrive . If , however , he determined to wait a little before reminding<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>of his claims to her consideration , he went very soon to call upon two or three other friends . One of these friends was an American lady who had spent several winters at Geneva , where she had placed her children at school . She was a very accomplished woman , and she lived in the Via Gregoriana .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>found her in a little crimson drawing room on a third floor ; the room was filled with southern sunshine . He had not been there ten minutes when the servant came in , announcing “ Madame Mila ! ” This announcement was presently followed by the entrance of little<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName><persName corresp="#Miller">Miller</persName>, who stopped in the middle of the room and stood staring at<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>. An instant later his pretty sister crossed the threshold ; and then , after a considerable interval ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>slowly advanced .</p>
    <p n="270"><said who="#Randolph">“ I know you ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>.</p>
    <p n="271"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I 'm sure you know a great many things , ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, taking him by the hand .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ How is your education coming on ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="272"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>was exchanging greetings very prettily with her hostess , but when she heard<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s voice she quickly turned her head .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , I declare ! ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="273"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I told you I should come , you know , ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>rejoined , smiling .</p>
    <p n="274"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , I did n't believe it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy</persName>.</p>
    <p n="275"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I am much obliged to you , ”</said>laughed the young man .</p>
    <p n="276"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ You might have come to see me ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.</p>
    <p n="277"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I arrived only yesterday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="278"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I do n't believe that ! ”</said>the young girl declared .</p>
    <p n="279"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>turned with a protesting smile to her mother , but this lady evaded his glance , and , seating herself , fixed her eyes upon her son .<said who="#Randolph">“ We 've got a bigger place than this , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>.<said who="#Randolph">“ It 's all gold on the walls . ”</said></p>
    <p n="280"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>turned uneasily in her chair .<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ I told you if I were to bring you , you would say something ! ”</said>she murmured .</p>
    <p n="281"><said who="#Randolph">“ I told YOU ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>exclaimed .<said who="#Randolph">“ I tell YOU , sir ! ”</said>he added jocosely , giving<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>a thump on the knee .<said who="#Randolph">“ It IS bigger , too ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="282"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>had entered upon a lively conversation with her hostess ;<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>judged it becoming to address a few words to her mother .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I hope you have been well since we parted at Vevey , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="283"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>now certainly looked at him — at his chin .<said who="#Randolph">“ Not very well , sir , ”</said>she answered .</p>
    <p n="284"><said who="#Randolph">“ She 's got the dyspepsia , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>.<said who="#Randolph">“ I 've got it too . Father 's got it . I 've got it most ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="285">This announcement , instead of embarrassing<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>, seemed to relieve her .<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ I suffer from the liver , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ I think it 's this climate ; it 's less bracing than Schenectady , especially in the winter season . I do n't know whether you know we reside at Schenectady . I was saying to<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>that I certainly had n't found any one like<persName>Dr. Davis</persName>, and I did n't believe I should . Oh , at Schenectady he stands first ; they think everything of him . He has so much to do , and yet there was nothing he would n't do for me . He said he never saw anything like my dyspepsia , but he was bound to cure it . I 'm sure there was nothing he would n't try . He was just going to try something new when we came off . Mr.<persName corresp="#Miller">Miller</persName>wanted<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>to see Europe for herself . But I wrote to Mr.<persName corresp="#Miller">Miller</persName>that it seems as if I could n't get on without<persName>Dr. Davis</persName>. At Schenectady he stands at the very top ; and there 's a great deal of sickness there , too . It affects my sleep . ”</said></p>
    <p n="286"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>had a good deal of pathological gossip with<persName>Dr. Davis</persName>'s patient , during which<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>chattered unremittingly to her own companion . The young man asked<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>how she was pleased with Rome .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , I must say I am disappointed , ”</said>she answered .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ We had heard so much about it ; I suppose we had heard too much . But we could n't help that . We had been led to expect something different . ”</said></p>
    <p n="287"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Ah , wait a little , and you will become very fond of it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="288"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I hate it worse and worse every day ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>.</p>
    <p n="289"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ You are like the infant Hannibal , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="290"><said who="#Randolph">“ No , I ai n't ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>declared at a venture .</p>
    <p n="291"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ You are not much like an infant , ”</said>said his mother .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ But we have seen places , ”</said>she resumed ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ that I should put a long way before Rome . ”</said>And in reply to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s interrogation , “ There 's Zurich , ” she concluded ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I think Zurich is lovely ; and we had n't heard half so much about it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="292"><said who="#Randolph">“ The best place we 've seen is the City of Richmond ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>.</p>
    <p n="293"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ He means the ship , ”</said>his mother explained .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ We crossed in that ship .<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>had a good time on the City of Richmond . ”</said></p>
    <p n="294"><said who="#the_child">“ It 's the best place I 've seen , ”</said>the child repeated .<said who="#the_child">“ Only it was turned the wrong way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="295"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ Well , we 've got to turn the right way some time , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>with a little laugh .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>expressed the hope that her daughter at least found some gratification in Rome , and she declared that<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>was quite carried away .<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ It 's on account of the society — the society 's splendid . She goes round everywhere ; she has made a great number of acquaintances . Of course she goes round more than I do . I must say they have been very sociable ; they have taken her right in . And then she knows a great many gentlemen . Oh , she thinks there 's nothing like Rome . Of course , it 's a great deal pleasanter for a young lady if she knows plenty of gentlemen . ”</said></p>
    <p n="296">By this time<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>had turned her attention again to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I 've been telling<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>how mean you were ! ”</said>the young girl announced .</p>
    <p n="297"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ And what is the evidence you have offered ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, rather annoyed at<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>'s want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer who on his way down to Rome had stopped neither at Bologna nor at Florence , simply because of a certain sentimental impatience . He remembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him that American women — the pretty ones , and this gave a largeness to the axiom — were at once the most exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense of indebtedness .</p>
    <p n="298"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Why , you were awfully mean at Vevey , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ You would n't do anything . You would n't stay there when I asked you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="299"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ My dearest young lady , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, with eloquence ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ have I come all the way to Rome to encounter your reproaches ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="300"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Just hear him say that ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>to her hostess , giving a twist to a bow on this lady 's dress .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Did you ever hear anything so quaint ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="301"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ So quaint , my dear ? ”</said>murmured<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>in the tone of a partisan of<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="302"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , I do n't know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>, fingering<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>'s ribbons .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>, I want to tell you something . ”</said></p>
    <p n="303"><said who="#Randolph">“ Mother-r , ”</said>interposed<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>, with his rough ends to his words ,<said who="#Randolph">“ I tell you you 've got to go .<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>'ll raise — something ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="304"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I 'm not afraid of<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>with a toss of her head .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Look here ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>, ”</said>she went on ,<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ you know I 'm coming to your party . ”</said></p>
    <p n="305"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ I am delighted to hear it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="306"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I 've got a lovely dress ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="307"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ I am very sure of that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="308"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ But I want to ask a favor — permission to bring a friend . ”</said></p>
    <p n="309"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ I shall be happy to see any of your friends , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>, turning with a smile to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>.</p>
    <p n="310"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Oh , they are not my friends , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s mamma , smiling shyly in her own fashion .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I never spoke to them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="311"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ It 's an intimate friend of mine —<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>without a tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little face .</p>
    <p n="312"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>was silent a moment ; she gave a rapid glance at<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ I shall be glad to see<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>, ”</said>she then said .</p>
    <p n="313"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ He 's an Italian , ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>pursued with the prettiest serenity .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ He 's a great friend of mine ; he 's the handsomest man in the world — except<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>!

    <p n="314">It was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>'s party , and then<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>prepared to take her leave .<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ I guess we 'll go back to the hotel , ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="315"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ You may go back to the hotel ,<persName>Mother</persName>, but I 'm going to take a walk , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.</p>

    <p n="318"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ Alone , my dear — at this hour ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>asked .

    <p n="319"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ Neither do I , ”</said>subjoined<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ You 'll get the fever , as sure as you live . Remember what<persName>Dr. Davis</persName>told you ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="320"><said who="#Randolph">“ Give her some medicine before she goes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>.</p>
    <p n="321">The company had risen to its feet ;<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>, still showing her pretty teeth , bent over and kissed her hostess .<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>, you are too perfect , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ I 'm not going alone ; I am going to meet a friend . ”</said></p>
    <p n="322"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ Your friend wo n't keep you from getting the fever , ”</said><persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>observed .</p>
    <p n="323"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Is it<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>? ”</said>asked the hostess .</p>
    <p n="324"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was watching the young girl ; at this question his attention quickened . She stood there , smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons ; she glanced at<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>. Then , while she glanced and smiled , she answered , without a shade of hesitation ,<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>— the beautiful<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="325"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ My dear young friend , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>, taking her hand pleadingly ,<said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ do n't walk off to the Pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful Italian . ”</said></p>
    <p n="326"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ Well , he speaks English , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>.</p>
    <p n="327"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Gracious me ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>exclaimed ,<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I do n't to do anything improper . There 's an easy way to settle it . ”</said>She continued to glance at<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ The Pincio is only a hundred yards distant ; and if<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>were as polite as he pretends , he would offer to walk with me ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="328"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s politeness hastened to affirm itself , and the young girl gave him gracious leave to accompany her . They passed downstairs before her mother , and at the door<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>perceived<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>'s carriage drawn up , with the ornamental courier whose acquaintance he had made at Vevey seated within .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Goodbye ,<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>;<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I 'm going to take a walk . ”</said>The distance from the Via Gregoriana to the beautiful garden at the other end of the Pincian Hill is , in fact , rapidly traversed . As the day was splendid , however , and the concourse of vehicles , walkers , and loungers numerous , the young Americans found their progress much delayed . This fact was highly agreeable to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, in spite of his consciousness of his singular situation . The slow-moving , idly gazing Roman crowd bestowed much attention upon the extremely pretty young foreign lady who was passing through it upon his arm ; and he wondered what on earth had been in<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s mind when she proposed to expose herself , unattended , to its appreciation . His own mission , to her sense , apparently , was to consign her to the hands of<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>; but<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, at once annoyed and gratified , resolved that he would do no such thing .</p>
    <p n="329"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Why have n't you been to see me ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ You can n't get out of that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="330"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I have had the honor of telling you that I have only just stepped out of the train . ”</said></p>
    <p n="331"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ You must have stayed in the train a good while after it stopped ! ”</said>cried the young girl with her little laugh .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I suppose you were asleep . You have had time to go to see<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="332"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I knew<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>— ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>began to explain .</p>
    <p n="333"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I know where you knew her . You knew her at Geneva . She told me so . Well , you knew me at Vevey . That 's just as good . So you ought to have come . ”</said>She asked him no other question than this ; she began to prattle about her own affairs .<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ We 've got splendid rooms at the hotel ;<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>says they 're the best rooms in Rome . We are going to stay all winter , if we do n't die of the fever ; and I guess we 'll stay then . It 's a great deal nicer than I thought ; I thought it would be fearfully quiet ; I was sure it would be awfully poky . I was sure we should be going round all the time with one of those dreadful old men that explain about the pictures and things . But we only had about a week of that , and now I 'm enjoying myself . I know ever so many people , and they are all so charming . The society 's extremely select . There are all kinds — English , and Germans , and Italians . I think I like the English best . I like their style of conversation . But there are some lovely Americans . I never saw anything so hospitable . There 's something or other every day . There 's not much dancing ; but I must say I never thought dancing was everything . I was always fond of conversation . I guess I shall have plenty at<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>'s , her rooms are so small . ”</said>When they had passed the gate of the Pincian Gardens ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>began to wonder where<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>might be .<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ We had better go straight to that place in front , ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Miss_Miller">“ where you look at the view . ”</said></p>
    <p n="334"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I certainly shall not help you to find him , ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>declared .</p>
    <p n="335"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Then I shall find him without you , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy</persName>.</p>
    <p n="336"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ You certainly wo n't leave me ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="337">She burst into her little laugh .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Are you afraid you 'll get lost — or run over ? But there 's<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>, leaning against that tree . He 's staring at the women in the carriages : did you ever see anything so cool ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="338"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>perceived at some distance a little man standing with folded arms nursing his cane . He had a handsome face , an artfully poised hat , a glass in one eye , and a nosegay in his buttonhole .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>looked at him a moment and then said ,<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Do you mean to speak to that man ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="339"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Do I mean to speak to him ? Why , you do n't suppose I mean to communicate by signs ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="340"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Pray understand , then , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ that I intend to remain with you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="341"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>stopped and looked at him , without a sign of troubled consciousness in her face , with nothing but the presence of her charming eyes and her happy dimples .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , she 's a cool one ! ”</said>thought the young man .</p>
    <p n="342"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I do n't like the way you say that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ It 's too imperious . ”</said></p>
    <p n="343"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I beg your pardon if I say it wrong . The main point is to give you an idea of my meaning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="344">The young girl looked at him more gravely , but with eyes that were prettier than ever .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I have never allowed a gentleman to dictate to me , or to interfere with anything I do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="345"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I think you have made a mistake , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.<said who="#Winterbourne">“ You should sometimes listen to a gentleman — the right one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="346"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>began to laugh again .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I do nothing but listen to gentlemen ! ”</said>she exclaimed .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Tell me if<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>is the right one ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="347">The gentleman with the nosegay in his bosom had now perceived our two friends , and was approaching the young girl with obsequious rapidity . He bowed to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>as well as to the latter 's companion ; he had a brilliant smile , an intelligent eye ;<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>thought him not a bad-looking fellow . But he nevertheless said to<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ No , he 's not the right one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="348"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>evidently had a natural talent for performing introductions ; she mentioned the name of each of her companions to the other . She strolled alone with one of them on each side of her ;<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>, who spoke English very cleverly —<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>afterward learned that he had practiced the idiom upon a great many American heiresses — addressed her a great deal of very polite nonsense ; he was extremely urbane , and the young American , who said nothing , reflected upon that profundity of Italian cleverness which enables people to appear more gracious in proportion as they are more acutely disappointed .<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>, of course , had counted upon something more intimate ; he had not bargained for a party of three . But he kept his temper in a manner which suggested far-stretching intentions .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>flattered himself that he had taken his measure .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ He is not a gentleman , ”</said>said the young American ;<said who="#Mr._Giovanelli">“ he is only a clever imitation of one . He is a music master , or a penny-a-liner , or a third-rate artist . Dn his good looks ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>had certainly a very pretty face ; but<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>felt a superior indignation at his own lovely fellow countrywoman 's not knowing the difference between a spurious gentleman and a real one .<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>chattered and jested and made himself wonderfully agreeable . It was true that , if he was an imitation , the imitation was brilliant .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Nevertheless , ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>said to himself ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ a nice girl ought to know ! ”</said>And then he came back to the question whether this was , in fact , a nice girl . Would a nice girl , even allowing for her being a little American flirt , make a rendezvous with a presumably low-lived foreigner ? The rendezvous in this case , indeed , had been in broad daylight and in the most crowded corner of Rome , but was it not impossible to regard the choice of these circumstances as a proof of extreme cynicism ? Singular though it may seem ,<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was vexed that the young girl , in joining her amoroso , should not appear more impatient of his own company , and he was vexed because of his inclination . It was impossible to regard her as a perfectly well-conducted young lady ; she was wanting in a certain indispensable delicacy . It would therefore simplify matters greatly to be able to treat her as the object of one of those sentiments which are called by romancers “ lawless passions . ” That she should seem to wish to get rid of him would help him to think more lightly of her , and to be able to think more lightly of her would make her much less perplexing . But<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>, on this occasion , continued to present herself as an inscrutable combination of audacity and innocence .</p>
    <p n="349">She had been walking some quarter of an hour , attended by her two cavaliers , and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety , as it seemed to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, to the pretty speeches of<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>, when a carriage that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up beside the path . At the same moment<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>perceived that his friend<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>— the lady whose house he had lately left — was seated in the vehicle and was beckoning to him . Leaving<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>'s side , he hastened to obey her summons .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>was flushed ; she wore an excited air .<said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ It is really too dreadful , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ That girl must not do this sort of thing . She must not walk here with you two men . Fifty people have noticed her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="350"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>raised his eyebrows .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I think it 's a pity to make too much fuss about it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="351"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ It 's a pity to let the girl ruin herself ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="352"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ She is very innocent , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="353"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ She 's very crazy ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>.<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Did you ever see anything so imbecile as her mother ? After you had all left me just now , I could not sit still for thinking of it . It seemed too pitiful , not even to attempt to save her . I ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet , and came here as quickly as possible . Thank Heaven I have found you ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="354"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ What do you propose to do with us ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, smiling .</p>
    <p n="355"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ To ask her to get in , to drive her about here for half an hour , so that the world may see she is not running absolutely wild , and then to take her safely home . ”</said></p>
    <p n="356"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I do n't think it 's a very happy thought , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>;<said who="#Winterbourne">“ but you can try . ”</said></p>
    <p n="357"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>tried . The young man went in pursuit of<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>, who had simply nodded and smiled at his interlocutor in the carriage and had gone her way with her companion .<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>, on learning that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>wished to speak to her , retraced her steps with a perfect good grace and with<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>at her side . She declared that she was delighted to have a chance to present this gentleman to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>. She immediately achieved the introduction , and declared that she had never in her life seen anything so lovely as<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>'s carriage rug .</p>
    <p n="358"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ I am glad you admire it , ”</said>said this lady , smiling sweetly .<said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ Will you get in and let me put it over you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="359"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Oh , no , thank you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I shall admire it much more as I see you driving round with it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="360"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ Do get in and drive with me ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>.</p>
    <p n="361"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ That would be charming , but it 's so enchanting just as I am ! ”</said>and<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>gave a brilliant glance at the gentlemen on either side of her .</p>
    <p n="362"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ It may be enchanting , dear child , but it is not the custom here , ”</said>urged<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>, leaning forward in her victoria , with her hands devoutly clasped .</p>
    <p n="363"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , it ought to be , then ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ If I did n't walk I should expire . ”</said></p>
    <p n="364"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ You should walk with your mother , dear , ”</said>cried the lady from Geneva , losing patience .</p>
    <p n="365"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ With my mother dear ! ”</said>exclaimed the young girl .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>saw that she scented interference .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ My mother never walked ten steps in her life . And then , you know , ”</said>she added with a laugh ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I am more than five years old . ”</said></p>
    <p n="366"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ You are old enough to be more reasonable . You are old enough , dear<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>, to be talked about . ”</said></p>
    <p n="367"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>looked at<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>, smiling intensely .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Talked about ? What do you mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="368"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Come into my carriage , and I will tell you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="369"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>turned her quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside her to the other .<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>was bowing to and fro , rubbing down his gloves and laughing very agreeably ;<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>thought it a most unpleasant scene .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I do n't think I want to know what you mean , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>presently .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I do n't think I should like it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="370"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>wished that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>would tuck in her carriage rug and drive away , but this lady did not enjoy being defied , as she afterward told him .<said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ Should you prefer being thought a very reckless girl ? ”</said>she demanded .</p>
    <p n="371"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Gracious ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>. She looked again at<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>, then she turned to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>. There was a little pink flush in her cheek ; she was tremendously pretty .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Does<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>think , ”</said>she asked slowly , smiling , throwing back her head , and glancing at him from head to foot ,<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ that , to save my reputation , I ought to get into the carriage ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="372"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>colored ; for an instant he hesitated greatly . It seemed so strange to hear her speak that way of her “ reputation . ” But he himself , in fact , must speak in accordance with gallantry . The finest gallantry , here , was simply to tell her the truth ; and the truth , for<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, as the few indications I have been able to give have made him known to the reader , was that<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy Miller</persName>should take<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>'s advice . He looked at her exquisite prettiness , and then he said , very gently ,<said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ I think you should get into the carriage . ”</said></p>
    <p n="373"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>gave a violent laugh .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I never heard anything so stiff ! If this is improper ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>, ”</said>she pursued ,<said who="#Mr._Giovanelli">“ then I am all improper , and you must give me up . Goodbye ; I hope you 'll have a lovely ride ! ”</said>and , with<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>, who made a triumphantly obsequious salute , she turned away .</p>
    <p n="374"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>sat looking after her , and there were tears in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>'s eyes .<said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ Get in here , sir , ”</said>she said to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, indicating the place beside her . The young man answered that he felt bound to accompany<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>, whereupon<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>declared that if he refused her this favor she would never speak to him again . She was evidently in earnest .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>overtook<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>and her companion , and , offering the young girl his hand , told her that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>had made an imperious claim upon his society . He expected that in answer she would say something rather free , something to commit herself still further to that “ recklessness ” from which<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>had so charitably endeavored to dissuade her . But she only shook his hand , hardly looking at him , while<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>bade him farewell with a too emphatic flourish of the hat .</p>
    <p n="375"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was not in the best possible humor as he took his seat in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>'s victoria .<said who="#Mr._Giovanelli">“ That was not clever of you , ”</said>he said candidly , while the vehicle mingled again with the throng of carriages .</p>
    <p n="376"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ In such a case , ”</said>his companion answered ,<said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ I do n't wish to be clever ; I wish to be EARNEST ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="377"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Well , your earnestness has only offended her and put her off . ”</said></p>
    <p n="378"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ It has happened very well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ If she is so perfectly determined to compromise herself , the sooner one knows it the better ; one can act accordingly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="379"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I suspect she meant no harm , ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>rejoined .</p>
    <p n="380"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ So I thought a month ago . But she has been going too far . ”</said></p>
    <p n="381"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ What has she been doing ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="382"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ Everything that is not done here . Flirting with any man she could pick up ; sitting in corners with mysterious Italians ; dancing all the evening with the same partners ; receiving visits at eleven o'clock at night . Her mother goes away when visitors come . ”</said></p>
    <p n="383"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ But her brother , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, laughing ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ sits up till midnight . ”</said></p>
    <p n="384"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ He must be edified by what he sees . I 'm told that at their hotel everyone is talking about her , and that a smile goes round among all the servants when a gentleman comes and asks for<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="385"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ The servants be hanged ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>angrily .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ The poor girl 's only fault , ”</said>he presently added ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ is that she is very uncultivated . ”</said></p>
    <p n="386"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ She is naturally indelicate , ”</said><persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>declared .</p>
    <p n="387"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Take that example this morning . How long had you known her at Vevey ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="388"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ A couple of days . ”</said></p>
    <p n="389"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Fancy , then , her making it a personal matter that you should have left the place ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="390"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was silent for some moments ; then he said ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I suspect ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>, that you and I have lived too long at Geneva ! ”</said>And he added a request that she should inform him with what particular design she had made him enter her carriage .</p>
    <p n="391"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ I wished to beg you to cease your relations with<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>— not to flirt with her — to give her no further opportunity to expose herself — to let her alone , in short . ”</said></p>
    <p n="392"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I 'm afraid I can n't do that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I like her extremely . ”</said></p>
    <p n="393"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ All the more reason that you should n't help her to make a scandal . ”</said></p>
    <p n="394"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ There shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="395"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ There certainly will be in the way she takes them . But I have said what I had on my conscience , ”</said><persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>pursued .<said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ If you wish to rejoin the young lady I will put you down . Here , by the way , you have a chance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="396">The carriage was traversing that part of the Pincian Garden that overhangs the wall of Rome and overlooks the beautiful Villa Borghese . It is bordered by a large parapet , near which there are several seats . One of the seats at a distance was occupied by a gentleman and a lady , toward whom<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>gave a toss of her head . At the same moment these persons rose and walked toward the parapet .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>had asked the coachman to stop ; he now descended from the carriage . His companion looked at him a moment in silence ; then , while he raised his hat , she drove majestically away .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>stood there ; he had turned his eyes toward<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>and her cavalier . They evidently saw no one ; they were too deeply occupied with each other . When they reached the low garden wall , they stood a moment looking off at the great flat-topped pine clusters of the Villa Borghese ; then<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>seated himself , familiarly , upon the broad ledge of the wall . The western sun in the opposite sky sent out a brilliant shaft through a couple of cloud bars , whereupon<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s companion took her parasol out of her hands and opened it . She came a little nearer , and he held the parasol over her ; then , still holding it , he let it rest upon her shoulder , so that both of their heads were hidden from<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>. This young man lingered a moment , then he began to walk . But he walked — not toward the couple with the parasol ; toward the residence of his aunt ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>.</p>
    <p n="397">He flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling among the servants when he , at least , asked for<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>at her hotel . This lady and her daughter , however , were not at home ; and on the next day after , repeating his visit ,<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>again had the misfortune not to find them .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>'s party took place on the evening of the third day , and , in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess ,<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was among the guests .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>was one of those American ladies who , while residing abroad , make a point , in their own phrase , of studying European society , and she had on this occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born fellow mortals to serve , as it were , as textbooks . When<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>arrived ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy Miller</persName>was not there , but in a few moments he saw her mother come in alone , very shyly and ruefully .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>'s hair above her exposed-looking temples was more frizzled than ever . As she approached<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>,<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>also drew near .</p>
    <p n="398"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ You see , I 've come all alone , ”</said>said poor<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ I 'm so frightened ; I do n't know what to do . It 's the first time I 've ever been to a party alone , especially in this country . I wanted to bring<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>or<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>, or someone , but<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>just pushed me off by myself . I ai n't used to going round alone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="399"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ And does not your daughter intend to favor us with her society ? ”</said>demanded<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>impressively .</p>
    <p n="400"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ Well ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s all dressed , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>with that accent of the dispassionate , if not of the philosophic , historian with which she always recorded the current incidents of her daughter 's career .<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ She got dressed on purpose before dinner . But she 's got a friend of hers there ; that gentleman — the Italian — that she wanted to bring . They 've got going at the piano ; it seems as if they could n't leave off .<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>sings splendidly . But I guess they 'll come before very long , ”</said>concluded<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>hopefully .</p>
    <p n="401"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ I 'm sorry she should come in that way , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>.</p>
    <p n="402"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , I told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before dinner if she was going to wait three hours , ”</said>responded<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s mamma .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I did n't see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round with<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="403"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ This is most horrible ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>, turning away and addressing herself to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ Elle s'affiche . It 's her revenge for my having ventured to remonstrate with her . When she comes , I shall not speak to her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="404"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>came after eleven o'clock ; but she was not , on such an occasion , a young lady to wait to be spoken to . She rustled forward in radiant loveliness , smiling and chattering , carrying a large bouquet , and attended by<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>. Everyone stopped talking and turned and looked at her . She came straight to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I 'm afraid you thought I never was coming , so I sent mother off to tell you . I wanted to make<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>practice some things before he came ; you know he sings beautifully , and I want you to ask him to sing . This is<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>; you know I introduced him to you ; he 's got the most lovely voice , and he knows the most charming set of songs . I made him go over them this evening on purpose ; we had the greatest time at the hotel . ”</said>Of all this<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>delivered herself with the sweetest , brightest audibleness , looking now at her hostess and now round the room , while she gave a series of little pats , round her shoulders , to the edges of her dress .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Is there anyone I know ? ”</said>she asked .</p>
    <p n="405"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ I think every one knows you ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>pregnantly , and she gave a very cursory greeting to<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>. This gentleman bore himself gallantly . He smiled and bowed and showed his white teeth ; he curled his mustaches and rolled his eyes and performed all the proper functions of a handsome Italian at an evening party . He sang very prettily half a dozen songs , though<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>afterward declared that she had been quite unable to find out who asked him . It was apparently not<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>who had given him his orders .<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>sat at a distance from the piano , and though she had publicly , as it were , professed a high admiration for his singing , talked , not inaudibly , while it was going on .</p>
    <p n="406"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ It 's a pity these rooms are so small ; we can n't dance , ”</said>she said to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, as if she had seen him five minutes before .</p>
    <p n="407"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I am not sorry we can n't dance , ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>answered ;<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I do n't dance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="408"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Of course you do n't dance ; you 're too stiff , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I hope you enjoyed your drive with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="409"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ No . I did n't enjoy it ; I preferred walking with you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="410"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ We paired off : that was much better , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ But did you ever hear anything so cool as<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>'s wanting me to get into her carriage and drop poor<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>, and under the pretext that it was proper ? People have different ideas ! It would have been most unkind ; he had been talking about that walk for ten days . ”</said></p>
    <p n="411"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ He should not have talked about it at all , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>;<said who="#Winterbourne">“ he would never have proposed to a young lady of this country to walk about the streets with him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="412"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ About the streets ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>with her pretty stare .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Where , then , would he have proposed to her to walk ? The Pincio is not the streets , either ; and I , thank goodness , am not a young lady of this country . The young ladies of this country have a dreadfully poky time of it , so far as I can learn ; I do n't see why I should change my habits for THEM . ”</said></p>
    <p n="413"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I am afraid your habits are those of a flirt , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>gravely .</p>
    <p n="414"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Of course they are , ”</said>she cried , giving him her little smiling stare again .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I 'm a fearful , frightful flirt ! Did you ever hear of a nice girl that was not ? But I suppose you will tell me now that I am not a nice girl . ”</said></p>
    <p n="415"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ You 're a very nice girl ; but I wish you would flirt with me , and me only , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="416"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Ah ! thank you — thank you very much ; you are the last man I should think of flirting with . As I have had the pleasure of informing you , you are too stiff . ”</said></p>
    <p n="417"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ You say that too often , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="418"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>gave a delighted laugh .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ If I could have the sweet hope of making you angry , I should say it again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="419"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Do n't do that ; when I am angry I 'm stiffer than ever . But if you wo n't flirt with me , do cease , at least , to flirt with your friend at the piano ; they do n't understand that sort of thing here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="420"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I thought they understood nothing else ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.</p>
    <p n="421"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Not in young unmarried women . ”</said></p>
    <p n="422"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ It seems to me much more proper in young unmarried women than in old married ones , ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>declared .</p>
    <p n="423"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ when you deal with natives you must go by the custom of the place . Flirting is a purely American custom ; it does n't exist here . So when you show yourself in public with<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>, and without your mother — ”</said></p>
    <p n="424"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Gracious ! poor<persName>Mother</persName>! ”</said>interposed<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.</p>
    <p n="425"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Though you may be flirting ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>is not ; he means something else . ”</said></p>
    <p n="426"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ He is n't preaching , at any rate , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>with vivacity .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ And if you want very much to know , we are neither of us flirting ; we are too good friends for that : we are very intimate friends . ”</said></p>
    <p n="427"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Ah ! ”</said>rejoined<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ if you are in love with each other , it is another affair . ”</said></p>
    <p n="428">She had allowed him up to this point to talk so frankly that he had no expectation of shocking her by this ejaculation ; but she immediately got up , blushing visibly , and leaving him to exclaim mentally that little American flirts were the queerest creatures in the world .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>, at least , ”</said>she said , giving her interlocutor a single glance ,<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ never says such very disagreeable things to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="429"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was bewildered ; he stood , staring .<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>had finished singing . He left the piano and came over to<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Giovanelli">“ Wo n't you come into the other room and have some tea ? ”</said>he asked , bending before her with his ornamental smile .</p>
    <p n="430"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>turned to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, beginning to smile again . He was still more perplexed , for this inconsequent smile made nothing clear , though it seemed to prove , indeed , that she had a sweetness and softness that reverted instinctively to the pardon of offenses .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ It has never occurred to<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>to offer me any tea , ”</said>she said with her little tormenting manner .</p>
    <p n="431"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I have offered you advice , ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>rejoined .</p>
    <p n="432"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I prefer weak tea ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>, and she went off with the brilliant<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>. She sat with him in the adjoining room , in the embrasure of the window , for the rest of the evening . There was an interesting performance at the piano , but neither of these young people gave heed to it . When<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>came to take leave of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>, this lady conscientiously repaired the weakness of which she had been guilty at the moment of the young girl 's arrival . She turned her back straight upon<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>and left her to depart with what grace she might .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was standing near the door ; he saw it all .<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>turned very pale and looked at her mother , but<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>was humbly unconscious of any violation of the usual social forms . She appeared , indeed , to have felt an incongruous impulse to draw attention to her own striking observance of them .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Good night ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>, ”</said>she said ;<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ we 've had a beautiful evening . You see , if I let<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>come to parties without me , I do n't want her to go away without me . ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>turned away , looking with a pale , grave face at the circle near the door ;<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>saw that , for the first moment , she was too much shocked and puzzled even for indignation . He on his side was greatly touched .</p>
    <p n="433"><said who="#Mrs._Walker">“ That was very cruel , ”</said>he said to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>.</p>
    <p n="434"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ She never enters my drawing room again ! ”</said>replied his hostess .</p>
    <p n="435">Since<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was not to meet her in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>'s drawing room , he went as often as possible to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>'s hotel . The ladies were rarely at home , but when he found them , the devoted<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>was always present . Very often the brilliant little Roman was in the drawing room with<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>alone ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>being apparently constantly of the opinion that discretion is the better part of surveillance .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>noted , at first with surprise , that<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>on these occasions was never embarrassed or annoyed by his own entrance ; but he very presently began to feel that she had no more surprises for him ; the unexpected in her behavior was the only thing to expect . She showed no displeasure at her tete-a-tete with<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>being interrupted ; she could chatter as freshly and freely with two gentlemen as with one ; there was always , in her conversation , the same odd mixture of audacity and puerility .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>remarked to himself that if she was seriously interested in<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>, it was very singular that she should not take more trouble to preserve the sanctity of their interviews ; and he liked her the more for her innocent-looking indifference and her apparently inexhaustible good humor . He could hardly have said why , but she seemed to him a girl who would never be jealous . At the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive smile on the reader 's part , I may affirm that with regard to the women who had hitherto interested him , it very often seemed to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>among the possibilities that , given certain contingencies , he should be afraid — literally afraid — of these ladies ; he had a pleasant sense that he should never be afraid of<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy Miller</persName>. It must be added that this sentiment was not altogether flattering to<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>; it was part of his conviction , or rather of his apprehension , that she would prove a very light young person .</p>
    <p n="436">But she was evidently very much interested in<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>. She looked at him whenever he spoke ; she was perpetually telling him to do this and to do that ; she was constantly “ chaffing ” and abusing him . She appeared completely to have forgotten that<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>had said anything to displease her at<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>'s little party . One Sunday afternoon , having gone to St. Peter 's with his aunt ,<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>perceived<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>strolling about the great church in company with the inevitable<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>. Presently he pointed out the young girl and her cavalier to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>. This lady looked at them a moment through her eyeglass , and then she said :</p>
    <p n="437"><said who="#Giovanelli">“ That 's what makes you so pensive in these days , eh ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="438"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ I had not the least idea I was pensive , ”</said>said the young man .</p>
    <p n="439"><said who="#Giovanelli">“ You are very much preoccupied ; you are thinking of something . ”</said></p>
    <p n="440"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ And what is it , ”</said>he asked ,<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ that you accuse me of thinking of ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="441"><said who="#Giovanelli">“ Of that young lady 's — Miss Baker 's , Miss Chandler 's — what 's her name ?—<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>'s intrigue with that little barber 's block . ”</said></p>
    <p n="442"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Do you call it an intrigue , ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>asked —<said who="#Winterbourne">“ an affair that goes on with such peculiar publicity ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="443"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ That 's their folly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>;<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ it 's not their merit . ”</said></p>
    <p n="444"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ No , ”</said>rejoined<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, with something of that pensiveness to which his aunt had alluded .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I do n't believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue . ”</said></p>
    <p n="445"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ I have heard a dozen people speak of it ; they say she is quite carried away by him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="446"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ They are certainly very intimate , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="447"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>inspected the young couple again with her optical instrument .<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ He is very handsome . One easily sees how it is . She thinks him the most elegant man in the world , the finest gentleman . She has never seen anything like him ; he is better , even , than the courier . It was the courier probably who introduced him ; and if he succeeds in marrying the young lady , the courier will come in for a magnificent commission . ”</said></p>
    <p n="448"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I do n't believe she thinks of marrying him , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ and I do n't believe he hopes to marry her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="449"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ You may be very sure she thinks of nothing . She goes on from day to day , from hour to hour , as they did in the Golden Age . I can imagine nothing more vulgar . And at the same time , ”</said>added<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>,<said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ depend upon it that she may tell you any moment that she is ‘ engaged . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="450"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I think that is more than<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>expects , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="451"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ Who is<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="452"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ The little Italian . I have asked questions about him and learned something . He is apparently a perfectly respectable little man . I believe he is , in a small way , a cavaliere avvocato . But he does n't move in what are called the first circles . I think it is really not absolutely impossible that the courier introduced him . He is evidently immensely charmed with<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>. If she thinks him the finest gentleman in the world , he , on his side , has never found himself in personal contact with such splendor , such opulence , such expensiveness as this young lady 's . And then she must seem to him wonderfully pretty and interesting . I rather doubt that he dreams of marrying her . That must appear to him too impossible a piece of luck . He has nothing but his handsome face to offer , and there is a substantial Mr.<persName corresp="#Miller">Miller</persName>in that mysterious land of dollars .<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>knows that he has n't a title to offer . If he were only a count or a marchese ! He must wonder at his luck , at the way they have taken him up . ”</said></p>
    <p n="453"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ He accounts for it by his handsome face and thinks<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>a young lady qui se passe ses fantaisies ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>.</p>
    <p n="454"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ It is very true , ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>pursued ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ that<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>and her mamma have not yet risen to that stage of — what shall I call it ?— of culture at which the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins . I believe that they are intellectually incapable of that conception . ”</said></p>
    <p n="455"><said who="#Mrs._Costello">“ Ah ! but the avvocato can n't believe it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>.</p>
    <p n="456">Of the observation excited by<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s “ intrigue , ”<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>gathered that day at St. Peter 's sufficient evidence . A dozen of the American colonists in Rome came to talk with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>, who sat on a little portable stool at the base of one of the great pilasters . The vesper service was going forward in splendid chants and organ tones in the adjacent choir , and meanwhile , between<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>and her friends , there was a great deal said about poor little<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>'s going really “ too far . ”<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was not pleased with what he heard , but when , coming out upon the great steps of the church , he saw<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>, who had emerged before him , get into an open cab with her accomplice and roll away through the cynical streets of Rome , he could not deny to himself that she was going very far indeed . He felt very sorry for her — not exactly that he believed that she had completely lost her head , but because it was painful to hear so much that was pretty , and undefended , and natural assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder . He made an attempt after this to give a hint to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>. He met one day in the Corso a friend , a tourist like himself , who had just come out of the Doria Palace , where he had been walking through the beautiful gallery . His friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait of Innocent X by Velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the palace , and then said ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ And in the same cabinet , by the way , I had the pleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kind — that pretty American girl whom you pointed out to me last week . ”</said>In answer to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s inquiries , his friend narrated that the pretty American girl — prettier than ever — was seated with a companion in the secluded nook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined .</p>
    <p n="457"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Who was her companion ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="458"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ A little Italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole . The girl is delightfully pretty , but I thought I understood from you the other day that she was a young lady du meilleur monde . ”</said></p>
    <p n="459"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ So she is ! ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>; and having assured himself that his informant had seen<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>and her companion but five minutes before , he jumped into a cab and went to call on<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>. She was at home ; but she apologized to him for receiving him in<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s absence .</p>
    <p n="460"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ She 's gone out somewhere with<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ She 's always going round with<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="461"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I have noticed that they are very intimate , ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>observed .</p>
    <p n="462"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ Oh , it seems as if they could n't live without each other ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ Well , he 's a real gentleman , anyhow . I keep telling<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>she 's engaged ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="463"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ And what does<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>say ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="464"><said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ Oh , she says she is n't engaged . But she might as well be ! ”</said>this impartial parent resumed ;<said who="#Mrs._Miller">“ she goes on as if she was . But I 've made<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>promise to tell me , if SHE does n't . I should want to write to Mr.<persName corresp="#Miller">Miller</persName>about it — should n't you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="465"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>replied that he certainly should ; and the state of mind of<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s mamma struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental vigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her upon her guard .</p>
    <p n="466">After this<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>was never at home , and<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>ceased to meet her at the houses of their common acquaintances , because , as he perceived , these shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too far . They ceased to invite her ; and they intimated that they desired to express to observant Europeans the great truth that , though<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>was a young American lady , her behavior was not representative — was regarded by her compatriots as abnormal .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that were turned toward her , and sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that she did not feel at all . He said to himself that she was too light and childish , too uncultivated and unreasoning , too provincial , to have reflected upon her ostracism , or even to have perceived it . Then at other moments he believed that she carried about in her elegant and irresponsible little organism a defiant , passionate , perfectly observant consciousness of the impression she produced . He asked himself whether<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s defiance came from the consciousness of innocence , or from her being , essentially , a young person of the reckless class . It must be admitted that holding one 's self to a belief in<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s “ innocence ” came to seem to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>more and more a matter of fine-spun gallantry . As I have already had occasion to relate , he was angry at finding himself reduced to chopping logic about this young lady ; he was vexed at his want of instinctive certitude as to how far her eccentricities were generic , national , and how far they were personal . From either view of them he had somehow missed her , and now it was too late . She was “ carried away ” by<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>.</p>
    <p n="467">A few days after his brief interview with her mother , he encountered her in that beautiful abode of flowering desolation known as the Palace of the Caesars . The early Roman spring had filled the air with bloom and perfume , and the rugged surface of the Palatine was muffled with tender verdure .<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>was strolling along the top of one of those great mounds of ruin that are embanked with mossy marble and paved with monumental inscriptions . It seemed to him that Rome had never been so lovely as just then . He stood , looking off at the enchanting harmony of line and color that remotely encircles the city , inhaling the softly humid odors , and feeling the freshness of the year and the antiquity of the place reaffirm themselves in mysterious interfusion . It seemed to him also that<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>had never looked so pretty , but this had been an observation of his whenever he met her .<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>was at her side , and<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>, too , wore an aspect of even unwonted brilliancy .</p>
    <p n="468"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>,<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I should think you would be lonesome ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="469"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Lonesome ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="470"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ You are always going round by yourself . Ca n't you get anyone to walk with you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="471"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I am not so fortunate , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ as your companion . ”</said></p>
    <p n="472"><persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>, from the first , had treated<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>with distinguished politeness . He listened with a deferential air to his remarks ; he laughed punctiliously at his pleasantries ; he seemed disposed to testify to his belief that<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>was a superior young man . He carried himself in no degree like a jealous wooer ; he had obviously a great deal of tact ; he had no objection to your expecting a little humility of him . It even seemed to<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>at times that<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>would find a certain mental relief in being able to have a private understanding with him — to say to him , as an intelligent man , that , bless you , HE knew how extraordinary was this young lady , and did n't flatter himself with delusive — or at least TOO delusive — hopes of matrimony and dollars . On this occasion he strolled away from his companion to pluck a sprig of almond blossom , which he carefully arranged in his buttonhole .</p>
    <p n="473"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I know why you say that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>, watching<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Because you think I go round too much with HIM . ”</said>And she nodded at her attendant .</p>
    <p n="474"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Every one thinks so — if you care to know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="475"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Of course I care to know ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>exclaimed seriously .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ But I do n't believe it . They are only pretending to be shocked . They do n't really care a straw what I do . Besides , I do n't go round so much . ”</said></p>
    <p n="476"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I think you will find they do care . They will show it disagreeably . ”</said></p>
    <p n="477"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>looked at him a moment .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ How disagreeably ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="478"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Have n't you noticed anything ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>asked .</p>
    <p n="479"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I have noticed you . But I noticed you were as stiff as an umbrella the first time I saw you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="480"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ You will find I am not so stiff as several others , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, smiling .</p>
    <p n="481"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ How shall I find it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="482"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ By going to see the others . ”</said></p>
    <p n="483"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ What will they do to me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="484"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ They will give you the cold shoulder . Do you know what that means ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="485"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>was looking at him intently ; she began to color .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Do you mean as<persName corresp="#Mrs._Walker">Mrs. Walker</persName>did the other night ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="486"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Exactly ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="487">She looked away at<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>, who was decorating himself with his almond blossom . Then looking back at<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>,<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I should n't think you would let people be so unkind ! ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="488"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ How can I help it ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="489"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I should think you would say something . ”</said></p>
    <p n="490"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I do say something ; ”</said>and he paused a moment .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I say that your mother tells me that she believes you are engaged . ”</said></p>
    <p n="491"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , she does , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>very simply .</p>
    <p n="492"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>began to laugh .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ And does<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>believe it ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="493"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I guess<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>does n't believe anything , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>.<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>'s skepticism excited<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>to further hilarity , and he observed that<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>was coming back to them .<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>, observing it too , addressed herself again to her countryman .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Since you have mentioned it , ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I AM engaged . ”</said>* * *<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>looked at her ; he had stopped laughing .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ You do n't believe ! ”</said>she added .</p>
    <p n="494">He was silent a moment ; and then , “ Yes , I believe it , ” he said .</p>
    <p n="495"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Oh , no , you do n't ! ”</said>she answered .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Well , then — I am not ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="496">The young girl and her cicerone were on their way to the gate of the enclosure , so that<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, who had but lately entered , presently took leave of them . A week afterward he went to dine at a beautiful villa on the Caelian Hill , and , on arriving , dismissed his hired vehicle . The evening was charming , and he promised himself the satisfaction of walking home beneath the Arch of Constantine and past the vaguely lighted monuments of the Forum . There was a waning moon in the sky , and her radiance was not brilliant , but she was veiled in a thin cloud curtain which seemed to diffuse and equalize it . When , on his return from the villa ( it was eleven o'clock ) ,<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>approached the dusky circle of the Colosseum , it recurred to him , as a lover of the picturesque , that the interior , in the pale moonshine , would be well worth a glance . He turned aside and walked to one of the empty arches , near which , as he observed , an open carriage — one of the little Roman streetcabs — was stationed . Then he passed in , among the cavernous shadows of the great structure , and emerged upon the clear and silent arena . The place had never seemed to him more impressive . One-half of the gigantic circus was in deep shade , the other was sleeping in the luminous dusk . As he stood there he began to murmur Byron 's famous lines , out of “ Manfred , ” but before he had finished his quotation he remembered that if nocturnal meditations in the Colosseum are recommended by the poets , they are deprecated by the doctors . The historic atmosphere was there , certainly ; but the historic atmosphere , scientifically considered , was no better than a villainous miasma .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>walked to the middle of the arena , to take a more general glance , intending thereafter to make a hasty retreat . The great cross in the center was covered with shadow ; it was only as he drew near it that he made it out distinctly . Then he saw that two persons were stationed upon the low steps which formed its base . One of these was a woman , seated ; her companion was standing in front of her .</p>
    <p n="497">Presently the sound of the woman 's voice came to him distinctly in the warm night air .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , he looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers may have looked at the Christian martyrs ! ”</said>These were the words he heard , in the familiar accent of<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>.</p>
    <p n="498"><said who="#Giovanelli">“ Let us hope he is not very hungry , ”</said>responded the ingenious<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>.<said who="#Giovanelli">“ He will have to take me first ; you will serve for dessert ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="499"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>stopped , with a sort of horror , and , it must be added , with a sort of relief . It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s behavior , and the riddle had become easy to read . She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect . He stood there , looking at her — looking at her companion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely , he himself must have been more brightly visible . He felt angry with himself that he had bothered so much about the right way of regarding<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Miss Daisy Miller</persName>. Then , as he was going to advance again , he checked himself , not from the fear that he was doing her injustice , but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism . He turned away toward the entrance of the place , but , as he did so , he heard<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>speak again .</p>
    <p n="500"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Why , it was<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>! He saw me , and he cuts me ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="501">What a clever little reprobate she was , and how smartly she played at injured innocence ! But he would n't cut her .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>came forward again and went toward the great cross .<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>had got up ;<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>lifted his hat .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>had now begun to think simply of the craziness , from a sanitary point of view , of a delicate young girl lounging away the evening in this nest of malaria . What if she WERE a clever little reprobate ? that was no reason for her dying of the perniciosa .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ How long have you been here ? ”</said>he asked almost brutally .</p>
    <p n="502"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>, lovely in the flattering moonlight , looked at him a moment . Then — “ All the evening , ” she answered , gently . * * * “ I never saw anything so pretty . ”</p>
    <p n="503"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I am afraid , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, “ that you will not think Roman fever very pretty . This is the way people catch it . I wonder , ” he added , turning to<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ that you , a native Roman , should countenance such a terrible indiscretion . ”</said></p>
    <p n="504"><said who="#Giovanelli">“ Ah , ”</said>said the handsome native ,<said who="#Giovanelli">“ for myself I am not afraid . ”</said></p>
    <p n="505"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ Neither am I — for you ! I am speaking for this young lady . ”</said></p>
    <p n="506"><persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>lifted his well-shaped eyebrows and showed his brilliant teeth . But he took<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s rebuke with docility .<said who="#Giovanelli">“ I told the signorina it was a grave indiscretion , but when was the signorina ever prudent ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="507"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I never was sick , and I do n't mean to be ! ”</said>the signorina declared .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ I do n't look like much , but I 'm healthy ! I was bound to see the Colosseum by moonlight ; I should n't have wanted to go home without that ; and we have had the most beautiful time , have n't we ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>? If there has been any danger ,<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>can give me some pills . He has got some splendid pills . ”</said></p>
    <p n="508"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I should advise you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ to drive home as fast as possible and take one ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="509"><said who="#Giovanelli">“ What you say is very wise , ”</said><persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>rejoined .<said who="#Giovanelli">“ I will go and make sure the carriage is at hand . ”</said>And he went forward rapidly .</p>
    <p n="510"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>followed with<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>. He kept looking at her ; she seemed not in the least embarrassed .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>said nothing ;<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>chattered about the beauty of the place .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , I HAVE seen the Colosseum by moonlight ! ”</said>she exclaimed .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ That 's one good thing . ”</said>Then , noticing<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>'s silence , she asked him why he did n't speak . He made no answer ; he only began to laugh . They passed under one of the dark archways ;<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>was in front with the carriage . Here<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>stopped a moment , looking at the young American .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ DID you believe I was engaged , the other day ? ”</said>she asked .</p>
    <p n="511"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ It does n't matter what I believed the other day , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, still laughing .</p>
    <p n="512"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Well , what do you believe now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="513"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ I believe that it makes very little difference whether you are engaged or not ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="514">He felt the young girl 's pretty eyes fixed upon him through the thick gloom of the archway ; she was apparently going to answer . But<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>hurried her forward .<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ Quick ! quick ! ”</said>he said ;<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ if we get in by midnight we are quite safe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="515"><persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>took her seat in the carriage , and the fortunate Italian placed himself beside her .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Do n't forget<persName corresp="#Eugenio">Eugenio</persName>'s pills ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>as he lifted his hat .</p>
    <p n="516"><said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ I do n't care , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>in a little strange tone ,<said who="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">“ whether I have Roman fever or not ! ”</said>Upon this the cab driver cracked his whip , and they rolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement .</p>
    <p n="517"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, to do him justice , as it were , mentioned to no one that he had encountered<persName corresp="#Miss_Miller">Miss Miller</persName>, at midnight , in the Colosseum with a gentleman ; but nevertheless , a couple of days later , the fact of her having been there under these circumstances was known to every member of the little American circle , and commented accordingly .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>reflected that they had of course known it at the hotel , and that , after<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s return , there had been an exchange of remarks between the porter and the cab driver . But the young man was conscious , at the same moment , that it had ceased to be a matter of serious regret to him that the little American flirt should be “ talked about ” by low-minded menials . These people , a day or two later , had serious information to give : the little American flirt was alarmingly ill.<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>, when the rumor came to him , immediately went to the hotel for more news . He found that two or three charitable friends had preceded him , and that they were being entertained in<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>'s salon by<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>.</p>
    <p n="518"><said who="#Randolph">“ It 's going round at night , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Randolph">Randolph</persName>—<said who="#Randolph">“ that 's what made her sick . She 's always going round at night . I should n't think she 'd want to , it 's so plaguy dark . You can n't see anything here at night , except when there 's a moon . In America there 's always a moon ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>was invisible ; she was now , at least , giving her daughter the advantage of her society . It was evident that<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>was dangerously ill .</p>
    <p n="519"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>went often to ask for news of her , and once he saw<persName corresp="#Mrs._Miller">Mrs. Miller</persName>, who , though deeply alarmed , was , rather to his surprise , perfectly composed , and , as it appeared , a most efficient and judicious nurse . She talked a good deal about<persName>Dr. Davis</persName>, but<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>paid her the compliment of saying to himself that she was not , after all , such a monstrous goose .<said who="#Winterbourne">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>spoke of you the other day , ”</said>she said to him .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Half the time she does n't know what she 's saying , but that time I think she did . She gave me a message she told me to tell you . She told me to tell you that she never was engaged to that handsome Italian . I am sure I am very glad ;<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>has n't been near us since she was taken ill . I thought he was so much of a gentleman ; but I do n't call that very polite ! A lady told me that he was afraid I was angry with him for taking<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>round at night . Well , so I am , but I suppose he knows I 'm a lady . I would scorn to scold him . Anyway , she says she 's not engaged . I do n't know why she wanted you to know , but she said to me three times , ‘ Mind you tell<persName corresp="#Mr._Winterbourne">Mr. Winterbourne</persName>. ’ And then she told me to ask if you remembered the time you went to that castle in Switzerland . But I said I would n't give any such messages as that . Only , if she is not engaged , I 'm sure I 'm glad to know it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="520">But , as<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>had said , it mattered very little . A week after this , the poor girl died ; it had been a terrible case of the fever .<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy</persName>'s grave was in the little Protestant cemetery , in an angle of the wall of imperial Rome , beneath the cypresses and the thick spring flowers .<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>stood there beside it , with a number of other mourners , a number larger than the scandal excited by the young lady 's career would have led you to expect . Near him stood<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>, who came nearer still before<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>turned away .<persName corresp="#Giovanelli">Giovanelli</persName>was very pale : on this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole ; he seemed to wish to say something . At last he said , “ She was the most beautiful young lady I ever saw , and the most amiable ” ; and then he added in a moment ,<said who="#Giovanelli">“ and she was the most innocent . ”</said></p>
    <p n="521"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>looked at him and presently repeated his words ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ And the most innocent ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="522"><said who="#Giovanelli">“ The most innocent ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="523"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>felt sore and angry .<said who="#Winterbourne">“ Why the devil , ”</said>he asked ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ did you take her to that fatal place ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="524"><persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>'s urbanity was apparently imperturbable . He looked on the ground a moment , and then he said ,<said who="#Mr._Giovanelli">“ For myself I had no fear ; and she wanted to go . ”</said></p>
    <p n="525"><said who="#Winterbourne">“ That was no reason ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>declared .</p>
    <p n="526">The subtle Roman again dropped his eyes .<said who="#Mr._Giovanelli">“ If she had lived , I should have got nothing . She would never have married me , I am sure . ”</said></p>

    <p n="528"><said who="#Mr._Giovanelli">“ For a moment I hoped so . But no . I am sure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="529"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>listened to him : he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the April daisies . When he turned away again ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Giovanelli">Mr. Giovanelli</persName>, with his light , slow step , had retired .</p>
    <p n="530"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>almost immediately left Rome ; but the following summer he again met his aunt ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>at Vevey .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Costello">Mrs. Costello</persName>was fond of Vevey . In the interval<persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>had often thought of<persName corresp="#Miss_Daisy_Miller">Daisy Miller</persName>and her mystifying manners .

    <p n="534"><persName corresp="#Winterbourne">Winterbourne</persName>offered no answer to this question ; but he presently said ,<said who="#Winterbourne">“ You were right in that remark that you made last summer . I was booked to make a mistake . I have lived too long in foreign parts . ”</said></p>
    <p n="535">Nevertheless , he went back to live at Geneva , whence there continue to come the most contradictory accounts of his motives of sojourn : a report that he is “ studying ” hard — an intimation that he is much interested in a very clever foreign lady .</p>
