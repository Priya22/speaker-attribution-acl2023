   <div type="chapter" n="1">
    <p n="1"><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel Lynde</persName>lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow , fringed with alders and ladies ’ eardrops and traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the old<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Cuthbert</persName>place ; it was reputed to be an intricate , headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods , with dark secrets of pool and cascade ; but by the time it reached<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Lynde</persName>'s Hollow it was a quiet , well-conducted little stream , for not even a brook could run past<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel Lynde</persName>'s door without due regard for decency and decorum ; it probably was conscious that<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>was sitting at her window , keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed , from brooks and children up , and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof .</p>
    <p n="2">There are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it , who can attend closely to their neighbor 's business by dint of neglecting their own ; but<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel Lynde</persName>was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain . She was a notable housewife ; her work was always done and well done ; she “ ran ” the Sewing Circle , helped run the Sunday-school , and was the strongest prop of the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary . Yet with all this<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window , knitting “ cotton warp ” quilts — she had knitted sixteen of them , as Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices — and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond . Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular peninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two sides of it , anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>'s all-seeing eye .</p>
    <p n="3">She was sitting there one afternoon in early June . The sun was coming in at the window warm and bright ; the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom , hummed over by a myriad of bees .<persName corresp="#Thomas">Thomas</persName><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Lynde</persName>— a meek little man whom Avonlea people called “<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel Lynde</persName>'s husband ” — was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn ; and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>ought to have been sowing his on the big red brook field away over by Green Gables .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>knew that he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening before in William J. Blair 's store over at Carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon . Peter had asked him , of course , for<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life .</p>
    <p n="4">And yet here was<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>, at half-past three on the afternoon of a busy day , placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill ; moreover , he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes , which was plain proof that he was going out of Avonlea ; and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare , which betokened that he was going a considerable distance . Now , where was<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>going and why was he going there ?</p>
    <p n="5">Had it been any other man in Avonlea ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>, deftly putting this and that together , might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions . But<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him ; he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy , was something that did n't happen often .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>, ponder as she might , could make nothing of it and her afternoon 's enjoyment was spoiled .</p>
    <p n="6"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I 'll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>where he 's gone and why , ”</said>the worthy woman finally concluded .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ He does n't generally go to town this time of year and he NEVER visits ; if he 'd run out of turnip seed he would n't dress up and take the buggy to go for more ; he was n't driving fast enough to be going for a doctor . Yet something must have happened since last night to start him off . I 'm clean puzzled , that 's what , and I wo n't know a minute 's peace of mind or conscience until I know what has taken<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>out of Avonlea today . ”</said></p>
    <p n="7">Accordingly after tea<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>set out ; she had not far to go ; the big , rambling , orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Lynde</persName>'s Hollow . To be sure , the long lane made it a good deal further .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>'s father , as shy and silent as his son after him , had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead . Green Gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day , barely visible from the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so sociably situated .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel Lynde</persName>did not call living in such a place LIVING at all .</p>
    <p n="8"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ It 's just STAYING , that 's what , ”</said>she said as she stepped along the deep-rutted , grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ It 's no wonder<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>are both a little odd , living away back here by themselves . Trees are n't much company , though dear knows if they were there 'd be enough of them . I 'd ruther look at people . To be sure , they seem contented enough ; but then , I suppose , they 're used to it . A body can get used to anything , even to being hanged , as the Irishman said . ”</said></p>
    <p n="9">With this<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green Gables . Very green and neat and precise was that yard , set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies . Not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen , for<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>would have seen it if there had been . Privately she was of the opinion that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>swept that yard over as often as she swept her house . One could have eaten a meal off the ground without overbrimming the proverbial peck of dirt .</p>
    <p n="10"><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so . The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful apartment — or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor . Its windows looked east and west ; through the west one , looking out on the back yard , came a flood of mellow June sunlight ; but the east one , whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left orchard and nodding , slender birches down in the hollow by the brook , was greened over by a tangle of vines . Here sat<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>, when she sat at all , always slightly distrustful of sunshine , which seemed to her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to be taken seriously ; and here she sat now , knitting , and the table behind her was laid for supper .</p>
    <p n="11"><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>, before she had fairly closed the door , had taken a mental note of everything that was on that table . There were three plates laid , so that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>must be expecting some one home with<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>to tea ; but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves and one kind of cake , so that the expected company could not be any particular company . Yet what of<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s white collar and the sorrel mare ?<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet , unmysterious Green Gables .</p>
    <p n="12"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Good evening ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>, ”</said><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>said briskly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ This is a real fine evening , is n't it ? Wo n't you sit down ? How are all your folks ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="13">Something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>and<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>, in spite of — or perhaps because of — their dissimilarity .</p>
    <p n="14"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was a tall , thin woman , with angles and without curves ; her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it . She looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience , which she was ; but there was a saving something about her mouth which , if it had been ever so slightly developed , might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor .</p>
    <p n="15"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ We 're all pretty well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>.<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I was kind of afraid YOU were n't , though , when I saw<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>starting off today . I thought maybe he was going to the doctor 's . ”</said></p>
    <p n="16"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s lips twitched understandingly . She had expected<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>up ; she had known that the sight of<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor 's curiosity .</p>
    <p n="17"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Oh , no , I 'm quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>went to Bright River . We 're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he 's coming on the train tonight . ”</said></p>
    <p n="18">If<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had said that<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had gone to Bright River to meet a kangaroo from Australia<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>could not have been more astonished . She was actually stricken dumb for five seconds . It was unsupposable that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was making fun of her , but<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>was almost forced to suppose it .</p>
    <p n="19"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Are you in earnest ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said>she demanded when voice returned to her .</p>
    <p n="20"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Yes , of course , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, as if getting boys from orphan asylums in Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated Avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation .</p>
    <p n="21"><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>felt that she had received a severe mental jolt . She thought in exclamation points . A boy !<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>of all people adopting a boy ! From an orphan asylum ! Well , the world was certainly turning upside down ! She would be surprised at nothing after this ! Nothing !</p>
    <p n="22"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ What on earth put such a notion into your head ? ”</said>she demanded disapprovingly .</p>
    <p n="23">This had been done without her advice being asked , and must perforce be disapproved .</p>
    <p n="24"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , we 've been thinking about it for some time — all winter in fact , ”</said>returned<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Mrs. Alexander<persName>Spencer</persName>was up here one day before Christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in Hopeton in the spring . Her cousin lives there and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>has visited here and knows all about it . So<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and I have talked it over off and on ever since . We thought we 'd get a boy .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>is getting up in years , you know — he 's sixty — and he is n't so spry as he once was . His heart troubles him a good deal . And you know how desperate hard it 's got to be to get hired help . There 's never anybody to be had but those stupid , half-grown little French boys ; and as soon as you do get one broke into your ways and taught something he 's up and off to the lobster canneries or the States . At first<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>suggested getting a Home boy . But I said ‘ no ’ flat to that . ‘ They may be all right — I 'm not saying they 're not — but no London street Arabs for me , ’ I said . ‘ Give me a native born at least . There 'll be a risk , no matter who we get . But I 'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born Canadian . ’ So in the end we decided to ask<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>to pick us out one when she went over to get her little girl . We heard last week she was going , so we sent her word by Richard<persName>Spencer</persName>'s folks at Carmody to bring us a smart , likely boy of about ten or eleven . We decided that would be the best age — old enough to be of some use in doing chores right off and young enough to be trained up proper . We mean to give him a good home and schooling . We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander<persName>Spencer</persName>today — the mail-man brought it from the station — saying they were coming on the five-thirty train tonight . So<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>went to Bright River to meet him .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>will drop him off there . Of course she goes on to White Sands station herself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="25"><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>prided herself on always speaking her mind ; she proceeded to speak it now , having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece of news .</p>
    <p n="26"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Well ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I 'll just tell you plain that I think you 're doing a mighty foolish thing — a risky thing , that 's what . You do n't know what you 're getting . You 're bringing a strange child into your house and home and you do n't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is like nor what sort of parents he had nor how he 's likely to turn out . Why , it was only last week I read in the paper how a man and his wife up west of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to the house at night — set it ON PURPOSE ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>— and nearly burnt them to a crisp in their beds . And I know another case where an adopted boy used to suck the eggs — they could n't break him of it . If you had asked my advice in the matter — which you did n't do ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>— I 'd have said for mercy 's sake not to think of such a thing , that 's what . ”</said></p>
    <p n="27">This Job 's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. She knitted steadily on .</p>
    <p n="28"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't deny there 's something in what you say ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>. I 've had some qualms myself . But<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was terrible set on it . I could see that , so I gave in . It 's so seldom<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>sets his mind on anything that when he does I always feel it 's my duty to give in . And as for the risk , there 's risks in pretty near everything a body does in this world . There 's risks in people 's having children of their own if it comes to that — they do n't always turn out well . And then Nova Scotia is right close to the Island . It is n't as if we were getting him from England or the States . He can n't be much different from ourselves . ”</said></p>
    <p n="29"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Well , I hope it will turn out all right , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Only do n't say I did n't warn you if he burns Green Gables down or puts strychnine in the well — I heard of a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan asylum child did that and the whole family died in fearful agonies . Only , it was a girl in that instance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="30"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , we 're not getting a girl , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, as if poisoning wells were a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case of a boy .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up . I wonder at Mrs. Alexander<persName>Spencer</persName>for doing it . But there , SHE would n't shrink from adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head . ”</said></p>
    <p n="31"><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>would have liked to stay until<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>came home with his imported orphan . But reflecting that it would be a good two hours at least before his arrival she concluded to go up the road to Robert<persName>Bell</persName>'s and tell the news . It would certainly make a sensation second to none , and<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>dearly loved to make a sensation . So she took herself away , somewhat to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s relief , for the latter felt her doubts and fears reviving under the influence of<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>'s pessimism .</p>
    <p n="32"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Well , of all things that ever were or will be ! ”</said>ejaculated<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>when she was safely out in the lane .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ It does really seem as if I must be dreaming . Well , I 'm sorry for that poor young one and no mistake .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>do n't know anything about children and they 'll expect him to be wiser and steadier that his own grandfather , if so be 's he ever had a grandfather , which is doubtful . It seems uncanny to think of a child at Green Gables somehow ; there 's never been one there , for<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>were grown up when the new house was built — if they ever WERE children , which is hard to believe when one looks at them . I would n't be in that orphan 's shoes for anything . My , but I pity him , that 's what . ”</said></p>
    <p n="33">So said<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>to the wild rose bushes out of the fulness of her heart ; but if she could have seen the child who was waiting patiently at the Bright River station at that very moment her pity would have been still deeper and more profound .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="2">
    <p n="34"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>and the sorrel mare jogged comfortably over the eight miles to Bright River . It was a pretty road , running along between snug farmsteads , with now and again a bit of balsamy fir wood to drive through or a hollow where wild plums hung out their filmy bloom . The air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards and the meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple ; while</p>
    <p n="35"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ The little birds sang as if it were The one day of summer in all the year . ”</said></p>
    <p n="36"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>enjoyed the drive after his own fashion , except during the moments when he met women and had to nod to them — for in Prince Edward island you are supposed to nod to all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not .</p>
    <p n="37"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>dreaded all women except<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>; he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him . He may have been quite right in thinking so , for he was an odd-looking personage , with an ungainly figure and long iron-gray hair that touched his stooping shoulders , and a full , soft brown beard which he had worn ever since he was twenty . In fact , he had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty , lacking a little of the grayness .</p>
    <p n="38">When he reached Bright River there was no sign of any train ; he thought he was too early , so he tied his horse in the yard of the small Bright River hotel and went over to the station house . The long platform was almost deserted ; the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, barely noting that it WAS a girl , sidled past her as quickly as possible without looking at her . Had he looked he could hardly have failed to notice the tense rigidity and expectation of her attitude and expression . She was sitting there waiting for something or somebody and , since sitting and waiting was the only thing to do just then , she sat and waited with all her might and main .</p>
    <p n="39"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>encountered the stationmaster locking up the ticket office preparatory to going home for supper , and asked him if the five-thirty train would soon be along .</p>
    <p n="40"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ The five-thirty train has been in and gone half an hour ago , ”</said>answered that brisk official .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ But there was a passenger dropped off for you — a little girl . She 's sitting out there on the shingles . I asked her to go into the ladies ’ waiting room , but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside . ‘ There was more scope for imagination , ’ she said . She 's a case , I should say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="41"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I 'm not expecting a girl , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>blankly .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ It 's a boy I 've come for . He should be here . Mrs. Alexander<persName>Spencer</persName>was to bring him over from Nova Scotia for me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="42">The stationmaster whistled .</p>
    <p n="43"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Guess there 's some mistake , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>came off the train with that girl and gave her into my charge . Said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently . That 's all I know about it — and I have n't got any more orphans concealed hereabouts . ”</said></p>
    <p n="44"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I do n't understand , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>helplessly , wishing that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was at hand to cope with the situation .</p>
    <p n="45"><said who="#the_station-master">“ Well , you 'd better question the girl , ”</said>said the station-master carelessly .<said who="#the_station-master">“ I dare say she 'll be able to explain — she 's got a tongue of her own , that 's certain . Maybe they were out of boys of the brand you wanted . ”</said></p>
    <p n="46">He walked jauntily away , being hungry , and the unfortunate<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was left to do that which was harder for him than bearding a lion in its den — walk up to a girl — a strange girl — an orphan girl — and demand of her why she was n't a boy .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>groaned in spirit as he turned about and shuffled gently down the platform towards her .</p>
    <p n="47">She had been watching him ever since he had passed her and she had her eyes on him now .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was not looking at her and would not have seen what she was really like if he had been , but an ordinary observer would have seen this : A child of about eleven , garbed in a very short , very tight , very ugly dress of yellowish-gray wincey . She wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat , extending down her back , were two braids of very thick , decidedly red hair . Her face was small , white and thin , also much freckled ; her mouth was large and so were her eyes , which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others .</p>
    <p n="48">So far , the ordinary observer ; an extraordinary observer might have seen that the chin was very pointed and pronounced ; that the big eyes were full of spirit and vivacity ; that the mouth was sweet-lipped and expressive ; that the forehead was broad and full ; in short , our discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded that no commonplace soul inhabited the body of this stray woman-child of whom shy<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>was so ludicrously afraid .</p>
    <p n="49"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, however , was spared the ordeal of speaking first , for as soon as she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up , grasping with one thin brown hand the handle of a shabby , old-fashioned carpet-bag ; the other she held out to him .</p>
    <p n="50"><said>“ I suppose you are Mr.<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>of Green Gables ? ”</said>she said in a peculiarly clear , sweet voice .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I 'm very glad to see you . I was beginning to be afraid you were n't coming for me and I was imagining all the things that might have happened to prevent you . I had made up my mind that if you did n't come for me to-night I 'd go down the track to that big wild cherry-tree at the bend , and climb up into it to stay all night . I would n't be a bit afraid , and it would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine , do n't you think ? You could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls , could n't you ? And I was quite sure you would come for me in the morning , if you did n't to-night . ”</said></p>
    <p n="51"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his ; then and there he decided what to do . He could not tell this child with the glowing eyes that there had been a mistake ; he would take her home and let<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>do that . She could n't be left at Bright River anyhow , no matter what mistake had been made , so all questions and explanations might as well be deferred until he was safely back at Green Gables .</p>
    <p n="52"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I 'm sorry I was late , ”</said>he said shyly .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Come along . The horse is over in the yard . Give me your bag . ”</said></p>
    <p n="53"><said who="#the_child">“ Oh , I can carry it , ”</said>the child responded cheerfully .<said who="#the_child">“ It is n't heavy . I 've got all my worldly goods in it , but it is n't heavy . And if it is n't carried in just a certain way the handle pulls out — so I 'd better keep it because I know the exact knack of it . It 's an extremely old carpet-bag . Oh , I 'm very glad you 've come , even if it would have been nice to sleep in a wild cherry-tree . We 've got to drive a long piece , have n't we ?<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>said it was eight miles . I 'm glad because I love driving . Oh , it seems so wonderful that I 'm going to live with you and belong to you . I 've never belonged to anybody — not really . But the asylum was the worst . I 've only been in it four months , but that was enough . I do n't suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum , so you can n't possibly understand what it is like . It 's worse than anything you could imagine .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>said it was wicked of me to talk like that , but I did n't mean to be wicked . It 's so easy to be wicked without knowing it , is n't it ? They were good , you know — the asylum people . But there is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum — only just in the other orphans . It was pretty interesting to imagine things about them — to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really the daughter of a belted earl , who had been stolen away from her parents in her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess . I used to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that , because I did n't have time in the day . I guess that 's why I 'm so thin — I AM dreadful thin , ai n't I ? There is n't a pick on my bones . I do love to imagine I 'm nice and plump , with dimples in my elbows . ”</said></p>
    <p n="54">With this<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s companion stopped talking , partly because she was out of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy . Not another word did she say until they had left the village and were driving down a steep little hill , the road part of which had been cut so deeply into the soft soil , that the banks , fringed with blooming wild cherry-trees and slim white birches , were several feet above their heads .</p>
    <p n="55">The child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that brushed against the side of the buggy .</p>
    <p n="56"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Is n't that beautiful ? What did that tree , leaning out from the bank , all white and lacy , make you think of ? ”</said>she asked .</p>
    <p n="57"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I dunno , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.</p>
    <p n="58"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Why , a bride , of course — a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil . I 've never seen one , but I can imagine what she would look like . I do n't ever expect to be a bride myself . I 'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me — unless it might be a foreign missionary . I suppose a foreign missionary might n't be very particular . But I do hope that some day I shall have a white dress . That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss . I just love pretty clothes . And I 've never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember — but of course it 's all the more to look forward to , is n't it ? And then I can imagine that I 'm dressed gorgeously . This morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear this horrid old wincey dress . All the orphans had to wear them , you know . A merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of wincey to the asylum . Some people said it was because he could n't sell it , but I 'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart , would n't you ? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be looking at me and pitying me . But I just went to work and imagined that I had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress — because when you ARE imagining you might as well imagine something worth while — and a big hat all flowers and nodding plumes , and a gold watch , and kid gloves and boots . I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island with all my might . I was n't a bit sick coming over in the boat . Neither was<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>although she generally is . She said she had n't time to get sick , watching to see that I did n't fall overboard . She said she never saw the beat of me for prowling about . But if it kept her from being seasick it 's a mercy I did prowl , is n't it ? And I wanted to see everything that was to be seen on that boat , because I did n't know whether I 'd ever have another opportunity . Oh , there are a lot more cherry-trees all in bloom ! This Island is the bloomiest place . I just love it already , and I 'm so glad I 'm going to live here . I 've always heard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world , and I used to imagine I was living here , but I never really expected I would . It 's delightful when your imaginations come true , is n't it ? But those red roads are so funny . When we got into the train at Charlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>what made them red and she said she did n't know and for pity 's sake not to ask her any more questions . She said I must have asked her a thousand already . I suppose I had , too , but how you going to find out about things if you do n't ask questions ? And what DOES make the roads red ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="59"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I dunno , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.</p>
    <p n="60"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , that is one of the things to find out sometime . Is n't it splendid to think of all the things there are to find out about ? It just makes me feel glad to be alive — it 's such an interesting world . It would n't be half so interesting if we know all about everything , would it ? There 'd be no scope for imagination then , would there ? But am I talking too much ? People are always telling me I do . Would you rather I did n't talk ? If you say so I 'll stop . I can STOP when I make up my mind to it , although it 's difficult . ”</said></p>
    <p n="61"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, much to his own surprise , was enjoying himself . Like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it . But he had never expected to enjoy the society of a little girl . Women were bad enough in all conscience , but little girls were worse . He detested the way they had of sidling past him timidly , with sidewise glances , as if they expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to say a word . That was the Avonlea type of well-bred little girl . But this freckled witch was very different , and although he found it rather difficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental processes he thought that he “ kind of liked her chatter . ” So he said as shyly as usual :</p>
    <p n="62"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Oh , you can talk as much as you like . I do n't mind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="63"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Oh , I 'm so glad . I know you and I are going to get along together fine . It 's such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told that children should be seen and not heard . I 've had that said to me a million times if I have once . And people laugh at me because I use big words . But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them , have n't you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="64"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , that seems reasonable , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.</p>
    <p n="65"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>said that my tongue must be hung in the middle . But it is n't — it 's firmly fastened at one end .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>said your place was named Green Gables . I asked her all about it . And she said there were trees all around it . I was gladder than ever . I just love trees . And there were n't any at all about the asylum , only a few poor weeny-teeny things out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them . They just looked like orphans themselves , those trees did . It used to make me want to cry to look at them . I used to say to them , ‘ Oh , you POOR little things ! If you were out in a great big woods with other trees all around you and little mosses and Junebells growing over your roots and a brook not far away and birds singing in you branches , you could grow , could n't you ? But you can n't where you are . I know just exactly how you feel , little trees . ’ I felt sorry to leave them behind this morning . You do get so attached to things like that , do n't you ? Is there a brook anywhere near Green Gables ? I forgot to ask<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="66"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , yes , there 's one right below the house . ”</said></p>
    <p n="67"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Fancy . It 's always been one of my dreams to live near a brook . I never expected I would , though . Dreams do n't often come true , do they ? Would n't it be nice if they did ? But just now I feel pretty nearly perfectly happy . I can n't feel exactly perfectly happy because — well , what color would you call this ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="68">She twitched one of her long glossy braids over her thin shoulder and held it up before<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s eyes .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was not used to deciding on the tints of ladies ’ tresses , but in this case there could n't be much doubt .</p>
    <p n="69"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ It 's red , ai n't it ? ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="70">The girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from her very toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages .</p>
    <p n="71"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Yes , it 's red , ”</said>she said resignedly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Now you see why I can n't be perfectly happy . Nobody could who has red hair . I do n't mind the other things so much — the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness . I can imagine them away . I can imagine that I have a beautiful rose-leaf complexion and lovely starry violet eyes . But I CANNOT imagine that red hair away . I do my best . I think to myself , ‘ Now my hair is a glorious black , black as the raven 's wing . ’ But all the time I KNOW it is just plain red and it breaks my heart . It will be my lifelong sorrow . I read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it was n't red hair . Her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster brow . What is an alabaster brow ? I never could find out . Can you tell me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="72"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I 'm afraid I can n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, who was getting a little dizzy . He felt as he had once felt in his rash youth when another boy had enticed him on the merry-go-round at a picnic .</p>
    <p n="73"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was divinely beautiful . Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be divinely beautiful ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="74"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , no , I have n't , ”</said>confessed<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>ingenuously .</p>
    <p n="75"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I have , often . Which would you rather be if you had the choice — divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="76"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I — I do n't know exactly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="77"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Neither do I. I can never decide . But it does n't make much real difference for it is n't likely I 'll ever be either . It 's certain I 'll never be angelically good .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>says — oh ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cuthbert">Mr. Cuthbert</persName>! Oh , Mr .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Cuthbert</persName>!! Oh , Mr .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Cuthbert</persName>!!! ”</said></p>
    <p n="78">That was not what<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>had said ; neither had the child tumbled out of the buggy nor had<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>done anything astonishing . They had simply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the “ Avenue . ”</p>
    <p n="79">The “ Avenue , ” so called by the Newbridge people , was a stretch of road four or five hundred yards long , completely arched over with huge , wide-spreading apple-trees , planted years ago by an eccentric old farmer . Overhead was one long canopy of snowy fragrant bloom . Below the boughs the air was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse of painted sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a cathedral aisle .</p>
    <p n="80">Its beauty seemed to strike the child dumb . She leaned back in the buggy , her thin hands clasped before her , her face lifted rapturously to the white splendor above . Even when they had passed out and were driving down the long slope to Newbridge she never moved or spoke . Still with rapt face she gazed afar into the sunset west , with eyes that saw visions trooping splendidly across that glowing background . Through Newbridge , a bustling little village where dogs barked at them and small boys hooted and curious faces peered from the windows , they drove , still in silence . When three more miles had dropped away behind them the child had not spoken . She could keep silence , it was evident , as energetically as she could talk .</p>
    <p n="81"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I guess you 're feeling pretty tired and hungry , ”</said><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>ventured to say at last , accounting for her long visitation of dumbness with the only reason he could think of .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ But we have n't very far to go now — only another mile . ”</said></p>
    <p n="82">She came out of her reverie with a deep sigh and looked at him with the dreamy gaze of a soul that had been wondering afar , star-led .</p>
    <p n="83"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cuthbert">Mr. Cuthbert</persName>, ”</said>she whispered ,<said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ that place we came through — that white place — what was it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="84"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , you must mean the Avenue , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>after a few moments ’ profound reflection .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ It is a kind of pretty place . ”</said></p>
    <p n="85"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ Pretty ? Oh , PRETTY does n't seem the right word to use . Nor beautiful , either . They do n't go far enough . Oh , it was wonderful — wonderful . It 's the first thing I ever saw that could n't be improved upon by imagination . It just satisfies me here ”</said>— she put one hand on her breast —<said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ it made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache . Did you ever have an ache like that ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cuthbert">Mr. Cuthbert</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="86"><said who="#Mr._Cuthbert">“ Well now , I just can n't recollect that I ever had . ”</said></p>
    <p n="87"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ I have it lots of time — whenever I see anything royally beautiful . But they should n't call that lovely place the Avenue . There is no meaning in a name like that . They should call it — let me see — the White Way of Delight . Is n't that a nice imaginative name ? When I do n't like the name of a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of them so . There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins , but I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere . Other people may call that place the Avenue , but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight . Have we really only another mile to go before we get home ? I 'm glad and I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and I 'm always sorry when pleasant things end . Something still pleasanter may come after , but you can never be sure . And it 's so often the case that it is n't pleasanter . That has been my experience anyhow . But I 'm glad to think of getting home . You see , I 've never had a real home since I can remember . It gives me that pleasant ache again just to think of coming to a really truly home . Oh , is n't that pretty ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="88">They had driven over the crest of a hill . Below them was a pond , looking almost like a river so long and winding was it . A bridge spanned it midway and from there to its lower end , where an amber-hued belt of sand-hills shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond , the water was a glory of many shifting hues — the most spiritual shadings of crocus and rose and ethereal green , with other elusive tintings for which no name has ever been found . Above the bridge the pond ran up into fringing groves of fir and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering shadows . Here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a white-clad girl tip-toeing to her own reflection . From the marsh at the head of the pond came the clear , mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs . There was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on a slope beyond and , although it was not yet quite dark , a light was shining from one of its windows .</p>
    <p n="89"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ That 's<persName>Barry</persName>'s pond , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.</p>
    <p n="90"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ Oh , I do n't like that name , either . I shall call it — let me see — the Lake of Shining Waters . Yes , that is the right name for it . I know because of the thrill . When I hit on a name that suits exactly it gives me a thrill . Do things ever give you a thrill ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="91"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>ruminated .</p>
    <p n="92"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , yes . It always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly white grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds . I hate the look of them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="93"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ Oh , I do n't think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill . Do you think it can ? There does n't seem to be much connection between grubs and lakes of shining waters , does there ? But why do other people call it<persName>Barry</persName>'s pond ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="94"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I reckon because<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>lives up there in that house . Orchard Slope 's the name of his place . If it was n't for that big bush behind it you could see Green Gables from here . But we have to go over the bridge and round by the road , so it 's near half a mile further . ”</said></p>
    <p n="95"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ Has<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>any little girls ? Well , not so very little either — about my size . ”</said></p>
    <p n="96"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ He 's got one about eleven . Her name is<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="97"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ Oh ! ”</said>with a long indrawing of breath .<said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ What a perfectly lovely name ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="98"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I dunno . There 's something dreadful heathenish about it , seems to me . I 'd ruther<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>or Mary or some sensible name like that . But when<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they gave him the naming of her and he called her<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="99"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ I wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when I was born , then . Oh , here we are at the bridge . I 'm going to shut my eyes tight . I 'm always afraid going over bridges . I can n't help imagining that perhaps just as we get to the middle , they 'll crumple up like a jack-knife and nip us . So I shut my eyes . But I always have to open them for all when I think we 're getting near the middle . Because , you see , if the bridge DID crumple up I 'd want to SEE it crumple . What a jolly rumble it makes ! I always like the rumble part of it . Is n't it splendid there are so many things to like in this world ? There we 're over . Now I 'll look back . Good night , dear Lake of Shining Waters . I always say good night to the things I love , just as I would to people . I think they like it . That water looks as if it was smiling at me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="100">When they had driven up the further hill and around a corner<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>said :</p>
    <p n="101"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ We 're pretty near home now . That 's Green Gables over — ”</said></p>
    <p n="102"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ Oh , do n't tell me , ”</said>she interrupted breathlessly , catching at his partially raised arm and shutting her eyes that she might not see his gesture .<said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ Let me guess . I 'm sure I 'll guess right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="103">She opened her eyes and looked about her . They were on the crest of a hill . The sun had set some time since , but the landscape was still clear in the mellow afterlight . To the west a dark church spire rose up against a marigold sky . Below was a little valley and beyond a long , gently-rising slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it . From one to another the child 's eyes darted , eager and wistful . At last they lingered on one away to the left , far back from the road , dimly white with blossoming trees in the twilight of the surrounding woods . Over it , in the stainless southwest sky , a great crystal-white star was shining like a lamp of guidance and promise .</p>
    <p n="104"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ That 's it , is n't it ? ”</said>she said , pointing .</p>
    <p n="105"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>slapped the reins on the sorrel 's back delightedly .</p>
    <p n="106"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , you 've guessed it ! But I reckon<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>described it so 's you could tell . ”</said></p>
    <p n="107"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ No , she did n't — really she did n't . All she said might just as well have been about most of those other places . I had n't any real idea what it looked like . But just as soon as I saw it I felt it was home . Oh , it seems as if I must be in a dream . Do you know , my arm must be black and blue from the elbow up , for I 've pinched myself so many times today . Every little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and I 'd be so afraid it was all a dream . Then I 'd pinch myself to see if it was real — until suddenly I remembered that even supposing it was only a dream I 'd better go on dreaming as long as I could ; so I stopped pinching . But it IS real and we 're nearly home . ”</said></p>
    <p n="108">With a sigh of rapture she relapsed into silence .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>stirred uneasily . He felt glad that it would be<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and not he who would have to tell this waif of the world that the home she longed for was not to be hers after all . They drove over<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Lynde</persName>'s Hollow , where it was already quite dark , but not so dark that<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>could not see them from her window vantage , and up the hill and into the long lane of Green Gables . By the time they arrived at the house<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was shrinking from the approaching revelation with an energy he did not understand . It was not of<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>or himself he was thinking of the trouble this mistake was probably going to make for them , but of the child 's disappointment . When he thought of that rapt light being quenched in her eyes he had an uncomfortable feeling that he was going to assist at murdering something — much the same feeling that came over him when he had to kill a lamb or calf or any other innocent little creature .</p>
    <p n="109">The yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves were rustling silkily all round it .</p>
    <p n="110"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Listen to the trees talking in their sleep , ”</said>she whispered , as he lifted her to the ground .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ What nice dreams they must have ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="111">Then , holding tightly to the carpet-bag which contained “ all her worldly goods , ” she followed him into the house .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="3">
    <p n="112"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>came briskly forward as<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>opened the door . But when her eyes fell of the odd little figure in the stiff , ugly dress , with the long braids of red hair and the eager , luminous eyes , she stopped short in amazement .</p>
    <p n="113"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>, who 's that ? ”</said>she ejaculated .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Where is the boy ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="114"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ There was n't any boy , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>wretchedly .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ There was only HER . ”</said></p>
    <p n="115">He nodded at the child , remembering that he had never even asked her name .</p>
    <p n="116"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No boy ! But there MUST have been a boy , ”</said>insisted<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ We sent word to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>to bring a boy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="117"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well , she did n't . She brought HER . I asked the station-master . And I had to bring her home . She could n't be left there , no matter where the mistake had come in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="118"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , this is a pretty piece of business ! ”</said>ejaculated<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="119">During this dialogue the child had remained silent , her eyes roving from one to the other , all the animation fading out of her face . Suddenly she seemed to grasp the full meaning of what had been said . Dropping her precious carpet-bag she sprang forward a step and clasped her hands .</p>
    <p n="120"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You do n't want me ! ”</said>she cried .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You do n't want me because I 'm not a boy ! I might have expected it . Nobody ever did want me . I might have known it was all too beautiful to last . I might have known nobody really did want me . Oh , what shall I do ? I 'm going to burst into tears ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="121">Burst into tears she did . Sitting down on a chair by the table , flinging her arms out upon it , and burying her face in them , she proceeded to cry stormily .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>looked at each other deprecatingly across the stove . Neither of them knew what to say or do . Finally<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>stepped lamely into the breach .</p>
    <p n="122"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , well , there 's no need to cry so about it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="123"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Yes , there IS need ! ”</said>The child raised her head quickly , revealing a tear-stained face and trembling lips .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ YOU would cry , too , if you were an orphan and had come to a place you thought was going to be home and found that they did n't want you because you were n't a boy . Oh , this is the most TRAGICAL thing that ever happened to me ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="124">Something like a reluctant smile , rather rusty from long disuse , mellowed<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s grim expression .</p>
    <p n="125"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , do n't cry any more . We 're not going to turn you out-of-doors to-night . You 'll have to stay here until we investigate this affair . What 's your name ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="126">The child hesitated for a moment .</p>
    <p n="127"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Will you please call me<persName>Cordelia</persName>? ”</said>she said eagerly .</p>
    <p n="128"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ CALL you<persName>Cordelia</persName>? Is that your name ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="129"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No-o-o , it 's not exactly my name , but I would love to be called<persName>Cordelia</persName>. It 's such a perfectly elegant name . ”</said></p>
    <p n="130"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I do n't know what on earth you mean . If<persName>Cordelia</persName>is n't your name , what is ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="131"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, ”</said>reluctantly faltered forth the owner of that name ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ but , oh , please do call me<persName>Cordelia</persName>. It can n't matter much to you what you call me if I 'm only going to be here a little while , can it ? And<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>is such an unromantic name . ”</said></p>
    <p n="132"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Unromantic fiddlesticks ! ”</said>said the unsympathetic<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>is a real good plain sensible name . You 've no need to be ashamed of it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="133"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I 'm not ashamed of it , ”</said>explained<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,<said>“ only I like<persName>Cordelia</persName>better . I 've always imagined that my name was<persName>Cordelia</persName>— at least , I always have of late years . When I was young I used to imagine it was<persName>Geraldine</persName>, but I like<persName>Cordelia</persName>better now . But if you call me<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>please call me<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>spelled with an E . ”</said></p>
    <p n="134"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ What difference does it make how it 's spelled ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>with another rusty smile as she picked up the teapot .</p>
    <p n="135"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Oh , it makes SUCH a difference . It LOOKS so much nicer . When you hear a name pronounced can n't you always see it in your mind , just as if it was printed out ? I can ; and A-n-n looks dreadful , but A-n-n-e looks so much more distinguished . If you 'll only call me<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>spelled with an E I shall try to reconcile myself to not being called<persName>Cordelia</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="136"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Very well , then ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>spelled with an E , can you tell us how this mistake came to be made ? We sent word to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>to bring us a boy . Were there no boys at the asylum ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="137"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , yes , there was an abundance of them . But<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>said DISTINCTLY that you wanted a girl about eleven years old . And the matron said she thought I would do . You do n't know how delighted I was . I could n't sleep all last night for joy . Oh , ”</said>she added reproachfully , turning to<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>,<said who="#Anne">“ why did n't you tell me at the station that you did n't want me and leave me there ? If I had n't seen the White Way of Delight and the Lake of Shining Waters it would n't be so hard . ”</said></p>
    <p n="138"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ What on earth does she mean ? ”</said>demanded<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, staring at<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.</p>
    <p n="139"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ She — she 's just referring to some conversation we had on the road , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>hastily .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I 'm going out to put the mare in ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. Have tea ready when I come back . ”</said></p>
    <p n="140"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Did<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>bring anybody over besides you ? ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>when<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had gone out .</p>
    <p n="141"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ She brought Lily Jones for herself . Lily is only five years old and she is very beautiful and had nut-brown hair . If I was very beautiful and had nut-brown hair would you keep me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="142"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No . We want a boy to help<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>on the farm . A girl would be of no use to us . Take off your hat . I 'll lay it and your bag on the hall table . ”</said></p>
    <p n="143"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>took off her hat meekly .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>came back presently and they sat down to supper . But<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>could not eat . In vain she nibbled at the bread and butter and pecked at the crab-apple preserve out of the little scalloped glass dish by her plate . She did not really make any headway at all .</p>
    <p n="144"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You 're not eating anything , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sharply , eying her as if it were a serious shortcoming .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sighed .</p>
    <p n="145"><said who="#Anne">“ I can n't . I 'm in the depths of despair . Can you eat when you are in the depths of despair ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="146"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 've never been in the depths of despair , so I can n't say , ”</said>responded<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="147"><said who="#Anne">“ Were n't you ? Well , did you ever try to IMAGINE you were in the depths of despair ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="148"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No , I did n't . ”</said></p>
    <p n="149"><said who="#Anne">“ Then I do n't think you can understand what it 's like . It 's very uncomfortable feeling indeed . When you try to eat a lump comes right up in your throat and you can n't swallow anything , not even if it was a chocolate caramel . I had one chocolate caramel once two years ago and it was simply delicious . I 've often dreamed since then that I had a lot of chocolate caramels , but I always wake up just when I 'm going to eat them . I do hope you wo n't be offended because I can n't eat . Everything is extremely nice , but still I cannot eat . ”</said></p>
    <p n="150"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I guess she 's tired , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, who had n't spoken since his return from the barn .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Best put her to bed ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="151"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had been wondering where<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>should be put to bed . She had prepared a couch in the kitchen chamber for the desired and expected boy . But , although it was neat and clean , it did not seem quite the thing to put a girl there somehow . But the spare room was out of the question for such a stray waif , so there remained only the east gable room .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>lighted a candle and told<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>to follow her , which<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>spiritlessly did , taking her hat and carpet-bag from the hall table as she passed . The hall was fearsomely clean ; the little gable chamber in which she presently found herself seemed still cleaner .</p>
    <p n="152"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>set the candle on a three-legged , three-cornered table and turned down the bedclothes .</p>
    <p n="153"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I suppose you have a nightgown ? ”</said>she questioned .</p>
    <p n="154"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>nodded .</p>
    <p n="155"><said who="#Anne">“ Yes , I have two . The matron of the asylum made them for me . They 're fearfully skimpy . There is never enough to go around in an asylum , so things are always skimpy — at least in a poor asylum like ours . I hate skimpy night-dresses . But one can dream just as well in them as in lovely trailing ones , with frills around the neck , that 's one consolation . ”</said></p>
    <p n="156"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , undress as quick as you can and go to bed . I 'll come back in a few minutes for the candle . I dare n't trust you to put it out yourself . You 'd likely set the place on fire . ”</said></p>
    <p n="157">When<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had gone<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked around her wistfully . The whitewashed walls were so painfully bare and staring that she thought they must ache over their own bareness . The floor was bare , too , except for a round braided mat in the middle such as<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had never seen before . In one corner was the bed , a high , old-fashioned one , with four dark , low-turned posts . In the other corner was the aforesaid three-corner table adorned with a fat , red velvet pin-cushion hard enough to turn the point of the most adventurous pin . Above it hung a little six-by-eight mirror . Midway between table and bed was the window , with an icy white muslin frill over it , and opposite it was the wash-stand . The whole apartment was of a rigidity not to be described in words , but which sent a shiver to the very marrow of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s bones . With a sob she hastily discarded her garments , put on the skimpy nightgown and sprang into bed where she burrowed face downward into the pillow and pulled the clothes over her head . When<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>came up for the light various skimpy articles of raiment scattered most untidily over the floor and a certain tempestuous appearance of the bed were the only indications of any presence save her own .</p>
    <p n="158">She deliberately picked up<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s clothes , placed them neatly on a prim yellow chair , and then , taking up the candle , went over to the bed .</p>
    <p n="159"><said who="#Anne">“ Good night , ”</said>she said , a little awkwardly , but not unkindly .</p>
    <p n="160"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s white face and big eyes appeared over the bedclothes with a startling suddenness .</p>
    <p n="161"><said who="#Anne">“ How can you call it a GOOD night when you know it must be the very worst night I 've ever had ? ”</said>she said reproachfully .</p>
    <p n="162">Then she dived down into invisibility again .</p>
    <p n="163"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>went slowly down to the kitchen and proceeded to wash the supper dishes .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was smoking — a sure sign of perturbation of mind . He seldom smoked , for<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>set her face against it as a filthy habit ; but at certain times and seasons he felt driven to it and them<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>winked at the practice , realizing that a mere man must have some vent for his emotions .</p>
    <p n="164"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , this is a pretty kettle of fish , ”</said>she said wrathfully .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ This is what comes of sending word instead of going ourselves . Richard<persName>Spencer</persName>'s folks have twisted that message somehow . One of us will have to drive over and see<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>tomorrow , that 's certain . This girl will have to be sent back to the asylum . ”</said></p>
    <p n="165"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Yes , I suppose so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>reluctantly .</p>
    <p n="166"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You SUPPOSE so ! Do n't you know it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="167"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , she 's a real nice little thing ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. It 's kind of a pity to send her back when she 's so set on staying here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="168"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>, you do n't mean to say you think we ought to keep her ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="169"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s astonishment could not have been greater if<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had expressed a predilection for standing on his head .</p>
    <p n="170"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well , now , no , I suppose not — not exactly , ”</said>stammered<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, uncomfortably driven into a corner for his precise meaning .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I suppose — we could hardly be expected to keep her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="171"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I should say not . What good would she be to us ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="172"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ We might be some good to her , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>suddenly and unexpectedly .</p>
    <p n="173"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>, I believe that child has bewitched you ! I can see as plain as plain that you want to keep her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="174"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , she 's a real interesting little thing , ”</said>persisted<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ You should have heard her talk coming from the station . ”</said></p>
    <p n="175"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Oh , she can talk fast enough . I saw that at once . It 's nothing in her favour , either . I do n't like children who have so much to say . I do n't want an orphan girl and if I did she is n't the style I 'd pick out . There 's something I do n't understand about her .

And to bed , when she had put her dishes away , went<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, frowning most resolutely . And up-stairs , in the east gable , a lonely , heart-hungry , friendless child cried herself to sleep .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="4">
    <p n="180">It was broad daylight when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>awoke and sat up in bed , staring confusedly at the window through which a flood of cheery sunshine was pouring and outside of which something white and feathery waved across glimpses of blue sky .</p>
    <p n="181">For a moment she could not remember where she was . First came a delightful thrill , as something very pleasant ; then a horrible remembrance . This was Green Gables and they did n't want her because she was n't a boy !</p>
    <p n="182">But it was morning and , yes , it was a cherry-tree in full bloom outside of her window . With a bound she was out of bed and across the floor . She pushed up the sash — it went up stiffly and creakily , as if it had n't been opened for a long time , which was the case ; and it stuck so tight that nothing was needed to hold it up .</p>
    <p n="183"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>dropped on her knees and gazed out into the June morning , her eyes glistening with delight . Oh , was n't it beautiful ? Was n't it a lovely place ? Suppose she was n't really going to stay here ! She would imagine she was . There was scope for imagination here .</p>
    <p n="184">A huge cherry-tree grew outside , so close that its boughs tapped against the house , and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf was to be seen . On both sides of the house was a big orchard , one of apple-trees and one of cherry-trees , also showered over with blossoms ; and their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions . In the garden below were lilac-trees purple with flowers , and their dizzily sweet fragrance drifted up to the window on the morning wind .</p>
    <p n="185">Below the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the hollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew , upspringing airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful possibilities in ferns and mosses and woodsy things generally . Beyond it was a hill , green and feathery with spruce and fir ; there was a gap in it where the gray gable end of the little house she had seen from the other side of the Lake of Shining Waters was visible .</p>
    <p n="186">Off to the left were the big barns and beyond them , away down over green , low-sloping fields , was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea .</p>
    <p n="187"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all , taking everything greedily in . She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life , poor child ; but this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed .</p>
    <p n="188">She knelt there , lost to everything but the loveliness around her , until she was startled by a hand on her shoulder .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had come in unheard by the small dreamer .</p>
    <p n="189"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It 's time you were dressed , ”</said>she said curtly .</p>
    <p n="190"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>really did not know how to talk to the child , and her uncomfortable ignorance made her crisp and curt when she did not mean to be .</p>
    <p n="191"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>stood up and drew a long breath .</p>
    <p n="192"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , is n't it wonderful ? ”</said>she said , waving her hand comprehensively at the good world outside .</p>
    <p n="193"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It 's a big tree , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ and it blooms great , but the fruit do n't amount to much never — small and wormy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="194"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I do n't mean just the tree ; of course it 's lovely — yes , it 's RADIANTLY lovely — it blooms as if it meant it — but I meant everything , the garden and the orchard and the brook and the woods , the whole big dear world . Do n't you feel as if you just loved the world on a morning like this ? And I can hear the brook laughing all the way up here . Have you ever noticed what cheerful things brooks are ? They 're always laughing . Even in winter-time I 've heard them under the ice . I 'm so glad there 's a brook near Green Gables . Perhaps you think it does n't make any difference to me when you 're not going to keep me , but it does . I shall always like to remember that there is a brook at Green Gables even if I never see it again . If there was n't a brook I 'd be HAUNTED by the uncomfortable feeling that there ought to be one . I 'm not in the depths of despair this morning . I never can be in the morning . Is n't it a splendid thing that there are mornings ? But I feel very sad . I 've just been imagining that it was really me you wanted after all and that I was to stay here for ever and ever . It was a great comfort while it lasted . But the worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts . ”</said></p>
    <p n="195"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You 'd better get dressed and come down-stairs and never mind your imaginings , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>as soon as she could get a word in edgewise .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Breakfast is waiting . Wash your face and comb your hair . Leave the window up and turn your bedclothes back over the foot of the bed . Be as smart as you can . ”</said></p>
    <p n="196"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>could evidently be smart to some purpose for she was down-stairs in ten minutes ’ time , with her clothes neatly on , her hair brushed and braided , her face washed , and a comfortable consciousness pervading her soul that she had fulfilled all<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s requirements . As a matter of fact , however , she had forgotten to turn back the bedclothes .</p>
    <p n="197"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'm pretty hungry this morning , ”</said>she announced as she slipped into the chair<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>placed for her .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ The world does n't seem such a howling wilderness as it did last night . I 'm so glad it 's a sunshiny morning . But I like rainy mornings real well , too . All sorts of mornings are interesting , do n't you think ? You do n't know what 's going to happen through the day , and there 's so much scope for imagination . But I 'm glad it 's not rainy today because it 's easier to be cheerful and bear up under affliction on a sunshiny day . I feel that I have a good deal to bear up under . It 's all very well to read about sorrows and imagine yourself living through them heroically , but it 's not so nice when you really come to have them , is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="198"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ For pity 's sake hold your tongue , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You talk entirely too much for a little girl . ”</said></p>
    <p n="199">Thereupon<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>held her tongue so obediently and thoroughly that her continued silence made<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>rather nervous , as if in the presence of something not exactly natural .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>also held his tongue ,— but this was natural ,— so that the meal was a very silent one .</p>
    <p n="200">As it progressed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>became more and more abstracted , eating mechanically , with her big eyes fixed unswervingly and unseeingly on the sky outside the window . This made<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>more nervous than ever ; she had an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd child 's body might be there at the table her spirit was far away in some remote airy cloudland , borne aloft on the wings of imagination . Who would want such a child about the place ?</p>
    <p n="201">Yet<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>wished to keep her , of all unaccountable things !<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>felt that he wanted it just as much this morning as he had the night before , and that he would go on wanting it . That was<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s way — take a whim into his head and cling to it with the most amazing silent persistency — a persistency ten times more potent and effectual in its very silence than if he had talked it out .</p>
    <p n="202">When the meal was ended<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>came out of her reverie and offered to wash the dishes .</p>
    <p n="203"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Can you wash dishes right ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>distrustfully .</p>
    <p n="204"><said who="#Anne">“ Pretty well . I 'm better at looking after children , though . I 've had so much experience at that . It 's such a pity you have n't any here for me to look after . ”</said></p>
    <p n="205"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't feel as if I wanted any more children to look after than I 've got at present . YOU 'RE problem enough in all conscience . What 's to be done with you I do n't know .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>is a most ridiculous man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="206"><said who="#Anne">“ I think he 's lovely , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>reproachfully .<said who="#Anne">“ He is so very sympathetic . He did n't mind how much I talked — he seemed to like it . I felt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="207"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You 're both queer enough , if that 's what you mean by kindred spirits , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>with a sniff .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Yes , you may wash the dishes . Take plenty of hot water , and be sure you dry them well . I 've got enough to attend to this morning for I 'll have to drive over to White Sands in the afternoon and see<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>. You 'll come with me and we 'll settle what 's to be done with you . After you 've finished the dishes go up-stairs and make your bed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="208"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>washed the dishes deftly enough , as<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>who kept a sharp eye on the process , discerned . Later on she made her bed less successfully , for she had never learned the art of wrestling with a feather tick . But is was done somehow and smoothed down ; and then<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, to get rid of her , told her she might go out-of-doors and amuse herself until dinner time .</p>
    <p n="209"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>flew to the door , face alight , eyes glowing . On the very threshold she stopped short , wheeled about , came back and sat down by the table , light and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an extinguisher on her .</p>
    <p n="210"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ What 's the matter now ? ”</said>demanded<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="211"><said who="#Anne">“ I do n't dare go out , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, in the tone of a martyr relinquishing all earthly joys .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ If I can n't stay here there is no use in my loving Green Gables . And if I go out there and get acquainted with all those trees and flowers and the orchard and the brook I 'll not be able to help loving it . It 's hard enough now , so I wo n't make it any harder . I want to go out so much — everything seems to be calling to me , ‘<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, come out to us .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, we want a playmate ’ — but it 's better not . There is no use in loving things if you have to be torn from them , is there ? And it 's so hard to keep from loving things , is n't it ? That was why I was so glad when I thought I was going to live here . I thought I 'd have so many things to love and nothing to hinder me . But that brief dream is over . I am resigned to my fate now , so I do n't think I 'll go out for fear I 'll get unresigned again . What is the name of that geranium on the window-sill , please ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="212"><said who="#Anne">“ That 's the apple-scented geranium . ”</said></p>
    <p n="213"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Oh , I do n't mean that sort of a name . I mean just a name you gave it yourself . Did n't you give it a name ? May I give it one then ? May I call it — let me see —<persName corresp="#Bonny">Bonny</persName>would do — may I call it<persName corresp="#Bonny">Bonny</persName>while I 'm here ? Oh , do let me ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="214"><said who="#Anne">“ Goodness , I do n't care . But where on earth is the sense of naming a geranium ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="215"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Oh , I like things to have handles even if they are only geraniums . It makes them seem more like people . How do you know but that it hurts a geranium 's feelings just to be called a geranium and nothing else ? You would n't like to be called nothing but a woman all the time . Yes , I shall call it<persName corresp="#Bonny">Bonny</persName>. I named that cherry-tree outside my bedroom window this morning . I called it Snow<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>because it was so white . Of course , it wo n't always be in blossom , but one can imagine that it is , can n't one ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="216"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I never in all my life saw or heard anything to equal her , ”</said>muttered<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, beating a retreat down to the cellar after potatoes .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ She is kind of interesting as<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>says . I can feel already that I 'm wondering what on earth she 'll say next . She 'll be casting a spell over me , too . She 's cast it over<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. That look he gave me when he went out said everything he said or hinted last night over again . I wish he was like other men and would talk things out . A body could answer back then and argue him into reason . But what 's to be done with a man who just LOOKS ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="217"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had relapsed into reverie , with her chin in her hands and her eyes on the sky , when<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>returned from her cellar pilgrimage . There<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>left her until the early dinner was on the table .</p>
    <p n="218"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I suppose I can have the mare and buggy this afternoon ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="219"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>nodded and looked wistfully at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>intercepted the look and said grimly :</p>
    <p n="220"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'm going to drive over to White Sands and settle this thing . I 'll take<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>with me and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>will probably make arrangements to send her back to Nova Scotia at once . I 'll set your tea out for you and I 'll be home in time to milk the cows . ”</said></p>
    <p n="221">Still<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>said nothing and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had a sense of having wasted words and breath . There is nothing more aggravating than a man who wo n't talk back — unless it is a woman who wo n't .</p>
    <p n="222"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>hitched the sorrel into the buggy in due time and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>set off .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>opened the yard gate for them and as they drove slowly through , he said , to nobody in particular as it seemed :</p>
    <p n="223"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Little Jerry Buote from the Creek was here this morning , and I told him I guessed I 'd hire him for the summer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="224"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>made no reply , but she hit the unlucky sorrel such a vicious clip with the whip that the fat mare , unused to such treatment , whizzed indignantly down the lane at an alarming pace .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>looked back once as the buggy bounced along and saw that aggravating<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>leaning over the gate , looking wistfully after them .</p>

I am not going to think about going back to the asylum while we 're having our drive . I 'm just going to think about the drive . Oh , look , there 's one little early wild rose out ! Is n't it lovely ? Do n't you think it must be glad to be a rose ? Would n't it be nice if roses could talk ? I 'm sure they could tell us such lovely things . And is n't pink the most bewitching color in the world ? I love it , but I can n't wear it . Redheaded people can n't wear pink , not even in imagination . Did you ever know of anybody whose hair was red when she was young , but got to be another color when she grew up ? ”</said></p>

    <p n="235"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No , I do n't want any of your imaginings . Just you stick to bald facts . Begin at the beginning . Where were you born and how old are you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="236"><said who="#Anne">“ I was eleven last March , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, resigning herself to bald facts with a little sigh .<said who="#Anne">“ And I was born in Bolingbroke , Nova Scotia . My father 's name was Walter<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Shirley</persName>, and he was a teacher in the Bolingbroke High School . My mother 's name was Bertha<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Shirley</persName>. Are n't Walter and Bertha lovely names ? I 'm so glad my parents had nice names . It would be a real disgrace to have a father named — well , say Jedediah , would n't it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="237"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I guess it does n't matter what a person 's name is as long as he behaves himself , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, feeling herself called upon to inculcate a good and useful moral .</p>
    <p n="238"><said who="#Anne">“ Well , I do n't know . ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked thoughtful .<said who="#Anne">“ I read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet , but I 've never been able to believe it . I do n't believe a rose WOULD be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage . I suppose my father could have been a good man even if he had been called Jedediah ; but I 'm sure it would have been a cross . Well , my mother was a teacher in the High school , too , but when she married father she gave up teaching , of course . A husband was enough responsibility .<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>said that they were a pair of babies and as poor as church mice . They went to live in a weeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke . I 've never seen that house , but I 've imagined it thousands of times . I think it must have had honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and lilies of the valley just inside the gate . Yes , and muslin curtains in all the windows . Muslin curtains give a house such an air . I was born in that house .<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw , I was so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes , but that mother thought I was perfectly beautiful . I should think a mother would be a better judge than a poor woman who came in to scrub , would n't you ? I 'm glad she was satisfied with me anyhow , I would feel so sad if I thought I was a disappointment to her — because she did n't live very long after that , you see . She died of fever when I was just three months old . I do wish she 'd lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother . I think it would be so sweet to say ‘ mother , ’ do n't you ? And father died four days afterwards from fever too . That left me an orphan and folks were at their wits ’ end , so<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>said , what to do with me . You see , nobody wanted me even then . It seems to be my fate .<persName>Father</persName>and mother had both come from places far away and it was well known they had n't any relatives living . Finally<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>said she 'd take me , though she was poor and had a drunken husband . She brought me up by hand . Do you know if there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make people who are brought up that way better than other people ? Because whenever I was naughty<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>would ask me how I could be such a bad girl when she had brought me up by hand — reproachful-like .</said></p>
    <p n="239"><said who="#Anne">“ Mr. and<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>moved away from Bolingbroke to Marysville , and I lived with them until I was eight years old . I helped look after the<persName corresp="#Thomas">Thomas</persName>children — there were four of them younger than me — and I can tell you they took a lot of looking after . Then Mr.<persName corresp="#Thomas">Thomas</persName>was killed falling under a train and his mother offered to take<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>and the children , but she did n't want me .<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>was at HER wits ’ end , so she said , what to do with me . Then<persName>Mrs. Hammond</persName>from up the river came down and said she 'd take me , seeing I was handy with children , and I went up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the stumps . It was a very lonesome place . I 'm sure I could never have lived there if I had n't had an imagination . Mr. Hammond worked a little sawmill up there , and<persName>Mrs. Hammond</persName>had eight children . She had twins three times . I like babies in moderation , but twins three times in succession is TOO MUCH . I told<persName>Mrs. Hammond</persName>so firmly , when the last pair came . I used to get so dreadfully tired carrying them about .</said></p>
    <p n="240"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I lived up river with<persName>Mrs. Hammond</persName>over two years , and then Mr. Hammond died and<persName>Mrs. Hammond</persName>broke up housekeeping .

They did n't want me at the asylum , either ; they said they were over-crowded as it was .

    <p n="241"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>finished up with another sigh , of relief this time . Evidently she did not like talking about her experiences in a world that had not wanted her .</p>

When I went up river we were so far from a school that I could n't walk it in winter and there was a vacation in summer , so I could only go in the spring and fall . But of course I went while I was at the asylum . I can read pretty well and I know ever so many pieces of poetry off by heart — ‘ The Battle of Hohenlinden ’ and ‘ Edinburgh after Flodden , ’ and ‘ Bingen of the Rhine , ’ and most of the ‘ Lady of the Lake ’ and most of ‘ The Seasons ’ by James Thompson . Do n't you just love poetry that gives you a crinkly feeling up and down your back ? There is a piece in the Fifth Reader — ‘ The Downfall of Poland ’ — that is just full of thrills . Of course , I was n't in the Fifth Reader — I was only in the Fourth — but the big girls used to lend me theirs to read . ”</said></p>
    <p n="244"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Were those women —<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>and<persName>Mrs. Hammond</persName>— good to you ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, looking at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>out of the corner of her eye .</p>
    <p n="245"><said who="#Anne">“ O-o-o-h , ”</said>faltered<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. Her sensitive little face suddenly flushed scarlet and embarrassment sat on her brow .<said who="#Anne">“ Oh , they MEANT to be — I know they meant to be just as good and kind as possible . And when people mean to be good to you , you do n't mind very much when they 're not quite — always . They had a good deal to worry them , you know . It 's very trying to have a drunken husband , you see ; and it must be very trying to have twins three times in succession , do n't you think ? But I feel sure they meant to be good to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="246"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>asked no more questions .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>gave herself up to a silent rapture over the shore road and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>guided the sorrel abstractedly while she pondered deeply . Pity was suddenly stirring in her heart for the child . What a starved , unloved life she had had — a life of drudgery and poverty and neglect ; for<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was shrewd enough to read between the lines of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s history and divine the truth . No wonder she had been so delighted at the prospect of a real home . It was a pity she had to be sent back . What if she ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, should indulge<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s unaccountable whim and let her stay ? He was set on it ; and the child seemed a nice , teachable little thing .</p>
    <p n="247"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ She 's got too much to say , ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ but she might be trained out of that . And there 's nothing rude or slangy in what she does say . She 's ladylike . It 's likely her people were nice folks . ”</said></p>
    <p n="248">The shore road was “ woodsy and wild and lonesome . ” On the right hand , scrub firs , their spirits quite unbroken by long years of tussle with the gulf winds , grew thickly . On the left were the steep red sandstone cliffs , so near the track in places that a mare of less steadiness than the sorrel might have tried the nerves of the people behind her . Down at the base of the cliffs were heaps of surf-worn rocks or little sandy coves inlaid with pebbles as with ocean jewels ; beyond lay the sea , shimmering and blue , and over it soared the gulls , their pinions flashing silvery in the sunlight .</p>
    <p n="249"><said who="#Anne">“ Is n't the sea wonderful ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, rousing from a long , wide-eyed silence .<said who="#Anne">“ Once , when I lived in Marysville , Mr.<persName corresp="#Thomas">Thomas</persName>hired an express wagon and took us all to spend the day at the shore ten miles away . I enjoyed every moment of that day , even if I had to look after the children all the time . I lived it over in happy dreams for years . But this shore is nicer than the Marysville shore . Are n't those gulls splendid ? Would you like to be a gull ? I think I would — that is , if I could n't be a human girl . Do n't you think it would be nice to wake up at sunrise and swoop down over the water and away out over that lovely blue all day ; and then at night to fly back to one 's nest ? Oh , I can just imagine myself doing it . What big house is that just ahead , please ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="250"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ That 's the White Sands Hotel . Mr. Kirke runs it , but the season has n't begun yet . There are heaps of Americans come there for the summer . They think this shore is just about right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="251"><said who="#Anne">“ I was afraid it might be<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>'s place , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>mournfully .<said who="#Anne">“ I do n't want to get there . Somehow , it will seem like the end of everything . ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="6">
    <p n="252">Get there they did , however , in due season .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>lived in a big yellow house at White Sands Cove , and she came to the door with surprise and welcome mingled on her benevolent face .</p>
    <p n="253"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ Dear , dear , ”</said>she exclaimed ,<said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ you 're the last folks I was looking for today , but I 'm real glad to see you . You 'll put your horse in ? And how are you ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="254"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm as well as can be expected , thank you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>smilelessly . A blight seemed to have descended on her .</p>
    <p n="255"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I suppose we 'll stay a little while to rest the mare , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ but I promised<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>I 'd be home early . The fact is ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>, there 's been a queer mistake somewhere , and I 've come over to see where it is . We send word ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and I , for you to bring us a boy from the asylum . We told your brother Robert to tell you we wanted a boy ten or eleven years old . ”</said></p>
    <p n="256"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>, you do n't say so ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>in distress .<said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ Why , Robert sent word down by his daughter Nancy and she said you wanted a girl — did n't she Flora<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>? ”</said>appealing to her daughter who had come out to the steps .</p>
    <p n="257"><said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ She certainly did ,<persName>Miss Cuthbert</persName>, ”</said>corroborated Flora<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>earnestly .</p>
    <p n="258"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ I 'm dreadful sorry , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ It 's too bad ; but it certainly was n't my fault , you see ,<persName>Miss Cuthbert</persName>. I did the best I could and I thought I was following your instructions . Nancy is a terrible flighty thing . I 've often had to scold her well for her heedlessness . ”</said></p>
    <p n="259"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It was our own fault , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>resignedly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ We should have come to you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along by word of mouth in that fashion . Anyhow , the mistake has been made and the only thing to do is to set it right . Can we send the child back to the asylum ? I suppose they 'll take her back , wo n't they ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="260"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ I suppose so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>thoughtfully ,<said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ but I do n't think it will be necessary to send her back . Mrs. Peter Blewett was up here yesterday , and she was saying to me how much she wished she 'd sent by me for a little girl to help her . Mrs. Peter has a large family , you know , and she finds it hard to get help .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>will be the very girl for you . I call it positively providential . ”</said></p>
    <p n="261"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>did not look as if she thought Providence had much to do with the matter . Here was an unexpectedly good chance to get this unwelcome orphan off her hands , and she did not even feel grateful for it .</p>
    <p n="262">She knew Mrs. Peter Blewett only by sight as a small , shrewish-faced woman without an ounce of superfluous flesh on her bones . But she had heard of her .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ A terrible worker and driver , ”</said>Mrs. Peter was said to be ; and discharged servant girls told fearsome tales of her temper and stinginess , and her family of pert , quarrelsome children .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>felt a qualm of conscience at the thought of handing<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>over to her tender mercies .</p>
    <p n="263"><said who="#Anne">“ Well , I 'll go in and we 'll talk the matter over , ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="264"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ And if there is n't Mrs. Peter coming up the lane this blessed minute ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>, bustling her guests through the hall into the parlor , where a deadly chill struck on them as if the air had been strained so long through dark green , closely drawn blinds that it had lost every particle of warmth it had ever possessed .<said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ That is real lucky , for we can settle the matter right away . Take the armchair ,<persName>Miss Cuthbert</persName>.<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, you sit here on the ottoman and do n't wiggle . Let me take your hats . Flora<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>, go out and put the kettle on . Good afternoon ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Blewett">Mrs. Blewett</persName>. We were just saying how fortunate it was you happened along . Let me introduce you two ladies .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Blewett">Mrs. Blewett</persName>,<persName>Miss Cuthbert</persName>. Please excuse me for just a moment . I forgot to tell Flora<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>to take the buns out of the oven . ”</said></p>
    <p n="265"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>whisked away , after pulling up the blinds .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sitting mutely on the ottoman , with her hands clasped tightly in her lap , stared at Mrs Blewett as one fascinated . Was she to be given into the keeping of this sharp-faced , sharp-eyed woman ? She felt a lump coming up in her throat and her eyes smarted painfully . She was beginning to be afraid she could n't keep the tears back when<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>returned , flushed and beaming , quite capable of taking any and every difficulty , physical , mental or spiritual , into consideration and settling it out of hand .</p>
    <p n="266"><said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ It seems there 's been a mistake about this little girl ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Blewett">Mrs. Blewett</persName>, ”</said>she said .<said who="#Mrs._Spencer">“ I was under the impression that Mr. and<persName>Miss Cuthbert</persName>wanted a little girl to adopt . I was certainly told so . But it seems it was a boy they wanted . So if you 're still of the same mind you were yesterday , I think she 'll be just the thing for you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="267"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Blewett">Mrs. Blewett</persName>darted her eyes over<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>from head to foot .</p>
    <p n="268"><said who="#Anne">“ How old are you and what 's your name ? ”</said>she demanded .</p>
    <p n="269"><said who="#Mrs._Blewett">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, ”</said>faltered the shrinking child , not daring to make any stipulations regarding the spelling thereof ,<said who="#Mrs._Blewett">“ and I 'm eleven years old . ”</said></p>
    <p n="270"><said who="#Anne_Shirley">“ Humph ! You do n't look as if there was much to you . But you 're wiry . I do n't know but the wiry ones are the best after all . Well , if I take you you 'll have to be a good girl , you know — good and smart and respectful . I 'll expect you to earn your keep , and no mistake about that . Yes , I suppose I might as well take her off your hands ,<persName>Miss Cuthbert</persName>. The baby 's awful fractious , and I 'm clean worn out attending to him . If you like I can take her right home now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="271"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>looked at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and softened at sight of the child 's pale face with its look of mute misery — the misery of a helpless little creature who finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>felt an uncomfortable conviction that , if she denied the appeal of that look , it would haunt her to her dying day . More-over , she did not fancy<persName corresp="#Mrs._Blewett">Mrs. Blewett</persName>. To hand a sensitive , “ highstrung ” child over to such a woman ! No , she could not take the responsibility of doing that !</p>
    <p n="272"><said who="#Mrs._Blewett">“ Well , I do n't know , ”</said>she said slowly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I did n't say that<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and I had absolutely decided that we would n't keep her . In fact I may say that<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>is disposed to keep her . I just came over to find out how the mistake had occurred . I think I 'd better take her home again and talk it over with<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. I feel that I ought n't to decide on anything without consulting him . If we make up our mind not to keep her we 'll bring or send her over to you tomorrow night . If we do n't you may know that she is going to stay with us . Will that suit you ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Blewett">Mrs. Blewett</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="273"><said who="#Mrs._Blewett">“ I suppose it 'll have to , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Blewett">Mrs. Blewett</persName>ungraciously .</p>
    <p n="274">During<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s speech a sunrise had been dawning on<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s face . First the look of despair faded out ; then came a faint flush of hope ; here eyes grew deep and bright as morning stars . The child was quite transfigured ; and , a moment later , when<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Blewett">Mrs. Blewett</persName>went out in quest of a recipe the latter had come to borrow she sprang up and flew across the room to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="275"><said who="#Mrs._Blewett">“ Oh ,<persName>Miss Cuthbert</persName>, did you really say that perhaps you would let me stay at Green Gables ? ”</said>she said , in a breathless whisper , as if speaking aloud might shatter the glorious possibility .<said who="#Mrs._Blewett">“ Did you really say it ? Or did I only imagine that you did ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="276"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I think you 'd better learn to control that imagination of yours ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, if you can n't distinguish between what is real and what is n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>crossly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Yes , you did hear me say just that and no more . It is n't decided yet and perhaps we will conclude to let<persName corresp="#Mrs._Blewett">Mrs. Blewett</persName>take you after all . She certainly needs you much more than I do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="277"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'd rather go back to the asylum than go to live with her , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>passionately .<said who="#Anne">“ She looks exactly like a — like a gimlet . ”</said></p>
    <p n="278"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>smothered a smile under the conviction that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>must be reproved for such a speech .</p>
    <p n="279"><said who="#Anne">“ A little girl like you should be ashamed of talking so about a lady and a stranger , ”</said>she said severely .<said who="#Anne">“ Go back and sit down quietly and hold your tongue and behave as a good girl should . ”</said></p>
    <p n="280"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'll try to do and be anything you want me , if you 'll only keep me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, returning meekly to her ottoman .</p>
    <p n="281">When they arrived back at Green Gables that evening<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>met them in the lane .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>from afar had noted him prowling along it and guessed his motive . She was prepared for the relief she read in his face when he saw that she had at least brought back<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>back with her . But she said nothing , to him , relative to the affair , until they were both out in the yard behind the barn milking the cows . Then she briefly told him<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s history and the result of the interview with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>.</p>
    <p n="282"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I would n't give a dog I liked to that Blewett woman , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>with unusual vim .</p>
    <p n="283"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't fancy her style myself , ”</said>admitted<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ but it 's that or keeping her ourselves ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. And since you seem to want her , I suppose I 'm willing — or have to be . I 've been thinking over the idea until I 've got kind of used to it . It seems a sort of duty . I 've never brought up a child , especially a girl , and I dare say I 'll make a terrible mess of it . But I 'll do my best . So far as I 'm concerned ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, she may stay . ”</said></p>
    <p n="284"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s shy face was a glow of delight .</p>
    <p n="285"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I reckoned you 'd come to see it in that light ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>he said .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ She 's such an interesting little thing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="286"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It 'd be more to the point if you could say she was a useful little thing , ”</said>retorted<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ but I 'll make it my business to see she 's trained to be that . And mind ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, you 're not to go interfering with my methods . Perhaps an old maid does n't know much about bringing up a child , but I guess she knows more than an old bachelor . So you just leave me to manage her . When I fail it 'll be time enough to put your oar in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="287"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ There , there ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, you can have your own way , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>reassuringly .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Only be as good and kind to her as you can without spoiling her .

    <p n="288"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sniffed , to express her contempt for<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s opinions concerning anything feminine , and walked off to the dairy with the pails .</p>
    <p n="289"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I wo n't tell her tonight that she can stay , ”</said>she reflected , as she strained the milk into the creamers .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ She 'd be so excited that she would n't sleep a wink .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>, you 're fairly in for it . Did you ever suppose you 'd see the day when you 'd be adopting an orphan girl ? It 's surprising enough ; but not so surprising as that<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>should be at the bottom of it , him that always seemed to have such a mortal dread of little girls .

She had intended to teach<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>the childish classic ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Now I lay me down to sleep . ”</said>But she had , as I have told you , the glimmerings of a sense of humor — which is simply another name for a sense of fitness of things ; and it suddenly occurred to her that that simple little prayer , sacred to white-robed childhood lisping at motherly knees , was entirely unsuited to this freckled witch of a girl who knew and cared nothing bout God 's love , since she had never had it translated to her through the medium of human love .</p>
    <p n="309"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You 're old enough to pray for yourself ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>she said finally .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Just thank God for your blessings and ask Him humbly for the things you want . ”</said></p>
    <p n="310"><said who="#Anne">“ Well , I 'll do my best , ”</said>promised<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, burying her face in<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s lap .<said who="#Anne">“ Gracious heavenly<persName>Father</persName>— that 's the way the ministers say it in church , so I suppose it 's all right in private prayer , is n't it ? ”</said>she interjected , lifting her head for a moment .</p>
    <p n="311">“ Gracious heavenly<persName>Father</persName>, I thank Thee for the White Way of Delight and the Lake of Shining Waters and<persName corresp="#Bonny">Bonny</persName>and the Snow<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>. I 'm really extremely grateful for them . And that 's all the blessings I can think of just now to thank Thee for . As for the things I want , they 're so numerous that it would take a great deal of time to name them all so I will only mention the two most important . Please let me stay at Green Gables ; and please let me be good-looking when I grow up . I remain ,<said who="#Queen">“ Yours respectfully ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>.</said></p>
    <p n="312"><said who="#Anne_Shirley">“ There , did I do all right ? ”</said>she asked eagerly , getting up .<said who="#Anne_Shirley">“ I could have made it much more flowery if I 'd had a little more time to think it over . ”</said></p>
    <p n="313">Poor<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was only preserved from complete collapse by remembering that it was not irreverence , but simply spiritual ignorance on the part of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>that was responsible for this extraordinary petition . She tucked the child up in bed , mentally vowing that she should be taught a prayer the very next day , and was leaving the room with the light when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>called her back .</p>
    <p n="314"><said who="#Anne">“ I 've just thought of it now . I should have said , ‘ Amen ’ in place of ‘ yours respectfully , ’ should n't I ?— the way the ministers do . I 'd forgotten it , but I felt a prayer should be finished off in some way , so I put in the other . Do you suppose it will make any difference ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="315"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I — I do n't suppose it will , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Go to sleep now like a good child . Good night . ”</said></p>
    <p n="316"><said who="#Anne">“ I can only say good night tonight with a clear conscience , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, cuddling luxuriously down among her pillows .</p>
    <p n="317"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>retreated to the kitchen , set the candle firmly on the table , and glared at<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.</p>
    <p n="318"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>, it 's about time somebody adopted that child and taught her something . She 's next door to a perfect heathen . Will you believe that she never said a prayer in her life till tonight ? I 'll send her to the manse tomorrow and borrow the Peep of the Day series , that 's what I 'll do . And she shall go to Sunday-school just as soon as I can get some suitable clothes made for her . I foresee that I shall have my hands full . Well , well , we can n't get through this world without our share of trouble . I 've had a pretty easy life of it so far , but my time has come at last and I suppose I 'll just have to make the best of it . ”</said></p>

    <p n="319">For reasons best known to herself ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>did not tell<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>that she was to stay at Green Gables until the next afternoon . During the forenoon she kept the child busy with various tasks and watched over her with a keen eye while she did them . By noon she had concluded that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was smart and obedient , willing to work and quick to learn ; her most serious shortcoming seemed to be a tendency to fall into daydreams in the middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as she was sharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe .</p>
    <p n="320">When<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had finished washing the dinner dishes she suddenly confronted<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>with the air and expression of one desperately determined to learn the worst . Her thin little body trembled from head to foot ; her face flushed and her eyes dilated until they were almost black ; she clasped her hands tightly and said in an imploring voice :</p>
    <p n="321"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Oh , please ,<persName>Miss Cuthbert</persName>, wo n't you tell me if you are going to send me away or not ?

    <p n="322"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You have n't scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you to do , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>immovably .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Just go and do it before you ask any more questions ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="323"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>went and attended to the dishcloth . Then she returned to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and fastened imploring eyes of the latter 's face .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, unable to find any excuse for deferring her explanation longer ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I suppose I might as well tell you .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and I have decided to keep you — that is , if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself grateful . Why , child , whatever is the matter ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="324"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm crying , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>in a tone of bewilderment .<said who="#Anne">“ I can n't think why . I 'm glad as glad can be . Oh , GLAD does n't seem the right word at all . I was glad about the White Way and the cherry blossoms — but this ! Oh , it 's something more than glad . I 'm so happy . I 'll try to be so good . It will be uphill work , I expect , for<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>often told me I was desperately wicked . However , I 'll do my very best . But can you tell me why I 'm crying ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="325"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I suppose it 's because you 're all excited and worked up , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>disapprovingly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself . I 'm afraid you both cry and laugh far too easily . Yes , you can stay here and we will try to do right by you . You must go to school ; but it 's only a fortnight till vacation so it is n't worth while for you to start before it opens again in September . ”</said></p>
    <p n="326"><said who="#Anne">“ What am I to call you ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Shall I always say<persName>Miss Cuthbert</persName>? Can I call you Aunt<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="327"><said who="#Anne">“ No ; you 'll call me just plain<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I 'm not used to being called<persName>Miss Cuthbert</persName>and it would make me nervous . ”</said></p>
    <p n="328"><said who="#Anne">“ It sounds awfully disrespectful to just say<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>protested<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="329"><said who="#Anne">“ I guess there 'll be nothing disrespectful in it if you 're careful to speak respectfully . Everybody , young and old , in Avonlea calls me<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>except the minister .

    <p n="330"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'd love to call you Aunt<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>wistfully .<said who="#Anne">“ I 've never had an aunt or any relation at all — not even a grandmother .

    <p n="331"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No . I 'm not your aunt and I do n't believe in calling people names that do n't belong to them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="332"><said who="#Anne">“ But we could imagine you were my aunt . ”</said></p>
    <p n="333"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I could n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>grimly .</p>
    <p n="334"><said who="#Anne">“ Do you never imagine things different from what they really are ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>wide-eyed .</p>
    <p n="335"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="336"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>drew a long breath .<said who="#Anne">“ Oh , Miss —<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, how much you miss ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="337"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't believe in imagining things different from what they really are , ”</said>retorted<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ When the Lord puts us in certain circumstances He does n't mean for us to imagine them away . And that reminds me . Go into the sitting room ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>— be sure your feet are clean and do n't let any flies in — and bring me out the illustrated card that 's on the mantelpiece . The Lord 's Prayer is on it and you 'll devote your spare time this afternoon to learning it off by heart . There 's to be no more of such praying as I heard last night . ”</said></p>
    <p n="338"><said who="#Anne">“ I suppose I was very awkward , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>apologetically ,<said who="#Anne">“ but then , you see , I 'd never had any practice . You could n't really expect a person to pray very well the first time she tried , could you ? I thought out a splendid prayer after I went to bed , just as I promised you I would . It was nearly as long as a minister 's and so poetical . But would you believe it ? I could n't remember one word when I woke up this morning . And I 'm afraid I 'll never be able to think out another one as good . Somehow , things never are so good when they 're thought out a second time . Have you ever noticed that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="339"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Here is something for you to notice ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. When I tell you to do a thing I want you to obey me at once and not stand stock-still and discourse about it . Just you go and do as I bid you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="340"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>promptly departed for the sitting-room across the hall ; she failed to return ; after waiting ten minutes<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>laid down her knitting and marched after her with a grim expression . She found<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>standing motionless before a picture hanging on the wall between the two windows , with her eyes astar with dreams . The white and green light strained through apple trees and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt little figure with a half-unearthly radiance .</p>
    <p n="341"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, whatever are you thinking of ? ”</said>demanded<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sharply .</p>
    <p n="342"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>came back to earth with a start .</p>
    <p n="343"><said who="#Anne">“ That , ”</said>she said , pointing to the picture — a rather vivid chromo entitled , “ Christ Blessing Little Children ” —<said who="#Anne">“ and I was just imagining I was one of them — that I was the little girl in the blue dress , standing off by herself in the corner as if she did n't belong to anybody , like me . She looks lonely and sad , do n't you think ? I guess she had n't any father or mother of her own . But she wanted to be blessed , too , so she just crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd , hoping nobody would notice her — except Him . I 'm sure I know just how she felt . Her heart must have beat and her hands must have got cold , like mine did when I asked you if I could stay . She was afraid He might n't notice her . But it 's likely He did , do n't you think ? I 've been trying to imagine it all out — her edging a little nearer all the time until she was quite close to Him ; and then He would look at her and put His hand on her hair and oh , such a thrill of joy as would run over her ! But I wish the artist had n't painted Him so sorrowful looking . All His pictures are like that , if you 've noticed . But I do n't believe He could really have looked so sad or the children would have been afraid of Him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="344"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, wondering why she had not broken into this speech long before ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ you should n't talk that way . It 's irreverent — positively irreverent . ”</said></p>
    <p n="345"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s eyes marveled .</p>
    <p n="346"><said who="#Anne">“ Why , I felt just as reverent as could be . I 'm sure I did n't mean to be irreverent . ”</said></p>
    <p n="347"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well I do n't suppose you did — but it does n't sound right to talk so familiarly about such things . And another thing ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, when I send you after something you 're to bring it at once and not fall into mooning and imagining before pictures . Remember that . Take that card and come right to the kitchen . Now , sit down in the corner and learn that prayer off by heart . ”</said></p>
    <p n="348"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>set the card up against the jugful of apple blossoms she had brought in to decorate the dinner-table —<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had eyed that decoration askance , but had said nothing — propped her chin on her hands , and fell to studying it intently for several silent minutes .</p>
    <p n="349"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I like this , ”</said>she announced at length .<said who="#Anne">“ It 's beautiful . I 've heard it before — I heard the superintendent of the asylum Sunday school say it over once . But I did n't like it then . He had such a cracked voice and he prayed it so mournfully . I really felt sure he thought praying was a disagreeable duty . This is n't poetry , but it makes me feel just the same way poetry does . ‘ Our<persName>Father</persName>who art in heaven hallowed be Thy name . ’ That is just like a line of music . Oh , I 'm so glad you thought of making me learn this , Miss —<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="350"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , learn it and hold your tongue , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>shortly .</p>
    <p n="351"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>tipped the vase of apple blossoms near enough to bestow a soft kiss on a pink-cupped bud , and then studied diligently for some moments longer .</p>
    <p n="352"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>she demanded presently ,<said who="#Anne">“ do you think that I shall ever have a bosom friend in Avonlea ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="353"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ A — a what kind of friend ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="354"><said who="#Anne">“ A bosom friend — an intimate friend , you know — a really kindred spirit to whom I can confide my inmost soul . I 've dreamed of meeting her all my life . I never really supposed I would , but so many of my loveliest dreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will , too . Do you think it 's possible ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="355"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana Barry</persName>lives over at Orchard Slope and she 's about your age . She 's a very nice little girl , and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when she comes home . She 's visiting her aunt over at Carmody just now . You 'll have to be careful how you behave yourself , though .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>is a very particular woman . She wo n't let<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>play with any little girl who is n't nice and good . ”</said></p>
    <p n="356"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked at<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>through the apple blossoms , her eyes aglow with interest .</p>
    <p n="357"><said who="#Anne">“ What is<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>like ? Her hair is n't red , is it ? Oh , I hope not . It 's bad enough to have red hair myself , but I positively could n't endure it in a bosom friend . ”</said></p>
    <p n="358"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>is a very pretty little girl . She has black eyes and hair and rosy cheeks . And she is good and smart , which is better than being pretty . ”</said></p>
    <p n="359"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was as fond of morals as the Duchess in Wonderland , and was firmly convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a child who was being brought up .</p>
    <p n="360">But<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the delightful possibilities before it .</p>
    <p n="361"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I 'm so glad she 's pretty . Next to being beautiful oneself — and that 's impossible in my case — it would be best to have a beautiful bosom friend . When I lived with<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>she had a bookcase in her sitting room with glass doors . There were n't any books in it ;<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>kept her best china and her preserves there — when she had any preserves to keep . One of the doors was broken . Mr.<persName corresp="#Thomas">Thomas</persName>smashed it one night when he was slightly intoxicated . But the other was whole and I used to pretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in it . I called her<persName>Katie Maurice</persName>, and we were very intimate . I used to talk to her by the hour , especially on Sunday , and tell her everything . Katie was the comfort and consolation of my life . We used to pretend that the bookcase was enchanted and that if I only knew the spell I could open the door and step right into the room where<persName>Katie Maurice</persName>lived , instead of into<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>’ shelves of preserves and china . And then<persName>Katie Maurice</persName>would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a wonderful place , all flowers and sunshine and fairies , and we would have lived there happy for ever after . When I went to live with<persName>Mrs. Hammond</persName>it just broke my heart to leave<persName>Katie Maurice</persName>. She felt it dreadfully , too , I know she did , for she was crying when she kissed me good-bye through the bookcase door . There was no bookcase at<persName>Mrs. Hammond</persName>'s . But just up the river a little way from the house there was a long green little valley , and the loveliest echo lived there . It echoed back every word you said , even if you did n't talk a bit loud . So I imagined that it was a little girl called<persName>Violetta</persName>and we were great friends and I loved her almost as well as I loved<persName>Katie Maurice</persName>— not quite , but almost , you know . The night before I went to the asylum I said good-bye to<persName>Violetta</persName>, and oh , her good-bye came back to me in such sad , sad tones . I had become so attached to her that I had n't the heart to imagine a bosom friend at the asylum , even if there had been any scope for imagination there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="362"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I think it 's just as well there was n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>drily .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't approve of such goings-on . You seem to half believe your own imaginations . It will be well for you to have a real live friend to put such nonsense out of your head . But do n't let<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>hear you talking about your Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she 'll think you tell stories . ”</said></p>
    <p n="363"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I wo n't . I could n't talk of them to everybody — their memories are too sacred for that . But I thought I 'd like to have you know about them . Oh , look , here 's a big bee just tumbled out of an apple blossom . Just think what a lovely place to live — in an apple blossom ! Fancy going to sleep in it when the wind was rocking it . If I was n't a human girl I think I 'd like to be a bee and live among the flowers . ”</said></p>
    <p n="364"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Yesterday you wanted to be a sea gull , ”</said>sniffed<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I think you are very fickle minded . I told you to learn that prayer and not talk . But it seems impossible for you to stop talking if you 've got anybody that will listen to you . So go up to your room and learn it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="365"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I know it pretty nearly all now — all but just the last line . ”</said></p>
    <p n="366"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , never mind , do as I tell you . Go to your room and finish learning it well , and stay there until I call you down to help me get tea . ”</said></p>
    <p n="367"><said who="#Anne">“ Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company ? ”</said>pleaded<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="368"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No ; you do n't want your room cluttered up with flowers . You should have left them on the tree in the first place . ”</said></p>
    <p n="369"><said who="#Anne">“ I did feel a little that way , too , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I kind of felt I should n't shorten their lovely lives by picking them — I would n't want to be picked if I were an apple blossom . But the temptation was IRRESISTIBLE . What do you do when you meet with an irresistible temptation ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="370"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, did you hear me tell you to go to your room ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="371"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sighed , retreated to the east gable , and sat down in a chair by the window .</p>
    <p n="372"><said who="#Anne">“ There — I know this prayer . I learned that last sentence coming upstairs . Now I 'm going to imagine things into this room so that they 'll always stay imagined . The floor is covered with a white velvet carpet with pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the windows . The walls are hung with gold and silver brocade tapestry . The furniture is mahogany . I never saw any mahogany , but it does sound SO luxurious . This is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions , pink and blue and crimson and gold , and I am reclining gracefully on it . I can see my reflection in that splendid big mirror hanging on the wall . I am tall and regal , clad in a gown of trailing white lace , with a pearl cross on my breast and pearls in my hair . My hair is of midnight darkness and my skin is a clear ivory pallor . My name is the Lady<persName>Cordelia</persName>Fitzgerald . No , it is n't — I can n't make THAT seem real . ”</said></p>
    <p n="373">She danced up to the little looking-glass and peered into it . Her pointed freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her .</p>
    <p n="374"><said who="#Anne">“ You 're only<persName>Anne of Green Gables</persName>, ”</said>she said earnestly ,<said>“ and I see you , just as you are looking now , whenever I try to imagine I 'm the Lady<persName>Cordelia</persName>. But it 's a million times nicer to be<persName>Anne of Green Gables</persName>than<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>of nowhere in particular , is n't it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="375">She bent forward , kissed her reflection affectionately , and betook herself to the open window .</p>
    <p n="376"><said who="#Anne">“ Dear Snow<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>, good afternoon . And good afternoon dear birches down in the hollow . And good afternoon , dear gray house up on the hill . I wonder if<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>is to be my bosom friend . I hope she will , and I shall love her very much . But I must never quite forget<persName>Katie Maurice</persName>and<persName>Violetta</persName>. They would feel so hurt if I did and I 'd hate to hurt anybody 's feelings , even a little bookcase girl 's or a little echo girl 's . I must be careful to remember them and send them a kiss every day . ”</said></p>
    <p n="377"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>blew a couple of airy kisses from her fingertips past the cherry blossoms and then , with her chin in her hands , drifted luxuriously out on a sea of daydreams .</p>

As soon as her doctor allowed her to put her foot out-of-doors she hurried up to Green Gables , bursting with curiosity to see<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s orphan , concerning whom all sorts of stories and suppositions had gone abroad in Avonlea .</p>
    <p n="379"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had made good use of every waking moment of that fortnight . Already she was acquainted with every tree and shrub about the place . She had discovered that a lane opened out below the apple orchard and ran up through a belt of woodland ; and she had explored it to its furthest end in all its delicious vagaries of brook and bridge , fir coppice and wild cherry arch , corners thick with fern , and branching byways of maple and mountain ash .</p>
    <p n="380">She had made friends with the spring down in the hollow — that wonderful deep , clear icy-cold spring ; it was set about with smooth red sandstones and rimmed in by great palm-like clumps of water fern ; and beyond it was a log bridge over the brook .</p>
    <p n="381">That bridge led<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s dancing feet up over a wooded hill beyond , where perpetual twilight reigned under the straight , thick-growing firs and spruces ; the only flowers there were myriads of delicate “ June bells , ” those shyest and sweetest of woodland blooms , and a few pale , aerial starflowers , like the spirits of last year 's blossoms . Gossamers glimmered like threads of silver among the trees and the fir boughs and tassels seemed to utter friendly speech .</p>
    <p n="382">All these raptured voyages of exploration were made in the odd half hours which she was allowed for play , and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>talked<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>half-deaf over her discoveries . Not that<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>complained , to be sure ; he listened to it all with a wordless smile of enjoyment on his face ;<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>permitted the “ chatter ” until she found herself becoming too interested in it , whereupon she always promptly quenched<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>by a curt command to hold her tongue .</p>
    <p n="383"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was out in the orchard when<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>came , wandering at her own sweet will through the lush , tremulous grasses splashed with ruddy evening sunshine ; so that good lady had an excellent chance to talk her illness fully over , describing every ache and pulse beat with such evident enjoyment that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>thought even grippe must bring its compensations . When details were exhausted<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>introduced the real reason of her call .</p>
    <p n="384"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I 've been hearing some surprising things about you and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="385"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't suppose you are any more surprised than I am myself , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'm getting over my surprise now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="386"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ It was too bad there was such a mistake , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>sympathetically .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Could n't you have sent her back ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="387"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I suppose we could , but we decided not to .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>took a fancy to her . And I must say I like her myself — although I admit she has her faults . The house seems a different place already . She 's a real bright little thing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="388"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>said more than she had intended to say when she began , for she read disapproval in<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>'s expression .</p>
    <p n="389"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ It 's a great responsibility you 've taken on yourself , ”</said>said that lady gloomily ,<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ especially when you 've never had any experience with children . You do n't know much about her or her real disposition , I suppose , and there 's no guessing how a child like that will turn out . But I do n't want to discourage you I 'm sure ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="390"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'm not feeling discouraged , ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s dry response ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ when I make up my mind to do a thing it stays made up . I suppose you 'd like to see<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. I 'll call her in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="391"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>came running in presently , her face sparkling with the delight of her orchard rovings ; but , abashed at finding the delight herself in the unexpected presence of a stranger , she halted confusedly inside the door . She certainly was an odd-looking little creature in the short tight wincey dress she had worn from the asylum , below which her thin legs seemed ungracefully long . Her freckles were more numerous and obtrusive than ever ; the wind had ruffled her hatless hair into over-brilliant disorder ; it had never looked redder than at that moment .</p>
    <p n="392"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Well , they did n't pick you for your looks , that 's sure and certain , ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel Lynde</persName>'s emphatic comment .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>was one of those delightful and popular people who pride themselves on speaking their mind without fear or favor .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ She 's terrible skinny and homely ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. Come here , child , and let me have a look at you . Lawful heart , did any one ever see such freckles ? And hair as red as carrots ! Come here , child , I say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="393"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>“ came there , ” but not exactly as<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>expected . With one bound she crossed the kitchen floor and stood before<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>, her face scarlet with anger , her lips quivering , and her whole slender form trembling from head to foot .</p>
    <p n="394"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I hate you , ”</said>she cried in a choked voice , stamping her foot on the floor .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I hate you — I hate you — I hate you — ”</said>a louder stamp with each assertion of hatred .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ How dare you call me skinny and ugly ? How dare you say I 'm freckled and redheaded ? You are a rude , impolite , unfeeling woman ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="395"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>in consternation .</p>
    <p n="396">But<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>continued to face<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>undauntedly , head up , eyes blazing , hands clenched , passionate indignation exhaling from her like an atmosphere .</p>
    <p n="397"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ How dare you say such things about me ? ”</said>she repeated vehemently .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ How would you like to have such things said about you ? How would you like to be told that you are fat and clumsy and probably had n't a spark of imagination in you ? I do n't care if I do hurt your feelings by saying so ! I hope I hurt them . You have hurt mine worse than they were ever hurt before even by<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>’ intoxicated husband . And I 'll NEVER forgive you for it , never , never ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="398">Stamp ! Stamp !</p>
    <p n="399"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Did anybody ever see such a temper ! ”</said>exclaimed the horrified<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>.</p>
    <p n="400"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>go to your room and stay there until I come up , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, recovering her powers of speech with difficulty .</p>
    <p n="401"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, bursting into tears , rushed to the hall door , slammed it until the tins on the porch wall outside rattled in sympathy , and fled through the hall and up the stairs like a whirlwind . A subdued slam above told that the door of the east gable had been shut with equal vehemence .</p>
    <p n="402"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Well , I do n't envy you your job bringing THAT up ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>with unspeakable solemnity .</p>
    <p n="403"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>opened her lips to say she knew not what of apology or deprecation . What she did say was a surprise to herself then and ever afterwards .</p>
    <p n="404"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You should n't have twitted her about her looks ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="405"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>, you do n't mean to say that you are upholding her in such a terrible display of temper as we 've just seen ? ”</said>demanded<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>indignantly .</p>
    <p n="406"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>slowly ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'm not trying to excuse her . She 's been very naughty and I 'll have to give her a talking to about it . But we must make allowances for her . She 's never been taught what is right . And you WERE too hard on her ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="407"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>could not help tacking on that last sentence , although she was again surprised at herself for doing it .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>got up with an air of offended dignity .</p>
    <p n="408"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Well , I see that I 'll have to be very careful what I say after this ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, since the fine feelings of orphans , brought from goodness knows where , have to be considered before anything else . Oh , no , I 'm not vexed — do n't worry yourself . I 'm too sorry for you to leave any room for anger in my mind . You 'll have your own troubles with that child . But if you 'll take my advice — which I suppose you wo n't do , although I 've brought up ten children and buried two — you 'll do that ‘ talking to ’ you mention with a fair-sized birch switch . I should think THAT would be the most effective language for that kind of a child . Her temper matches her hair I guess . Well , good evening ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I hope you 'll come down to see me often as usual . But you can n't expect me to visit here again in a hurry , if I 'm liable to be flown at and insulted in such a fashion . It 's something new in MY experience . ”</said></p>
    <p n="409">Whereat<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>swept out and away — if a fat woman who always waddled COULD be said to sweep away — and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>with a very solemn face betook herself to the east gable .</p>
    <p n="410">On the way upstairs she pondered uneasily as to what she ought to do . She felt no little dismay over the scene that had just been enacted . How unfortunate that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>should have displayed such temper before<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel Lynde</persName>, of all people ! Then<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>suddenly became aware of an uncomfortable and rebuking consciousness that she felt more humiliation over this than sorrow over the discovery of such a serious defect in<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s disposition . And how was she to punish her ? The amiable suggestion of the birch switch — to the efficiency of which all of<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>'s own children could have borne smarting testimony — did not appeal to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. She did not believe she could whip a child . No , some other method of punishment must be found to bring<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>to a proper realization of the enormity of her offense .</p>
    <p n="411"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>found<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>face downward on her bed , crying bitterly , quite oblivious of muddy boots on a clean counterpane .</p>
    <p n="412"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>she said not ungently .</p>
    <p n="413">No answer .</p>
    <p n="414"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>with greater severity ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ get off that bed this minute and listen to what I have to say to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="415"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>squirmed off the bed and sat rigidly on a chair beside it , her face swollen and tear-stained and her eyes fixed stubbornly on the floor .</p>
    <p n="416"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ This is a nice way for you to behave .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>! Are n't you ashamed of yourself ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="417"><said who="#Anne">“ She had n't any right to call me ugly and redheaded , ”</said>retorted<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, evasive and defiant .</p>
    <p n="418"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You had n't any right to fly into such a fury and talk the way you did to her ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. I was ashamed of you — thoroughly ashamed of you . I wanted you to behave nicely to<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>, and instead of that you have disgraced me . I 'm sure I do n't know why you should lose your temper like that just because<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>said you were red-haired and homely . You say it yourself often enough . ”</said></p>
    <p n="419"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , but there 's such a difference between saying a thing yourself and hearing other people say it , ”</said>wailed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ You may know a thing is so , but you can n't help hoping other people do n't quite think it is . I suppose you think I have an awful temper , but I could n't help it . When she said those things something just rose right up in me and choked me . I HAD to fly out at her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="420"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , you made a fine exhibition of yourself I must say .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>will have a nice story to tell about you everywhere — and she 'll tell it , too . It was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="421"><said who="#Anne">“ Just imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that you were skinny and ugly , ”</said>pleaded<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>tearfully .</p>
    <p n="422">An old remembrance suddenly rose up before<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. She had been a very small child when she had heard one aunt say of her to another ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ What a pity she is such a dark , homely little thing . ”</said><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was every day of fifty before the sting had gone out of that memory .</p>
    <p n="423"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't say that I think<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>was exactly right in saying what she did to you ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>she admitted in a softer tone .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>is too outspoken . But that is no excuse for such behavior on your part . She was a stranger and an elderly person and my visitor — all three very good reasons why you should have been respectful to her . You were rude and saucy and ”</said>—<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had a saving inspiration of punishment —<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ you must go to her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her to forgive you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="424"><said who="#Anne">“ I can never do that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>determinedly and darkly .<said who="#Anne">“ You can punish me in any way you like ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. You can shut me up in a dark , damp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and water and I shall not complain . But I cannot ask<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>to forgive me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="425"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ We 're not in the habit of shutting people up in dark damp dungeons , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>drily ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ especially as they 're rather scarce in Avonlea . But apologize to<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>you must and shall and you 'll stay here in your room until you can tell me you 're willing to do it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="426"><said who="#Anne">“ I shall have to stay here forever then , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>mournfully ,<said who="#Anne">“ because I can n't tell<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>I 'm sorry I said those things to her . How can I ? I 'm NOT sorry . I 'm sorry I 've vexed you ; but I 'm GLAD I told her just what I did . It was a great satisfaction . I can n't say I 'm sorry when I 'm not , can I ? I can n't even IMAGINE I 'm sorry . ”</said></p>
    <p n="427"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Perhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the morning , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, rising to depart .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You 'll have the night to think over your conduct in and come to a better frame of mind . You said you would try to be a very good girl if we kept you at Green Gables , but I must say it has n't seemed very much like it this evening . ”</said></p>
    <p n="428">Leaving this Parthian shaft to rankle in<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s stormy bosom ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>descended to the kitchen , grievously troubled in mind and vexed in soul . She was as angry with herself as with<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, because , whenever she recalled<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>'s dumbfounded countenance her lips twitched with amusement and she felt a most reprehensible desire to laugh .</p>

    <p n="429"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>said nothing to<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>about the affair that evening ; but when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>proved still refractory the next morning an explanation had to be made to account for her absence from the breakfast table .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>told<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>the whole story , taking pains to impress him with a due sense of the enormity of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s behavior .</p>
    <p n="430"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ It 's a good thing<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel Lynde</persName>got a calling down ; she 's a meddlesome old gossip , ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s consolatory rejoinder .</p>
    <p n="431"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>, I 'm astonished at you . You know that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s behavior was dreadful , and yet you take her part !

    <p n="432"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now — no — not exactly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>uneasily .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I reckon she ought to be punished a little . But do n't be too hard on her ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. Recollect she has n't ever had anyone to teach her right .

    <p n="433"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ When did you ever hear of me starving people into good behavior ? ”</said>demanded<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>indignantly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ She 'll have her meals regular , and I 'll carry them up to her myself .

    <p n="434">Breakfast , dinner , and supper were very silent meals — for<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>still remained obdurate . After each meal<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>carried a well-filled tray to the east gable and brought it down later on not noticeably depleted .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>eyed its last descent with a troubled eye . Had<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>eaten anything at all ?</p>
    <p n="435">When<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>went out that evening to bring the cows from the back pasture ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, who had been hanging about the barns and watching , slipped into the house with the air of a burglar and crept upstairs . As a general thing<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>gravitated between the kitchen and the little bedroom off the hall where he slept ; once in a while he ventured uncomfortably into the parlor or sitting room when the minister came to tea . But he had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he helped<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>paper the spare bedroom , and that was four years ago .</p>
    <p n="436">He tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minutes outside the door of the east gable before he summoned courage to tap on it with his fingers and then open the door to peep in .</p>
    <p n="437"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out into the garden . Very small and unhappy she looked , and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s heart smote him . He softly closed the door and tiptoed over to her .</p>
    <p n="438"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>he whispered , as if afraid of being overheard ,<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ how are you making it ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="439"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>smiled wanly .</p>
    <p n="440"><said who="#Anne">“ Pretty well . I imagine a good deal , and that helps to pass the time . Of course , it 's rather lonesome . But then , I may as well get used to that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="441"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>smiled again , bravely facing the long years of solitary imprisonment before her .</p>
    <p n="442"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>recollected that he must say what he had come to say without loss of time , lest<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>return prematurely .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well now ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, do n't you think you 'd better do it and have it over with ? ”</said>he whispered .<said>“ It 'll have to be done sooner or later , you know , for<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s a dreadful deter-mined woman — dreadful determined ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. Do it right off , I say , and have it over . ”</said></p>
    <p n="443"><said who="#Anne">“ Do you mean apologize to<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="444"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Yes — apologize — that 's the very word , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>eagerly .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Just smooth it over so to speak . That 's what I was trying to get at . ”</said></p>
    <p n="445"><said who="#Anne">“ I suppose I could do it to oblige you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>thoughtfully .<said who="#Anne">“ It would be true enough to say I am sorry , because I AM sorry now . I was n't a bit sorry last night . I was mad clear through , and I stayed mad all night . I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just furious every time . But this morning it was over . I was n't in a temper anymore — and it left a dreadful sort of goneness , too . I felt so ashamed of myself . But I just could n't think of going and telling<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>so . It would be so humiliating . I made up my mind I 'd stay shut up here forever rather than do that . But still — I 'd do anything for you — if you really want me to — ”</said></p>
    <p n="446"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , of course I do . It 's terrible lonesome downstairs without you . Just go and smooth things over — that 's a good girl . ”</said></p>
    <p n="447"><said who="#Anne">“ Very well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>resignedly .<said who="#Anne">“ I 'll tell<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>as soon as she comes in I 've repented . ”</said></p>
    <p n="448"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ That 's right — that 's right ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. But do n't tell<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>I said anything about it . She might think I was putting my oar in and I promised not to do that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="449"><said who="#Anne">“ Wild horses wo n't drag the secret from me , ”</said>promised<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>solemnly .<said who="#Anne">“ How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="450">But<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was gone , scared at his own success . He fled hastily to the remotest corner of the horse pasture lest<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>should suspect what he had been up to .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>herself , upon her return to the house , was agreeably surprised to hear a plaintive voice calling , “<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>” over the banisters .</p>
    <p n="451"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well ? ”</said>she said , going into the hall .</p>
    <p n="452"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I 'm sorry I lost my temper and said rude things , and I 'm willing to go and tell<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="453"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Very well . ”</said><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s crispness gave no sign of her relief . She had been wondering what under the canopy she should do if<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>did not give in .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'll take you down after milking . ”</said></p>
    <p n="454">Accordingly , after milking , behold<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>walking down the lane , the former erect and triumphant , the latter drooping and dejected . But halfway down<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s dejection vanished as if by enchantment . She lifted her head and stepped lightly along , her eyes fixed on the sunset sky and an air of subdued exhilaration about her .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>beheld the change disapprovingly . This was no meek penitent such as it behooved her to take into the presence of the offended<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>.</p>
    <p n="455"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ What are you thinking of ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said>she asked sharply .</p>
    <p n="456"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm imagining out what I must say to<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>, ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>dreamily .</p>
    <p n="457">This was satisfactory — or should have been so . But<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>could not rid herself of the notion that something in her scheme of punishment was going askew .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had no business to look so rapt and radiant .</p>
    <p n="458">Rapt and radiant<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>continued until they were in the very presence of<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>, who was sitting knitting by her kitchen window . Then the radiance vanished . Mournful penitence appeared on every feature . Before a word was spoken<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>suddenly went down on her knees before the astonished<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>and held out her hands beseechingly .</p>
    <p n="459"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>, I am so extremely sorry , ”</said>she said with a quiver in her voice .<said who="#Anne">“ I could never express all my sorrow , no , not if I used up a whole dictionary . You must just imagine it . I behaved terribly to you — and I 've disgraced the dear friends ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, who have let me stay at Green Gables although I 'm not a boy . I 'm a dreadfully wicked and ungrateful girl , and I deserve to be punished and cast out by respectable people forever . It was very wicked of me to fly into a temper because you told me the truth . It WAS the truth ; every word you said was true . My hair is red and I 'm freckled and skinny and ugly . What I said to you was true , too , but I should n't have said it . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>, please , please , forgive me . If you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow on a poor little orphan girl , would you , even if she had a dreadful temper ? Oh , I am sure you would n't . Please say you forgive me ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="460"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>clasped her hands together , bowed her head , and waited for the word of judgment .</p>
    <p n="461">There was no mistaking her sincerity — it breathed in every tone of her voice . Both<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>recognized its unmistakable ring . But the former under-stood in dismay that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was actually enjoying her valley of humiliation — was reveling in the thoroughness of her abasement . Where was the wholesome punishment upon which she ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, had plumed herself ?<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had turned it into a species of positive pleasure .</p>
    <p n="462">Good<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>, not being overburdened with perception , did not see this . She only perceived that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had made a very thorough apology and all resentment vanished from her kindly , if somewhat officious , heart .</p>
    <p n="463"><said who="#Anne">“ There , there , get up , child , ”</said>she said heartily .<said who="#Anne">“ Of course I forgive you . I guess I was a little too hard on you , anyway . But I 'm such an outspoken person . You just must n't mind me , that 's what . It can n't be denied your hair is terrible red ; but I knew a girl once — went to school with her , in fact — whose hair was every mite as red as yours when she was young , but when she grew up it darkened to a real handsome auburn . I would n't be a mite surprised if yours did , too — not a mite . ”</said></p>
    <p n="464"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>! ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>drew a long breath as she rose to her feet .<said who="#Anne">“ You have given me a hope . I shall always feel that you are a benefactor . Oh , I could endure anything if I only thought my hair would be a handsome auburn when I grew up . It would be so much easier to be good if one 's hair was a handsome auburn , do n't you think ? And now may I go out into your garden and sit on that bench under the apple-trees while you and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>are talking ? There is so much more scope for imagination out there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="465"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Laws , yes , run along , child . And you can pick a bouquet of them white June lilies over in the corner if you like . ”</said></p>
    <p n="466">As the door closed behind<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>got briskly up to light a lamp .</p>
    <p n="467"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ She 's a real odd little thing . Take this chair ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>; it 's easier than the one you 've got ; I just keep that for the hired boy to sit on . Yes , she certainly is an odd child , but there is something kind of taking about her after all . I do n't feel so surprised at you and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>keeping her as I did — nor so sorry for you , either . She may turn out all right . Of course , she has a queer way of expressing herself — a little too — well , too kind of forcible , you know ; but she 'll likely get over that now that she 's come to live among civilized folks . And then , her temper 's pretty quick , I guess ; but there 's one comfort , a child that has a quick temper , just blaze up and cool down , ai n't never likely to be sly or deceitful . Preserve me from a sly child , that 's what . On the whole ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I kind of like her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="468">When<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>went home<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>came out of the fragrant twilight of the orchard with a sheaf of white narcissi in her hands .</p>
    <p n="469"><said who="#Anne">“ I apologized pretty well , did n't I ? ”</said>she said proudly as they went down the lane .<said who="#Anne">“ I thought since I had to do it I might as well do it thoroughly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="470"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You did it thoroughly , all right enough , ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s comment .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was dismayed at finding herself inclined to laugh over the recollection . She had also an uneasy feeling that she ought to scold<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>for apologizing so well ; but then , that was ridiculous ! She compromised with her conscience by saying severely :</p>
    <p n="471"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I hope you wo n't have occasion to make many more such apologies . I hope you 'll try to control your temper now ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="472"><said who="#Anne">“ That would n't be so hard if people would n't twit me about my looks , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>with a sigh .<said who="#Anne">“ I do n't get cross about other things ; but I 'm SO tired of being twitted about my hair and it just makes me boil right over . Do you suppose my hair will really be a handsome auburn when I grow up ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="473"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You should n't think so much about your looks ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. I 'm afraid you are a very vain little girl . ”</said></p>
    <p n="474"><said who="#Anne">“ How can I be vain when I know I 'm homely ? ”</said>protested<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I love pretty things ; and I hate to look in the glass and see something that is n't pretty . It makes me feel so sorrowful — just as I feel when I look at any ugly thing . I pity it because it is n't beautiful . ”</said></p>
    <p n="475"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Handsome is as handsome does , ”</said>quoted<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I 've had that said to me before , but I have my doubts about it , ”</said>remarked skeptical<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, sniffing at her narcissi .<said who="#Anne">“ Oh , are n't these flowers sweet ! It was lovely of<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>to give them to me . I have no hard feelings against<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>now . It gives you a lovely , comfortable feeling to apologize and be forgiven , does n't it ? Are n't the stars bright tonight ? If you could live in a star , which one would you pick ? I 'd like that lovely clear big one away over there above that dark hill . ”</said></p>
    <p n="476"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, do hold your tongue . ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, thoroughly worn out trying to follow the gyrations of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s thoughts .</p>
    <p n="477"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>said no more until they turned into their own lane . A little gypsy wind came down it to meet them , laden with the spicy perfume of young dew-wet ferns . Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out through the trees from the kitchen at Green Gables .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>suddenly came close to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and slipped her hand into the older woman 's hard palm .</p>
    <p n="478"><said who="#Anne">“ It 's lovely to be going home and know it 's home , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Anne">“ I love Green Gables already , and I never loved any place before . No place ever seemed like home . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I 'm so happy . I could pray right now and not find it a bit hard . ”</said></p>
    <p n="479">Something warm and pleasant welled up in<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s heart at touch of that thin little hand in her own — a throb of the maternity she had missed , perhaps . Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed her . She hastened to restore her sensations to their normal calm by inculcating a moral .</p>
    <p n="480"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ If you 'll be a good girl you 'll always be happy ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. And you should never find it hard to say your prayers . ”</said></p>
    <p n="481"><said who="#Anne">“ Saying one 's prayers is n't exactly the same thing as praying , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>meditatively .<said who="#Anne">“ But I 'm going to imagine that I 'm the wind that is blowing up there in those tree tops . When I get tired of the trees I 'll imagine I 'm gently waving down here in the ferns — and then I 'll fly over to<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>'s garden and set the flowers dancing — and then I 'll go with one great swoop over the clover field — and then I 'll blow over the Lake of Shining Waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling waves . Oh , there 's so much scope for imagination in a wind ! So I 'll not talk any more just now ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="482"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Thanks be to goodness for that , ”</said>breathed<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>in devout relief .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="11">
    <p n="483"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was standing in the gable room , looking solemnly at three new dresses spread out on the bed . One was of snuffy colored gingham which<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had been tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer because it looked so serviceable ; one was of black-and-white checkered sateen which she had picked up at a bargain counter in the winter ; and one was a stiff print of an ugly blue shade which she had purchased that week at a Carmody store .</p>
    <p n="484">She had made them up herself , and they were all made alike — plain skirts fulled tightly to plain waists , with sleeves as plain as waist and skirt and tight as sleeves could be .</p>
    <p n="485"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'll imagine that I like them , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>soberly .</p>
    <p n="486"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't want you to imagine it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, offended .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Oh , I can see you do n't like the dresses ! What is the matter with them ? Are n't they neat and clean and new ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="487"><said who="#Anne">“ Yes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="488"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Then why do n't you like them ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="489"><said who="#Anne">“ They 're — they 're not — pretty , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>reluctantly .</p>
    <p n="490"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Pretty ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sniffed .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I did n't trouble my head about getting pretty dresses for you . I do n't believe in pampering vanity ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, I 'll tell you that right off . Those dresses are good , sensible , serviceable dresses , without any frills or furbelows about them , and they 're all you 'll get this summer . The brown gingham and the blue print will do you for school when you begin to go . The sateen is for church and Sunday school . I 'll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear them . I should think you 'd be grateful to get most anything after those skimpy wincey things you 've been wearing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="491"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I AM grateful , ”</said>protested<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ But I 'd be ever so much gratefuller if — if you 'd made just one of them with puffed sleeves . Puffed sleeves are so fashionable now . It would give me such a thrill ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves . ”</said></p>
    <p n="492"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , you 'll have to do without your thrill . I had n't any material to waste on puffed sleeves . I think they are ridiculous-looking things anyhow . I prefer the plain , sensible ones . ”</said></p>
    <p n="493"><said who="#Anne">“ But I 'd rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and sensible all by myself , ”</said>persisted<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>mournfully .</p>
    <p n="494"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Trust you for that ! Well , hang those dresses carefully up in your closet , and then sit down and learn the Sunday school lesson . I got a quarterly from<persName>Mr. Bell</persName>for you and you 'll go to Sunday school tomorrow , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon .</p>
    <p n="495"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>clasped her hands and looked at the dresses .</p>
    <p n="496"><said who="#Anne">“ I did hope there would be a white one with puffed sleeves , ”</said>she whispered disconsolately .<said who="#Anne">“ I prayed for one , but I did n't much expect it on that account . I did n't suppose God would have time to bother about a little orphan girl 's dress . I knew I 'd just have to depend on<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>for it . Well , fortunately I can imagine that one of them is of snow-white muslin with lovely lace frills and three-puffed sleeves . ”</said></p>
    <p n="497">The next morning warnings of a sick headache prevented<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>from going to Sunday-school with<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="498"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You 'll have to go down and call for<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said>she said .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ She 'll see that you get into the right class . Now , mind you behave yourself properly . Stay to preaching afterwards and ask<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>to show you our pew . Here 's a cent for collection . Do n't stare at people and do n't fidget . I shall expect you to tell me the text when you come home . ”</said></p>
    <p n="499"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>started off irreproachable , arrayed in the stiff black-and-white sateen , which , while decent as regards length and certainly not open to the charge of skimpiness , contrived to emphasize every corner and angle of her thin figure . Her hat was a little , flat , glossy , new sailor , the extreme plainness of which had likewise much disappointed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, who had permitted herself secret visions of ribbon and flowers . The latter , however , were supplied before<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>reached the main road , for being confronted halfway down the lane with a golden frenzy of wind-stirred buttercups and a glory of wild roses ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>promptly and liberally garlanded her hat with a heavy wreath of them . Whatever other people might have thought of the result it satisfied<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, and she tripped gaily down the road , holding her ruddy head with its decoration of pink and yellow very proudly .</p>
    <p n="500">When she had reached<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>'s house she found that lady gone . Nothing daunted ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>proceeded onward to the church alone . In the porch she found a crowd of little girls , all more or less gaily attired in whites and blues and pinks , and all staring with curious eyes at this stranger in their midst , with her extraordinary head adornment . Avonlea little girls had already heard queer stories about<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>said she had an awful temper ; Jerry Buote , the hired boy at Green Gables , said she talked all the time to herself or to the trees and flowers like a crazy girl . They looked at her and whispered to each other behind their quarterlies . Nobody made any friendly advances , then or later on when the opening exercises were over and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>found herself in Miss Rogerson 's class .</p>
    <p n="501">Miss Rogerson was a middle-aged lady who had taught a Sunday-school class for twenty years . Her method of teaching was to ask the printed questions from the quarterly and look sternly over its edge at the particular little girl she thought ought to answer the question . She looked very often at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, thanks to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s drilling , answered promptly ; but it may be questioned if she understood very much about either question or answer .</p>
    <p n="502">She did not think she liked Miss Rogerson , and she felt very miserable ; every other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt that life was really not worth living without puffed sleeves .</p>
    <p n="503"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , how did you like Sunday school ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>wanted to know when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>came home . Her wreath having faded ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had discarded it in the lane , so<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was spared the knowledge of that for a time .</p>
    <p n="504"><said who="#Anne">“ I did n't like it a bit . It was horrid . ”</said></p>
    <p n="505"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>rebukingly .</p>
    <p n="506"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sat down on the rocker with a long sigh , kissed one of<persName corresp="#Bonny">Bonny</persName>'s leaves , and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia .</p>
    <p n="507"><said who="#Bonny">“ They might have been lonesome while I was away , ”</said>she explained .<said who="#Bonny">“ And now about the Sunday school . I behaved well , just as you told me .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>was gone , but I went right on myself . I went into the church , with a lot of other little girls , and I sat in the corner of a pew by the window while the opening exercises went on .<persName>Mr. Bell</persName>made an awfully long prayer . I would have been dreadfully tired before he got through if I had n't been sitting by that window . But it looked right out on the Lake of Shining Waters , so I just gazed at that and imagined all sorts of splendid things . ”</said></p>
    <p n="508"><said who="#Anne">“ You should n't have done anything of the sort . You should have listened to<persName>Mr. Bell</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="509"><said who="#Anne">“ But he was n't talking to me , ”</said>protested<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ He was talking to God and he did n't seem to be very much inter-ested in it , either . I think he thought God was too far off though . There was a long row of white birches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through them , ‘ way , ‘ way down , deep into the water . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, it was like a beautiful dream ! It gave me a thrill and I just said , ‘ Thank you for it , God , ’ two or three times . ”</said></p>
    <p n="510"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Not out loud , I hope , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>anxiously .</p>
    <p n="511"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , no , just under my breath . Well ,<persName>Mr. Bell</persName>did get through at last and they told me to go into the classroom with Miss Rogerson 's class . There were nine other girls in it . They all had puffed sleeves . I tried to imagine mine were puffed , too , but I could n't . Why could n't I ? It was as easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when I was alone in the east gable , but it was awfully hard there among the others who had really truly puffs . ”</said></p>
    <p n="512"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You should n't have been thinking about your sleeves in Sunday school . You should have been attending to the lesson . I hope you knew it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="513"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Oh , yes ; and I answered a lot of questions . Miss Rogerson asked ever so many . I do n't think it was fair for her to do all the asking . There were lots I wanted to ask her , but I did n't like to because I did n't think she was a kindred spirit . Then all the other little girls recited a paraphrase . She asked me if I knew any . I told her I did n't , but I could recite , ‘ The Dog at His Master 's Grave ’ if she liked . That 's in the Third Royal Reader . It is n't a really truly religious piece of poetry , but it 's so sad and melancholy that it might as well be . She said it would n't do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next Sunday . I read it over in church afterwards and it 's splendid . There are two lines in particular that just thrill me .</said></p>
    <p n="514"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ ‘ Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell In Midian 's evil day . ’</said></p>
    <p n="515"><said who="#Anne">“ I do n't know what ‘ squadrons ’ means nor ‘ Midian , ’ either , but it sounds SO tragical . I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it . I 'll practice it all the week . After Sunday school I asked Miss Rogerson — because<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>was too far away — to show me your pew . I sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations , third chapter , second and third verses . It was a very long text . If I was a minister I 'd pick the short , snappy ones . The sermon was awfully long , too . I suppose the minister had to match it to the text . I did n't think he was a bit interesting . The trouble with him seems to be that he has n't enough imagination . I did n't listen to him very much . I just let my thoughts run and I thought of the most surprising things . ”</said></p>
    <p n="516"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>felt helplessly that all this should be sternly reproved , but she was hampered by the undeniable fact that some of the things<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had said , especially about the minister 's sermons and<persName>Mr. Bell</persName>'s prayers , were what she herself had really thought deep down in her heart for years , but had never given expression to . It almost seemed to her that those secret , unuttered , critical thoughts had suddenly taken visible and accusing shape and form in the person of this outspoken morsel of neglected humanity .</p>

    <p n="517">It was not until the next Friday that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>heard the story of the flower-wreathed hat . She came home from<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>'s and called<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>to account .</p>
    <p n="518"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>says you went to church last Sunday with your hat rigged out ridiculous with roses and buttercups . What on earth put you up to such a caper ? A pretty-looking object you must have been ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="519"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh . I know pink and yellow are n't becoming to me , ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="520"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Becoming fiddlesticks ! It was putting flowers on your hat at all , no matter what color they were , that was ridiculous . You are the most aggravating child ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="521"><said who="#Anne">“ I do n't see why it 's any more ridiculous to wear flowers on your hat than on your dress , ”</said>protested<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Lots of little girls there had bouquets pinned on their dresses . What 's the difference ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="522"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was not to be drawn from the safe concrete into dubious paths of the abstract .</p>
    <p n="523"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Do n't answer me back like that ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. It was very silly of you to do such a thing . Never let me catch you at such a trick again .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>says she thought she would sink through the floor when she saw you come in all rigged out like that . She could n't get near enough to tell you to take them off till it was too late . She says people talked about it something dreadful . Of course they would think I had no better sense than to let you go decked out like that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="524"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I 'm so sorry , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, tears welling into her eyes .<said who="#Anne">“ I never thought you 'd mind . The roses and buttercups were so sweet and pretty I thought they 'd look lovely on my hat . Lots of the little girls had artificial flowers on their hats . I 'm afraid I 'm going to be a dreadful trial to you . Maybe you 'd better send me back to the asylum . That would be terrible ; I do n't think I could endure it ; most likely I would go into consumption ; I 'm so thin as it is , you see . But that would be better than being a trial to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="525"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Nonsense , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, vexed at herself for having made the child cry .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't want to send you back to the asylum , I 'm sure . All I want is that you should behave like other little girls and not make yourself ridiculous . Do n't cry any more . I 've got some news for you .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana Barry</persName>came home this afternoon . I 'm going up to see if I can borrow a skirt pattern from<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>, and if you like you can come with me and get acquainted with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="526"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>rose to her feet , with clasped hands , the tears still glistening on her cheeks ; the dish towel she had been hemming slipped unheeded to the floor .</p>
    <p n="527"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I 'm frightened — now that it has come I 'm actually frightened . What if she should n't like me ! It would be the most tragical disappointment of my life . ”</said></p>
    <p n="528"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Now , do n't get into a fluster . And I do wish you would n't use such long words . It sounds so funny in a little girl . I guess<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'ll like you well enough . It 's her mother you 've got to reckon with . If she does n't like you it wo n't matter how much<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>does . If she has heard about your outburst to<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>and going to church with buttercups round your hat I do n't know what she 'll think of you . You must be polite and well behaved , and do n't make any of your startling speeches . For pity 's sake , if the child is n't actually trembling ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="529"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>WAS trembling . Her face was pale and tense .</p>
    <p n="530"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, you 'd be excited , too , if you were going to meet a little girl you hoped to be your bosom friend and whose mother might n't like you , ”</said>she said as she hastened to get her hat .</p>
    <p n="531">They went over to Orchard Slope by the short cut across the brook and up the firry hill grove .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>came to the kitchen door in answer to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s knock . She was a tall black-eyed , black-haired woman , with a very resolute mouth . She had the reputation of being very strict with her children .</p>
    <p n="532"><said who="#Mrs._Barry">“ How do you do ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said>she said cordially .<said who="#Mrs._Barry">“ Come in . And this is the little girl you have adopted , I suppose ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="533"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Yes , this is<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="534"><said who="#Anne">“ Spelled with an E , ”</said>gasped<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, who , tremulous and excited as she was , was determined there should be no misunderstanding on that important point .</p>
    <p n="535"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>, not hearing or not comprehending , merely shook hands and said kindly :</p>
    <p n="536"><said who="#Mrs._Barry">“ How are you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="537"><said who="#Anne">“ I am well in body although considerable rumpled up in spirit , thank you ma'am , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>gravely . Then aside to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>in an audible whisper ,<said who="#Anne">“ There was n't anything startling in that , was there ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="538"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>was sitting on the sofa , reading a book which she dropped when the callers entered . She was a very pretty little girl , with her mother 's black eyes and hair , and rosy cheeks , and the merry expression which was her inheritance from her father .</p>
    <p n="539"><said who="#Mrs._Barry">“ This is my little girl<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Barry">“<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, you might take<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>out into the garden and show her your flowers . It will be better for you than straining your eyes over that book . She reads entirely too much — ”</said>this to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>as the little girls went out —<said who="#Mrs._Barry">“ and I can n't prevent her , for her father aids and abets her . She 's always poring over a book . I 'm glad she has the prospect of a playmate — perhaps it will take her more out-of-doors . ”</said></p>
    <p n="540">Outside in the garden , which was full of mellow sunset light streaming through the dark old firs to the west of it , stood<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, gazing bashfully at each other over a clump of gorgeous tiger lilies .</p>
    <p n="541">The<persName>Barry</persName>garden was a bowery wilderness of flowers which would have delighted<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s heart at any time less fraught with destiny . It was encircled by huge old willows and tall firs , beneath which flourished flowers that loved the shade . Prim , right-angled paths neatly bordered with clamshells , intersected it like moist red ribbons and in the beds between old-fashioned flowers ran riot . There were rosy bleeding-hearts and great splendid crimson peonies ; white , fragrant narcissi and thorny , sweet Scotch roses ; pink and blue and white columbines and lilac-tinted Bouncing Bets ; clumps of southernwood and ribbon grass and mint ; purple Adam-and-Eve , daffodils , and masses of sweet clover white with its delicate , fragrant , feathery sprays ; scarlet lightning that shot its fiery lances over prim white musk-flowers ; a garden it was where sunshine lingered and bees hummed , and winds , beguiled into loitering , purred and rustled .</p>
    <p n="542"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>at last , clasping her hands and speaking almost in a whisper ,<said who="#Anne">“ oh , do you think you can like me a little — enough to be my bosom friend ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="543"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>laughed .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>always laughed before she spoke .</p>
    <p n="544"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Why , I guess so , ”</said>she said frankly .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I 'm awfully glad you 've come to live at Green Gables . It will be jolly to have somebody to play with . There is n't any other girl who lives near enough to play with , and I 've no sisters big enough . ”</said></p>
    <p n="545"><said who="#Anne">“ Will you swear to be my friend forever and ever ? ”</said>demanded<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>eagerly .</p>
    <p n="546"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>looked shocked .</p>
    <p n="547"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Why it 's dreadfully wicked to swear , ”</said>she said rebukingly .</p>
    <p n="548"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh no , not my kind of swearing . There are two kinds , you know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="549"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I never heard of but one kind , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>doubtfully .</p>
    <p n="550"><said who="#Anne">“ There really is another . Oh , it is n't wicked at all . It just means vowing and promising solemnly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="551"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Well , I do n't mind doing that , ”</said>agreed<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, relieved .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ How do you do it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="552"><said who="#Anne">“ We must join hands — so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>gravely .<said who="#Anne">“ It ought to be over running water . We 'll just imagine this path is running water . I 'll repeat the oath first . I solemnly swear to be faithful to my bosom friend ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana Barry</persName>, as long as the sun and moon shall endure . Now you say it and put my name in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="553"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>repeated the “ oath ” with a laugh fore and aft . Then she said :</p>
    <p n="554"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ You 're a queer girl ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. I heard before that you were queer . But I believe I 'm going to like you real well . ”</said></p>
    <p n="555">When<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>went home<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>went with them as for as the log bridge . The two little girls walked with their arms about each other . At the brook they parted with many promises to spend the next afternoon together .</p>
    <p n="556"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , did you find<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>a kindred spirit ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>as they went up through the garden of Green Gables .</p>
    <p n="557"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh yes , ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, blissfully unconscious of any sarcasm on<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s part .<said who="#Anne">“ Oh<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I 'm the happiest girl on Prince Edward Island this very moment . I assure you I 'll say my prayers with a right good-will tonight .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I are going to build a playhouse in Mr. William<persName>Bell</persName>'s birch grove tomorrow . Can I have those broken pieces of china that are out in the woodshed ?<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s birthday is in February and mine is in March . Do n't you think that is a very strange coincidence ?<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>is going to lend me a book to read . She says it 's perfectly splendid and tremendously exciting . She 's going to show me a place back in the woods where rice lilies grow . Do n't you think<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>has got very soulful eyes ? I wish I had soulful eyes .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>is going to teach me to sing a song called ‘ Nelly in the Hazel Dell . ’ She 's going to give me a picture to put up in my room ; it 's a perfectly beautiful picture , she says — a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress . A sewing-machine agent gave it to her . I wish I had something to give<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. I 'm an inch taller than<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, but she is ever so much fatter ; she says she 'd like to be thin because it 's so much more graceful , but I 'm afraid she only said it to soothe my feelings . We 're going to the shore some day to gather shells . We have agreed to call the spring down by the log bridge the Dryad 's Bubble . Is n't that a perfectly elegant name ? I read a story once about a spring called that . A dryad is sort of a grown-up fairy , I think . ”</said></p>
    <p n="558"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , all I hope is you wo n't talk<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>to death , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ But remember this in all your planning ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. You 're not going to play all the time nor most of it . You 'll have your work to do and it 'll have to be done first . ”</said></p>
    <p n="559"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s cup of happiness was full , and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>caused it to overflow . He had just got home from a trip to the store at Carmody , and he sheepishly produced a small parcel from his pocket and handed it to<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, with a deprecatory look at<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="560"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I heard you say you liked chocolate sweeties , so I got you some , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="561"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Humph , ”</said>sniffed<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It 'll ruin her teeth and stomach . There , there , child , do n't look so dismal . You can eat those , since<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>has gone and got them . He 'd better have brought you peppermints . They 're wholesomer . Do n't sicken yourself eating all them at once now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="562"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , no , indeed , I wo n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>eagerly .<said who="#Anne">“ I 'll just eat one tonight ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. And I can give<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>half of them , can n't I ? The other half will taste twice as sweet to me if I give some to her . It 's delightful to think I have something to give her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="563"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I will say it for the child , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had gone to her gable ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ she is n't stingy . I 'm glad , for of all faults I detest stinginess in a child . Dear me , it 's only three weeks since she came , and it seems as if she 'd been here always . I can n't imagine the place without her . Now , do n't be looking I told-you-so ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. That 's bad enough in a woman , but it is n't to be endured in a man . I 'm perfectly willing to own up that I 'm glad I consented to keep the child and that I 'm getting fond of her , but do n't you rub it in ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>. ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="13">
    <p n="564"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It 's time<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was in to do her sewing , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, glancing at the clock and then out into the yellow August afternoon where everything drowsed in the heat .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ She stayed playing with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>more than half an hour more'n I gave her leave to ; and now she 's perched out there on the woodpile talking to<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, nineteen to the dozen , when she knows perfectly well she ought to be at her work . And of course he 's listening to her like a perfect ninny . I never saw such an infatuated man . The more she talks and the odder the things she says , the more he 's delighted evidently .<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, you come right in here this minute , do you hear me ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="565">A series of staccato taps on the west window brought<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>flying in from the yard , eyes shining , cheeks faintly flushed with pink , unbraided hair streaming behind her in a torrent of brightness .</p>
    <p n="566"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>she exclaimed breathlessly ,<said who="#Anne">“ there 's going to be a Sunday-school picnic next week — in Mr. Harmon<persName>Andrews</persName>'s field , right near the lake of Shining Waters . And Mrs . Superintendent<persName>Bell</persName>and<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel Lynde</persName>are going to make ice cream — think of it ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>— ICE CREAM ! And , oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, can I go to it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="567"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Just look at the clock , if you please ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. What time did I tell you to come in ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="568"><said who="#Anne">“ Two o'clock — but is n't it splendid about the picnic ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? Please can I go ? Oh , I 've never been to a picnic — I 've dreamed of picnics , but I 've never — ”</said></p>
    <p n="569"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Yes , I told you to come at two o'clock . And it 's a quarter to three . I 'd like to know why you did n't obey me ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="570"><said who="#Anne">“ Why , I meant to ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, as much as could be . But you have no idea how fascinating<persName>Idlewild</persName>is . And then , of course , I had to tell<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>about the picnic .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>is such a sympathetic listener . Please can I go ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="571"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You 'll have to learn to resist the fascination of Idle-whatever-you-call-it . When I tell you to come in at a certain time I mean that time and not half an hour later . And you need n't stop to discourse with sympathetic listeners on your way , either . As for the picnic , of course you can go . You 're a Sunday-school scholar , and it 's not likely I 'd refuse to let you go when all the other little girls are going . ”</said></p>
    <p n="572"><said who="#Anne">“ But — but , ”</said>faltered<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>says that everybody must take a basket of things to eat . I can n't cook , as you know ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, and — and — I do n't mind going to a picnic without puffed sleeves so much , but I 'd feel terribly humiliated if I had to go without a basket . It 's been preying on my mind ever since<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>told me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="573"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , it need n't prey any longer . I 'll bake you a basket . ”</said></p>
    <p n="574"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , you dear good<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. Oh , you are so kind to me . Oh , I 'm so much obliged to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="575">Getting through with her “ ohs ”<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>cast herself into<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s arms and rapturously kissed her sallow cheek . It was the first time in her whole life that childish lips had voluntarily touched<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s face . Again that sudden sensation of startling sweetness thrilled her . She was secretly vastly pleased at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s impulsive caress , which was probably the reason why she said brusquely :</p>
    <p n="576"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ There , there , never mind your kissing nonsense . I 'd sooner see you doing strictly as you 're told . As for cooking , I mean to begin giving you lessons in that some of these days . But you 're so featherbrained ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, I 've been waiting to see if you 'd sober down a little and learn to be steady before I begin . You 've got to keep your wits about you in cooking and not stop in the middle of things to let your thoughts rove all over creation . Now , get out your patchwork and have your square done before teatime . ”</said></p>
    <p n="577"><said who="#Anne">“ I do NOT like patchwork , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>dolefully , hunting out her workbasket and sitting down before a little heap of red and white diamonds with a sigh .<said>“ I think some kinds of sewing would be nice ; but there 's no scope for imagination in patchwork . It 's just one little seam after another and you never seem to be getting anywhere . But of course I 'd rather be<persName>Anne of Green Gables</persName>sewing patchwork than<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>of any other place with nothing to do but play . I wish time went as quick sewing patches as it does when I 'm playing with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, though . Oh , we do have such elegant times ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I have to furnish most of the imagination , but I 'm well able to do that .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>is simply perfect in every other way . You know that little piece of land across the brook that runs up between our farm and<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>'s . It belongs to Mr. William<persName>Bell</persName>, and right in the corner there is a little ring of white birch trees — the most romantic spot ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I have our playhouse there . We call it<persName>Idlewild</persName>. Is n't that a poetical name ? I assure you it took me some time to think it out . I stayed awake nearly a whole night before I invented it . Then , just as I was dropping off to sleep , it came like an inspiration .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>was ENRAPTURED when she heard it . We have got our house fixed up elegantly . You must come and see it ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>— wo n't you ? We have great big stones , all covered with moss , for seats , and boards from tree to tree for shelves . And we have all our dishes on them . Of course , they 're all broken but it 's the easiest thing in the world to imagine that they are whole . There 's a piece of a plate with a spray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful . We keep it in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there , too . The fairy glass is as lovely as a dream .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>found it out in the woods behind their chicken house . It 's all full of rainbows — just little young rainbows that have n't grown big yet — and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s mother told her it was broken off a hanging lamp they once had . But it 's nice to imagine the fairies lost it one night when they had a ball , so we call it the fairy glass .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>is going to make us a table . Oh , we have named that little round pool over in<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>'s field Willowmere . I got that name out of the book<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>lent me . That was a thrilling book ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. The heroine had five lovers . I 'd be satisfied with one , would n't you ? She was very handsome and she went through great tribulations . She could faint as easy as anything . I 'd love to be able to faint , would n't you ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? It 's so romantic . But I 'm really very healthy for all I 'm so thin . I believe I 'm getting fatter , though . Do n't you think I am ? I look at my elbows every morning when I get up to see if any dimples are coming .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves . She is going to wear it to the picnic . Oh , I do hope it will be fine next Wednesday . I do n't feel that I could endure the disappointment if anything happened to prevent me from getting to the picnic . I suppose I 'd live through it , but I 'm certain it would be a lifelong sorrow . It would n't matter if I got to a hundred picnics in after years ; they would n't make up for missing this one . They 're going to have boats on the Lake of Shining Waters — and ice cream , as I told you . I have never tasted ice cream .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>tried to explain what it was like , but I guess ice cream is one of those things that are beyond imagination . ”</said></p>
    <p n="578"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, you have talked even on for ten minutes by the clock , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Now , just for curiosity 's sake , see if you can hold your tongue for the same length of time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="579"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>held her tongue as desired . But for the rest of the week she talked picnic and thought picnic and dreamed picnic . On Saturday it rained and she worked herself up into such a frantic state lest it should keep on raining until and over Wednesday that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>made her sew an extra patchwork square by way of steadying her nerves .</p>
    <p n="580">On Sunday<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>confided to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>on the way home from church that she grew actually cold all over with excitement when the minister announced the picnic from the pulpit .</p>
    <p n="581"><said who="#Anne">“ Such a thrill as went up and down my back ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>! I do n't think I 'd ever really believed until then that there was honestly going to be a picnic . I could n't help fearing I 'd only imagined it . But when a minister says a thing in the pulpit you just have to believe it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="582"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You set your heart too much on things ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, with a sigh .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'm afraid there 'll be a great many disappointments in store for you through life . ”</said></p>
    <p n="583"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, looking forward to things is half the pleasure of them , ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ You may n't get the things themselves ; but nothing can prevent you from having the fun of looking forward to them .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says , ‘ Blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not be disappointed . ’ But I think it would be worse to expect nothing than to be disappointed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="584"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>wore her amethyst brooch to church that day as usual .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>always wore her amethyst brooch to church . She would have thought it rather sacrilegious to leave it off — as bad as forgetting her Bible or her collection dime . That amethyst brooch was<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s most treasured possession . A seafaring uncle had given it to her mother who in turn had bequeathed it to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. It was an old-fashioned oval , containing a braid of her mother 's hair , surrounded by a border of very fine amethysts .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>knew too little about precious stones to realize how fine the amethysts actually were ; but she thought them very beautiful and was always pleasantly conscious of their violet shimmer at her throat , above her good brown satin dress , even although she could not see it .</p>
    <p n="585"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had been smitten with delighted admiration when she first saw that brooch .</p>
    <p n="586"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, it 's a perfectly elegant brooch . I do n't know how you can pay attention to the sermon or the prayers when you have it on . I could n't , I know . I think amethysts are just sweet . They are what I used to think diamonds were like . Long ago , before I had ever seen a diamond , I read about them and I tried to imagine what they would be like . I thought they would be lovely glimmering purple stones . When I saw a real diamond in a lady 's ring one day I was so disappointed I cried . Of course , it was very lovely but it was n't my idea of a diamond . Will you let me hold the brooch for one minute ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? Do you think amethysts can be the souls of good violets ? ”</said></p>

    <p n="587">ON the Monday evening before the picnic<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>came down from her room with a troubled face .</p>
    <p n="588"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>she said to that small personage , who was shelling peas by the spotless table and singing , “ Nelly of the Hazel Dell ” with a vigor and expression that did credit to<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s teaching ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ did you see anything of my amethyst brooch ? I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when I came home from church yesterday evening , but I can n't find it anywhere . ”</said></p>
    <p n="589"><said who="#Anne">“ I — I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid Society , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, a little slowly .<said who="#Anne">“ I was passing your door when I saw it on the cushion , so I went in to look at it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="590"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Did you touch it ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sternly .</p>
    <p n="591"><said who="#Anne">“ Y-e-e-s , ”</said>admitted<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne">“ I took it up and I pinned it on my breast just to see how it would look . ”</said></p>
    <p n="592"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You had no business to do anything of the sort . It 's very wrong in a little girl to meddle . You should n't have gone into my room in the first place and you should n't have touched a brooch that did n't belong to you in the second . Where did you put it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="593"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I put it back on the bureau . I had n't it on a minute . Truly , I did n't mean to meddle ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I did n't think about its being wrong to go in and try on the brooch ; but I see now that it was and I 'll never do it again . That 's one good thing about me . I never do the same naughty thing twice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="594"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You did n't put it back , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ That brooch is n't anywhere on the bureau . You 've taken it out or something ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="595"><said who="#Anne">“ I did put it back , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>quickly — pertly ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>thought .<said who="#Anne">“ I do n't just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in the china tray . But I 'm perfectly certain I put it back . ”</said></p>
    <p n="596"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'll go and have another look , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, determining to be just .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ If you put that brooch back it 's there still . If it is n't I 'll know you did n't , that 's all ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="597"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>went to her room and made a thorough search , not only over the bureau but in every other place she thought the brooch might possibly be . It was not to be found and she returned to the kitchen .</p>
    <p n="598"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, the brooch is gone . By your own admission you were the last person to handle it . Now , what have you done with it ? Tell me the truth at once . Did you take it out and lose it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="599"><said who="#Anne">“ No , I did n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>solemnly , meeting<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s angry gaze squarely .<said who="#Anne">“ I never took the brooch out of your room and that is the truth , if I was to be led to the block for it — although I 'm not very certain what a block is . So there ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="600"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s “ so there ” was only intended to emphasize her assertion , but<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>took it as a display of defiance .</p>
    <p n="601"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I believe you are telling me a falsehood ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>she said sharply .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I know you are . There now , do n't say anything more unless you are prepared to tell the whole truth . Go to your room and stay there until you are ready to confess . ”</said></p>
    <p n="602"><said who="#Anne">“ Will I take the peas with me ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>meekly .</p>
    <p n="603"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No , I 'll finish shelling them myself . Do as I bid you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="604">When<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had gone<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>went about her evening tasks in a very disturbed state of mind . She was worried about her valuable brooch . What if<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had lost it ? And how wicked of the child to deny having taken it , when anybody could see she must have ! With such an innocent face , too !</p>
    <p n="605"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't know what I would n't sooner have had happen , ”</said>thought<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, as she nervously shelled the peas .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Of course , I do n't suppose she meant to steal it or anything like that . She 's just taken it to play with or help along that imagination of hers . She must have taken it , that 's clear , for there has n't been a soul in that room since she was in it , by her own story , until I went up tonight . And the brooch is gone , there 's nothing surer . I suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for fear she 'll be punished . It 's a dreadful thing to think she tells falsehoods . It 's a far worse thing than her fit of temper . It 's a fearful responsibility to have a child in your house you can n't trust . Slyness and untruthfulness — that 's what she has displayed . I declare I feel worse about that than about the brooch . If she 'd only have told the truth about it I would n't mind so much . ”</said></p>
    <p n="606"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>went to her room at intervals all through the evening and searched for the brooch , without finding it . A bedtime visit to the east gable produced no result .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>persisted in denying that she knew anything about the brooch but<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was only the more firmly convinced that she did .</p>
    <p n="607">She told<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>the story the next morning .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was confounded and puzzled ; he could not so quickly lose faith in<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>but he had to admit that circumstances were against her .</p>
    <p n="608"><said who="#Anne">“ You 're sure it has n't fell down behind the bureau ? ”</said>was the only suggestion he could offer .</p>
    <p n="609">“ I 've moved the bureau and I 've taken out the drawers and I 've looked in every crack and cranny ” was<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s positive answer .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ The brooch is gone and that child has taken it and lied about it . That 's the plain , ugly truth ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>, and we might as well look it in the face . ”</said></p>
    <p n="610"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , what are you going to do about it ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>asked forlornly , feeling secretly thankful that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and not he had to deal with the situation . He felt no desire to put his oar in this time .</p>
    <p n="611"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ She 'll stay in her room until she confesses , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>grimly , remembering the success of this method in the former case .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Then we 'll see . Perhaps we 'll be able to find the brooch if she 'll only tell where she took it ; but in any case she 'll have to be severely punished ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="612"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , you 'll have to punish her , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, reaching for his hat .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I 've nothing to do with it , remember . You warned me off yourself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="613"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>felt deserted by everyone . She could not even go to<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>for advice . She went up to the east gable with a very serious face and left it with a face more serious still .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>steadfastly refused to confess . She persisted in asserting that she had not taken the brooch . The child had evidently been crying and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>felt a pang of pity which she sternly repressed . By night she was , as she expressed it ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ beat out . ”</said></p>
    <p n="614"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ You 'll stay in this room until you confess ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. You can make up your mind to that , ”</said>she said firmly .</p>
    <p n="615"><said who="#Anne">“ But the picnic is tomorrow ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ You wo n't keep me from going to that , will you ? You 'll just let me out for the afternoon , wo n't you ? Then I 'll stay here as long as you like AFTERWARDS cheerfully . But I MUST go to the picnic . ”</said></p>
    <p n="616"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You 'll not go to picnics nor anywhere else until you 've confessed ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="617"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>gasped<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="618">But<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had gone out and shut the door .</p>
    <p n="619">Wednesday morning dawned as bright and fair as if expressly made to order for the picnic . Birds sang around Green Gables ; the Madonna lilies in the garden sent out whiffs of perfume that entered in on viewless winds at every door and window , and wandered through halls and rooms like spirits of benediction . The birches in the hollow waved joyful hands as if watching for<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s usual morning greeting from the east gable . But<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was not at her window . When<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>took her breakfast up to her she found the child sitting primly on her bed , pale and resolute , with tight-shut lips and gleaming eyes .</p>
    <p n="620"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I 'm ready to confess . ”</said></p>
    <p n="621"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Ah ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>laid down her tray . Once again her method had succeeded ; but her success was very bitter to her .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Let me hear what you have to say then ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="622"><said who="#Anne">“ I took the amethyst brooch , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, as if repeating a lesson she had learned .<said who="#Anne">“ I took it just as you said . I did n't mean to take it when I went in . But it did look so beautiful ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, when I pinned it on my breast that I was overcome by an irresistible temptation . I imagined how perfectly thrilling it would be to take it to<persName>Idlewild</persName>and play I was the Lady<persName>Cordelia</persName>Fitzgerald . It would be so much easier to imagine I was the Lady<persName>Cordelia</persName>if I had a real amethyst brooch on .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to amethysts ? So I took the brooch . I thought I could put it back before you came home . I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the time . When I was going over the bridge across the Lake of Shining Waters I took the brooch off to have another look at it . Oh , how it did shine in the sunlight ! And then , when I was leaning over the bridge , it just slipped through my fingers — so — and went down — down — down , all purply-sparkling , and sank forevermore beneath the Lake of Shining Waters . And that 's the best I can do at confessing ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="623"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>felt hot anger surge up into her heart again . This child had taken and lost her treasured amethyst brooch and now sat there calmly reciting the details thereof without the least apparent compunction or repentance .</p>
    <p n="624"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, this is terrible , ”</said>she said , trying to speak calmly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You are the very wickedest girl I ever heard of . ”</said></p>
    <p n="625"><said who="#Anne">“ Yes , I suppose I am , ”</said>agreed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>tranquilly .<said who="#Anne">“ And I know I 'll have to be punished . It 'll be your duty to punish me ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. Wo n't you please get it over right off because I 'd like to go to the picnic with nothing on my mind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="626"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Picnic , indeed ! You 'll go to no picnic today ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>. That shall be your punishment . And it is n't half severe enough either for what you 've done ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="627"><said who="#Anne">“ Not go to the picnic ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sprang to her feet and clutched<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s hand .<said who="#Anne">“ But you PROMISED me I might ! Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I must go to the picnic . That was why I confessed . Punish me any way you like but that . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, please , please , let me go to the picnic . Think of the ice cream ! For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice cream again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="628"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>disengaged<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s clinging hands stonily .</p>
    <p n="629"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You need n't plead ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. You are not going to the picnic and that 's final . No , not a word . ”</said></p>
    <p n="630"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>realized that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was not to be moved . She clasped her hands together , gave a piercing shriek , and then flung herself face downward on the bed , crying and writhing in an utter abandonment of disappointment and despair .</p>
    <p n="631"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ For the land 's sake ! ”</said>gasped<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, hastening from the room .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I believe the child is crazy . No child in her senses would behave as she does . If she is n't she 's utterly bad . Oh dear , I 'm afraid<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>was right from the first . But I 've put my hand to the plow and I wo n't look back . ”</said></p>
    <p n="632">That was a dismal morning .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>worked fiercely and scrubbed the porch floor and the dairy shelves when she could find nothing else to do . Neither the shelves nor the porch needed it — but<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>did . Then she went out and raked the yard .</p>
    <p n="633">When dinner was ready she went to the stairs and called<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. A tear-stained face appeared , looking tragically over the banisters .</p>
    <p n="634"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Come down to your dinner ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="635"><said who="#Anne">“ I do n't want any dinner ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, sobbingly .<said who="#Anne">“ I could n't eat anything . My heart is broken . You 'll feel remorse of conscience someday , I expect , for breaking it ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, but I forgive you . Remember when the time comes that I forgive you . But please do n't ask me to eat anything , especially boiled pork and greens . Boiled pork and greens are so unromantic when one is in affliction . ”</said></p>
    <p n="636">Exasperated ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>returned to the kitchen and poured out her tale of woe to<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, who , between his sense of justice and his unlawful sympathy with<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, was a miserable man .</p>
    <p n="637"><said who="#Anne">“ Well now , she should n't have taken the brooch ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, or told stories about it , ”</said>he admitted , mournfully surveying his plateful of unromantic pork and greens as if he , like<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, thought it a food unsuited to crises of feeling ,<said who="#Anne">“ but she 's such a little thing — such an interesting little thing . Do n't you think it 's pretty rough not to let her go to the picnic when she 's so set on it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="638"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>, I 'm amazed at you . I think I 've let her off entirely too easy . And she does n't appear to realize how wicked she 's been at all — that 's what worries me most . If she 'd really felt sorry it would n't be so bad . And you do n't seem to realize it , neither ; you 're making excuses for her all the time to yourself — I can see that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="639"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , she 's such a little thing , ”</said>feebly reiterated<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ And there should be allowances made ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. You know she 's never had any bringing up . ”</said></p>
    <p n="640">“ Well , she 's having it now ” retorted<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="641">The retort silenced<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>if it did not convince him . That dinner was a very dismal meal . The only cheerful thing about it was Jerry Buote , the hired boy , and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>resented his cheerfulness as a personal insult .</p>
    <p n="642">When her dishes were washed and her bread sponge set and her hens fed<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>remembered that she had noticed a small rent in her best black lace shawl when she had taken it off on Monday afternoon on returning from the Ladies ’ Aid .</p>
    <p n="643">She would go and mend it . The shawl was in a box in her trunk . As<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>lifted it out , the sunlight , falling through the vines that clustered thickly about the window , struck upon something caught in the shawl — something that glittered and sparkled in facets of violet light .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>snatched at it with a gasp . It was the amethyst brooch , hanging to a thread of the lace by its catch !</p>
    <p n="644"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Dear life and heart , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>blankly ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ what does this mean ? Here 's my brooch safe and sound that I thought was at the bottom of<persName>Barry</persName>'s pond . Whatever did that girl mean by saying she took it and lost it ? I declare I believe Green Gables is bewitched . I remember now that when I took off my shawl Monday afternoon I laid it on the bureau for a minute . I suppose the brooch got caught in it somehow . Well ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="645"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>betook herself to the east gable , brooch in hand .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had cried herself out and was sitting dejectedly by the window .</p>
    <p n="646"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>solemnly ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 've just found my brooch hanging to my black lace shawl . Now I want to know what that rigmarole you told me this morning meant . ”</said></p>
    <p n="647"><said who="#Anne">“ Why , you said you 'd keep me here until I confessed , ”</said>returned<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>wearily ,<said who="#Anne">“ and so I decided to confess because I was bound to get to the picnic . I thought out a confession last night after I went to bed and made it as interesting as I could . And I said it over and over so that I would n't forget it . But you would n't let me go to the picnic after all , so all my trouble was wasted . ”</said></p>
    <p n="648"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had to laugh in spite of herself . But her conscience pricked her .</p>
    <p n="649"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, you do beat all ! But I was wrong — I see that now . I should n't have doubted your word when I 'd never known you to tell a story . Of course , it was n't right for you to confess to a thing you had n't done — it was very wrong to do so . But I drove you to it . So if you 'll forgive me ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, I 'll forgive you and we 'll start square again . And now get yourself ready for the picnic . ”</said></p>
    <p n="650"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>flew up like a rocket .</p>
    <p n="651"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, is n't it too late ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="652"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No , it 's only two o'clock . They wo n't be more than well gathered yet and it 'll be an hour before they have tea . Wash your face and comb your hair and put on your gingham . I 'll fill a basket for you . There 's plenty of stuff baked in the house . And I 'll get Jerry to hitch up the sorrel and drive you down to the picnic ground . ”</said></p>
    <p n="653"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, flying to the washstand .<said who="#Anne">“ Five minutes ago I was so miserable I was wishing I 'd never been born and now I would n't change places with an angel ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="654">That night a thoroughly happy , completely tired-out<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>returned to Green Gables in a state of beatification impossible to describe .</p>
    <p n="655"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I 've had a perfectly scrumptious time . Scrumptious is a new word I learned today . I heard Mary Alice<persName>Bell</persName>use it . Is n't it very expressive ? Everything was lovely . We had a splendid tea and then Mr. Harmon<persName>Andrews</persName>took us all for a row on the Lake of Shining Waters — six of us at a time . And<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>nearly fell overboard . She was leaning out to pick water lilies and if Mr.<persName>Andrews</persName>had n't caught her by her sash just in the nick of time she 'd fallen in and prob'ly been drowned . I wish it had been me . It would have been such a romantic experience to have been nearly drowned . It would be such a thrilling tale to tell . And we had the ice cream . Words fail me to describe that ice cream .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I assure you it was sublime . ”</said></p>
    <p n="656">That evening<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>told the whole story to<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>over her stocking basket .</p>
    <p n="657"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'm willing to own up that I made a mistake , ”</said>she concluded candidly ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ but I 've learned a lesson . I have to laugh when I think of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s ‘ confession , ’ although I suppose I should n't for it really was a falsehood . But it does n't seem as bad as the other would have been , somehow , and anyhow I 'm responsible for it . That child is hard to understand in some respects . But I believe she 'll turn out all right yet . And there 's one thing certain , no house will ever be dull that she 's in . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="15">
    <p n="658"><said who="#Anne">“ What a splendid day ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, drawing a long breath .<said who="#Anne">“ Is n't it good just to be alive on a day like this ? I pity the people who are n't born yet for missing it . They may have good days , of course , but they can never have this one . And it 's splendider still to have such a lovely way to go to school by , is n't it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="659"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It 's a lot nicer than going round by the road ; that is so dusty and hot , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>practically , peeping into her dinner basket and mentally calculating if the three juicy , toothsome , raspberry tarts reposing there were divided among ten girls how many bites each girl would have .</p>
    <p n="660">The little girls of Avonlea school always pooled their lunches , and to eat three raspberry tarts all alone or even to share them only with one 's best chum would have forever and ever branded as “ awful mean ” the girl who did it . And yet , when the tarts were divided among ten girls you just got enough to tantalize you .</p>
    <p n="661">The way<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>went to school WAS a pretty one .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>thought those walks to and from school with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>could n't be improved upon even by imagination . Going around by the main road would have been so unromantic ; but to go by Lover 's Lane and Willowmere and<persName>Violet Vale</persName>and<persName>the Birch Path</persName>was romantic , if ever anything was .</p>
    <p n="662">Lover 's Lane opened out below the orchard at Green Gables and stretched far up into the woods to the end of the<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Cuthbert</persName>farm . It was the way by which the cows were taken to the back pasture and the wood hauled home in winter .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had named it Lover 's Lane before she had been a month at Green Gables .</p>
    <p n="663"><said who="#Anne">“ Not that lovers ever really walk there , ”</said>she explained to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>,<said who="#Anne">“ but<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I are reading a perfectly magnificent book and there 's a Lover 's Lane in it . So we want to have one , too . And it 's a very pretty name , do n't you think ? So romantic ! We can n't imagine the lovers into it , you know . I like that lane because you can think out loud there without people calling you crazy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="664"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, starting out alone in the morning , went down Lover 's Lane as far as the brook . Here<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>met her , and the two little girls went on up the lane under the leafy arch of maples — “ maples are such sociable trees , ” said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>; “ they 're always rustling and whispering to you ” — until they came to a rustic bridge . Then they left the lane and walked through<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>'s back field and past Willowmere . Beyond Willowmere came<persName>Violet Vale</persName>— a little green dimple in the shadow of Mr. Andrew<persName>Bell</persName>'s big woods .<said who="#Anne">“ Of course there are no violets there now , ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>told<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>,<said who="#Anne">“ but<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>says there are millions of them in spring . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, can n't you just imagine you see them ? It actually takes away my breath . I named it<persName>Violet Vale</persName>.<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>says she never saw the beat of me for hitting on fancy names for places . It 's nice to be clever at something , is n't it ? But<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>named<persName>the Birch Path</persName>. She wanted to , so I let her ; but I 'm sure I could have found something more poetical than plain Birch Path . Anybody can think of a name like that . But<persName>the Birch Path</persName>is one of the prettiest places in the world ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="665">It was . Other people besides<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>thought so when they stumbled on it . It was a little narrow , twisting path , winding down over a long hill straight through<persName>Mr. Bell</persName>'s woods , where the light came down sifted through so many emerald screens that it was as flawless as the heart of a diamond . It was fringed in all its length with slim young birches , white stemmed and lissom boughed ; ferns and starflowers and wild lilies-of-the-valley and scarlet tufts of pigeonberries grew thickly along it ; and always there was a delightful spiciness in the air and music of bird calls and the murmur and laugh of wood winds in the trees overhead . Now and then you might see a rabbit skipping across the road if you were quiet — which , with<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, happened about once in a blue moon . Down in the valley the path came out to the main road and then it was just up the spruce hill to the school .</p>
    <p n="666">The Avonlea school was a whitewashed building , low in the eaves and wide in the windows , furnished inside with comfortable substantial old-fashioned desks that opened and shut , and were carved all over their lids with the initials and hieroglyphics of three generations of school children . The schoolhouse was set back from the road and behind it was a dusky fir wood and a brook where all the children put their bottles of milk in the morning to keep cool and sweet until dinner hour .</p>
    <p n="667"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had seen<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>start off to school on the first day of September with many secret misgivings .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was such an odd girl . How would she get on with the other children ? And how on earth would she ever manage to hold her tongue during school hours ?</p>
    <p n="668">Things went better than<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>feared , however .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>came home that evening in high spirits .</p>
    <p n="669"><said who="#Anne">“ I think I 'm going to like school here , ”</said>she announced .<said who="#Anne">“ I do n't think much of the master , through . He 's all the time curling his mustache and making eyes at<persName>Prissy Andrews</persName>.<persName>Prissy</persName>is grown up , you know . She 's sixteen and she 's studying for the entrance examination into<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s Academy at Charlottetown next year . Tillie Boulter says the master is DEAD GONE on her . She 's got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair and she does it up so elegantly . She sits in the long seat at the back and he sits there , too , most of the time — to explain her lessons , he says . But<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>says she saw him writing something on her slate and when<persName>Prissy</persName>read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled ; and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>says she does n't believe it had anything to do with the lesson . ”</said></p>
    <p n="670"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, do n't let me hear you talking about your teacher in that way again , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sharply .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You do n't go to school to criticize the master . I guess he can teach YOU something , and it 's your business to learn . And I want you to understand right off that you are not to come home telling tales about him . That is something I wo n't encourage . I hope you were a good girl . ”</said></p>
    <p n="671"><said who="#Anne">“ Indeed I was , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>comfortably .<said who="#Anne">“ It was n't so hard as you might imagine , either . I sit with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. Our seat is right by the window and we can look down to the Lake of Shining Waters . There are a lot of nice girls in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime . It 's so nice to have a lot of little girls to play with . But of course I like<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>best and always will . I ADORE<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. I 'm dreadfully far behind the others . They 're all in the fifth book and I 'm only in the fourth . I feel that it 's kind of a disgrace . But there 's not one of them has such an imagination as I have and I soon found that out . We had reading and geography and Canadian history and dictation today .<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>said my spelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could see it , all marked over . I felt so mortified ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>; he might have been politer to a stranger , I think .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>gave me an apple and Sophia<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Sloane</persName>lent me a lovely pink card with ‘ May I see you home ? ’ on it . I 'm to give it back to her tomorrow . And Tillie Boulter let me wear her bead ring all the afternoon . Can I have some of those pearl beads off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring ? And oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>,<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>told me that<persName>Minnie</persName>MacPherson told her that she heard<persName>Prissy Andrews</persName>tell Sara<persName>Gillis</persName>that I had a very pretty nose .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, that is the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you can n't imagine what a strange feeling it gave me .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, have I really a pretty nose ? I know you 'll tell me the truth . ”</said></p>
    <p n="672"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Your nose is well enough , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>shortly . Secretly she thought<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s nose was a remarkable pretty one ; but she had no intention of telling her so .</p>
    <p n="673">That was three weeks ago and all had gone smoothly so far . And now , this crisp September morning ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>were tripping blithely down<persName>the Birch Path</persName>, two of the happiest little girls in Avonlea .</p>
    <p n="674"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I guess<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>will be in school today , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ He 's been visiting his cousins over in New Brunswick all summer and he only came home Saturday night . He 's AW'FLY handsome ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. And he teases the girls something terrible . He just torments our lives out . ”</said></p>
    <p n="675"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s voice indicated that she rather liked having her life tormented out than not .</p>
    <p n="676"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Is n't his name that 's written up on the porch wall with<persName>Julia Bell</persName>'s and a big ‘ Take Notice ’ over them ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="677"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, tossing her head ,<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ but I 'm sure he does n't like<persName>Julia Bell</persName>so very much . I 've heard him say he studied the multiplication table by her freckles . ”</said></p>
    <p n="678"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , do n't speak about freckles to me , ”</said>implored<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ It is n't delicate when I 've got so many . But I do think that writing take-notices up on the wall about the boys and girls is the silliest ever . I should just like to see anybody dare to write my name up with a boy 's . Not , of course , ”</said>she hastened to add ,<said who="#Anne">“ that anybody would . ”</said></p>
    <p n="679"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sighed . She did n't want her name written up . But it was a little humiliating to know that there was no danger of it .</p>
    <p n="680"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Nonsense , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, whose black eyes and glossy tresses had played such havoc with the hearts of Avonlea schoolboys that her name figured on the porch walls in half a dozen take-notices .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It 's only meant as a joke . And do n't you be too sure your name wo n't ever be written up .<persName>Charlie Sloane</persName>is DEAD GONE on you . He told his mother — his MOTHER , mind you — that you were the smartest girl in school . That 's better than being good looking . ”</said></p>
    <p n="681"><said who="#Anne">“ No , it is n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, feminine to the core .<said who="#Anne">“ I 'd rather be pretty than clever . And I hate<persName>Charlie Sloane</persName>, I can n't bear a boy with goggle eyes . If anyone wrote my name up with his I 'd never GET over it ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana Barry</persName>. But it IS nice to keep head of your class . ”</said></p>
    <p n="682"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ You 'll have<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>in your class after this , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>,<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ and he 's used to being head of his class , I can tell you . He 's only in the fourth book although he 's nearly fourteen . Four years ago his father was sick and had to go out to Alberta for his health and<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>went with him . They were there three years and<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gil</persName>did n't go to school hardly any until they came back . You wo n't find it so easy to keep head after this ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="683"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm glad , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>quickly .<said who="#Anne">“ I could n't really feel proud of keeping head of little boys and girls of just nine or ten . I got up yesterday spelling ‘ ebullition . ’<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>was head and , mind you , she peeped in her book .<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>did n't see her — he was looking at<persName>Prissy Andrews</persName>— but I did . I just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="684"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Those Pye girls are cheats all round , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>indignantly , as they climbed the fence of the main road .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Gertie Pye</persName>actually went and put her milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday . Did you ever ? I do n't speak to her now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="685">When<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>was in the back of the room hearing<persName>Prissy Andrews</persName>'s<persName corresp="#Latin">Latin</persName>,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>whispered to<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,</p>
    <p n="686"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ That 's<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>sitting right across the aisle from you ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. Just look at him and see if you do n't think he 's handsome . ”</said></p>
    <p n="687"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked accordingly . She had a good chance to do so , for the said<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid of<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>, who sat in front of him , to the back of her seat . He was a tall boy , with curly brown hair , roguish hazel eyes , and a mouth twisted into a teasing smile . Presently<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>started up to take a sum to the master ; she fell back into her seat with a little shriek , believing that her hair was pulled out by the roots . Everybody looked at her and<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>glared so sternly that<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>began to cry .<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>had whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the soberest face in the world ; but when the commotion subsided he looked at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and winked with inexpressible drollery .</p>
    <p n="688"><said who="#Anne">“ I think your<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>IS handsome , ”</said>confided<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>to<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>,<said who="#Anne">“ but I think he 's very bold . It is n't good manners to wink at a strange girl . ”</said></p>
    <p n="689">But it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen .</p>
    <p n="690"><persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to<persName>Prissy Andrews</persName>and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as they pleased eating green apples , whispering , drawing pictures on their slates , and driving crickets harnessed to strings , up and down aisle .<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>was trying to make<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>look at him and failing utterly , because<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was at that moment totally oblivious not only to the very existence of<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>, but of every other scholar in Avonlea school itself . With her chin propped on her hands and her eyes fixed on the blue glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that the west window afforded , she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and seeing nothing save her own wonderful visions .</p>
    <p n="691"><persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>was n't used to putting himself out to make a girl look at him and meeting with failure . She SHOULD look at him , that red-haired<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Shirley</persName>girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that were n't like the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school .</p>
    <p n="692"><persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>reached across the aisle , picked up the end of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s long red braid , held it out at arm 's length and said in a piercing whisper :</p>
    <p n="693"><said who="#Anne">“ Carrots ! Carrots ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="694">Then<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked at him with a vengeance !</p>
    <p n="695">She did more than look . She sprang to her feet , her bright fancies fallen into cureless ruin . She flashed one indignant glance at<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>from eyes whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry tears .</p>
    <p n="696"><said who="#Anne">“ You mean , hateful boy ! ”</said>she exclaimed passionately .<said who="#Anne">“ How dare you ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="697">And then — thwack !<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had brought her slate down on<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>'s head and cracked it — slate not head — clear across .</p>
    <p n="698">Avonlea school always enjoyed a scene . This was an especially enjoyable one . Everybody said “ Oh ” in horrified delight .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>gasped .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>, who was inclined to be hysterical , began to cry . Tommy<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Sloane</persName>let his team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared open-mouthed at the tableau .</p>
    <p n="699"><persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s shoulder .</p>
    <p n="700"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, what does this mean ? ”</said>he said angrily .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>returned no answer . It was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell before the whole school that she had been called “ carrots . ”<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>it was who spoke up stoutly .</p>
    <p n="701"><said who="#Anne_Shirley">“ It was my fault<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>. I teased her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="702"><persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>paid no heed to<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>.</p>
    <p n="703"><said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“ I am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such a vindictive spirit , ”</said>he said in a solemn tone , as if the mere fact of being a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts of small imperfect mortals .<said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, go and stand on the platform in front of the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="704"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under which her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash . With a white , set face she obeyed .<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>took a chalk crayon and wrote on the blackboard above her head .</p>
    <p n="705"><said who="#Mr._Phillips">“ Ann<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Shirley</persName>has a very bad temper . Ann<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Shirley</persName>must learn to control her temper , ”</said>and then read it out loud so that even the primer class , who could n't read writing , should understand it .</p>
    <p n="706"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her . She did not cry or hang her head . Anger was still too hot in her heart for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation . With resentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s sympathetic gaze and<persName>Charlie Sloane</persName>'s indignant nods and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>'s malicious smiles . As for<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>, she would not even look at him . She would NEVER look at him again ! She would never speak to him ! !</p>
    <p n="707">When school was dismissed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>marched out with her red head held high .<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>tried to intercept her at the porch door .</p>
    <p n="708"><said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“ I 'm awfully sorry I made fun of your hair ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>he whispered contritely .<said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“ Honest I am . Do n't be mad for keeps , now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="709"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>swept by disdainfully , without look or sign of hearing .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Oh how could you ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said>breathed<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>as they went down the road half reproachfully , half admiringly .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>felt that SHE could never have resisted<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>'s plea .</p>
    <p n="710"><said who="#Anne">“ I shall never forgive<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>firmly .<said who="#Anne">“ And<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>spelled my name without an e , too . The iron has entered into my soul ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="711"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>had n't the least idea what<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>meant but she understood it was something terrible .</p>
    <p n="712"><said who="#Anne">“ You must n't mind<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>making fun of your hair , ”</said>she said soothingly .<said who="#Anne">“ Why , he makes fun of all the girls . He laughs at mine because it 's so black . He 's called me a crow a dozen times ; and I never heard him apologize for anything before , either . ”</said></p>
    <p n="713"><said who="#Anne">“ There 's a great deal of difference between being called a crow and being called carrots , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>with dignity .<said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>has hurt my feelings EXCRUCIATINGLY ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="714">It is possible the matter might have blown over without more excruciation if nothing else had happened . But when things begin to happen they are apt to keep on .</p>
    <p n="715">Avonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in<persName>Mr. Bell</persName>'s spruce grove over the hill and across his big pasture field . From there they could keep an eye on Eben Wright 's house , where the master boarded . When they saw<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse ; but the distance being about three times longer than Mr. Wright 's lane they were very apt to arrive there , breathless and gasping , some three minutes too late .</p>
    <p n="716">On the following day<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>was seized with one of his spasmodic fits of reform and announced before going home to dinner , that he should expect to find all the scholars in their seats when he returned . Anyone who came in late would be punished .</p>
    <p n="717">All the boys and some of the girls went to<persName>Mr. Bell</persName>'s spruce grove as usual , fully intending to stay only long enough to “ pick a chew . ” But spruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling ; they picked and loitered and strayed ; and as usual the first thing that recalled them to a sense of the flight of time was Jimmy Glover shouting from the top of a patriarchal old spruce “ Master 's coming . ”</p>
    <p n="718">The girls who were on the ground , started first and managed to reach the schoolhouse in time but without a second to spare . The boys , who had to wriggle hastily down from the trees , were later ; and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, who had not been picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the grove , waist deep among the bracken , singing softly to herself , with a wreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity of the shadowy places , was latest of all .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>could run like a deer , however ; run she did with the impish result that she overtook the boys at the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>was in the act of hanging up his hat .</p>
    <p n="719"><persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>'s brief reforming energy was over ; he did n't want the bother of punishing a dozen pupils ; but it was necessary to do something to save his word , so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it in<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, who had dropped into her seat , gasping for breath , with a forgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a particularly rakish and disheveled appearance .</p>
    <p n="720"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, since you seem to be so fond of the boys ’ company we shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon , ”</said>he said sarcastically .<said who="#Anne">“ Take those flowers out of your hair and sit with<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="721">The other boys snickered .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, turning pale with pity , plucked the wreath from<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s hair and squeezed her hand .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>stared at the master as if turned to stone .</p>
    <p n="722"><said who="#Mr._Phillips">“ Did you hear what I said ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said>queried<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>sternly .</p>
    <p n="723"><said who="#Anne">“ Yes , sir , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>slowly “ but I did n't suppose you really meant it . ”</p>
    <p n="724"><said who="#Anne">“ I assure you I did ”</said>— still with the sarcastic inflection which all the children , and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>especially , hated . It flicked on the raw .<said who="#Anne">“ Obey me at once . ”</said></p>
    <p n="725">For a moment<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked as if she meant to disobey . Then , realizing that there was no help for it , she rose haughtily , stepped across the aisle , sat down beside<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>, and buried her face in her arms on the desk .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>, who got a glimpse of it as it went down , told the others going home from school that she 'd “ acksually never seen anything like it — it was so white , with awful little red spots in it . ”</p>
    <p n="726">To<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, this was as the end of all things . It was bad enough to be singled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones ; it was worse still to be sent to sit with a boy , but that that boy should be<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly unbearable .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt that she could not bear it and it would be of no use to try . Her whole being seethed with shame and anger and humiliation .</p>
    <p n="727">At first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged . But as<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>never lifted her head and as<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>worked fractions as if his whole soul was absorbed in them and them only , they soon returned to their own tasks and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was forgotten . When<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>called the history class out<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>should have gone , but<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>did not move , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>, who had been writing some verses “ To Priscilla ” before he called the class , was thinking about an obstinate rhyme still and never missed her . Once , when nobody was looking ,<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>took from his desk a little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it , “ You are sweet , ” and slipped it under the curve of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s arm . Whereupon<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>arose , took the pink heart gingerly between the tips of her fingers , dropped it on the floor , ground it to powder beneath her heel , and resumed her position without deigning to bestow a glance on<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>.</p>
    <p n="728">When school went out<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>marched to her desk , ostentatiously took out everything therein , books and writing tablet , pen and ink , testament and arithmetic , and piled them neatly on her cracked slate .</p>
    <p n="729"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ What are you taking all those things home for ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>wanted to know , as soon as they were out on the road . She had not dared to ask the question before .</p>
    <p n="730"><said who="#Anne">“ I am not coming back to school any more , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>gasped and stared at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>to see if she meant it .</p>
    <p n="731"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Will<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>let you stay home ? ”</said>she asked .</p>
    <p n="732"><said who="#Anne">“ She 'll have to , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I 'll NEVER go to school to that man again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="733"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>! ”</said><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>looked as if she were ready to cry .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I do think you 're mean . What shall I do ?<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>will make me sit with that horrid<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Gertie Pye</persName>— I know he will because she is sitting alone . Do come back ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="734"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'd do almost anything in the world for you ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sadly .<said who="#Anne">“ I 'd let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good . But I can n't do this , so please do n't ask it . You harrow up my very soul . ”</said></p>
    <p n="735"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Just think of all the fun you will miss , ”</said>mourned<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ We are going to build the loveliest new house down by the brook ; and we 'll be playing ball next week and you 've never played ball ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. It 's tremendously exciting . And we 're going to learn a new song —<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>is practicing it up now ; and Alice<persName>Andrews</persName>is going to bring a new Pansy book next week and we 're all going to read it out loud , chapter about , down by the brook . And you know you are so fond of reading out loud ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="736">Nothing moved<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>in the least . Her mind was made up . She would not go to school to<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>again ; she told<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>so when she got home .</p>
    <p n="737"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Nonsense , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="738"><said who="#Anne">“ It is n't nonsense at all , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, gazing at<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>with solemn , reproachful eyes .<said who="#Anne">“ Do n't you understand ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? I 've been insulted . ”</said></p>
    <p n="739"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Insulted fiddlesticks ! You 'll go to school tomorrow as usual . ”</said></p>
    <p n="740"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , no . ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>shook her head gently .<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm not going back ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I 'll learn my lessons at home and I 'll be as good as I can be and hold my tongue all the time if it 's possible at all . But I will not go back to school , I assure you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="741"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking out of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s small face . She understood that she would have trouble in overcoming it ; but she re-solved wisely to say nothing more just then .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'll run down and see<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>about it this evening , ”</said>she thought .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ There 's no use reasoning with<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>now . She 's too worked up and I 've an idea she can be awful stubborn if she takes the notion . Far as I can make out from her story ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>has been carrying matters with a rather high hand . But it would never do to say so to her . I 'll just talk it over with<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>. She 's sent ten children to school and she ought to know something about it . She 'll have heard the whole story , too , by this time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="742"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>found<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>knitting quilts as industriously and cheerfully as usual .</p>
    <p n="743"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I suppose you know what I 've come about , ”</said>she said , a little shamefacedly .</p>
    <p n="744"><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>nodded .</p>
    <p n="745"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ About<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s fuss in school , I reckon , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Tillie Boulter was in on her way home from school and told me about it . ”</said>“ I do n't know what to do with her , ” said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ She declares she wo n't go back to school . I never saw a child so worked up . I 've been expecting trouble ever since she started to school . I knew things were going too smooth to last . She 's so high strung . What would you advise ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="746"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Well , since you 've asked my advice ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>amiably —<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>dearly loved to be asked for advice —<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I 'd just humor her a little at first , that 's what I 'd do . It 's my belief that<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>was in the wrong . Of course , it does n't do to say so to the children , you know . And of course he did right to punish her yesterday for giving way to temper . But today it was different . The others who were late should have been punished as well as<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, that 's what . And I do n't believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment . It is n't modest . Tillie Boulter was real indignant . She took<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s part right through and said all the scholars did too .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>seems real popular among them , somehow . I never thought she 'd take with them so well . ”</said></p>
    <p n="747"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Then you really think I 'd better let her stay home , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>in amazement .</p>
    <p n="748"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Yes . That is I would n't say school to her again until she said it herself . Depend upon it ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, she 'll cool off in a week or so and be ready enough to go back of her own accord , that 's what , while , if you were to make her go back right off , dear knows what freak or tantrum she 'd take next and make more trouble than ever . The less fuss made the better , in my opinion . She wo n't miss much by not going to school , as far as THAT goes .<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>is n't any good at all as a teacher . The order he keeps is scandalous , that 's what , and he neglects the young fry and puts all his time on those big scholars he 's getting ready for<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s . He 'd never have got the school for another year if his uncle had n't been a trustee — THE trustee , for he just leads the other two around by the nose , that 's what . I declare , I do n't know what education in this Island is coming to . ”</said></p>
    <p n="749"><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>shook her head , as much as to say if she were only at the head of the educational system of the Province things would be much better managed .</p>
    <p n="750"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>took<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>'s advice and not another word was said to<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>about going back to school . She learned her lessons at home , did her chores , and played with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>in the chilly purple autumn twilights ; but when she met<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>on the road or encountered him in Sunday school she passed him by with an icy contempt that was no whit thawed by his evident desire to appease her . Even<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s efforts as a peacemaker were of no avail .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had evidently made up her mind to hate<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>to the end of life .</p>
    <p n="751">As much as she hated<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>, however , did she love<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, with all the love of her passionate little heart , equally intense in its likes and dislikes . One evening<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, coming in from the orchard with a basket of apples , found<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sitting along by the east window in the twilight , crying bitterly .</p>
    <p n="752"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Whatever 's the matter now ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said>she asked .</p>
    <p n="753"><said who="#Anne">“ It 's about<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, ”</said>sobbed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>luxuriously .<said who="#Anne">“ I love<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>so ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I cannot ever live without her . But I know very well when we grow up that<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>will get married and go away and leave me . And oh , what shall I do ? I hate her husband — I just hate him furiously . I 've been imagining it all out — the wedding and everything —<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>dressed in snowy garments , with a veil , and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen ; and me the bridesmaid , with a lovely dress too , and puffed sleeves , but with a breaking heart hid beneath my smiling face . And then bidding<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>goodbye-e-e — ”</said>Here<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>broke down entirely and wept with increasing bitterness .</p>
    <p n="754"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>turned quickly away to hide her twitching face ; but it was no use ; she collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and unusual peal of laughter that<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, crossing the yard outside , halted in amazement . When had he heard<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>laugh like that before ?</p>
    <p n="755"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>as soon as she could speak ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ if you must borrow trouble , for pity 's sake borrow it handier home . I should think you had an imagination , sure enough . ”</said></p>

    <p n="756">OCTOBER was a beautiful month at Green Gables , when the birches in the hollow turned as golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson and the wild cherry trees along the lane put on the loveliest shades of dark red and bronzy green , while the fields sunned themselves in aftermaths .</p>
    <p n="757"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>reveled in the world of color about her .</p>
    <p n="758"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>she exclaimed one Saturday morning , coming dancing in with her arms full of gorgeous boughs ,<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers . It would be terrible if we just skipped from September to November , would n't it ? Look at these maple branches . Do n't they give you a thrill — several thrills ? I 'm going to decorate my room with them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="759"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Messy things , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably developed .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors stuff ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. Bedrooms were made to sleep in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="760"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , and dream in too ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. And you know one can dream so much better in a room where there are pretty things . I 'm going to put these boughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table . ”</said></p>
    <p n="761"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Mind you do n't drop leaves all over the stairs then . I 'm going on a meeting of the Aid Society at Carmody this afternoon ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, and I wo n't likely be home before dark . You 'll have to get<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and Jerry their supper , so mind you do n't forget to put the tea to draw until you sit down at the table as you did last time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="762"><said who="#Anne">“ It was dreadful of me to forget , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>apologetically ,<said who="#Anne">“ but that was the afternoon I was trying to think of a name for<persName>Violet Vale</persName>and it crowded other things out .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was so good . He never scolded a bit . He put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as not . And I told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting , so he did n't find the time long at all . It was a beautiful fairy story ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I forgot the end of it , so I made up an end for it myself and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>said he could n't tell where the join came in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="763"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>would think it all right ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, if you took a notion to get up and have dinner in the middle of the night .

And — I do n't really know if I 'm doing right — it may make you more addlepated than ever — but you can ask<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>to come over and spend the afternoon with you and have tea here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="764"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>! ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>clasped her hands .<said who="#Anne">“ How perfectly lovely ! You ARE able to imagine things after all or else you 'd never have understood how I 've longed for that very thing . It will seem so nice and grown-uppish . No fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when I have company . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, can I use the rosebud spray tea set ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="765"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No , indeed ! The rosebud tea set ! Well , what next ? You know I never use that except for the minister or the Aids . You 'll put down the old brown tea set . But you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves . It 's time it was being used anyhow — I believe it 's beginning to work . And you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and snaps . ”</said></p>
    <p n="766"><said who="#Anne">“ I can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and pouring out the tea , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, shutting her eyes ecstatically .<said who="#Anne">“ And asking<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>if she takes sugar !

Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, it 's a wonderful sensation just to think of it . Can I take her into the spare room to lay off her hat when she comes ? And then into the parlor to sit ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="767"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No . The sitting room will do for you and your company . But there 's a bottle half full of raspberry cordial that was left over from the church social the other night .

    <p n="768"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>flew down to the hollow , past the Dryad 's Bubble and up the spruce path to Orchard Slope , to ask<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>to tea . As a result just after<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had driven off to Carmody ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>came over , dressed in HER second-best dress and looking exactly as it is proper to look when asked out to tea . At other times she was wont to run into the kitchen without knocking ; but now she knocked primly at the front door . And when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, dressed in her second best , as primly opened it , both little girls shook hands as gravely as if they had never met before . This unnatural solemnity lasted until after<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>had been taken to the east gable to lay off her hat and then had sat for ten minutes in the sitting room , toes in position .</p>
    <p n="769"><said who="#Anne">“ How is your mother ? ”</said>inquired<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>politely , just as if she had not seen<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>picking apples that morning in excellent health and spirits .</p>
    <p n="770"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ She is very well , thank you . I suppose<persName corresp="#Mr._Cuthbert">Mr. Cuthbert</persName>is hauling potatoes to the LILY SANDS this afternoon , is he ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, who had ridden down to Mr. Harmon<persName>Andrews</persName>'s that morning in<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s cart .</p>
    <p n="771"><said who="#Anne">“ Yes . Our potato crop is very good this year . I hope your father 's crop is good too . ”</said></p>
    <p n="772"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It is fairly good , thank you . Have you picked many of your apples yet ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="773"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , ever so many , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>forgetting to be dignified and jumping up quickly .<said who="#Anne">“ Let 's go out to the orchard and get some of the Red Sweetings ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>says we can have all that are left on the tree .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>is a very generous woman . She said we could have fruit cake and cherry preserves for tea . But it is n't good manners to tell your company what you are going to give them to eat , so I wo n't tell you what she said we could have to drink . Only it begins with an R and a C and it 's bright red color . I love bright red drinks , do n't you ? They taste twice as good as any other color . ”</said></p>
    <p n="774">The orchard , with its great sweeping boughs that bent to the ground with fruit , proved so delightful that the little girls spent most of the afternoon in it , sitting in a grassy corner where the frost had spared the green and the mellow autumn sunshine lingered warmly , eating apples and talking as hard as they could .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>had much to tell<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>of what went on in school . She had to sit with<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Gertie Pye</persName>and she hated it ; Gertie squeaked her pencil all the time and it just made her —<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s — blood run cold ;<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>had charmed all her warts away , true 's you live , with a magic pebble that old<persName>Mary Joe</persName>from the Creek gave her . You had to rub the warts with the pebble and then throw it away over your left shoulder at the time of the new moon and the warts would all go .<persName>Charlie Sloane</persName>'s name was written up with Em White 's on the porch wall and Em White was AWFUL MAD about it ; Sam Boulter had “ sassed ”<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>in class and<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>whipped him and Sam 's father came down to the school and dared<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>to lay a hand on one of his children again ; and Mattie<persName>Andrews</persName>had a new red hood and a blue crossover with tassels on it and the airs she put on about it were perfectly sickening ; and Lizzie Wright did n't speak to Mamie Wilson because Mamie Wilson 's grown-up sister had cut out Lizzie Wright 's grown-up sister with her beau ; and everybody missed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>so and wished she 's come to school again ; and<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>—</p>
    <p n="775">But<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>did n't want to hear about<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>. She jumped up hurriedly and said suppose they go in and have some raspberry cordial .</p>
    <p n="776"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked on the second shelf of the room pantry but there was no bottle of raspberry cordial there . Search revealed it away back on the top shelf .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>put it on a tray and set it on the table with a tumbler .</p>
    <p n="777"><said who="#Anne">“ Now , please help yourself ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, ”</said>she said politely .<said who="#Anne">“ I do n't believe I 'll have any just now . I do n't feel as if I wanted any after all those apples . ”</said></p>
    <p n="778"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>poured herself out a tumblerful , looked at its bright-red hue admiringly , and then sipped it daintily .</p>
    <p n="779"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ That 's awfully nice raspberry cordial ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>she said .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I did n't know raspberry cordial was so nice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="780"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm real glad you like it . Take as much as you want . I 'm going to run out and stir the fire up . There are so many responsibilities on a person 's mind when they 're keeping house , is n't there ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="781">When<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>came back from the kitchen<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>was drinking her second glassful of cordial ; and , being entreated thereto by<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, she offered no particular objection to the drinking of a third . The tumblerfuls were generous ones and the raspberry cordial was certainly very nice .</p>
    <p n="782"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ The nicest I ever drank , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It 's ever so much nicer than<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>'s , although she brags of hers so much . It does n't taste a bit like hers . ”</said></p>
    <p n="783"><said who="#Anne">“ I should think<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s raspberry cordial would prob'ly be much nicer than<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>'s , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>loyally .<said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>is a famous cook . She is trying to teach me to cook but I assure you ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, it is uphill work . There 's so little scope for imagination in cookery . You just have to go by rules . The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in . I was thinking the loveliest story about you and me ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. I thought you were desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you , but I went boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life ; and then I took the smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the graveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with your tears ; and you never , never forgot the friend of your youth who sacrificed her life for you . Oh , it was such a pathetic tale ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. The tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake . But I forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure . Flour is so essential to cakes , you know .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was very cross and I do n't wonder . I 'm a great trial to her . She was terribly mortified about the pudding sauce last week . We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there was half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>said there was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry shelf and cover it . I meant to cover it just as much as could be ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, but when I carried it in I was imagining I was a nun — of course I 'm a Protestant but I imagined I was a Catholic — taking the veil to bury a broken heart in cloistered seclusion ; and I forgot all about covering the pudding sauce . I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce ! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was out milking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if I 'd give the sauce to the pigs ; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow , whichever they wanted to be , so I never thought about the pudding sauce again and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sent me out to pick apples . Well , Mr. and Mrs. Chester Ross from Spencervale came here that morning . You know they are very stylish people , especially Mrs. Chester Ross . When<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>called me in dinner was all ready and everybody was at the table . I tried to be as polite and dignified as I could be , for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to think I was a ladylike little girl even if I was n't pretty . Everything went right until I saw<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>coming with the plum pudding in one hand and the pitcher of pudding sauce WARMED UP , in the other .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, that was a terrible moment . I remembered everything and I just stood up in my place and shrieked out ‘<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, you must n't use that pudding sauce . There was a mouse drowned in it . I forgot to tell you before . ’ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred . Mrs. Chester Ross just LOOKED at me and I thought I would sink through the floor with mortification . She is such a perfect housekeeper and fancy what she must have thought of us .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>turned red as fire but she never said a word — then . She just carried that sauce and pudding out and brought in some strawberry preserves . She even offered me some , but I could n't swallow a mouthful . It was like heaping coals of fire on my head . After Mrs. Chester Ross went away ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>gave me a dreadful scolding . Why ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, what is the matter ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="784"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>had stood up very unsteadily ; then she sat down again , putting her hands to her head .</p>
    <p n="785"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I 'm — I 'm awful sick , ”</said>she said , a little thickly .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I — I — must go right home . ”</said></p>
    <p n="786"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , you must n't dream of going home without your tea , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>in distress .<said who="#Anne">“ I 'll get it right off — I 'll go and put the tea down this very minute . ”</said></p>
    <p n="787"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I must go home , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, stupidly but determinedly .</p>
    <p n="788"><said who="#Anne">“ Let me get you a lunch anyhow , ”</said>implored<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Let me give you a bit of fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves . Lie down on the sofa for a little while and you 'll be better . Where do you feel bad ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="789"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I must go home , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, and that was all she would say . In vain<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>pleaded .</p>
    <p n="790"><said who="#Anne">“ I never heard of company going home without tea , ”</said>she mourned .<said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, do you suppose that it 's possible you 're really taking the smallpox ? If you are I 'll go and nurse you , you can depend on that . I 'll never forsake you . But I do wish you 'd stay till after tea . Where do you feel bad ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="791"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I 'm awful dizzy , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.</p>
    <p n="792">And indeed , she walked very dizzily .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, with tears of disappointment in her eyes , got<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s hat and went with her as far as the<persName>Barry</persName>yard fence . Then she wept all the way back to Green Gables , where she sorrowfully put the remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the pantry and got tea ready for<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and Jerry , with all the zest gone out of the performance .</p>
    <p n="793">The next day was Sunday and as the rain poured down in torrents from dawn till dusk<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>did not stir abroad from Green Gables . Monday afternoon<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sent her down to<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>'s on an errand . In a very short space of time<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>came flying back up the lane with tears rolling down her cheeks . Into the kitchen she dashed and flung herself face downward on the sofa in an agony .</p>
    <p n="794"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Whatever has gone wrong now ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said>queried<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>in doubt and dismay .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do hope you have n't gone and been saucy to<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="795">No answer from<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>save more tears and stormier sobs !</p>
    <p n="796"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, when I ask you a question I want to be answered . Sit right up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about . ”</said></p>
    <p n="797"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sat up , tragedy personified .</p>
    <p n="798"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>was up to see<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>today and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>was in an awful state , ”</said>she wailed .<said who="#Anne">“ She says that I set<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>DRUNK Saturday and sent her home in a disgraceful condition . And she says I must be a thoroughly bad , wicked little girl and she 's never , never going to let<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>play with me again . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I 'm just overcome with woe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="799"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>stared in blank amazement .</p>
    <p n="800"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Set<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>drunk ! ”</said>she said when she found her voice .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>are you or<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>crazy ? What on earth did you give her ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="801"><said who="#Anne">“ Not a thing but raspberry cordial , ”</said>sobbed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I never thought raspberry cordial would set people drunk ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>— not even if they drank three big tumblerfuls as<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>did . Oh , it sounds so — so — like<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>'s husband ! But I did n't mean to set her drunk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="802"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Drunk fiddlesticks ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, marching to the sitting room pantry . There on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one containing some of her three-year-old homemade currant wine for which she was celebrated in Avonlea , although certain of the stricter sort ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>among them , disapproved strongly of it . And at the same time<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>recollected that she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial down in the cellar instead of in the pantry as she had told<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="803">She went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand . Her face was twitching in spite of herself .</p>
    <p n="804"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble . You went and gave<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>currant wine instead of raspberry cordial . Did n't you know the difference yourself ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="805"><said who="#Anne">“ I never tasted it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I thought it was the cordial . I meant to be so — so — hospitable .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>got awfully sick and had to go home .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>told<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>she was simply dead drunk . She just laughed silly-like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to sleep and slept for hours . Her mother smelled her breath and knew she was drunk . She had a fearful headache all day yesterday .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>is so indignant . She will never believe but what I did it on purpose . ”</said></p>
    <p n="806"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I should think she would better punish<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>for being so greedy as to drink three glassfuls of anything , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>shortly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Why , three of those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been cordial . Well , this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are so down on me for making currant wine , although I have n't made any for three years ever since I found out that the minister did n't approve . I just kept that bottle for sickness . There , there , child , do n't cry . I can n't see as you were to blame although I 'm sorry it happened so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="807"><said who="#Anne">“ I must cry , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ My heart is broken . The stars in their courses fight against me ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I are parted forever . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of friendship . ”</said></p>
    <p n="808"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Do n't be foolish ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>will think better of it when she finds you 're not to blame . I suppose she thinks you 've done it for a silly joke or something of that sort . You 'd best go up this evening and tell her how it was . ”</said></p>
    <p n="809"><said who="#Anne">“ My courage fails me at the thought of facing<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s injured mother , ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I wish you 'd go ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. You 're so much more dignified than I am . Likely she 'd listen to you quicker than to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="810"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , I will , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, reflecting that it would probably be the wiser course .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Do n't cry any more ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. It will be all right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="811"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had changed her mind about it being all right by the time she got back from Orchard Slope .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was watching for her coming and flew to the porch door to meet her .</p>
    <p n="812"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I know by your face that it 's been no use , ”</said>she said sorrowfully .<said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>wo n't forgive me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="813"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>indeed ! ”</said>snapped<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Of all the unreasonable women I ever saw she 's the worst . I told her it was all a mistake and you were n't to blame , but she just simply did n't believe me . And she rubbed it well in about my currant wine and how I 'd always said it could n't have the least effect on anybody . I just told her plainly that currant wine was n't meant to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a time and that if a child I had to do with was so greedy I 'd sober her up with a right good spanking . ”</said></p>
    <p n="814"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>whisked into the kitchen , grievously disturbed , leaving a very much distracted little soul in the porch behind her . Presently<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>stepped out bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk ; very determinedly and steadily she took her way down through the sere clover field over the log bridge and up through the spruce grove , lighted by a pale little moon hanging low over the western woods .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>, coming to the door in answer to a timid knock , found a white-lipped eager-eyed suppliant on the doorstep .</p>
    <p n="815">Her face hardened .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>was a woman of strong prejudices and dislikes , and her anger was of the cold , sullen sort which is always hardest to overcome . To do her justice , she really believed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had made<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>drunk out of sheer malice prepense , and she was honestly anxious to preserve her little daughter from the contamination of further intimacy with such a child .</p>
    <p n="816"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ What do you want ? ”</said>she said stiffly .</p>
    <p n="817"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>clasped her hands .</p>
    <p n="818"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>, please forgive me . I did not mean to — to — intoxicate<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. How could I ? Just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl that kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all the world . Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose ? I thought it was only raspberry cordial . I was firmly convinced it was raspberry cordial . Oh , please do n't say that you wo n't let<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>play with me any more . If you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="819">This speech which would have softened good<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>'s heart in a twinkling , had no effect on<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>except to irritate her still more . She was suspicious of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s big words and dramatic gestures and imagined that the child was making fun of her . So she said , coldly and cruelly :</p>
    <p n="820"><said who="#Anne">“ I do n't think you are a fit little girl for<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>to associate with . You 'd better go home and behave yourself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="821"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s lips quivered .</p>
    <p n="822"><said who="#Anne">“ Wo n't you let me see<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>just once to say farewell ? ”</said>she implored .</p>
    <p n="823"><said who="#Mrs._Barry">“<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>has gone over to Carmody with her father , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>, going in and shutting the door .</p>
    <p n="824"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>went back to Green Gables calm with despair .</p>
    <p n="825"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ My last hope is gone , ”</said>she told<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I went up and saw<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>myself and she treated me very insultingly .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I do NOT think she is a well-bred woman . There is nothing more to do except to pray and I have n't much hope that that 'll do much good because ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I do not believe that God Himself can do very much with such an obstinate person as<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="826">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, you should n't say such things ” rebuked<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, striving to overcome that unholy tendency to laughter which she was dismayed to find growing upon her . And indeed , when she told the whole story to<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>that night , she did laugh heartily over<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s tribulations .</p>
    <p n="827">But when she slipped into the east gable before going to bed and found that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had cried herself to sleep an unaccustomed softness crept into her face .</p>
    <p n="828"><said who="#Anne">“ Poor little soul , ”</said>she murmured , lifting a loose curl of hair from the child 's tear-stained face . Then she bent down and kissed the flushed cheek on the pillow .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="17">
    <p n="829">THE next afternoon<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, bending over her patchwork at the kitchen window , happened to glance out and beheld<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>down by the Dryad 's Bubble beckoning mysteriously . In a trice<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was out of the house and flying down to the hollow , astonishment and hope struggling in her expressive eyes . But the hope faded when she saw<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s dejected countenance .</p>
    <p n="830"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Your mother has n't relented ? ”</said>she gasped .</p>
    <p n="831"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>shook her head mournfully .</p>
    <p n="832"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ No ; and oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, she says I 'm never to play with you again . I 've cried and cried and I told her it was n't your fault , but it was n't any use . I had ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good-bye to you . She said I was only to stay ten minutes and she 's timing me by the clock . ”</said></p>
    <p n="833"><said who="#Anne">“ Ten minutes is n't very long to say an eternal farewell in , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>tearfully .<said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, will you promise faithfully never to forget me , the friend of your youth , no matter what dearer friends may caress thee ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="834"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Indeed I will , ”</said>sobbed<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>,<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ and I 'll never have another bosom friend — I do n't want to have . I could n't love anybody as I love you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="835"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, clasping her hands ,<said who="#Anne">“ do you LOVE me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="836"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Why , of course I do . Did n't you know that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="837"><said who="#Anne">“ No . ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>drew a long breath .<said who="#Anne">“ I thought you LIKED me of course but I never hoped you LOVED me . Why ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, I did n't think anybody could love me . Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember . Oh , this is wonderful ! It 's a ray of light which will forever shine on the darkness of a path severed from thee ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. Oh , just say it once again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="838"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I love you devotedly ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>stanchly ,<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ and I always will , you may be sure of that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="839"><said who="#Anne">“ And I will always love thee ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, solemnly extending her hand .<said who="#Anne">“ In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my lonely life , as that last story we read together says .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, wilt thou give me a lock of thy jet-black tresses in parting to treasure forevermore ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="840"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Have you got anything to cut it with ? ”</said>queried<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, wiping away the tears which<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s affecting accents had caused to flow afresh , and returning to practicalities .</p>
    <p n="841"><said who="#Anne">“ Yes . I 've got my patchwork scissors in my apron pocket fortunately , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. She solemnly clipped one of<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s curls .<said who="#Anne">“ Fare thee well , my beloved friend . Henceforth we must be as strangers though living side by side . But my heart will ever be faithful to thee . ”</said></p>
    <p n="842"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>stood and watched<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>out of sight , mournfully waving her hand to the latter whenever she turned to look back . Then she returned to the house , not a little consoled for the time being by this romantic parting .</p>
    <p n="843"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It is all over , ”</said>she informed<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I shall never have another friend . I 'm really worse off than ever before , for I have n't<persName>Katie Maurice</persName>and<persName>Violetta</persName>now . And even if I had it would n't be the same . Somehow , little dream girls are not satisfying after a real friend .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I had such an affecting farewell down by the spring . It will be sacred in my memory forever . I used the most pathetic language I could think of and said ‘ thou ’ and ‘ thee . ’ ‘ Thou ’ and ‘ thee ’ seem so much more romantic than ‘ you . ’<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>gave me a lock of her hair and I 'm going to sew it up in a little bag and wear it around my neck all my life . Please see that it is buried with me , for I do n't believe I 'll live very long . Perhaps when she sees me lying cold and dead before her<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>may feel remorse for what she has done and will let<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>come to my funeral . ”</said></p>
    <p n="844"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't think there is much fear of your dying of grief as long as you can talk ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>unsympathetically .</p>
    <p n="845">The following Monday<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>surprised<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>by coming down from her room with her basket of books on her arm and hip and her lips primmed up into a line of determination .</p>
    <p n="846"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'm going back to school , ”</said>she announced .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ That is all there is left in life for me , now that my friend has been ruthlessly torn from me . In school I can look at her and muse over days departed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="847"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You 'd better muse over your lessons and sums , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, concealing her delight at this development of the situation .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ If you 're going back to school I hope we 'll hear no more of breaking slates over people 's heads and such carryings on . Behave yourself and do just what your teacher tells you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="848"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'll try to be a model pupil , ”</said>agreed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>dolefully .<said who="#Anne">“ There wo n't be much fun in it , I expect .<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>said<persName>Minnie Andrews</persName>was a model pupil and there is n't a spark of imagination or life in her . She is just dull and poky and never seems to have a good time . But I feel so depressed that perhaps it will come easy to me now . I 'm going round by the road . I could n't bear to go by<persName>the Birch Path</persName>all alone . I should weep bitter tears if I did . ”</said></p>
    <p n="849"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was welcomed back to school with open arms . Her imagination had been sorely missed in games , her voice in the singing and her dramatic ability in the perusal aloud of books at dinner hour .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>smuggled three blue plums over to her during testament reading ; Ella May MacPherson gave her an enormous yellow pansy cut from the covers of a floral catalogue — a species of desk decoration much prized in Avonlea school . Sophia<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Sloane</persName>offered to teach her a perfectly elegant new pattern of knit lace , so nice for trimming aprons . Katie Boulter gave her a perfume bottle to keep slate water in , and<persName>Julia Bell</persName>copied carefully on a piece of pale pink paper scalloped on the edges the following effusion :</p>
    <p n="850">When twilight drops her curtain down And pins it with a star Remember that you have a friend Though she may wander far .</p>
    <p n="851"><said who="#Anne">“ It 's so nice to be appreciated , ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>rapturously to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>that night .</p>
    <p n="852">The girls were not the only scholars who “ appreciated ” her . When<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>went to her seat after dinner hour — she had been told by<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>to sit with the model<persName>Minnie Andrews</persName>— she found on her desk a big luscious “ strawberry apple . ”<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>caught it up all ready to take a bite when she remembered that the only place in Avonlea where strawberry apples grew was in the old<persName>Blythe</persName>orchard on the other side of the Lake of Shining Waters .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>dropped the apple as if it were a red-hot coal and ostentatiously wiped her fingers on her handkerchief . The apple lay untouched on her desk until the next morning , when little Timothy<persName>Andrews</persName>, who swept the school and kindled the fire , annexed it as one of his perquisites .<persName>Charlie Sloane</persName>'s slate pencil , gorgeously bedizened with striped red and yellow paper , costing two cents where ordinary pencils cost only one , which he sent up to her after dinner hour , met with a more favorable reception .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was graciously pleased to accept it and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated youth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to make such fearful errors in his dictation that<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>kept him in after school to rewrite it .</p>
    <p n="853">But as ,</p>
    <p n="854">The Caesar 's pageant shorn of Brutus ’ bust Did but of Rome 's best son remind her more .</p>
    <p n="855">so the marked absence of any tribute or recognition from<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana Barry</persName>who was sitting with<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Gertie Pye</persName>embittered<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s little triumph .</p>
    <p n="856"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>might just have smiled at me once , I think , ”</said>she mourned to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>that night . But the next morning a note most fearfully and wonderfully twisted and folded , and a small parcel were passed across to<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="857">Dear<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>( ran the former )</p>
    <p n="858">Mother says I 'm not to play with you or talk to you even in school . It is n't my fault and do n't be cross at me , because I love you as much as ever . I miss you awfully to tell all my secrets to and I do n't like<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Gertie Pye</persName>one bit . I made you one of the new bookmarkers out of red tissue paper . They are awfully fashionable now and only three girls in school know how to make them . When you look at it remember</p>
    <p n="859">Your true friend</p>
    <p n="860"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana Barry</persName>.</p>
    <p n="861"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>read the note , kissed the bookmark , and dispatched a prompt reply back to the other side of the school .</p>
    <p n="862">My own darling<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>:—</p>
    <p n="863">Of course I am not cross at you because you have to obey your mother . Our spirits can commune . I shall keep your lovely present forever .<persName>Minnie Andrews</persName>is a very nice little girl — although she has no imagination — but after having been<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s busum friend I cannot be<persName>Minnie</persName>'s . Please excuse mistakes because my spelling is n't very good yet , although much improoved .</p>
    <p n="864">Yours until death us do part</p>
    <p n="865"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>or<persName>Cordelia</persName><persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Shirley</persName>.</p>
    <p n="866">P. S . I shall sleep with your letter under my pillow tonight . A . OR C. S .</p>
    <p n="867"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>pessimistically expected more trouble since<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had again begun to go to school . But none developed . Perhaps<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>caught something of the “ model ” spirit from<persName>Minnie Andrews</persName>; at least she got on very well with<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>thenceforth . She flung herself into her studies heart and soul , determined not to be outdone in any class by<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>. The rivalry between them was soon apparent ; it was entirely good natured on<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>'s side ; but it is much to be feared that the same thing cannot be said of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for holding grudges . She was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves . She would not stoop to admit that she meant to rival<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>in schoolwork , because that would have been to acknowledge his existence which<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>persistently ignored ; but the rivalry was there and honors fluctuated between them . Now<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>was head of the spelling class ; now<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, with a toss of her long red braids , spelled him down . One morning<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>had all his sums done correctly and had his name written on the blackboard on the roll of honor ; the next morning<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, having wrestled wildly with decimals the entire evening before , would be first . One awful day they were ties and their names were written up together . It was almost as bad as a take-notice and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s mortification was as evident as<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>'s satisfaction . When the written examinations at the end of each month were held the suspense was terrible . The first month<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>came out three marks ahead . The second<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>beat him by five . But her triumph was marred by the fact that<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>congratulated her heartily before the whole school . It would have been ever so much sweeter to her if he had felt the sting of his defeat .</p>
    <p n="868"><persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>might not be a very good teacher ; but a pupil so inflexibly determined on learning as<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was could hardly escape making progress under any kind of teacher . By the end of the term<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>were both promoted into the fifth class and allowed to begin studying the elements of “ the branches ” — by which<persName corresp="#Latin">Latin</persName>, geometry , French , and algebra were meant . In geometry<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>met her Waterloo .</p>
    <p n="869"><said who="#Anne">“ It 's perfectly awful stuff ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>she groaned .<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm sure I 'll never be able to make head or tail of it . There is no scope for imagination in it at all .<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>says I 'm the worst dunce he ever saw at it . And<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gil</persName>— I mean some of the others are so smart at it . It is extremely mortifying ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</said></p>
    <p n="870"><said who="#Latin">“ Even<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>gets along better than I do . But I do n't mind being beaten by<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. Even although we meet as strangers now I still love her with an INEXTINGUISHABLE love . It makes me very sad at times to think about her . But really ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, one can n't stay sad very long in such an interesting world , can one ? ”</said></p>

    <p n="871">ALL things great are wound up with all things little . At first glance it might not seem that the decision of a certain Canadian Premier to include Prince Edward Island in a political tour could have much or anything to do with the fortunes of little<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>at Green Gables . But it had .</p>
    <p n="872">It was a January the Premier came , to address his loyal supporters and such of his nonsupporters as chose to be present at the monster mass meeting held in Charlottetown . Most of the Avonlea people were on Premier 's side of politics ; hence on the night of the meeting nearly all the men and a goodly proportion of the women had gone to town thirty miles away .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel Lynde</persName>had gone too .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel Lynde</persName>was a red-hot politician and could n't have believed that the political rally could be carried through without her , although she was on the opposite side of politics . So she went to town and took her husband —<persName corresp="#Thomas">Thomas</persName>would be useful in looking after the horse — and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>with her .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had a sneaking interest in politics herself , and as she thought it might be her only chance to see a real live Premier , she promptly took it , leaving<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>to keep house until her return the following day .</p>
    <p n="873">Hence , while<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>were enjoying themselves hugely at the mass meeting ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had the cheerful kitchen at Green Gables all to themselves . A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned Waterloo stove and blue-white frost crystals were shining on the windowpanes .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>nodded over a FARMERS ’ ADVOCATE on the sofa and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>at the table studied her lessons with grim determination , despite sundry wistful glances at the clock shelf , where lay a new book that<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>had lent her that day .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>had assured her that it was warranted to produce any number of thrills , or words to that effect , and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s fingers tingled to reach out for it . But that would mean<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>'s triumph on the morrow .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>turned her back on the clock shelf and tried to imagine it was n't there .</p>
    <p n="874"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, did you ever study geometry when you went to school ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="875"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , no , I did n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, coming out of his doze with a start .</p>
    <p n="876"><said who="#Anne">“ I wish you had , ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne">“ because then you 'd be able to sympathize with me . You can n't sympathize properly if you 've never studied it . It is casting a cloud over my whole life . I 'm such a dunce at it ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="877"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I dunno , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>soothingly .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I guess you 're all right at anything .<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>told me last week in Blair 's store at Carmody that you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid progress . ‘ Rapid progress ’ was his very words . There 's them as runs down Teddy Phillips and says he ai n't much of a teacher , but I guess he 's all right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="878"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>would have thought anyone who praised<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was “ all right . ”</p>
    <p n="879"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm sure I 'd get on better with geometry if only he would n't change the letters , ”</said>complained<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I learn the proposition off by heart and then he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what are in the book and I get all mixed up . I do n't think a teacher should take such a mean advantage , do you ? We 're studying agriculture now and I 've found out at last what makes the roads red . It 's a great comfort . I wonder how<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>are enjoying themselves .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says Canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run at Ottawa and that it 's an awful warning to the electors . She says if women were allowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change . What way do you vote ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="880"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Conservative , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>promptly . To vote Conservative was part of<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s religion .</p>
    <p n="881"><said who="#Anne">“ Then I 'm Conservative too , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>decidedly .<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm glad because<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gil</persName>— because some of the boys in school are Grits . I guess<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>is a Grit too because<persName>Prissy Andrews</persName>'s father is one , and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>says that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girl 's mother in religion and her father in politics . Is that true ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="882"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I dunno , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.</p>

    <p n="884"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , no , I dunno 's I ever did , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, who had certainly never thought of such a thing in his whole existence .</p>
    <p n="885"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>reflected with her chin in her hands .</p>
    <p n="886"><said who="#Anne">“ It must be rather interesting , do n't you think ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>?<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>says when she grows up she 's going to have ever so many beaus on the string and have them all crazy about her ; but I think that would be too exciting . I 'd rather have just one in his right mind . But<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>knows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big sisters , and<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says the<persName>Gillis</persName>girls have gone off like hot cakes .<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>goes up to see<persName>Prissy Andrews</persName>nearly every evening . He says it is to help her with her lessons but Miranda<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Sloane</persName>is studying for<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s too , and I should think she needed help a lot more than<persName>Prissy</persName>because she 's ever so much stupider , but he never goes to help her in the evenings at all . There are a great many things in this world that I can n't understand very well ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="887"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I dunno as I comprehend them all myself , ”</said>acknowledged<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.</p>
    <p n="888"><said who="#Anne">“ Well , I suppose I must finish up my lessons . I wo n't allow myself to open that new book<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>lent me until I 'm through . But it 's a terrible temptation ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. Even when I turn my back on it I can see it there just as plain .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>said she cried herself sick over it . I love a book that makes me cry . But I think I 'll carry that book into the sitting room and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key . And you must NOT give it to me ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, until my lessons are done , not even if I implore you on my bended knees . It 's all very well to say resist temptation , but it 's ever so much easier to resist it if you can n't get the key . And then shall I run down the cellar and get some russets ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>? Would n't you like some russets ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="889"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I dunno but what I would , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, who never ate russets but knew<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s weakness for them .</p>
    <p n="890">Just as<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>emerged triumphantly from the cellar with her plateful of russets came the sound of flying footsteps on the icy board walk outside and the next moment the kitchen door was flung open and in rushed<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana Barry</persName>, white faced and breathless , with a shawl wrapped hastily around her head .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>promptly let go of her candle and plate in her surprise , and plate , candle , and apples crashed together down the cellar ladder and were found at the bottom embedded in melted grease , the next day , by<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, who gathered them up and thanked mercy the house had n't been set on fire .</p>
    <p n="891"><said who="#Anne">“ Whatever is the matter ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Has your mother relented at last ? ”</said></p>

    <p n="893"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, without a word , reached out for cap and coat , slipped past<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and away into the darkness of the yard .</p>
    <p n="894"><said who="#Anne">“ He 's gone to harness the sorrel mare to go to Carmody for the doctor , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, who was hurrying on hood and jacket .<said who="#Anne">“ I know it as well as if he 'd said so .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and I are such kindred spirits I can read his thoughts without words at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="895"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I do n't believe he 'll find the doctor at Carmody , ”</said>sobbed<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I know that Dr. Blair went to town and I guess Dr.<persName>Spencer</persName>would go too . Young<persName>Mary Joe</persName>never saw anybody with croup and<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>is away . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="896"><said who="#Anne">“ Do n't cry , Di , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>cheerily .<said who="#Anne">“ I know exactly what to do for croup . You forget that<persName>Mrs. Hammond</persName>had twins three times . When you look after three pairs of twins you naturally get a lot of experience . They all had croup regularly . Just wait till I get the ipecac bottle — you may n't have any at your house . Come on now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="897">The two little girls hastened out hand in hand and hurried through Lover 's Lane and across the crusted field beyond , for the snow was too deep to go by the shorter wood way .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, although sincerely sorry for<persName>Minnie</persName>May , was far from being insensible to the romance of the situation and to the sweetness of once more sharing that romance with a kindred spirit .</p>
    <p n="898">The night was clear and frosty , all ebony of shadow and silver of snowy slope ; big stars were shining over the silent fields ; here and there the dark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches and the wind whistling through them .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>thought it was truly delightful to go skimming through all this mystery and loveliness with your bosom friend who had been so long estranged .</p>
    <p n="899"><persName>Minnie</persName>May , aged three , was really very sick . She lay on the kitchen sofa feverish and restless , while her hoarse breathing could be heard all over the house . Young<persName>Mary Joe</persName>, a buxom , broad-faced French girl from the creek , whom<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>had engaged to stay with the children during her absence , was helpless and bewildered , quite incapable of thinking what to do , or doing it if she thought of it .</p>
    <p n="900"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>went to work with skill and promptness .</p>
    <p n="901"><said who="#Anne">“<persName>Minnie</persName>May has croup all right ; she 's pretty bad , but I 've seen them worse . First we must have lots of hot water . I declare ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, there is n't more than a cupful in the kettle ! There , I 've filled it up , and ,<persName>Mary Joe</persName>, you may put some wood in the stove . I do n't want to hurt your feelings but it seems to me you might have thought of this before if you 'd any imagination . Now , I 'll undress<persName>Minnie</persName>May and put her to bed and you try to find some soft flannel cloths ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. I 'm going to give her a dose of ipecac first of all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="902"><persName>Minnie</persName>May did not take kindly to the ipecac but<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had not brought up three pairs of twins for nothing . Down that ipecac went , not only once , but many times during the long , anxious night when the two little girls worked patiently over the suffering<persName>Minnie</persName>May , and Young<persName>Mary Joe</persName>, honestly anxious to do all she could , kept up a roaring fire and heated more water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies .</p>
    <p n="903">It was three o'clock when<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>came with a doctor , for he had been obliged to go all the way to Spencervale for one . But the pressing need for assistance was past .<persName>Minnie</persName>May was much better and was sleeping soundly .</p>
    <p n="904"><said who="#Anne">“ I was awfully near giving up in despair , ”</said>explained<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ She got worse and worse until she was sicker than ever the Hammond twins were , even the last pair . I actually thought she was going to choke to death . I gave her every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose went down I said to myself — not to<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>or Young<persName>Mary Joe</persName>, because I did n't want to worry them any more than they were worried , but I had to say it to myself just to relieve my feelings — ‘ This is the last lingering hope and I fear , tis a vain one . ’ But in about three minutes she coughed up the phlegm and began to get better right away . You must just imagine my relief , doctor , because I can n't express it in words . You know there are some things that cannot be expressed in words . ”</said></p>
    <p n="905"><said who="#Mrs._Barry">“ Yes , I know , ”</said>nodded the doctor . He looked at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>as if he were thinking some things about her that could n't be expressed in words . Later on , however , he expressed them to Mr. and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>.</p>
    <p n="906"><said who="#Anne">“ That little redheaded girl they have over at<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Cuthbert</persName>'s is as smart as they make ‘ em . I tell you she saved that baby 's life , for it would have been too late by the time I got there . She seems to have a skill and presence of mind perfectly wonderful in a child of her age . I never saw anything like the eyes of her when she was explaining the case to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="907"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had gone home in the wonderful , white-frosted winter morning , heavy eyed from loss of sleep , but still talking unweariedly to<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>as they crossed the long white field and walked under the glittering fairy arch of the Lover 's Lane maples .</p>
    <p n="908"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, is n't it a wonderful morning ? The world looks like something God had just imagined for His own pleasure , does n't it ? Those trees look as if I could blow them away with a breath — pouf ! I 'm so glad I live in a world where there are white frosts , are n't you ? And I 'm so glad<persName>Mrs. Hammond</persName>had three pairs of twins after all . If she had n't I might n't have known what to do for<persName>Minnie</persName>May . I 'm real sorry I was ever cross with<persName>Mrs. Hammond</persName>for having twins . But , oh ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, I 'm so sleepy . I can n't go to school . I just know I could n't keep my eyes open and I 'd be so stupid . But I hate to stay home , for<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gil</persName>— some of the others will get head of the class , and it 's so hard to get up again — although of course the harder it is the more satisfaction you have when you do get up , have n't you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="909"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I guess you 'll manage all right , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, looking at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s white little face and the dark shadows under her eyes .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ You just go right to bed and have a good sleep . I 'll do all the chores . ”</said></p>
    <p n="910"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>accordingly went to bed and slept so long and soundly that it was well on in the white and rosy winter afternoon when she awoke and descended to the kitchen where<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, who had arrived home in the meantime , was sitting knitting .</p>
    <p n="911"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , did you see the Premier ? ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>at once .<said who="#Anne">“ What did he look like<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="912"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , he never got to be Premier on account of his looks , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Such a nose as that man had ! But he can speak . I was proud of being a Conservative .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel Lynde</persName>, of course , being a Liberal , had no use for him . Your dinner is in the oven ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, and you can get yourself some blue plum preserve out of the pantry . I guess you 're hungry .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>has been telling me about last night . I must say it was fortunate you knew what to do . I would n't have had any idea myself , for I never saw a case of croup . There now , never mind talking till you 've had your dinner . I can tell by the look of you that you 're just full up with speeches , but they 'll keep . ”</said></p>
    <p n="913"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had something to tell<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, but she did not tell it just then for she knew if she did<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s consequent excitement would lift her clear out of the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner . Not until<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had finished her saucer of blue plums did<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>say :</p>
    <p n="914"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>was here this afternoon ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. She wanted to see you , but I would n't wake you up . She says you saved<persName>Minnie</persName>May 's life , and she is very sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine . She says she knows now you did n't mean to set<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>drunk , and she hopes you 'll forgive her and be good friends with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>again . You 're to go over this evening if you like for<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>can n't stir outside the door on account of a bad cold she caught last night . Now ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, for pity 's sake do n't fly up into the air . ”</said></p>
    <p n="915">The warning seemed not unnecessary , so uplifted and aerial was<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s expression and attitude as she sprang to her feet , her face irradiated with the flame of her spirit .</p>
    <p n="916"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, can I go right now — without washing my dishes ? I 'll wash them when I come back , but I cannot tie myself down to anything so unromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment . ”</said></p>
    <p n="917"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Yes , yes , run along , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>indulgently .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>— are you crazy ? Come back this instant and put something on you . I might as well call to the wind . She 's gone without a cap or wrap . Look at her tearing through the orchard with her hair streaming . It 'll be a mercy if she does n't catch her death of cold . ”</said></p>
    <p n="918"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy places . Afar in the southwest was the great shimmering , pearl-like sparkle of an evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal rose over gleaming white spaces and dark glens of spruce . The tinkles of sleigh bells among the snowy hills came like elfin chimes through the frosty air , but their music was not sweeter than the song in<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s heart and on her lips .</p>
    <p n="919"><said who="#Anne">“ You see before you a perfectly happy person ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>she announced .<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm perfectly happy — yes , in spite of my red hair . Just at present I have a soul above red hair .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>kissed me and cried and said she was so sorry and she could never repay me . I felt fearfully embarrassed ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, but I just said as politely as I could , ‘ I have no hard feelings for you ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>. I assure you once for all that I did not mean to intoxicate<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and henceforth I shall cover the past with the mantle of oblivion . ’ That was a pretty dignified way of speaking was n't it ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="920"><said who="#Anne">“ I felt that I was heaping coals of fire on<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>'s head . And<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I had a lovely afternoon .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>showed me a new fancy crochet stitch her aunt over at Carmody taught her . Not a soul in Avonlea knows it but us , and we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>gave me a beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of poetry :</said></p>
    <p n="921"><said who="#Anne">“ If you love me as I love you Nothing but death can part us two .</said></p>
    <p n="922"><said>“ And that is true ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. We 're going to ask<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>to let us sit together in school again , and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Gertie Pye</persName>can go with<persName>Minnie Andrews</persName>. We had an elegant tea .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>had the very best china set out ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, just as if I was real company . I can n't tell you what a thrill it gave me . Nobody ever used their very best china on my account before . And we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of preserves ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. And<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>asked me if I took tea and said ‘ Pa , why do n't you pass the biscuits to<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ’ It must be lovely to be grown up ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, when just being treated as if you were is so nice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="923"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't know about that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, with a brief sigh .</p>
    <p n="924"><said who="#Anne">“ Well , anyway , when I am grown up , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>decidedly ,<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm always going to talk to little girls as if they were too , and I 'll never laugh when they use big words . I know from sorrowful experience how that hurts one 's feelings . After tea<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I made taffy . The taffy was n't very good , I suppose because neither<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>nor I had ever made any before .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and I forgot and let it burn ; and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat walked over one plate and that had to be thrown away . But the making of it was splendid fun . Then when I came home<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>asked me to come over as often as I could and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>stood at the window and threw kisses to me all the way down to Lover 's Lane . I assure you ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, that I feel like praying tonight and I 'm going to think out a special brand-new prayer in honor of the occasion . ”</said></p>

    <p n="925"><said who="#Anne">“ MARILLA , can I go over to see<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>just for a minute ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, running breathlessly down from the east gable one February evening .</p>
    <p n="926"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't see what you want to be traipsing about after dark for , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>shortly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>walked home from school together and then stood down there in the snow for half an hour more , your tongues going the whole blessed time , clickety-clack .

    <p n="927"><said who="#Anne">“ But she wants to see me , ”</said>pleaded<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ She has something very important to tell me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="928"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ How do you know she has ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="929"><said who="#Anne">“ Because she just signaled to me from her window . We have arranged a way to signal with our candles and cardboard . We set the candle on the window sill and make flashes by passing the cardboard back and forth . So many flashes mean a certain thing . It was my idea ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="930"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'll warrant you it was , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>emphatically .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ And the next thing you 'll be setting fire to the curtains with your signaling nonsense . ”</said></p>
    <p n="931"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , we 're very careful ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. And it 's so interesting . Two flashes mean , ‘ Are you there ? ’ Three mean ‘ yes ’ and four ‘ no . ’ Five mean , ‘ Come over as soon as possible , because I have something important to reveal . ’<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>has just signaled five flashes , and I 'm really suffering to know what it is . ”</said></p>
    <p n="932"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , you need n't suffer any longer , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sarcastically .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You can go , but you 're to be back here in just ten minutes , remember that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="933"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>did remember it and was back in the stipulated time , although probably no mortal will ever know just what it cost her to confine the discussion of<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s important communication within the limits of ten minutes . But at least she had made good use of them .</p>
    <p n="934"><said>“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, what do you think ? You know tomorrow is<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s birthday . Well , her mother told her she could ask me to go home with her from school and stay all night with her . And her cousins are coming over from Newbridge in a big pung sleigh to go to the Debating Club concert at the hall tomorrow night . And they are going to take<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and me to the concert — if you 'll let me go , that is . You will , wo n't you ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? Oh , I feel so excited . ”</said></p>
    <p n="935"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You can calm down then , because you 're not going . You 're better at home in your own bed , and as for that club concert , it 's all nonsense , and little girls should not be allowed to go out to such places at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="936"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm sure the Debating Club is a most respectable affair , ”</said>pleaded<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="937"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'm not saying it is n't . But you 're not going to begin gadding about to concerts and staying out all hours of the night .

    <p n="938"><said who="#Anne">“ But it 's such a very special occasion , ”</said>mourned<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, on the verge of tears .<said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>has only one birthday in a year . It is n't as if birthdays were common things ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<persName>Prissy Andrews</persName>is going to recite ‘ Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight . ’ That is such a good moral piece ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I 'm sure it would do me lots of good to hear it . And the choir are going to sing four lovely pathetic songs that are pretty near as good as hymns . And oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, the minister is going to take part ; yes , indeed , he is ; he 's going to give an address . That will be just about the same thing as a sermon . Please , may n't I go ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="939"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You heard what I said ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, did n't you ? Take off your boots now and go to bed . It 's past eight . ”</said></p>
    <p n="940"><said who="#Anne">“ There 's just one more thing ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, with the air of producing the last shot in her locker .<said>“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>told<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>that we might sleep in the spare-room bed . Think of the honor of your little<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>being put in the spare-room bed . ”</said></p>

    <p n="943"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I think you ought to let<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>go . ”</said></p>

    <p n="947"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I ai n't interfering . It ai n't interfering to have your own opinion . And my opinion is that you ought to let<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>go . ”</said></p>
    <p n="948">“ You 'd think I ought to let<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>go to the moon if she took the notion , I 've no doubt ” was<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s amiable rejoinder .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I might have let her spend the night with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, if that was all . But I do n't approve of this concert plan . She 'd go there and catch cold like as not , and have her head filled up with nonsense and excitement . It would unsettle her for a week .

    <p n="949"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I think you ought to let<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>go , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>firmly . Argument was not his strong point , but holding fast to his opinion certainly was .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>gave a gasp of helplessness and took refuge in silence . The next morning , when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was washing the breakfast dishes in the pantry ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>paused on his way out to the barn to say to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>again :</p>

    <p n="951">For a moment<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>looked things not lawful to be uttered . Then she yielded to the inevitable and said tartly :</p>

    <p n="953"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>flew out of the pantry , dripping dishcloth in hand .</p>
    <p n="954"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, say those blessed words again . ”</said></p>

If you catch pneumonia sleeping in a strange bed or coming out of that hot hall in the middle of the night , do n't blame me , blame<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, you 're dripping greasy water all over the floor . I never saw such a careless child . ”</said></p>
    <p n="956"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I know I 'm a great trial to you ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>repentantly .<said who="#Anne">“ I make so many mistakes . But then just think of all the mistakes I do n't make , although I might . I 'll get some sand and scrub up the spots before I go to school . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, my heart was just set on going to that concert . I never was to a concert in my life , and when the other girls talk about them in school I feel so out of it . You did n't know just how I felt about it , but you see<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>did .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>understands me , and it 's so nice to be understood ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="957"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was too excited to do herself justice as to lessons that morning in school .<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>spelled her down in class and left her clear out of sight in mental arithmetic .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s consequent humiliation was less than it might have been , however , in view of the concert and the spare-room bed . She and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>talked so constantly about it all day that with a stricter teacher than<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>dire disgrace must inevitably have been their portion .</p>
    <p n="958"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt that she could not have borne it if she had not been going to the concert , for nothing else was discussed that day in school . The Avonlea Debating Club , which met fortnightly all winter , had had several smaller free entertainments ; but this was to be a big affair , admission ten cents , in aid of the library . The Avonlea young people had been practicing for weeks , and all the scholars were especially interested in it by reason of older brothers and sisters who were going to take part . Everybody in school over nine years of age expected to go , except<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Carrie Sloane</persName>, whose father shared<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s opinions about small girls going out to night concerts .<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Carrie Sloane</persName>cried into her grammar all the afternoon and felt that life was not worth living .</p>
    <p n="959">For<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>the real excitement began with the dismissal of school and increased therefrom in crescendo until it reached to a crash of positive ecstasy in the concert itself . They had a “ perfectly elegant tea ; ” and then came the delicious occupation of dressing in<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s little room upstairs .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>did<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s front hair in the new pompadour style and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>tied<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s bows with the especial knack she possessed ; and they experimented with at least half a dozen different ways of arranging their back hair . At last they were ready , cheeks scarlet and eyes glowing with excitement .</p>
    <p n="960">True ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>could not help a little pang when she contrasted her plain black tam and shapeless , tight-sleeved , homemade gray-cloth coat with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s jaunty fur cap and smart little jacket . But she remembered in time that she had an imagination and could use it .</p>
    <p n="961">Then<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s cousins , the Murrays from Newbridge , came ; they all crowded into the big pung sleigh , among straw and furry robes .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>reveled in the drive to the hall , slipping along over the satin-smooth roads with the snow crisping under the runners . There was a magnificent sunset , and the snowy hills and deep-blue water of the St. Lawrence Gulf seemed to rim in the splendor like a huge bowl of pearl and sapphire brimmed with wine and fire . Tinkles of sleigh bells and distant laughter , that seemed like the mirth of wood elves , came from every quarter .</p>
    <p n="962"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, ”</said>breathed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, squeezing<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s mittened hand under the fur robe ,<said who="#Anne">“ is n't it all like a beautiful dream ? Do I really look the same as usual ? I feel so different that it seems to me it must show in my looks . ”</said></p>
    <p n="963"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ You look awfully nice , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, who having just received a compliment from one of her cousins , felt that she ought to pass it on .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ You 've got the loveliest color . ”</said></p>
    <p n="964">The program that night was a series of “ thrills ” for at least one listener in the audience , and , as<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>assured<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, every succeeding thrill was thrillier than the last . When<persName>Prissy Andrews</persName>, attired in a new pink-silk waist with a string of pearls about her smooth white throat and real carnations in her hair — rumor whispered that the master had sent all the way to town for them for her — “ climbed the slimy ladder , dark without one ray of light , ”<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>shivered in luxurious sympathy ; when the choir sang “ Far Above the Gentle Daisies ”<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>gazed at the ceiling as if it were frescoed with angels ; when Sam<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Sloane</persName>proceeded to explain and illustrate “ How Sockery Set a Hen ”<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>laughed until people sitting near her laughed too , more out of sympathy with her than with amusement at a selection that was rather threadbare even in Avonlea ; and when<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>gave Mark Antony 's oration over the dead body of Caesar in the most heart-stirring tones — looking at<persName>Prissy Andrews</persName>at the end of every sentence —<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt that she could rise and mutiny on the spot if but one Roman citizen led the way .</p>
    <p n="965">Only one number on the program failed to interest her . When<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>recited “ Bingen on the Rhine ”<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>picked up Rhoda Murray 's library book and read it until he had finished , when she sat rigidly stiff and motionless while<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>clapped her hands until they tingled .</p>
    <p n="966">It was eleven when they got home , sated with dissipation , but with the exceeding sweet pleasure of talking it all over still to come . Everybody seemed asleep and the house was dark and silent .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>tiptoed into the parlor , a long narrow room out of which the spare room opened . It was pleasantly warm and dimly lighted by the embers of a fire in the grate .</p>
    <p n="967"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Let 's undress here , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It 's so nice and warm . ”</said></p>
    <p n="968"><said who="#Anne">“ Has n't it been a delightful time ? ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>rapturously .<said who="#Anne">“ It must be splendid to get up and recite there . Do you suppose we will ever be asked to do it ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="969"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Yes , of course , someday . They 're always wanting the big scholars to recite .<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>does often and he 's only two years older than us . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, how could you pretend not to listen to him ? When he came to the line ,</said></p>
    <p n="970"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ THERE 'S ANOTHER , not A SISTER ,</said></p>
    <p n="971">he looked right down at you . ”</p>
    <p n="972"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>with dignity ,<said who="#Anne">“ you are my bosom friend , but I cannot allow even you to speak to me of that person . Are you ready for bed ? Let 's run a race and see who 'll get to the bed first . ”</said></p>
    <p n="973">The suggestion appealed to<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. The two little white-clad figures flew down the long room , through the spare-room door , and bounded on the bed at the same moment . And then — something — moved beneath them , there was a gasp and a cry — and somebody said in muffled accents :</p>
    <p n="974"><said who="#Anne">“ Merciful goodness ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="975"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>were never able to tell just how they got off that bed and out of the room . They only knew that after one frantic rush they found themselves tiptoeing shiveringly upstairs .</p>
    <p n="976"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , who was it — WHAT was it ? ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, her teeth chattering with cold and fright .</p>
    <p n="977"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It was<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Aunt Josephine</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, gasping with laughter .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, it was<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Aunt Josephine</persName>, however she came to be there . Oh , and I know she will be furious . It 's dreadful — it 's really dreadful — but did you ever know anything so funny ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="978"><said who="#Anne">“ Who is your<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Aunt Josephine</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="979"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ She 's father 's aunt and she lives in Charlottetown . She 's awfully old — seventy anyhow — and I do n't believe she was EVER a little girl . We were expecting her out for a visit , but not so soon . She 's awfully prim and proper and she 'll scold dreadfully about this , I know . Well , we 'll have to sleep with<persName>Minnie</persName>May — and you can n't think how she kicks . ”</said></p>
    <p n="980">Miss<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josephine Barry</persName>did not appear at the early breakfast the next morning .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>smiled kindly at the two little girls .</p>
    <p n="981"><said who="#Mrs._Barry">“ Did you have a good time last night ? I tried to stay awake until you came home , for I wanted to tell you<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Aunt Josephine</persName>had come and that you would have to go upstairs after all , but I was so tired I fell asleep . I hope you did n't disturb your aunt ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="982"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>preserved a discreet silence , but she and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>exchanged furtive smiles of guilty amusement across the table .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>hurried home after breakfast and so remained in blissful ignorance of the disturbance which presently resulted in the<persName>Barry</persName>household until the late afternoon , when she went down to<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>'s on an errand for<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="983"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ So you and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>nearly frightened poor old<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>to death last night ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>severely , but with a twinkle in her eye .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>was here a few minutes ago on her way to Carmody . She 's feeling real worried over it . Old<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>was in a terrible temper when she got up this morning — and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josephine Barry</persName>'s temper is no joke , I can tell you that . She would n't speak to<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="984"><said who="#Anne">“ It was n't<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s fault , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>contritely .<said who="#Anne">“ It was mine . I suggested racing to see who would get into bed first . ”</said></p>
    <p n="985"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I knew it ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>, with the exultation of a correct guesser .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I knew that idea came out of your head . Well , it 's made a nice lot of trouble , that 's what . Old<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>came out to stay for a month , but she declares she wo n't stay another day and is going right back to town tomorrow , Sunday and all as it is . She 'd have gone today if they could have taken her . She had promised to pay for a quarter 's music lessons for<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a tomboy . Oh , I guess they had a lively time of it there this morning . The Barrys must feel cut up . Old<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>is rich and they 'd like to keep on the good side of her . Of course ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>did n't say just that to me , but I 'm a pretty good judge of human nature , that 's what . ”</said></p>
    <p n="986"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm such an unlucky girl , ”</said>mourned<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm always getting into scrapes myself and getting my best friends — people I 'd shed my heart 's blood for — into them too . Can you tell me why it is so ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="987"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ It 's because you 're too heedless and impulsive , child , that 's what . You never stop to think — whatever comes into your head to say or do you say or do it without a moment 's reflection . ”</said></p>
    <p n="988"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , but that 's the best of it , ”</said>protested<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Something just flashes into your mind , so exciting , and you must out with it . If you stop to think it over you spoil it all . Have n't you never felt that yourself ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="989">No ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>had not . She shook her head sagely .</p>
    <p n="990"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ You must learn to think a little ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, that 's what . The proverb you need to go by is ‘ Look before you leap ’ — especially into spare-room beds . ”</said></p>
    <p n="991"><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>laughed comfortably over her mild joke , but<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>remained pensive . She saw nothing to laugh at in the situation , which to her eyes appeared very serious . When she left<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>'s she took her way across the crusted fields to Orchard Slope .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>met her at the kitchen door .</p>
    <p n="992"><said who="#Anne">“ Your<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Aunt Josephine</persName>was very cross about it , was n't she ? ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="993"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Yes , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, stifling a giggle with an apprehensive glance over her shoulder at the closed sitting-room door .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ She was fairly dancing with rage ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. Oh , how she scolded . She said I was the worst-behaved girl she ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed of the way they had brought me up . She says she wo n't stay and I 'm sure I do n't care . But<persName>Father</persName>and Mother do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="994"><said who="#Anne">“ Why did n't you tell them it was my fault ? ”</said>demanded<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="995"><said who="#Anne">“ It 's likely I 'd do such a thing , is n't it ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>with just scorn .<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm no telltale ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, and anyhow I was just as much to blame as you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="996"><said who="#Anne">“ Well , I 'm going in to tell her myself , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>resolutely .</p>
    <p n="997"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>stared .</p>
    <p n="998"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, you 'd never ! why — she 'll eat you alive ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="999"><said who="#Anne">“ Do n't frighten me any more than I am frightened , ”</said>implored<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I 'd rather walk up to a cannon 's mouth . But I 've got to do it ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. It was my fault and I 've got to confess . I 've had practice in confessing , fortunately . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1000"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Well , she 's in the room , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ You can go in if you want to . I would n't dare . And I do n't believe you 'll do a bit of good . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1001">With this encouragement<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>bearded the lion in its den — that is to say , walked resolutely up to the sitting-room door and knocked faintly . A sharp “ Come in ” followed .</p>
    <p n="1002">Miss<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josephine Barry</persName>, thin , prim , and rigid , was knitting fiercely by the fire , her wrath quite unappeased and her eyes snapping through her gold-rimmed glasses . She wheeled around in her chair , expecting to see<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, and beheld a white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up with a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror .</p>
    <p n="1003"><said who="#Josie_Pye">“ Who are you ? ”</said>demanded Miss<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josephine Barry</persName>, without ceremony .</p>
    <p n="1004"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I 'm<persName>Anne of Green Gables</persName>, ”</said>said the small visitor tremulously , clasping her hands with her characteristic gesture ,<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ and I 've come to confess , if you please . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1005"><said who="#Josie_Pye">“ Confess what ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1006"><said who="#Josie_Pye">“ That it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night . I suggested it .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>would never have thought of such a thing , I am sure .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>is a very ladylike girl ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>. So you must see how unjust it is to blame her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1007"><said who="#Miss_Barry">“ Oh , I must , hey ? I rather think<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>did her share of the jumping at least . Such carryings on in a respectable house ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1008"><said who="#Anne">“ But we were only in fun , ”</said>persisted<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I think you ought to forgive us ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>, now that we 've apologized . And anyhow , please forgive<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and let her have her music lessons .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s heart is set on her music lessons ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>, and I know too well what it is to set your heart on a thing and not get it . If you must be cross with anyone , be cross with me . I 've been so used in my early days to having people cross at me that I can endure it much better than<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>can . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1009">Much of the snap had gone out of the old lady 's eyes by this time and was replaced by a twinkle of amused interest . But she still said severely :</p>
    <p n="1010"><said who="#Anne">“ I do n't think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun . Little girls never indulged in that kind of fun when I was young . You do n't know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep , after a long and arduous journey , by two great girls coming bounce down on you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1011"><said who="#Anne">“ I do n't KNOW , but I can IMAGINE , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>eagerly .<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm sure it must have been very disturbing . But then , there is our side of it too . Have you any imagination ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>? If you have , just put yourself in our place . We did n't know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly scared us to death . It was simply awful the way we felt . And then we could n't sleep in the spare room after being promised . I suppose you are used to sleeping in spare rooms . But just imagine what you would feel like if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1012">All the snap had gone by this time .<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>actually laughed — a sound which caused<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen outside , to give a great gasp of relief .</p>
    <p n="1013"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I 'm afraid my imagination is a little rusty — it 's so long since I used it , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as mine . It all depends on the way we look at it . Sit down here and tell me about yourself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1014"><said who="#Anne">“ I am very sorry I can n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>firmly .<said who="#Anne">“ I would like to , because you seem like an interesting lady , and you might even be a kindred spirit although you do n't look very much like it . But it is my duty to go home to Miss<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>. Miss<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>is a very kind lady who has taken me to bring up properly . She is doing her best , but it is very discouraging work . You must not blame her because I jumped on the bed . But before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and stay just as long as you meant to in Avonlea . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1015"><said who="#Miss_Barry">“ I think perhaps I will if you will come over and talk to me occasionally , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1016">That evening<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>gave<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>a silver bangle bracelet and told the senior members of the household that she had unpacked her valise .</p>
    <p n="1017"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I 've made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better acquainted with that Anne-girl , ”</said>she said frankly .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ She amuses me , and at my time of life an amusing person is a rarity . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1018"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s only comment when she heard the story was ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I told you so . ”</said>This was for<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s benefit .</p>
    <p n="1019"><persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>stayed her month out and over . She was a more agreeable guest than usual , for<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>kept her in good humor . They became firm friends .</p>
    <p n="1020">When<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>went away she said :</p>
    <p n="1021"><said who="#Miss_Barry">“ Remember , you Anne-girl , when you come to town you 're to visit me and I 'll put you in my very sparest spare-room bed to sleep . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1022"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>was a kindred spirit , after all , ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>confided to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ You would n't think so to look at her , but she is . You do n't find it right out at first , as in<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s case , but after a while you come to see it . Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think . It 's splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1023">Spring had come once more to Green Gables — the beautiful capricious , reluctant Canadian spring , lingering along through April and May in a succession of sweet , fresh , chilly days , with pink sunsets and miracles of resurrection and growth . The maples in Lover 's Lane were red budded and little curly ferns pushed up around the Dryad 's Bubble . Away up in the barrens , behind Mr. Silas<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Sloane</persName>'s place , the Mayflowers blossomed out , pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves . All the school girls and boys had one golden afternoon gathering them , coming home in the clear , echoing twilight with arms and baskets full of flowery spoil .</p>
    <p n="1024"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no Mayflowers , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>says perhaps they have something better , but there could n't be anything better than Mayflowers , could there ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? And<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>says if they do n't know what they are like they do n't miss them . But I think that is the saddest thing of all . I think it would be TRAGIC ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, not to know what Mayflowers are like and NOT to miss them . Do you know what I think Mayflowers are ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? I think they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this is their heaven . But we had a splendid time today ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. We had our lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well — such a ROMANTIC spot .<persName>Charlie Sloane</persName>dared Arty<persName>Gillis</persName>to jump over it , and Arty did because he would n't take a dare . Nobody would in school . It is very FASHIONABLE to dare .<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>gave all the Mayflowers he found to<persName>Prissy Andrews</persName>and I heard him to say ‘ sweets to the sweet . ’ He got that out of a book , I know ; but it shows he has some imagination . I was offered some Mayflowers too , but I rejected them with scorn . I can n't tell you the person 's name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips . We made wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats ; and when the time came to go home we marched in procession down the road , two by two , with our bouquets and wreaths , singing ‘ My Home on the Hill . ’ Oh , it was so thrilling ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. All Mr. Silas<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Sloane</persName>'s folks rushed out to see us and everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us . We made a real sensation . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1025"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Not much wonder ! Such silly doings ! ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s response .</p>
    <p n="1026">After the Mayflowers came the violets , and<persName>Violet Vale</persName>was empurpled with them .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>walked through it on her way to school with reverent steps and worshiping eyes , as if she trod on holy ground .</p>
    <p n="1027"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Somehow , ”</said>she told<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>,<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ when I 'm going through here I do n't really care whether<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gil</persName>— whether anybody gets ahead of me in class or not . But when I 'm up in school it 's all different and I care as much as ever . There 's such a lot of different Annes in me . I sometimes think that is why I 'm such a troublesome person . If I was just the one<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>it would be ever so much more comfortable , but then it would n't be half so interesting . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1028">One June evening , when the orchards were pink blossomed again , when the frogs were singing silverly sweet in the marshes about the head of the Lake of Shining Waters , and the air was full of the savor of clover fields and balsamic fir woods ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was sitting by her gable window . She had been studying her lessons , but it had grown too dark to see the book , so she had fallen into wide-eyed reverie , looking out past the boughs of the Snow<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>, once more bestarred with its tufts of blossom .</p>
    <p n="1029">In all essential respects the little gable chamber was unchanged . The walls were as white , the pincushion as hard , the chairs as stiffly and yellowly upright as ever . Yet the whole character of the room was altered . It was full of a new vital , pulsing personality that seemed to pervade it and to be quite independent of schoolgirl books and dresses and ribbons , and even of the cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms on the table . It was as if all the dreams , sleeping and waking , of its vivid occupant had taken a visible although unmaterial form and had tapestried the bare room with splendid filmy tissues of rainbow and moonshine . Presently<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>came briskly in with some of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s freshly ironed school aprons . She hung them over a chair and sat down with a short sigh . She had had one of her headaches that afternoon , and although the pain had gone she felt weak and “ tuckered out , ” as she expressed it .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked at her with eyes limpid with sympathy .</p>
    <p n="1030"><said who="#Anne">“ I do truly wish I could have had the headache in your place ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I would have endured it joyfully for your sake . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1031"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I guess you did your part in attending to the work and letting me rest , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You seem to have got on fairly well and made fewer mistakes than usual . Of course it was n't exactly necessary to starch<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s handkerchiefs ! And most people when they put a pie in the oven to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of leaving it to be burned to a crisp . But that does n't seem to be your way evidently . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1032">Headaches always left<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>somewhat sarcastic .</p>
    <p n="1033"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I 'm so sorry , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>penitently .<said who="#Anne">“ I never thought about that pie from the moment I put it in the oven till now , although I felt INSTINCTIVELY that there was something missing on the dinner table . I was firmly resolved , when you left me in charge this morning , not to imagine anything , but keep my thoughts on facts . I did pretty well until I put the pie in , and then an irresistible temptation came to me to imagine I was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a handsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal-black steed . So that is how I came to forget the pie . I did n't know I starched the handkerchiefs . All the time I was ironing I was trying to think of a name for a new island<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I have discovered up the brook . It 's the most ravishing spot ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. There are two maple trees on it and the brook flows right around it . At last it struck me that it would be splendid to call it Victoria Island because we found it on the<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s birthday . Both<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I are very loyal . But I 'm sorry about that pie and the handkerchiefs . I wanted to be extra good today because it 's an anniversary . Do you remember what happened this day last year ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1034"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No , I can n't think of anything special . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1035"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, it was the day I came to Green Gables . I shall never forget it . It was the turning point in my life . Of course it would n't seem so important to you . I 've been here for a year and I 've been so happy . Of course , I 've had my troubles , but one can live down troubles . Are you sorry you kept me ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1036"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No , I can n't say I 'm sorry , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, who sometimes wondered how she could have lived before<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>came to Green Gables ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ no , not exactly sorry . If you 've finished your lessons ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, I want you to run over and ask<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>if she 'll lend me<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s apron pattern . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1037"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh — it 's — it 's too dark , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1038"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Too dark ? Why , it 's only twilight . And goodness knows you 've gone over often enough after dark . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1039"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'll go over early in the morning , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>eagerly .<said who="#Anne">“ I 'll get up at sunrise and go over ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1040"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ What has got into your head now ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>? I want that pattern to cut out your new apron this evening . Go at once and be smart too . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1041"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'll have to go around by the road , then , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, taking up her hat reluctantly .</p>
    <p n="1042"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Go by the road and waste half an hour ! I 'd like to catch you ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1043"><said who="#Anne">“ I can n't go through the Haunted Wood ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>desperately .</p>
    <p n="1044"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>stared .</p>

    <p n="1046"><said who="#Anne">“ The spruce wood over the brook , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>in a whisper .</p>
    <p n="1047"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Fiddlesticks ! There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere . Who has been telling you such stuff ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1048"><said who="#Anne">“ Nobody , ”</said>confessed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I just imagined the wood was haunted . All the places around here are so — so — COMMONPLACE . We just got this up for our own amusement . We began it in April . A haunted wood is so very romantic ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. We chose the spruce grove because it 's so gloomy . Oh , we have imagined the most harrowing things . There 's a white lady walks along the brook just about this time of the night and wrings her hands and utters wailing cries . She appears when there is to be a death in the family . And the ghost of a little murdered child haunts the corner up by<persName>Idlewild</persName>; it creeps up behind you and lays its cold fingers on your hand — so . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, it gives me a shudder to think of it . And there 's a headless man stalks up and down the path and skeletons glower at you between the boughs . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I would n't go through the Haunted Wood after dark now for anything . I 'd be sure that white things would reach out from behind the trees and grab me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1049"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Did ever anyone hear the like ! ”</said>ejaculated<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, who had listened in dumb amazement .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, do you mean to tell me you believe all that wicked nonsense of your own imagination ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1050"><said who="#Anne">“ Not believe EXACTLY , ”</said>faltered<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ At least , I do n't believe it in daylight . But after dark ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, it 's different . That is when ghosts walk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1051"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ There are no such things as ghosts ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1052"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , but there are ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>eagerly .<said who="#Anne">“ I know people who have seen them . And they are respectable people .<persName>Charlie Sloane</persName>says that his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night after he 'd been buried for a year . You know<persName>Charlie Sloane</persName>'s grandmother would n't tell a story for anything . She 's a very religious woman . And<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>'s father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with its head cut off hanging by a strip of skin . He said he knew it was the spirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine days . He did n't , but he died two years after , so you see it was really true . And<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>says — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1053"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, ”</said>interrupted<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>firmly ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I never want to hear you talking in this fashion again . I 've had my doubts about that imagination of yours right along , and if this is going to be the outcome of it , I wo n't countenance any such doings . You 'll go right over to<persName>Barry</persName>'s , and you 'll go through that spruce grove , just for a lesson and a warning to you . And never let me hear a word out of your head about haunted woods again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1054"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>might plead and cry as she liked — and did , for her terror was very real . Her imagination had run away with her and she held the spruce grove in mortal dread after nightfall . But<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was inexorable . She marched the shrinking ghost-seer down to the spring and ordered her to proceed straightaway over the bridge and into the dusky retreats of wailing ladies and headless specters beyond .</p>
    <p n="1055"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, how can you be so cruel ? ”</said>sobbed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ What would you feel like if a white thing did snatch me up and carry me off ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1056"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'll risk it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>unfeelingly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You know I always mean what I say . I 'll cure you of imagining ghosts into places . March , now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1057"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>marched . That is , she stumbled over the bridge and went shuddering up the horrible dim path beyond .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>never forgot that walk . Bitterly did she repent the license she had given to her imagination . The goblins of her fancy lurked in every shadow about her , reaching out their cold , fleshless hands to grasp the terrified small girl who had called them into being . A white strip of birch bark blowing up from the hollow over the brown floor of the grove made her heart stand still . The long-drawn wail of two old boughs rubbing against each other brought out the perspiration in beads on her forehead . The swoop of bats in the darkness over her was as the wings of unearthly creatures . When she reached Mr. William<persName>Bell</persName>'s field she fled across it as if pursued by an army of white things , and arrived at the<persName>Barry</persName>kitchen door so out of breath that she could hardly gasp out her request for the apron pattern .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>was away so that she had no excuse to linger . The dreadful return journey had to be faced .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>went back over it with shut eyes , preferring to take the risk of dashing her brains out among the boughs to that of seeing a white thing . When she finally stumbled over the log bridge she drew one long shivering breath of relief .</p>
    <p n="1058"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , so nothing caught you ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>unsympathetically .</p>

    <p n="1060"><said who="#Anne">“ Dear me , there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world , as<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>plaintively , putting her slate and books down on the kitchen table on the last day of June and wiping her red eyes with a very damp handkerchief .<said who="#Anne">“ Was n't it fortunate ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, that I took an extra handkerchief to school today ? I had a presentiment that it would be needed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1061"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I never thought you were so fond of<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>that you 'd require two handkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he was going away , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1062"><said who="#Anne">“ I do n't think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him , ”</said>reflected<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I just cried because all the others did . It was<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>started it .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>has always declared she hated<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>, but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she burst into tears . Then all the girls began to cry , one after the other . I tried to hold out ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I tried to remember the time<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>made me sit with<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gil</persName>— with a , boy ; and the time he spelled my name without an e on the blackboard ; and how he said I was the worst dunce he ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling ; and all the times he had been so horrid and sarcastic ; but somehow I could n't ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, and I just had to cry too .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>has been talking for a month about how glad she 'd be when<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>went away and she declared she 'd never shed a tear . Well , she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a handkerchief from her brother — of course the boys did n't cry — because she had n't brought one of her own , not expecting to need it . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, it was heartrending .<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>made such a beautiful farewell speech beginning , ‘ The time has come for us to part . ’ It was very affecting . And he had tears in his eyes too ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. Oh , I felt dreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I 'd talked in school and drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and<persName>Prissy</persName>. I can tell you I wished I 'd been a model pupil like<persName>Minnie Andrews</persName>. She had n't anything on her conscience . The girls cried all the way home from school .<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Carrie Sloane</persName>kept saying every few minutes , ‘ The time has come for us to part , ’ and that would start us off again whenever we were in any danger of cheering up . I do feel dreadfully sad ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. But one can n't feel quite in the depths of despair with two months ’ vacation before them , can they ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? And besides , we met the new minister and his wife coming from the station . For all I was feeling so bad about<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>going away I could n't help taking a little interest in a new minister , could I ? His wife is very pretty . Not exactly regally lovely , of course — it would n't do , I suppose , for a minister to have a regally lovely wife , because it might set a bad example .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says the minister 's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she dresses so fashionably . Our new minister 's wife was dressed in blue muslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for a minister 's wife , but I did n't make any such uncharitable remark ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves . Besides , she 's only been a minister 's wife for a little while , so one should make allowances , should n't they ? They are going to board with<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>until the manse is ready . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1063">If<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, in going down to<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>'s that evening , was actuated by any motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had borrowed the preceding winter , it was an amiable weakness shared by most of the Avonlea people . Many a thing<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>had lent , sometimes never expecting to see it again , came home that night in charge of the borrowers thereof . A new minister , and moreover a minister with a wife , was a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement where sensations were few and far between .</p>
    <p n="1064">Old Mr. Bentley , the minister whom<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had found lacking in imagination , had been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years . He was a widower when he came , and a widower he remained , despite the fact that gossip regularly married him to this , that , or the other one , every year of his sojourn . In the preceding February he had resigned his charge and departed amid the regrets of his people , most of whom had the affection born of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his shortcomings as an orator . Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a variety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various candidates and “ supplies ” who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on trial . These stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mothers in Israel ; but a certain small , red-haired girl who sat meekly in the corner of the old<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Cuthbert</persName>pew also had her opinions about them and discussed the same in full with<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>always declining from principle to criticize ministers in any shape or form .</p>
    <p n="1065">“ I do n't think Mr. Smith would have done ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>” was<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s final summing up .<said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says his delivery was so poor , but I think his worst fault was just like Mr. Bentley 's — he had no imagination . And Mr. Terry had too much ; he let it run away with him just as I did mine in the matter of the Haunted Wood . Besides ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says his theology was n't sound . Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man , but he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church ; he was undignified , and you must have some dignity about a minister , must n't you ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive ; but<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says he is n't married , or even engaged , because she made special inquiries about him , and she says it would never do to have a young unmarried minister in Avonlea , because he might marry in the congregation and that would make trouble .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>is a very farseeing woman , is n't she ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>? I 'm very glad they 've called<persName>Mr. Allan</persName>. I liked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he meant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says he is n't perfect , but she says she supposes we could n't expect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year , and anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly on all the points of doctrine . And she knows his wife 's people and they are most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman make an ideal combination for a minister 's family . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1066">The new minister and his wife were a young , pleasant-faced couple , still on their honeymoon , and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for their chosen lifework . Avonlea opened its heart to them from the start . Old and young liked the frank , cheerful young man with his high ideals , and the bright , gentle little lady who assumed the mistress-ship of the manse . With<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love . She had discovered another kindred spirit .</p>
    <p n="1067"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>is perfectly lovely , ”</said>she announced one Sunday afternoon .<said who="#Anne">“ She 's taken our class and she 's a splendid teacher . She said right away she did n't think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions , and you know ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, that is exactly what I 've always thought . She said we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many . I 'm good at asking questions ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1068">“ I believe you ” was<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s emphatic comment .</p>
    <p n="1069"><said who="#Anne">“ Nobody else asked any except<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>, and she asked if there was to be a Sunday-school picnic this summer . I did n't think that was a very proper question to ask because it had n't any connection with the lesson — the lesson was about Daniel in the lions ’ den — but<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>just smiled and said she thought there would be .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>has a lovely smile ; she has such EXQUISITE dimples in her cheeks . I wish I had dimples in my cheeks ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I 'm not half so skinny as I was when I came here , but I have no dimples yet . If I had perhaps I could influence people for good .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>said we ought always to try to influence other people for good . She talked so nice about everything . I never knew before that religion was such a cheerful thing . I always thought it was kind of melancholy , but<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>'s is n't , and I 'd like to be a Christian if I could be one like her . I would n't want to be one like Mr . Superintendent<persName>Bell</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1070"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It 's very naughty of you to speak so about<persName>Mr. Bell</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>severely .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName>Mr. Bell</persName>is a real good man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1071"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , of course he 's good , ”</said>agreed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne">“ but he does n't seem to get any comfort out of it . If I could be good I 'd dance and sing all day because I was glad of it . I suppose<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>is too old to dance and sing and of course it would n't be dignified in a minister 's wife . But I can just feel she 's glad she 's a Christian and that she 'd be one even if she could get to heaven without it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1072"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I suppose we must have Mr. and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>up to tea someday soon , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>reflectively .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ They 've been most everywhere but here . Let me see . Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them . But do n't say a word to<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>about it , for if he knew they were coming he 'd find some excuse to be away that day . He 'd got so used to Mr. Bentley he did n't mind him , but he 's going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new minister , and a new minister 's wife will frighten him to death . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1073"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'll be as secret as the dead , ”</said>assured<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ But oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, will you let me make a cake for the occasion ? I 'd love to do something for<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1074"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You can make a layer cake , ”</said>promised<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1075">Monday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables . Having the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important undertaking , and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was determined not to be eclipsed by any of the Avonlea housekeepers .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was wild with excitement and delight . She talked it all over with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>Tuesday night in the twilight , as they sat on the big red stones by the Dryad 's Bubble and made rainbows in the water with little twigs dipped in fir balsam .</p>
    <p n="1076"><said who="#Anne">“ Everything is ready ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, except my cake which I 'm to make in the morning , and the baking-powder biscuits which<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>will make just before teatime . I assure you ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and I have had a busy two days of it . It 's such a responsibility having a minister 's family to tea . I never went through such an experience before . You should just see our pantry . It 's a sight to behold . We 're going to have jellied chicken and cold tongue . We 're to have two kinds of jelly , red and yellow , and whipped cream and lemon pie , and cherry pie , and three kinds of cookies , and fruit cake , and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s famous yellow plum preserves that she keeps especially for ministers , and pound cake and layer cake , and biscuits as aforesaid ; and new bread and old both , in case the minister is dyspeptic and can n't eat new .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says ministers are dyspeptic , but I do n't think<persName>Mr. Allan</persName>has been a minister long enough for it to have had a bad effect on him . I just grow cold when I think of my layer cake . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, what if it should n't be good ! I dreamed last night that I was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a head . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1077"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It 'll be good , all right , ”</said>assured<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, who was a very comfortable sort of friend .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I 'm sure that piece of the one you made that we had for lunch in<persName>Idlewild</persName>two weeks ago was perfectly elegant . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1078"><said who="#Anne">“ Yes ; but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just when you especially want them to be good , ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, setting a particularly well-balsamed twig afloat .<said who="#Anne">“ However , I suppose I shall just have to trust to Providence and be careful to put in the flour . Oh , look ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, what a lovely rainbow ! Do you suppose the dryad will come out after we go away and take it for a scarf ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1079"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ You know there is no such thing as a dryad , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s mother had found out about the Haunted Wood and had been decidedly angry over it . As a result<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>had abstained from any further imitative flights of imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of belief even in harmless dryads .</p>
    <p n="1080"><said who="#Anne">“ But it 's so easy to imagine there is , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Every night before I go to bed , I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really sitting here , combing her locks with the spring for a mirror . Sometimes I look for her footprints in the dew in the morning . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, do n't give up your faith in the dryad ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1081">Wednesday morning came .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>got up at sunrise because she was too excited to sleep . She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of her dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening ; but nothing short of absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary matters that morning . After breakfast she proceeded to make her cake . When she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath .</p>
    <p n="1082"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm sure I have n't forgotten anything this time ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. But do you think it will rise ? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder is n't good ? I used it out of the new can . And<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says you can never be sure of getting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says the Government ought to take the matter up , but she says we 'll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, what if that cake does n't rise ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1083">“ We 'll have plenty without it ” was<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s unimpassioned way of looking at the subject .</p>
    <p n="1084">The cake did rise , however , and came out of the oven as light and feathery as golden foam .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, flushed with delight , clapped it together with layers of ruby jelly and , in imagination , saw<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>eating it and possibly asking for another piece !</p>
    <p n="1085"><said who="#Mrs._Allan">“ You 'll be using the best tea set , of course ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>she said .<said who="#Mrs._Allan">“ Can I fix the table with ferns and wild roses ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1086"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I think that 's all nonsense , ”</said>sniffed<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ In my opinion it 's the eatables that matter and not flummery decorations . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1087"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>had HER table decorated , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, who was not entirely guiltless of the wisdom of the serpent ,<said who="#Anne">“ and the minister paid her an elegant compliment . He said it was a feast for the eye as well as the palate . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1088"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , do as you like , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, who was quite determined not to be surpassed by<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>or anybody else .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Only mind you leave enough room for the dishes and the food . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1089"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that should leave<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>'s nowhere . Having abundance of roses and ferns and a very artistic taste of her own , she made that tea table such a thing of beauty that when the minister and his wife sat down to it they exclaimed in chorus over it loveliness .</p>
    <p n="1090"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It 's<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s doings , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, grimly just ; and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>'s approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world .</p>
    <p n="1091"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was there , having been inveigled into the party only goodness and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>knew how . He had been in such a state of shyness and nervousness that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had given him up in despair , but<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>took him in hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes and white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly . He never said a word to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>, but that perhaps was not to be expected .</p>
    <p n="1092">All went merry as a marriage bell until<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s layer cake was passed .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>, having already been helped to a bewildering variety , declined it . But<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, seeing the disappointment on<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s face , said smilingly :</p>
    <p n="1093"><said>“ Oh , you must take a piece of this ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>.<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>made it on purpose for you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1094"><said who="#Mrs._Allan">“ In that case I must sample it , ”</said>laughed<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>, helping herself to a plump triangle , as did also the minister and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1095"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression crossed her face ; not a word did she say , however , but steadily ate away at it .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake .</p>
    <p n="1096"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>! ”</said>she exclaimed ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ what on earth did you put into that cake ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1097"><said who="#Anne">“ Nothing but what the recipe said ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>with a look of anguish .<said who="#Anne">“ Oh , is n't it all right ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1098"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ All right ! It 's simply horrible .<persName>Mr. Allan</persName>, do n't try to eat it .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, taste it yourself . What flavoring did you use ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1099"><said who="#Anne">“ Vanilla , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, her face scarlet with mortification after tasting the cake .<said who="#Anne">“ Only vanilla . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, it must have been the baking powder . I had my suspicions of that bak — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1100"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Baking powder fiddlesticks ! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you used . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1101"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially filled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly ,<said who="#Anne">“ Best Vanilla . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1102"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>took it , uncorked it , smelled it .</p>
    <p n="1103"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Mercy on us ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, you 've flavored that cake with ANODYNE LINIMENT . I broke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an old empty vanilla bottle . I suppose it 's partly my fault — I should have warned you — but for pity 's sake why could n't you have smelled it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1104"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>dissolved into tears under this double disgrace .</p>
    <p n="1105"><said who="#Anne">“ I could n't — I had such a cold ! ”</said>and with this she fairly fled to the gable chamber , where she cast herself on the bed and wept as one who refuses to be comforted .</p>
    <p n="1106">Presently a light step sounded on the stairs and somebody entered the room .</p>
    <p n="1107"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>sobbed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, without looking up ,<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm disgraced forever . I shall never be able to live this down . It will get out — things always do get out in Avonlea .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>will ask me how my cake turned out and I shall have to tell her the truth . I shall always be pointed at as the girl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment .<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gil</persName>— the boys in school will never get over laughing at it . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, if you have a spark of Christian pity do n't tell me that I must go down and wash the dishes after this . I 'll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone , but I cannot ever look<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>in the face again . Perhaps she 'll think I tried to poison her .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says she knows an orphan girl who tried to poison her benefactor . But the liniment is n't poisonous . It 's meant to be taken internally — although not in cakes . Wo n't you tell<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>so ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1108"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Suppose you jump up and tell her so yourself , ”</said>said a merry voice .</p>
    <p n="1109"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>flew up , to find<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>standing by her bed , surveying her with laughing eyes .</p>
    <p n="1110"><said who="#Mrs._Allan">“ My dear little girl , you must n't cry like this , ”</said>she said , genuinely disturbed by<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s tragic face .<said who="#Mrs._Allan">“ Why , it 's all just a funny mistake that anybody might make . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1111"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , no , it takes me to make such a mistake , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>forlornly .<said who="#Anne">“ And I wanted to have that cake so nice for you ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1112"><said who="#Mrs._Allan">“ Yes , I know , dear . And I assure you I appreciate your kindness and thoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right . Now , you must n't cry any more , but come down with me and show me your flower garden .<persName>Miss Cuthbert</persName>tells me you have a little plot all your own . I want to see it , for I 'm very much interested in flowers . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1113"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>permitted herself to be led down and comforted , reflecting that it was really providential that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>was a kindred spirit . Nothing more was said about the liniment cake , and when the guests went away<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>found that she had enjoyed the evening more than could have been expected , considering that terrible incident . Nevertheless , she sighed deeply .</p>
    <p n="1114"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, is n't it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1115"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'll warrant you 'll make plenty in it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I never saw your beat for making mistakes ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1116"><said who="#Anne">“ Yes , and well I know it , ”</said>admitted<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>mournfully .<said who="#Anne">“ But have you ever noticed one encouraging thing about me ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? I never make the same mistake twice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1117"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't know as that 's much benefit when you 're always making new ones . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1118"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , do n't you see ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? There must be a limit to the mistakes one person can make , and when I get to the end of them , then I 'll be through with them . That 's a very comforting thought . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1119"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , you 'd better go and give that cake to the pigs , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It is n't fit for any human to eat , not even Jerry Boute . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="22">
    <p n="1120"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ And what are your eyes popping out of your head about . Now ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had just come in from a run to the post office .<said who="#Anne">“ Have you discovered another kindred spirit ? ”</said>Excitement hung around<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>like a garment , shone in her eyes , kindled in every feature . She had come dancing up the lane , like a wind-blown sprite , through the mellow sunshine and lazy shadows of the August evening .</p>
    <p n="1121"><said who="#Anne">“ No ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, but oh , what do you think ? I am invited to tea at the manse tomorrow afternoon !<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>left the letter for me at the post office . Just look at it ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ‘ Miss<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, Green Gables . ’ That is the first time I was ever called ‘ Miss . ’ Such a thrill as it gave me ! I shall cherish it forever among my choicest treasures . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1122"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>told me she meant to have all the members of her Sunday-school class to tea in turn , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, regarding the wonderful event very coolly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You need n't get in such a fever over it . Do learn to take things calmly , child . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1123">For<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>to take things calmly would have been to change her nature . All “ spirit and fire and dew , ” as she was , the pleasures and pains of life came to her with trebled intensity .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>felt this and was vaguely troubled over it , realizing that the ups and downs of existence would probably bear hardly on this impulsive soul and not sufficiently understanding that the equally great capacity for delight might more than compensate . Therefore<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>conceived it to be her duty to drill<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>into a tranquil uniformity of disposition as impossible and alien to her as to a dancing sunbeam in one of the brook shallows . She did not make much headway , as she sorrowfully admitted to herself . The downfall of some dear hope or plan plunged<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>into “ deeps of affliction . ” The fulfillment thereof exalted her to dizzy realms of delight .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had almost begun to despair of ever fashioning this waif of the world into her model little girl of demure manners and prim deportment . Neither would she have believed that she really liked<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>much better as she was .</p>
    <p n="1124"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>went to bed that night speechless with misery because<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had said the wind was round northeast and he feared it would be a rainy day tomorrow . The rustle of the poplar leaves about the house worried her , it sounded so like pattering raindrops , and the full , faraway roar of the gulf , to which she listened delightedly at other times , loving its strange , sonorous , haunting rhythm , now seemed like a prophecy of storm and disaster to a small maiden who particularly wanted a fine day .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>thought that the morning would never come .</p>
    <p n="1125">But all things have an end , even nights before the day on which you are invited to take tea at the manse . The morning , in spite of<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s predictions , was fine and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s spirits soared to their highest .<said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, there is something in me today that makes me just love everybody I see , ”</said>she exclaimed as she washed the breakfast dishes .<said who="#Anne">“ You do n't know how good I feel ! Would n't it be nice if it could last ? I believe I could be a model child if I were just invited out to tea every day . But oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, it 's a solemn occasion too . I feel so anxious . What if I should n't behave properly ? You know I never had tea at a manse before , and I 'm not sure that I know all the rules of etiquette , although I 've been studying the rules given in the Etiquette Department of the Family Herald ever since I came here . I 'm so afraid I 'll do something silly or forget to do something I should do . Would it be good manners to take a second helping of anything if you wanted to VERY much ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1126"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ The trouble with you ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, is that you 're thinking too much about yourself . You should just think of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>and what would be nicest and most agreeable to her , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, hitting for once in her life on a very sound and pithy piece of advice .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>instantly realized this .</p>
    <p n="1127"><said who="#Anne">“ You are right ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I 'll try not to think about myself at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1128"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>evidently got through her visit without any serious breach of “ etiquette , ” for she came home through the twilight , under a great , high-sprung sky gloried over with trails of saffron and rosy cloud , in a beatified state of mind and told<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>all about it happily , sitting on the big red-sandstone slab at the kitchen door with her tired curly head in<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s gingham lap .</p>
    <p n="1129">A cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest fields from the rims of firry western hills and whistling through the poplars . One clear star hung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Lover 's Lane , in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>watched them as she talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were all tangled up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting .</p>
    <p n="1130"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I 've had a most FASCINATING time . I feel that I have not lived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never be invited to tea at a manse again . When I got there<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>met me at the door . She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy , with dozens of frills and elbow sleeves , and she looked just like a seraph . I really think I 'd like to be a minister 's wife when I grow up ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. A minister might n't mind my red hair because he would n't be thinking of such worldly things . But then of course one would have to be naturally good and I 'll never be that , so I suppose there 's no use in thinking about it . Some people are naturally good , you know , and others are not . I 'm one of the others .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says I 'm full of original sin . No matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success of it as those who are naturally good . It 's a good deal like geometry , I expect . But do n't you think the trying so hard ought to count for something ?<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>is one of the naturally good people . I love her passionately . You know there are some people , like<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>that you can love right off without any trouble . And there are others , like<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>, that you have to try very hard to love . You know you OUGHT to love them because they know so much and are such active workers in the church , but you have to keep reminding yourself of it all the time or else you forget . There was another little girl at the manse to tea , from the White Sands Sunday school . Her name was Laurette Bradley , and she was a very nice little girl . Not exactly a kindred spirit , you know , but still very nice . We had an elegant tea , and I think I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well . After tea<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing too .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the Sunday-school choir after this . You can n't think how I was thrilled at the mere thought . I 've longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir , as<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>does , but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to . Lauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the White Sands Hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it . Lauretta says that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in aid of the Charlottetown hospital , and they ask lots of the White Sands people to recite . Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself someday . I just gazed at her in awe . After she had gone<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>and I had a heart-to-heart talk . I told her everything — about<persName>Mrs. Thomas</persName>and the twins and<persName>Katie Maurice</persName>and<persName>Violetta</persName>and coming to Green Gables and my troubles over geometry . And would you believe it ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>?<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>told me she was a dunce at geometry too . You do n't know how that encouraged me .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>came to the manse just before I left , and what do you think ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? The trustees have hired a new teacher and it 's a lady . Her name is Miss Muriel<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Stacy</persName>. Is n't that a romantic name ?<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says they 've never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she thinks it is a dangerous innovation . But I think it will be splendid to have a lady teacher , and I really do n't see how I 'm going to live through the two weeks before school begins . I 'm so impatient to see her . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="23">
    <p n="1131"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had to live through more than two weeks , as it happened . Almost a month having elapsed since the liniment cake episode , it was high time for her to get into fresh trouble of some sort , little mistakes , such as absentmindedly emptying a pan of skim milk into a basket of yarn balls in the pantry instead of into the pigs ’ bucket , and walking clean over the edge of the log bridge into the brook while wrapped in imaginative reverie , not really being worth counting .</p>
    <p n="1132">A week after the tea at the manse<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana Barry</persName>gave a party .</p>
    <p n="1133"><said who="#Anne">“ Small and select , ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>assured<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Just the girls in our class . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1134">They had a very good time and nothing untoward happened until after tea , when they found themselves in the<persName>Barry</persName>garden , a little tired of all their games and ripe for any enticing form of mischief which might present itself . This presently took the form of “ daring . ”</p>
    <p n="1135">Daring was the fashionable amusement among the Avonlea small fry just then . It had begun among the boys , but soon spread to the girls , and all the silly things that were done in Avonlea that summer because the doers thereof were “ dared ” to do them would fill a book by themselves .</p>
    <p n="1136">First of all<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Carrie Sloane</persName>dared<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>to climb to a certain point in the huge old willow tree before the front door ; which<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>, albeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said tree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she should tear her new muslin dress , nimbly did , to the discomfiture of the aforesaid<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Carrie Sloane</persName>. Then<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>dared<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>to hop on her left leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her right foot to the ground ; which<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>gamely tried to do , but gave out at the third corner and had to confess herself defeated .</p>
    <p n="1137"><persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>'s triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which bounded the garden to the east . Now , to “ walk ” board fences requires more skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose who has never tried it . But<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>, if deficient in some qualities that make for popularity , had at least a natural and inborn gift , duly cultivated , for walking board fences .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>walked the<persName>Barry</persName>fence with an airy unconcern which seemed to imply that a little thing like that was n't worth a “ dare . ” Reluctant admiration greeted her exploit , for most of the other girls could appreciate it , having suffered many things themselves in their efforts to walk fences .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>descended from her perch , flushed with victory , and darted a defiant glance at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1138"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>tossed her red braids .</p>
    <p n="1139"><said who="#Anne">“ I do n't think it 's such a very wonderful thing to walk a little , low , board fence , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Anne">“ I knew a girl in Marysville who could walk the ridgepole of a roof . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1140"><said who="#Josie_Pye">“ I do n't believe it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>flatly .<said who="#Josie_Pye">“ I do n't believe anybody could walk a ridgepole . YOU could n't , anyhow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1141"><said who="#Anne">“ Could n't I ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>rashly .</p>
    <p n="1142"><said who="#Josie_Pye">“ Then I dare you to do it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>defiantly .<said who="#Josie_Pye">“ I dare you to climb up there and walk the ridgepole of<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>'s kitchen roof . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1143"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>turned pale , but there was clearly only one thing to be done . She walked toward the house , where a ladder was leaning against the kitchen roof . All the fifth-class girls said ,<said who="#Anne">“ Oh ! ”</said>partly in excitement , partly in dismay .</p>
    <p n="1144"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Do n't you do it ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>entreated<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ You 'll fall off and be killed . Never mind<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>. It is n't fair to dare anybody to do anything so dangerous . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1145"><said who="#Anne">“ I must do it . My honor is at stake , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>solemnly .<said who="#Anne">“ I shall walk that ridgepole ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, or perish in the attempt . If I am killed you are to have my pearl bead ring . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1146"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>climbed the ladder amid breathless silence , gained the ridgepole , balanced herself uprightly on that precarious footing , and started to walk along it , dizzily conscious that she was uncomfortably high up in the world and that walking ridgepoles was not a thing in which your imagination helped you out much . Nevertheless , she managed to take several steps before the catastrophe came . Then she swayed , lost her balance , stumbled , staggered , and fell , sliding down over the sun-baked roof and crashing off it through the tangle of Virginia creeper beneath — all before the dismayed circle below could give a simultaneous , terrified shriek .</p>
    <p n="1147">If<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had tumbled off the roof on the side up which she had ascended<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>would probably have fallen heir to the pearl bead ring then and there . Fortunately she fell on the other side , where the roof extended down over the porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was a much less serious thing . Nevertheless , when<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and the other girls had rushed frantically around the house — except<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>, who remained as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics — they found<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the Virginia creeper .</p>
    <p n="1148"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, are you killed ? ”</said>shrieked<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, throwing herself on her knees beside her friend .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, dear<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, speak just one word to me and tell me if you 're killed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1149">To the immense relief of all the girls , and especially of<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>, who , in spite of lack of imagination , had been seized with horrible visions of a future branded as the girl who was the cause of<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>'s early and tragic death ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sat dizzily up and answered uncertainly :</p>
    <p n="1150"><said who="#Anne">“ No ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, I am not killed , but I think I am rendered unconscious . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1151"><said who="#Carrie_Sloane">“ Where ? ”</said>sobbed<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Carrie Sloane</persName>.<said who="#Carrie_Sloane">“ Oh , where ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said>Before<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>could answer<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>appeared on the scene . At sight of her<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>tried to scramble to her feet , but sank back again with a sharp little cry of pain .</p>
    <p n="1152"><said who="#Mrs._Barry">“ What 's the matter ? Where have you hurt yourself ? ”</said>demanded<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1153"><said who="#Anne">“ My ankle , ”</said>gasped<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, please find your father and ask him to take me home . I know I can never walk there . And I 'm sure I could n't hop so far on one foot when<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>could n't even hop around the garden . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1154"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was out in the orchard picking a panful of summer apples when she saw<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>coming over the log bridge and up the slope , with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>beside him and a whole procession of little girls trailing after him . In his arms he carried<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, whose head lay limply against his shoulder .</p>
    <p n="1155">At that moment<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had a revelation . In the sudden stab of fear that pierced her very heart she realized what<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had come to mean to her . She would have admitted that she liked<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>— nay , that she was very fond of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. But now she knew as she hurried wildly down the slope that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was dearer to her than anything else on earth .</p>
    <p n="1156"><said who="#Anne">“<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>, what has happened to her ? ”</said>she gasped , more white and shaken than the self-contained , sensible<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had been for many years .</p>
    <p n="1157"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>herself answered , lifting her head .</p>
    <p n="1158"><said who="#Anne">“ Do n't be very frightened ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I was walking the ridgepole and I fell off . I expect I have sprained my ankle . But ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I might have broken my neck . Let us look on the bright side of things . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1159"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I might have known you 'd go and do something of the sort when I let you go to that party , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, sharp and shrewish in her very relief .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Bring her in here ,<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>, and lay her on the sofa . Mercy me , the child has gone and fainted ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1160">It was quite true . Overcome by the pain of her injury ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had one more of her wishes granted to her . She had fainted dead away .</p>
    <p n="1161"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, hastily summoned from the harvest field , was straightway dispatched for the doctor , who in due time came , to discover that the injury was more serious than they had supposed .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s ankle was broken .</p>
    <p n="1162">That night , when<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>went up to the east gable , where a white-faced girl was lying , a plaintive voice greeted her from the bed .</p>
    <p n="1163"><said who="#Anne">“ Are n't you very sorry for me ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1164"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It was your own fault , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, twitching down the blind and lighting a lamp .</p>
    <p n="1165"><said who="#Anne">“ And that is just why you should be sorry for me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne">“ because the thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard . If I could blame it on anybody I would feel so much better . But what would you have done ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1166"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'd have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away . Such absurdity ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1167"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sighed .</p>
    <p n="1168"><said who="#Anne">“ But you have such strength of mind ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I have n't . I just felt that I could n't bear<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>'s scorn . She would have crowed over me all my life . And I think I have been punished so much that you need n't be very cross with me ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. It 's not a bit nice to faint , after all . And the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle . I wo n't be able to go around for six or seven weeks and I 'll miss the new lady teacher . She wo n't be new any more by the time I 'm able to go to school . And<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gil</persName>— everybody will get ahead of me in class . Oh , I am an afflicted mortal . But I 'll try to bear it all bravely if only you wo n't be cross with me ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1169"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ There , there , I 'm not cross , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You 're an unlucky child , there 's no doubt about that ; but as you say , you 'll have the suffering of it . Here now , try and eat some supper . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1170"><said who="#Anne">“ Is n't it fortunate I 've got such an imagination ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ It will help me through splendidly , I expect . What do people who have n't any imagination do when they break their bones , do you suppose ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1171"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had good reason to bless her imagination many a time and oft during the tedious seven weeks that followed . But she was not solely dependent on it . She had many visitors and not a day passed without one or more of the schoolgirls dropping in to bring her flowers and books and tell her all the happenings in the juvenile world of Avonlea .</p>
    <p n="1172"><said who="#Anne">“ Everybody has been so good and kind ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>happily , on the day when she could first limp across the floor .<said who="#Anne">“ It is n't very pleasant to be laid up ; but there is a bright side to it ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. You find out how many friends you have . Why , even Superintendent<persName>Bell</persName>came to see me , and he 's really a very fine man . Not a kindred spirit , of course ; but still I like him and I 'm awfully sorry I ever criticized his prayers . I believe now he really does mean them , only he has got into the habit of saying them as if he did n't . He could get over that if he 'd take a little trouble . I gave him a good broad hint . I told him how hard I tried to make my own little private prayers interesting . He told me all about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy . It does seem so strange to think of Superintendent<persName>Bell</persName>ever being a boy . Even my imagination has its limits , for I can n't imagine THAT . When I try to imagine him as a boy I see him with gray whiskers and spectacles , just as he looks in Sunday school , only small . Now , it 's so easy to imagine<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>as a little girl .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>has been to see me fourteen times . Is n't that something to be proud of ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? When a minister 's wife has so many claims on her time ! She is such a cheerful person to have visit you , too . She never tells you it 's your own fault and she hopes you 'll be a better girl on account of it .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>always told me that when she came to see me ; and she said it in a kind of way that made me feel she might hope I 'd be a better girl but did n't really believe I would . Even<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>came to see me . I received her as politely as I could , because I think she was sorry she dared me to walk a ridgepole . If I had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden of remorse all her life .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>has been a faithful friend . She 's been over every day to cheer my lonely pillow . But oh , I shall be so glad when I can go to school for I 've heard such exciting things about the new teacher . The girls all think she is perfectly sweet .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>says she has the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes . She dresses beautifully , and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else 's in Avonlea . Every other Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody has to say a piece or take part in a dialogue . Oh , it 's just glorious to think of it .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>says she hates it but that is just because<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>has so little imagination .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>and<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>are preparing a dialogue , called ‘ A Morning Visit , ’ for next Friday . And the Friday afternoons they do n't have recitations<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>takes them all to the woods for a ‘ field ’ day and they study ferns and flowers and birds . And they have physical culture exercises every morning and evening .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says she never heard of such goings on and it all comes of having a lady teacher . But I think it must be splendid and I believe I shall find that<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>is a kindred spirit . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1173"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ There 's one thing plain to be seen ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ and that is that your fall off the<persName>Barry</persName>roof has n't injured your tongue at all . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="24">
    <p n="1174">It was October again when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was ready to go back to school — a glorious October , all red and gold , with mellow mornings when the valleys were filled with delicate mists as if the spirit of autumn had poured them in for the sun to drain — amethyst , pearl , silver , rose , and smoke-blue . The dews were so heavy that the fields glistened like cloth of silver and there were such heaps of rustling leaves in the hollows of many-stemmed woods to run crisply through .<persName>The Birch Path</persName>was a canopy of yellow and the ferns were sear and brown all along it . There was a tang in the very air that inspired the hearts of small maidens tripping , unlike snails , swiftly and willingly to school ; and it WAS jolly to be back again at the little brown desk beside<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, with<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>nodding across the aisle and<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Carrie Sloane</persName>sending up notes and<persName>Julia Bell</persName>passing a “ chew ” of gum down from the back seat .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>drew a long breath of happiness as she sharpened her pencil and arranged her picture cards in her desk . Life was certainly very interesting .</p>
    <p n="1175">In the new teacher she found another true and helpful friend .<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>was a bright , sympathetic young woman with the happy gift of winning and holding the affections of her pupils and bringing out the best that was in them mentally and morally .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>expanded like a flower under this wholesome influence and carried home to the admiring<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and the critical<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>glowing accounts of schoolwork and aims .</p>
    <p n="1176"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I love<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>with my whole heart ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. She is so ladylike and she has such a sweet voice . When she pronounces my name I feel INSTINCTIVELY that she 's spelling it with an E. We had recitations this afternoon . I just wish you could have been there to hear me recite ‘ Mary ,<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>of Scots . ’ I just put my whole soul into it .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>told me coming home that the way I said the line , ‘ Now for my father 's arm , ’ she said , ‘ my woman 's heart farewell , ’ just made her blood run cold . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1177"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , you might recite it for me some of these days , out in the barn , ”</said>suggested<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1178"><said who="#Anne">“ Of course I will , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>meditatively ,<said who="#Anne">“ but I wo n't be able to do it so well , I know . It wo n't be so exciting as it is when you have a whole schoolful before you hanging breathlessly on your words . I know I wo n't be able to make your blood run cold . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1179"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says it made HER blood run cold to see the boys climbing to the very tops of those big trees on<persName>Bell</persName>'s hill after crows ’ nests last Friday , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I wonder at<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>for encouraging it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1180"><said who="#Anne">“ But we wanted a crow 's nest for nature study , ”</said>explained<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ That was on our field afternoon . Field afternoons are splendid ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. And<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>explains everything so beautifully . We have to write compositions on our field afternoons and I write the best ones . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1181"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It 's very vain of you to say so then . You 'd better let your teacher say it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1182"><said who="#Anne">“ But she DID say it ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. And indeed I 'm not vain about it . How can I be , when I 'm such a dunce at geometry ? Although I 'm really beginning to see through it a little , too .<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>makes it so clear . Still , I 'll never be good at it and I assure you it is a humbling reflection . But I love writing compositions . Mostly<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>lets us choose our own subjects ; but next week we are to write a composition on some remarkable person . It 's hard to choose among so many remarkable people who have lived . Must n't it be splendid to be remarkable and have compositions written about you after you 're dead ? Oh , I would dearly love to be remarkable . I think when I grow up I 'll be a trained nurse and go with the Red Crosses to the field of battle as a messenger of mercy . That is , if I do n't go out as a foreign missionary . That would be very romantic , but one would have to be very good to be a missionary , and that would be a stumbling block . We have physical culture exercises every day , too . They make you graceful and promote digestion . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1183"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Promote fiddlesticks ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, who honestly thought it was all nonsense .</p>
    <p n="1184">But all the field afternoons and recitation Fridays and physical culture contortions paled before a project which<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>brought forward in November . This was that the scholars of Avonlea school should get up a concert and hold it in the hall on Christmas Night , for the laudable purpose of helping to pay for a schoolhouse flag . The pupils one and all taking graciously to this plan , the preparations for a program were begun at once . And of all the excited performers-elect none was so excited as<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, who threw herself into the undertaking heart and soul , hampered as she was by<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s disapproval .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>thought it all rank foolishness .</p>
    <p n="1185"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It 's just filling your heads up with nonsense and taking time that ought to be put on your lessons , ”</said>she grumbled .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't approve of children 's getting up concerts and racing about to practices . It makes them vain and forward and fond of gadding . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1186"><said who="#Anne">“ But think of the worthy object , ”</said>pleaded<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ A flag will cultivate a spirit of patriotism ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1187"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Fudge ! There 's precious little patriotism in the thoughts of any of you . All you want is a good time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1188"><said>“ Well , when you can combine patriotism and fun , is n't it all right ? Of course it 's real nice to be getting up a concert . We 're going to have six choruses and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>is to sing a solo . I 'm in two dialogues — ‘ The Society for the Suppression of Gossip ’ and ‘ The Fairy<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>. ’ The boys are going to have a dialogue too . And I 'm to have two recitations ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I just tremble when I think of it , but it 's a nice thrilly kind of tremble . And we 're to have a tableau at the last — ‘ Faith , Hope and Charity . ’<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>and I are to be in it , all draped in white with flowing hair . I 'm to be Hope , with my hands clasped — so — and my eyes uplifted . I 'm going to practice my recitations in the garret . Do n't be alarmed if you hear me groaning . I have to groan heartrendingly in one of them , and it 's really hard to get up a good artistic groan ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>is sulky because she did n't get the part she wanted in the dialogue . She wanted to be the fairy queen . That would have been ridiculous , for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>? Fairy queens must be slender .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>is to be the queen and I am to be one of her maids of honor .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>says she thinks a red-haired fairy is just as ridiculous as a fat one , but I do not let myself mind what<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>says . I 'm to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>is going to lend me her slippers because I have n't any of my own . It 's necessary for fairies to have slippers , you know . You could n't imagine a fairy wearing boots , could you ? Especially with copper toes ? We are going to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with pink tissue-paper roses in them . And we are all to march in two by two after the audience is seated , while Emma White plays a march on the organ . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I know you are not so enthusiastic about it as I am , but do n't you hope your little<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>will distinguish herself ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1189"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ All I hope is that you 'll behave yourself . I 'll be heartily glad when all this fuss is over and you 'll be able to settle down . You are simply good for nothing just now with your head stuffed full of dialogues and groans and tableaus . As for your tongue , it 's a marvel it 's not clean worn out . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1190"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sighed and betook herself to the back yard , over which a young new moon was shining through the leafless poplar boughs from an apple-green western sky , and where<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was splitting wood .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>perched herself on a block and talked the concert over with him , sure of an appreciative and sympathetic listener in this instance at least .</p>
    <p n="1191"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I reckon it 's going to be a pretty good concert . And I expect you 'll do your part fine , ”</said>he said , smiling down into her eager , vivacious little face .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>smiled back at him . Those two were the best of friends and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>thanked his stars many a time and oft that he had nothing to do with bringing her up . That was<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s exclusive duty ; if it had been his he would have been worried over frequent conflicts between inclination and said duty . As it was , he was free to , “ spoil<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>” —<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s phrasing — as much as he liked . But it was not such a bad arrangement after all ; a little “ appreciation ” sometimes does quite as much good as all the conscientious “ bringing up ” in the world .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="25">
    <p n="1192"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was having a bad ten minutes of it . He had come into the kitchen , in the twilight of a cold , gray December evening , and had sat down in the woodbox corner to take off his heavy boots , unconscious of the fact that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and a bevy of her schoolmates were having a practice of “ The Fairy<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>” in the sitting room . Presently they came trooping through the hall and out into the kitchen , laughing and chattering gaily . They did not see<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, who shrank bashfully back into the shadows beyond the woodbox with a boot in one hand and a bootjack in the other , and he watched them shyly for the aforesaid ten minutes as they put on caps and jackets and talked about the dialogue and the concert .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>stood among them , bright eyed and animated as they ; but<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>suddenly became conscious that there was something about her different from her mates . And what worried<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was that the difference impressed him as being something that should not exist .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had a brighter face , and bigger , starrier eyes , and more delicate features than the other ; even shy , unobservant<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had learned to take note of these things ; but the difference that disturbed him did not consist in any of these respects . Then in what did it consist ?</p>
    <p n="1193"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was haunted by this question long after the girls had gone , arm in arm , down the long , hard-frozen lane and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had betaken herself to her books . He could not refer it to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, who , he felt , would be quite sure to sniff scornfully and remark that the only difference she saw between<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and the other girls was that they sometimes kept their tongues quiet while<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>never did . This ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>felt , would be no great help .</p>
    <p n="1194">He had recourse to his pipe that evening to help him study it out , much to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s disgust . After two hours of smoking and hard reflection<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>arrived at a solution of his problem .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was not dressed like the other girls !</p>
    <p n="1195">The more<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>thought about the matter the more he was convinced that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>never had been dressed like the other girls — never since she had come to Green Gables .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>kept her clothed in plain , dark dresses , all made after the same unvarying pattern . If<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>knew there was such a thing as fashion in dress it was as much as he did ; but he was quite sure that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s sleeves did not look at all like the sleeves the other girls wore . He recalled the cluster of little girls he had seen around her that evening — all gay in waists of red and blue and pink and white — and he wondered why<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>always kept her so plainly and soberly gowned .</p>
    <p n="1196">Of course , it must be all right .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>knew best and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was bringing her up . Probably some wise , inscrutable motive was to be served thereby . But surely it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty dress — something like<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana Barry</persName>always wore .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>decided that he would give her one ; that surely could not be objected to as an unwarranted putting in of his oar . Christmas was only a fortnight off . A nice new dress would be the very thing for a present .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, with a sigh of satisfaction , put away his pipe and went to bed , while<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>opened all the doors and aired the house .</p>
    <p n="1197">The very next evening<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>betook himself to Carmody to buy the dress , determined to get the worst over and have done with it . It would be , he felt assured , no trifling ordeal . There were some things<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>could buy and prove himself no mean bargainer ; but he knew he would be at the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl 's dress .</p>
    <p n="1198">After much cogitation<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>resolved to go to Samuel Lawson 's store instead of<persName corresp="#William_Blair">William Blair</persName>'s . To be sure , the Cuthberts always had gone to<persName corresp="#William_Blair">William Blair</persName>'s ; it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them as to attend the Presbyterian church and vote Conservative . But<persName corresp="#William_Blair">William Blair</persName>'s two daughters frequently waited on customers there and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>held them in absolute dread . He could contrive to deal with them when he knew exactly what he wanted and could point it out ; but in such a matter as this , requiring explanation and consultation ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>felt that he must be sure of a man behind the counter . So he would go to Lawson 's , where Samuel or his son would wait on him .</p>
    <p n="1199">Alas !<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>did not know that Samuel , in the recent expansion of his business , had set up a lady clerk also ; she was a niece of his wife 's and a very dashing young person indeed , with a huge , drooping pompadour , big , rolling brown eyes , and a most extensive and bewildering smile . She was dressed with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets that glittered and rattled and tinkled with every movement of her hands .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was covered with confusion at finding her there at all ; and those bangles completely wrecked his wits at one fell swoop .</p>
    <p n="1200"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ What can I do for you this evening ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cuthbert">Mr. Cuthbert</persName>? ”</said>Miss Lucilla Harris inquired , briskly and ingratiatingly , tapping the counter with both hands .</p>
    <p n="1201"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Have you any — any — any — well now , say any garden rakes ? ”</said>stammered<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1202">Miss Harris looked somewhat surprised , as well she might , to hear a man inquiring for garden rakes in the middle of December .</p>
    <p n="1203"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I believe we have one or two left over , ”</said>she said ,<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ but they 're upstairs in the lumber room . I 'll go and see . ”</said>During her absence<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>collected his scattered senses for another effort .</p>
    <p n="1204">When Miss Harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired :<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Anything else tonight ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Cuthbert">Mr. Cuthbert</persName>? ”</said><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>took his courage in both hands and replied :<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , since you suggest it , I might as well — take — that is — look at — buy some — some hayseed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1205">Miss Harris had heard<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>called odd . She now concluded that he was entirely crazy .</p>
    <p n="1206"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ We only keep hayseed in the spring , ”</said>she explained loftily .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ We 've none on hand just now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1207"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Oh , certainly — certainly — just as you say , ”</said>stammered unhappy<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, seizing the rake and making for the door . At the threshold he recollected that he had not paid for it and he turned miserably back . While Miss Harris was counting out his change he rallied his powers for a final desperate attempt .</p>
    <p n="1208"><said who="#William_Blair">“ Well now — if it is n't too much trouble — I might as well — that is — I 'd like to look at — at — some sugar . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1209"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ White or brown ? ”</said>queried Miss Harris patiently .</p>
    <p n="1210"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Oh — well now — brown , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>feebly .</p>
    <p n="1211"><said who="#William_Blair">“ There 's a barrel of it over there , ”</said>said Miss Harris , shaking her bangles at it .<said who="#William_Blair">“ It 's the only kind we have . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1212"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I 'll — I 'll take twenty pounds of it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, with beads of perspiration standing on his forehead .</p>
    <p n="1213"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had driven halfway home before he was his own man again . It had been a gruesome experience , but it served him right , he thought , for committing the heresy of going to a strange store . When he reached home he hid the rake in the tool house , but the sugar he carried in to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1214"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Brown sugar ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Whatever possessed you to get so much ? You know I never use it except for the hired man 's porridge or black fruit cake . Jerry 's gone and I 've made my cake long ago . It 's not good sugar , either — it 's coarse and dark —<persName corresp="#William_Blair">William Blair</persName>does n't usually keep sugar like that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1215"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I — I thought it might come in handy sometime , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, making good his escape .</p>
    <p n="1216">When<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>came to think the matter over he decided that a woman was required to cope with the situation .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was out of the question .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>felt sure she would throw cold water on his project at once . Remained only<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>; for of no other woman in Avonlea would<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>have dared to ask advice . To<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>he went accordingly , and that good lady promptly took the matter out of the harassed man 's hands .</p>
    <p n="1217"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Pick out a dress for you to give<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? To be sure I will . I 'm going to Carmody tomorrow and I 'll attend to it . Have you something particular in mind ? No ? Well , I 'll just go by my own judgment then . I believe a nice rich brown would just suit<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, and<persName corresp="#William_Blair">William Blair</persName>has some new gloria in that 's real pretty . Perhaps you 'd like me to make it up for her , too , seeing that if<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was to make it<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>would probably get wind of it before the time and spoil the surprise ? Well , I 'll do it . No , it is n't a mite of trouble . I like sewing . I 'll make it to fit my niece , Jenny<persName>Gillis</persName>, for she and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>are as like as two peas as far as figure goes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1218"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I 'm much obliged , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>,<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ and — and — I dunno — but I 'd like — I think they make the sleeves different nowadays to what they used to be . If it would n't be asking too much I — I 'd like them made in the new way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1219"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Puffs ? Of course . You need n't worry a speck more about it ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. I 'll make it up in the very latest fashion , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>. To herself she added when<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had gone :</p>
    <p n="1220"><said>“ It 'll be a real satisfaction to see that poor child wearing something decent for once . The way<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>dresses her is positively ridiculous , that 's what , and I 've ached to tell her so plainly a dozen times . I 've held my tongue though , for I can see<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>does n't want advice and she thinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all she 's an old maid . But that 's always the way . Folks that has brought up children know that there 's no hard and fast method in the world that 'll suit every child . But them as never have think it 's all as plain and easy as Rule of Three — just set your three terms down so fashion , and the sum 'll work out correct . But flesh and blood do n't come under the head of arithmetic and that 's where<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>makes her mistake . I suppose she 's trying to cultivate a spirit of humility in<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>by dressing her as she does ; but it 's more likely to cultivate envy and discontent . I 'm sure the child must feel the difference between her clothes and the other girls ’ . But to think of<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>taking notice of it ! That man is waking up after being asleep for over sixty years . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1221"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>knew all the following fortnight that<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had something on his mind , but what it was she could not guess , until Christmas Eve , when<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>brought up the new dress .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>behaved pretty well on the whole , although it is very likely she distrusted<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>'s diplomatic explanation that she had made the dress because<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was afraid<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>would find out about it too soon if<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>made it .</p>
    <p n="1222"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ So this is what<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>has been looking so mysterious over and grinning about to himself for two weeks , is it ? ”</said>she said a little stiffly but tolerantly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I knew he was up to some foolishness . Well , I must say I do n't think<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>needed any more dresses . I made her three good , warm , serviceable ones this fall , and anything more is sheer extravagance . There 's enough material in those sleeves alone to make a waist , I declare there is . You 'll just pamper<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s vanity ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, and she 's as vain as a peacock now . Well , I hope she 'll be satisfied at last , for I know she 's been hankering after those silly sleeves ever since they came in , although she never said a word after the first . The puffs have been getting bigger and more ridiculous right along ; they 're as big as balloons now . Next year anybody who wears them will have to go through a door sideways . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1223">Christmas morning broke on a beautiful white world . It had been a very mild December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas ; but just enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure Avonlea .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>peeped out from her frosted gable window with delighted eyes . The firs in the Haunted Wood were all feathery and wonderful ; the birches and wild cherry trees were outlined in pearl ; the plowed fields were stretches of snowy dimples ; and there was a crisp tang in the air that was glorious .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>ran downstairs singing until her voice reechoed through Green Gables .</p>
    <p n="1224"><said who="#Anne">“ Merry Christmas ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>! Merry Christmas ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>! Is n't it a lovely Christmas ? I 'm so glad it 's white . Any other kind of Christmas does n't seem real , does it ? I do n't like green Christmases . They 're not green — they 're just nasty faded browns and grays . What makes people call them green ? Why — why —<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, is that for me ? Oh ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1225"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and held it out with a deprecatory glance at<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, who feigned to be contemptuously filling the teapot , but nevertheless watched the scene out of the corner of her eye with a rather interested air .</p>
    <p n="1226"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence . Oh , how pretty it was — a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk ; a skirt with dainty frills and shirrings ; a waist elaborately pintucked in the most fashionable way , with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck . But the sleeves — they were the crowning glory ! Long elbow cuffs , and above them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of brown-silk ribbon .</p>
    <p n="1227"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ That 's a Christmas present for you ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>shyly .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Why — why —<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, do n't you like it ? Well now — well now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1228">For<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s eyes had suddenly filled with tears .</p>
    <p n="1229"><said who="#Anne">“ Like it ! Oh ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>! ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>laid the dress over a chair and clasped her hands .<said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, it 's perfectly exquisite . Oh , I can never thank you enough . Look at those sleeves ! Oh , it seems to me this must be a happy dream . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1230"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , well , let us have breakfast , ”</said>interrupted<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I must say ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, I do n't think you needed the dress ; but since<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>has got it for you , see that you take good care of it . There 's a hair ribbon<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>left for you . It 's brown , to match the dress . Come now , sit in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1231"><said who="#Anne">“ I do n't see how I 'm going to eat breakfast , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>rapturously .<said who="#Anne">“ Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment . I 'd rather feast my eyes on that dress . I 'm so glad that puffed sleeves are still fashionable . It did seem to me that I 'd never get over it if they went out before I had a dress with them . I 'd never have felt quite satisfied , you see . It was lovely of<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>to give me the ribbon too . I feel that I ought to be a very good girl indeed . It 's at times like this I 'm sorry I 'm not a model little girl ; and I always resolve that I will be in future . But somehow it 's hard to carry out your resolutions when irresistible temptations come . Still , I really will make an extra effort after this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1232">When the commonplace breakfast was over<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>appeared , crossing the white log bridge in the hollow , a gay little figure in her crimson ulster .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>flew down the slope to meet her .</p>
    <p n="1233"><said who="#Anne">“ Merry Christmas ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>! And oh , it 's a wonderful Christmas . I 've something splendid to show you .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>has given me the loveliest dress , with SUCH sleeves . I could n't even imagine any nicer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1234"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I 've got something more for you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>breathlessly .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Here — this box .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Aunt Josephine</persName>sent us out a big box with ever so many things in it — and this is for you . I 'd have brought it over last night , but it did n't come until after dark , and I never feel very comfortable coming through the Haunted Wood in the dark now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1235"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>opened the box and peeped in . First a card with “ For the Anne-girl and Merry Christmas , ” written on it ; and then , a pair of the daintiest little kid slippers , with beaded toes and satin bows and glistening buckles .</p>
    <p n="1236"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, this is too much . I must be dreaming . ”</said></p>

Mind you , Rob Wright went home with<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Gertie Pye</persName>from the practice night before last . Did you ever hear anything equal to that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1238">All the Avonlea scholars were in a fever of excitement that day , for the hall had to be decorated and a last grand rehearsal held .</p>
    <p n="1239">The concert came off in the evening and was a pronounced success . The little hall was crowded ; all the performers did excellently well , but<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was the bright particular star of the occasion , as even envy , in the shape of<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>, dared not deny .</p>
    <p n="1240"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , has n't it been a brilliant evening ? ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, when it was all over and she and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>were walking home together under a dark , starry sky .</p>
    <p n="1241"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Everything went off very well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>practically .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I guess we must have made as much as ten dollars .

    <p n="1242"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, will we really see our names in print ? It makes me thrill to think of it . Your solo was perfectly elegant ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. I felt prouder than you did when it was encored . I just said to myself , ‘ It is my dear bosom friend who is so honored . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="1243"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Well , your recitations just brought down the house ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. That sad one was simply splendid . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1244"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I was so nervous ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. When<persName>Mr. Allan</persName>called out my name I really cannot tell how I ever got up on that platform . I felt as if a million eyes were looking at me and through me , and for one dreadful moment I was sure I could n't begin at all . Then I thought of my lovely puffed sleeves and took courage . I knew that I must live up to those sleeves ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. So I started in , and my voice seemed to be coming from ever so far away . I just felt like a parrot . It 's providential that I practiced those recitations so often up in the garret , or I 'd never have been able to get through . Did I groan all right ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1245"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Yes , indeed , you groaned lovely , ”</said>assured<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1246"><said who="#Anne">“ I saw old Mrs.<persName corresp="#Carrie_Sloane">Sloane</persName>wiping away tears when I sat down . It was splendid to think I had touched somebody 's heart . It 's so romantic to take part in a concert , is n't it ? Oh , it 's been a very memorable occasion indeed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1247"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Was n't the boys ’ dialogue fine ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>was just splendid .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, I do think it 's awful mean the way you treat<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gil</persName>. Wait till I tell you . When you ran off the platform after the fairy dialogue one of your roses fell out of your hair . I saw<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gil</persName>pick it up and put it in his breast pocket . There now . You 're so romantic that I 'm sure you ought to be pleased at that . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1249">That night<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, who had been out to a concert for the first time in twenty years , sat for a while by the kitchen fire after<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had gone to bed .</p>
    <p n="1250"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I guess our<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>did as well as any of them , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>proudly .</p>

    <p n="1253"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ There 's time enough to think of that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ She 's only thirteen in March . Though tonight it struck me she was growing quite a big girl .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>made that dress a mite too long , and it makes<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>look so tall . She 's quick to learn and I guess the best thing we can do for her will be to send her to<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s after a spell .

   <div type="chapter" n="26">
    <p n="1255">Junior Avonlea found it hard to settle down to humdrum existence again . To<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>in particular things seemed fearfully flat , stale , and unprofitable after the goblet of excitement she had been sipping for weeks . Could she go back to the former quiet pleasures of those faraway days before the concert ? At first , as she told<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, she did not really think she could .</p>
    <p n="1256"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm positively certain ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, that life can never be quite the same again as it was in those olden days , ”</said>she said mournfully , as if referring to a period of at least fifty years back .<said who="#Anne">“ Perhaps after a while I 'll get used to it , but I 'm afraid concerts spoil people for everyday life . I suppose that is why<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>disapproves of them .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>is such a sensible woman . It must be a great deal better to be sensible ; but still , I do n't believe I 'd really want to be a sensible person , because they are so unromantic .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says there is no danger of my ever being one , but you can never tell . I feel just now that I may grow up to be sensible yet . But perhaps that is only because I 'm tired . I simply could n't sleep last night for ever so long . I just lay awake and imagined the concert over and over again . That 's one splendid thing about such affairs — it 's so lovely to look back to them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1257">Eventually , however , Avonlea school slipped back into its old groove and took up its old interests . To be sure , the concert left traces .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>and Emma White , who had quarreled over a point of precedence in their platform seats , no longer sat at the same desk , and a promising friendship of three years was broken up .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>and<persName>Julia Bell</persName>did not “ speak ” for three months , because<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>had told Bessie Wright that<persName>Julia Bell</persName>'s bow when she got up to recite made her think of a chicken jerking its head , and Bessie told Julia . None of the Sloanes would have any dealings with the Bells , because the Bells had declared that the Sloanes had too much to do in the program , and the Sloanes had retorted that the Bells were not capable of doing the little they had to do properly . Finally ,<persName>Charlie Sloane</persName>fought<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>MacPherson , because<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>had said that<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>put on airs about her recitations , and<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>was “ licked ” ; consequently<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>'s sister , Ella May , would not “ speak ” to<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>all the rest of the winter . With the exception of these trifling frictions , work in<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>'s little kingdom went on with regularity and smoothness .</p>
    <p n="1258">The winter weeks slipped by . It was an unusually mild winter , with so little snow that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>could go to school nearly every day by way of<persName>the Birch Path</persName>. On<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s birthday they were tripping lightly down it , keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter , for<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>had told them that they must soon write a composition on “ A Winter 's Walk in the Woods , ” and it behooved them to be observant .</p>
    <p n="1259"><said who="#Anne">“ Just think ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, I 'm thirteen years old today , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>in an awed voice .<said who="#Anne">“ I can scarcely realize that I 'm in my teens . When I woke this morning it seemed to me that everything must be different . You 've been thirteen for a month , so I suppose it does n't seem such a novelty to you as it does to me . It makes life seem so much more interesting . In two more years I 'll be really grown up . It 's a great comfort to think that I 'll be able to use big words then without being laughed at . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1260"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>says she means to have a beau as soon as she 's fifteen , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1261"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>thinks of nothing but beaus , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>disdainfully .<said who="#Anne">“ She 's actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a take-notice for all she pretends to be so mad . But I 'm afraid that is an uncharitable speech .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>says we should never make uncharitable speeches ; but they do slip out so often before you think , do n't they ? I simply can n't talk about<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>without making an uncharitable speech , so I never mention her at all . You may have noticed that . I 'm trying to be as much like<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>as I possibly can , for I think she 's perfect .<persName>Mr. Allan</persName>thinks so too .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says he just worships the ground she treads on and she does n't really think it right for a minister to set his affections so much on a mortal being . But then ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, even ministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody else . I had such an interesting talk with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>about besetting sins last Sunday afternoon . There are just a few things it 's proper to talk about on Sundays and that is one of them . My besetting sin is imagining too much and forgetting my duties . I 'm striving very hard to overcome it and now that I 'm really thirteen perhaps I 'll get on better . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1262"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ In four more years we 'll be able to put our hair up , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Alice<persName>Bell</persName>is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up , but I think that 's ridiculous . I shall wait until I 'm seventeen . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1263"><said who="#Anne">“ If I had Alice<persName>Bell</persName>'s crooked nose , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>decidedly ,<said who="#Anne">“ I would n't — but there ! I wo n't say what I was going to because it was extremely uncharitable . Besides , I was comparing it with my own nose and that 's vanity . I 'm afraid I think too much about my nose ever since I heard that compliment about it long ago . It really is a great comfort to me . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, look , there 's a rabbit . That 's something to remember for our woods composition . I really think the woods are just as lovely in winter as in summer . They 're so white and still , as if they were asleep and dreaming pretty dreams . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1264"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I wo n't mind writing that composition when its time comes , ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I can manage to write about the woods , but the one we 're to hand in Monday is terrible . The idea of<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>telling us to write a story out of our own heads ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1265"><said who="#Anne">“ Why , it 's as easy as wink , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1266"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It 's easy for you because you have an imagination , ”</said>retorted<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>,<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ but what would you do if you had been born without one ? I suppose you have your composition all done ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1267"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>nodded , trying hard not to look virtuously complacent and failing miserably .</p>
    <p n="1268"><said who="#Anne">“ I wrote it last Monday evening . It 's called ‘ The Jealous Rival ; or In Death Not Divided . ’ I read it to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>and she said it was stuff and nonsense . Then I read it to<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and he said it was fine . That is the kind of critic I like . It 's a sad , sweet story . I just cried like a child while I was writing it . It 's about two beautiful maidens called<persName>Cordelia</persName>Montmorency and<persName>Geraldine</persName>Seymour who lived in the same village and were devotedly attached to each other .<persName>Cordelia</persName>was a regal brunette with a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes .<persName>Geraldine</persName>was a queenly blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1269"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I never saw anybody with purple eyes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>dubiously .</p>
    <p n="1270"><said who="#Anne">“ Neither did I. I just imagined them . I wanted something out of the common .<persName>Geraldine</persName>had an alabaster brow too . I 've found out what an alabaster brow is . That is one of the advantages of being thirteen . You know so much more than you did when you were only twelve . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1271"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Well , what became of<persName>Cordelia</persName>and<persName>Geraldine</persName>? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, who was beginning to feel rather interested in their fate .</p>
    <p n="1272"><said who="#Anne">“ They grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen . Then<persName>Bertram</persName>DeVere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair<persName>Geraldine</persName>. He saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a carriage , and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three miles ; because , you understand , the carriage was all smashed up . I found it rather hard to imagine the proposal because I had no experience to go by . I asked<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>if she knew anything about how men proposed because I thought she 'd likely be an authority on the subject , having so many sisters married .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>told me she was hid in the hall pantry when Malcolm Andres proposed to her sister Susan . She said Malcolm told Susan that his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said , ‘ What do you say , darling pet , if we get hitched this fall ? ’ And Susan said , ‘ Yes — no — I do n't know — let me see ’ — and there they were , engaged as quick as that . But I did n't think that sort of a proposal was a very romantic one , so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could . I made it very flowery and poetical and<persName>Bertram</persName>went on his knees , although<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>says it is n't done nowadays .<persName>Geraldine</persName>accepted him in a speech a page long . I can tell you I took a lot of trouble with that speech . I rewrote it five times and I look upon it as my masterpiece .<persName>Bertram</persName>gave her a diamond ring and a ruby necklace and told her they would go to Europe for a wedding tour , for he was immensely wealthy . But then , alas , shadows began to darken over their path .<persName>Cordelia</persName>was secretly in love with<persName>Bertram</persName>herself and when<persName>Geraldine</persName>told her about the engagement she was simply furious , especially when she saw the necklace and the diamond ring . All her affection for<persName>Geraldine</persName>turned to bitter hate and she vowed that she should never marry<persName>Bertram</persName>. But she pretended to be<persName>Geraldine</persName>'s friend the same as ever . One evening they were standing on the bridge over a rushing turbulent stream and<persName>Cordelia</persName>, thinking they were alone , pushed<persName>Geraldine</persName>over the brink with a wild , mocking , ‘ Ha , ha , ha . ’ But<persName>Bertram</persName>saw it all and he at once plunged into the current , exclaiming , ‘ I will save thee , my peerless<persName>Geraldine</persName>. ’ But alas , he had forgotten he could n't swim , and they were both drowned , clasped in each other 's arms . Their bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards . They were buried in the one grave and their funeral was most imposing ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. It 's so much more romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding . As for<persName>Cordelia</persName>, she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic asylum . I thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1273"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ How perfectly lovely ! ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, who belonged to<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s school of critics .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I do n't see how you can make up such thrilling things out of your own head ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. I wish my imagination was as good as yours . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1274"><said who="#Anne">“ It would be if you 'd only cultivate it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>cheeringly .<said who="#Anne">“ I 've just thought of a plan ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. Let you and me have a story club all our own and write stories for practice . I 'll help you along until you can do them by yourself . You ought to cultivate your imagination , you know .<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>says so . Only we must take the right way . I told her about the Haunted Wood , but she said we went the wrong way about it in that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1275">This was how the story club came into existence . It was limited to<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>at first , but soon it was extended to include<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>and one or two others who felt that their imaginations needed cultivating . No boys were allowed in it — although<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>opined that their admission would make it more exciting — and each member had to produce one story a week .</p>
    <p n="1276"><said who="#Anne">“ It 's extremely interesting , ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>told<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Each girl has to read her story out loud and then we talk it over . We are going to keep them all sacredly and have them to read to our descendants . We each write under a nom-de-plume . Mine is Rosamond Montmorency . All the girls do pretty well .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>is rather sentimental . She puts too much lovemaking into her stories and you know too much is worse than too little .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>never puts any because she says it makes her feel so silly when she had to read it out loud .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>'s stories are extremely sensible . Then<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>puts too many murders into hers . She says most of the time she does n't know what to do with the people so she kills them off to get rid of them . I mostly always have to tell them what to write about , but that is n't hard for I 've millions of ideas . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1277"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I think this story-writing business is the foolishest yet , ”</said>scoffed<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You 'll get a pack of nonsense into your heads and waste time that should be put on your lessons . Reading stories is bad enough but writing them is worse . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1278"><said who="#Anne">“ But we 're so careful to put a moral into them all ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>explained<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I insist upon that . All the good people are rewarded and all the bad ones are suitably punished . I 'm sure that must have a wholesome effect . The moral is the great thing .<persName>Mr. Allan</persName>says so . I read one of my stories to him and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>and they both agreed that the moral was excellent . Only they laughed in the wrong places . I like it better when people cry .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>almost always cry when I come to the pathetic parts .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>wrote her<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Aunt Josephine</persName>about our club and her<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Aunt Josephine</persName>wrote back that we were to send her some of our stories . So we copied out four of our very best and sent them . Miss<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josephine Barry</persName>wrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life . That kind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost everybody died . But I 'm glad<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>liked them . It shows our club is doing some good in the world .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>says that ought to be our object in everything . I do really try to make it my object but I forget so often when I 'm having fun . I hope I shall be a little like<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>when I grow up . Do you think there is any prospect of it ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1279">“ I should n't say there was a great deal ” was<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s encouraging answer .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'm sure<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>was never such a silly , forgetful little girl as you are . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1280"><said who="#Anne">“ No ; but she was n't always so good as she is now either , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>seriously .<said who="#Anne">“ She told me so herself — that is , she said she was a dreadful mischief when she was a girl and was always getting into scrapes . I felt so encouraged when I heard that . Is it very wicked of me ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, to feel encouraged when I hear that other people have been bad and mischievous ?<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says it is .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says she always feels shocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty , no matter how small they were .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says she once heard a minister confess that when he was a boy he stole a strawberry tart out of his aunt 's pantry and she never had any respect for that minister again . Now , I would n't have felt that way . I 'd have thought that it was real noble of him to confess it , and I 'd have thought what an encouraging thing it would be for small boys nowadays who do naughty things and are sorry for them to know that perhaps they may grow up to be ministers in spite of it . That 's how I 'd feel ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1281"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ The way I feel at present ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ is that it 's high time you had those dishes washed .

    <p n="1282"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, walking home one late April evening from an Aid meeting , realized that the winter was over and gone with the thrill of delight that spring never fails to bring to the oldest and saddest as well as to the youngest and merriest .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was not given to subjective analysis of her thoughts and feelings . She probably imagined that she was thinking about the Aids and their missionary box and the new carpet for the vestry room , but under these reflections was a harmonious consciousness of red fields smoking into pale-purply mists in the declining sun , of long , sharp-pointed fir shadows falling over the meadow beyond the brook , of still , crimson-budded maples around a mirrorlike wood pool , of a wakening in the world and a stir of hidden pulses under the gray sod . The spring was abroad in the land and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s sober , middle-aged step was lighter and swifter because of its deep , primal gladness .</p>
    <p n="1283">Her eyes dwelt affectionately on Green Gables , peering through its network of trees and reflecting the sunlight back from its windows in several little coruscations of glory .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, as she picked her steps along the damp lane , thought that it was really a satisfaction to know that she was going home to a briskly snapping wood fire and a table nicely spread for tea , instead of to the cold comfort of old Aid meeting evenings before<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had come to Green Gables .</p>
    <p n="1284">Consequently , when<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>entered her kitchen and found the fire black out , with no sign of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>anywhere , she felt justly disappointed and irritated . She had told<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>to be sure and have tea ready at five o'clock , but now she must hurry to take off her second-best dress and prepare the meal herself against<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s return from plowing .</p>
    <p n="1285"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'll settle Miss<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>when she comes home , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>grimly , as she shaved up kindlings with a carving knife and with more vim than was strictly necessary .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had come in and was waiting patiently for his tea in his corner .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ She 's gadding off somewhere with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, writing stories or practicing dialogues or some such tomfoolery , and never thinking once about the time or her duties . She 's just got to be pulled up short and sudden on this sort of thing . I do n't care if<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>does say she 's the brightest and sweetest child she ever knew . She may be bright and sweet enough , but her head is full of nonsense and there 's never any knowing what shape it 'll break out in next . Just as soon as she grows out of one freak she takes up with another . But there ! Here I am saying the very thing I was so riled with<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel Lynde</persName>for saying at the Aid today . I was real glad when<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>spoke up for<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, for if she had n't I know I 'd have said something too sharp to<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>before everybody .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s got plenty of faults , goodness knows , and far be it from me to deny it . But I 'm bringing her up and not<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel Lynde</persName>, who 'd pick faults in the Angel Gabriel himself if he lived in Avonlea . Just the same ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>has no business to leave the house like this when I told her she was to stay home this afternoon and look after things . I must say , with all her faults , I never found her disobedient or untrustworthy before and I 'm real sorry to find her so now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1286"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I dunno , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, who , being patient and wise and , above all , hungry , had deemed it best to let<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>talk her wrath out unhindered , having learned by experience that she got through with whatever work was on hand much quicker if not delayed by untimely argument .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Perhaps you 're judging her too hasty ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. Do n't call her untrustworthy until you 're sure she has disobeyed you . Mebbe it can all be explained —<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s a great hand at explaining . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1287"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ She 's not here when I told her to stay , ”</said>retorted<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I reckon she 'll find it hard to explain THAT to my satisfaction . Of course I knew you 'd take her part ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. But I 'm bringing her up , not you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1288">It was dark when supper was ready , and still no sign of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, coming hurriedly over the log bridge or up Lover 's Lane , breathless and repentant with a sense of neglected duties .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>washed and put away the dishes grimly . Then , wanting a candle to light her way down the cellar , she went up to the east gable for the one that generally stood on<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s table . Lighting it , she turned around to see<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>herself lying on the bed , face downward among the pillows .</p>
    <p n="1289"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Mercy on us , ”</said>said astonished<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ have you been asleep ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1290"><said who="#Anne">“ No , ”</said>was the muffled reply .</p>
    <p n="1291"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Are you sick then ? ”</said>demanded<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>anxiously , going over to the bed .</p>
    <p n="1292"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>cowered deeper into her pillows as if desirous of hiding herself forever from mortal eyes .</p>
    <p n="1293"><said who="#Anne">“ No . But please ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, go away and do n't look at me . I 'm in the depths of despair and I do n't care who gets head in class or writes the best composition or sings in the Sunday-school choir any more . Little things like that are of no importance now because I do n't suppose I 'll ever be able to go anywhere again . My career is closed . Please ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, go away and do n't look at me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1294"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Did anyone ever hear the like ? ”</said>the mystified<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>wanted to know .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, whatever is the matter with you ? What have you done ? Get right up this minute and tell me . This minute , I say . There now , what is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1295"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had slid to the floor in despairing obedience .</p>
    <p n="1296"><said who="#Anne">“ Look at my hair ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>she whispered .</p>
    <p n="1297">Accordingly ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>lifted her candle and looked scrutinizingly at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s hair , flowing in heavy masses down her back . It certainly had a very strange appearance .</p>
    <p n="1298"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, what have you done to your hair ? Why , it 's GREEN ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1299">Green it might be called , if it were any earthly color — a queer , dull , bronzy green , with streaks here and there of the original red to heighten the ghastly effect . Never in all her life had<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>seen anything so grotesque as<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s hair at that moment .</p>
    <p n="1300"><said who="#Anne">“ Yes , it 's green , ”</said>moaned<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I thought nothing could be as bad as red hair . But now I know it 's ten times worse to have green hair . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, you little know how utterly wretched I am . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1301"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I little know how you got into this fix , but I mean to find out , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Come right down to the kitchen — it 's too cold up here — and tell me just what you 've done . I 've been expecting something queer for some time . You have n't got into any scrape for over two months , and I was sure another one was due . Now , then , what did you do to your hair ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1302"><said who="#Anne">“ I dyed it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1303"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Dyed it ! Dyed your hair !<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, did n't you know it was a wicked thing to do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1304"><said who="#Anne">“ Yes , I knew it was a little wicked , ”</said>admitted<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ But I thought it was worth while to be a little wicked to get rid of red hair . I counted the cost ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. Besides , I meant to be extra good in other ways to make up for it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1305"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sarcastically ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ if I 'd decided it was worth while to dye my hair I 'd have dyed it a decent color at least . I would n't have dyed it green . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1306"><said who="#Anne">“ But I did n't mean to dye it green ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>protested<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>dejectedly .<said who="#Anne">“ If I was wicked I meant to be wicked to some purpose . He said it would turn my hair a beautiful raven black — he positively assured me that it would . How could I doubt his word ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? I know what it feels like to have your word doubted . And<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>says we should never suspect anyone of not telling us the truth unless we have proof that they 're not . I have proof now — green hair is proof enough for anybody . But I had n't then and I believed every word he said IMPLICITLY . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1307"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Who said ? Who are you talking about ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1308"><said who="#Anne">“ The peddler that was here this afternoon . I bought the dye from him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1309"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, how often have I told you never to let one of those Italians in the house ! I do n't believe in encouraging them to come around at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1310"><said who="#Anne_Shirley">“ Oh , I did n't let him in the house . I remembered what you told me , and I went out , carefully shut the door , and looked at his things on the step . Besides , he was n't an Italian — he was a German Jew . He had a big box full of very interesting things and he told me he was working hard to make enough money to bring his wife and children out from Germany . He spoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart . I wanted to buy something from him to help him in such a worthy object . Then all at once I saw the bottle of hair dye . The peddler said it was warranted to dye any hair a beautiful raven black and would n't wash off . In a trice I saw myself with beautiful raven-black hair and the temptation was irresistible . But the price of the bottle was seventy-five cents and I had only fifty cents left out of my chicken money . I think the peddler had a very kind heart , for he said that , seeing it was me , he 'd sell it for fifty cents and that was just giving it away . So I bought it , and as soon as he had gone I came up here and applied it with an old hairbrush as the directions said . I used up the whole bottle , and oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, when I saw the dreadful color it turned my hair I repented of being wicked , I can tell you . And I 've been repenting ever since . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1311"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , I hope you 'll repent to good purpose , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>severely ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ and that you 've got your eyes opened to where your vanity has led you ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. Goodness knows what 's to be done . I suppose the first thing is to give your hair a good washing and see if that will do any good . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1312">Accordingly ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>washed her hair , scrubbing it vigorously with soap and water , but for all the difference it made she might as well have been scouring its original red . The peddler had certainly spoken the truth when he declared that the dye would n't wash off , however his veracity might be impeached in other respects .</p>
    <p n="1313"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, what shall I do ? ”</said>questioned<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>in tears .<said who="#Anne">“ I can never live this down . People have pretty well forgotten my other mistakes — the liniment cake and setting<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>drunk and flying into a temper with<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>. But they 'll never forget this . They will think I am not respectable . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ‘ what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive . ’ That is poetry , but it is true . And oh , how<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>will laugh !<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I CANNOT face<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>. I am the unhappiest girl in Prince Edward Island . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1314"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s unhappiness continued for a week . During that time she went nowhere and shampooed her hair every day .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>alone of outsiders knew the fatal secret , but she promised solemnly never to tell , and it may be stated here and now that she kept her word . At the end of the week<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>said decidedly :</p>
    <p n="1315"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It 's no use ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. That is fast dye if ever there was any . Your hair must be cut off ; there is no other way . You can n't go out with it looking like that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1316"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s lips quivered , but she realized the bitter truth of<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s remarks . With a dismal sigh she went for the scissors .</p>
    <p n="1317"><said who="#Anne">“ Please cut it off at once ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, and have it over . Oh , I feel that my heart is broken . This is such an unromantic affliction . The girls in books lose their hair in fevers or sell it to get money for some good deed , and I 'm sure I would n't mind losing my hair in some such fashion half so much . But there is nothing comforting in having your hair cut off because you 've dyed it a dreadful color , is there ? I 'm going to weep all the time you 're cutting it off , if it wo n't interfere . It seems such a tragic thing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1318"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>wept then , but later on , when she went upstairs and looked in the glass , she was calm with despair .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had done her work thoroughly and it had been necessary to shingle the hair as closely as possible . The result was not becoming , to state the case as mildly as may be .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>promptly turned her glass to the wall .</p>
    <p n="1319"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'll never , never look at myself again until my hair grows , ”</said>she exclaimed passionately .</p>
    <p n="1320">Then she suddenly righted the glass .</p>
    <p n="1321"><said who="#Anne">“ Yes , I will , too . I 'd do penance for being wicked that way . I 'll look at myself every time I come to my room and see how ugly I am . And I wo n't try to imagine it away , either . I never thought I was vain about my hair , of all things , but now I know I was , in spite of its being red , because it was so long and thick and curly . I expect something will happen to my nose next . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1322"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s clipped head made a sensation in school on the following Monday , but to her relief nobody guessed the real reason for it , not even<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>, who , however , did not fail to inform<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>that she looked like a perfect scarecrow .</p>
    <p n="1323"><said who="#Anne">“ I did n't say anything when<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>said that to me , ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>confided that evening to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, who was lying on the sofa after one of her headaches ,<said who="#Anne">“ because I thought it was part of my punishment and I ought to bear it patiently . It 's hard to be told you look like a scarecrow and I wanted to say something back . But I did n't . I just swept her one scornful look and then I forgave her . It makes you feel very virtuous when you forgive people , does n't it ? I mean to devote all my energies to being good after this and I shall never try to be beautiful again . Of course it 's better to be good . I know it is , but it 's sometimes so hard to believe a thing even when you know it . I do really want to be good ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, like you and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>and<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>, and grow up to be a credit to you .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>says when my hair begins to grow to tie a black velvet ribbon around my head with a bow at one side . She says she thinks it will be very becoming . I will call it a snood — that sounds so romantic . But am I talking too much ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? Does it hurt your head ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1324"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ My head is better now . It was terrible bad this afternoon , though . These headaches of mine are getting worse and worse . I 'll have to see a doctor about them . As for your chatter , I do n't know that I mind it — I 've got so used to it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1325">Which was<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s way of saying that she liked to hear it .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="28">
    <p n="1326"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ OF course you must be<persName>Elaine</persName>,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I could never have the courage to float down there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1327"><said who="#Ruby_Gillis">“ Nor I , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>, with a shiver .<said who="#Ruby_Gillis">“ I do n't mind floating down when there 's two or three of us in the flat and we can sit up . It 's fun then . But to lie down and pretend I was dead — I just could n't . I 'd die really of fright . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1328"><said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ Of course it would be romantic , ”</said>conceded<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>,<said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ but I know I could n't keep still . I 'd be popping up every minute or so to see where I was and if I was n't drifting too far out . And you know ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, that would spoil the effect . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1329"><said who="#Anne">“ But it 's so ridiculous to have a redheaded<persName>Elaine</persName>, ”</said>mourned<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm not afraid to float down and I 'd love to be<persName>Elaine</persName>. But it 's ridiculous just the same .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>ought to be<persName>Elaine</persName>because she is so fair and has such lovely long golden hair —<persName>Elaine</persName>had ‘ all her bright hair streaming down , ’ you know . And<persName>Elaine</persName>was the lily maid . Now , a red-haired person cannot be a lily maid . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1330"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Your complexion is just as fair as<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>'s , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>earnestly ,<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ and your hair is ever so much darker than it used to be before you cut it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1331"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , do you really think so ? ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, flushing sensitively with delight .<said who="#Anne">“ I 've sometimes thought it was myself — but I never dared to ask anyone for fear she would tell me it was n't . Do you think it could be called auburn now ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1332"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Yes , and I think it is real pretty , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, looking admiringly at the short , silky curls that clustered over<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s head and were held in place by a very jaunty black velvet ribbon and bow .</p>
    <p n="1333">They were standing on the bank of the pond , below Orchard Slope , where a little headland fringed with birches ran out from the bank ; at its tip was a small wooden platform built out into the water for the convenience of fishermen and duck hunters .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>and<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>were spending the midsummer afternoon with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had come over to play with them .</p>
    <p n="1334"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>had spent most of their playtime that summer on and about the pond .<persName>Idlewild</persName>was a thing of the past ,<persName>Mr. Bell</persName>having ruthlessly cut down the little circle of trees in his back pasture in the spring .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had sat among the stumps and wept , not without an eye to the romance of it ; but she was speedily consoled , for , after all , as she and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>said , big girls of thirteen , going on fourteen , were too old for such childish amusements as playhouses , and there were more fascinating sports to be found about the pond . It was splendid to fish for trout over the bridge and the two girls learned to row themselves about in the little flat-bottomed dory<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>kept for duck shooting .</p>
    <p n="1335">It was<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s idea that they dramatize<persName>Elaine</persName>. They had studied Tennyson 's poem in school the preceding winter , the Superintendent of Education having prescribed it in the English course for the Prince Edward Island schools . They had analyzed and parsed it and torn it to pieces in general until it was a wonder there was any meaning at all left in it for them , but at least the fair lily maid and Lancelot and Guinevere and King Arthur had become very real people to them , and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was devoured by secret regret that she had not been born in Camelot . Those days , she said , were so much more romantic than the present .</p>
    <p n="1336"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s plan was hailed with enthusiasm . The girls had discovered that if the flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down with the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another headland lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond . They had often gone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing<persName>Elaine</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1337"><said who="#Anne">“ Well , I 'll be<persName>Elaine</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, yielding reluctantly , for , although she would have been delighted to play the principal character , yet her artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this , she felt , her limitations made impossible .<said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>, you must be King Arthur and<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>will be Guinevere and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>must be Lancelot . But first you must be the brothers and the father . We can n't have the old dumb servitor because there is n't room for two in the flat when one is lying down . We must pall the barge all its length in blackest samite . That old black shawl of your mother 's will be just the thing ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1338">The black shawl having been procured ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>spread it over the flat and then lay down on the bottom , with closed eyes and hands folded over her breast .</p>
    <p n="1339"><said who="#Ruby_Gillis">“ Oh , she does look really dead , ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>nervously , watching the still , white little face under the flickering shadows of the birches .<said who="#Ruby_Gillis">“ It makes me feel frightened , girls . Do you suppose it 's really right to act like this ?<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says that all play-acting is abominably wicked . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1340"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>, you should n't talk about<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>severely .<said who="#Anne">“ It spoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>was born .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>, you arrange this . It 's silly for<persName>Elaine</persName>to be talking when she 's dead . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1341"><persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>rose to the occasion . Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none , but an old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent substitute . A white lily was not obtainable just then , but the effect of a tall blue iris placed in one of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s folded hands was all that could be desired .</p>
    <p n="1342"><said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ Now , she 's all ready , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>.<said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ We must kiss her quiet brows and ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, you say , ‘ Sister , farewell forever , ’ and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>, you say , ‘ Farewell , sweet sister , ’ both of you as sorrowfully as you possibly can .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, for goodness sake smile a little . You know<persName>Elaine</persName>‘ lay as though she smiled . ’ That 's better . Now push the flat off . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1343">The flat was accordingly pushed off , scraping roughly over an old embedded stake in the process .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>only waited long enough to see it caught in the current and headed for the bridge before scampering up through the woods , across the road , and down to the lower headland where , as Lancelot and Guinevere and the King , they were to be in readiness to receive the lily maid .</p>
    <p n="1344">For a few minutes<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, drifting slowly down , enjoyed the romance of her situation to the full . Then something happened not at all romantic . The flat began to leak . In a very few moments it was necessary for<persName>Elaine</persName>to scramble to her feet , pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall of blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her barge through which the water was literally pouring . That sharp stake at the landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>did not know this , but it did not take her long to realize that she was in a dangerous plight . At this rate the flat would fill and sink long before it could drift to the lower headland . Where were the oars ? Left behind at the landing !</p>
    <p n="1345"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>gave one gasping little scream which nobody ever heard ; she was white to the lips , but she did not lose her self-possession . There was one chance — just one .</p>
    <p n="1346"><said who="#Mrs._Allan">“ I was horribly frightened , ”</said>she told<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>the next day ,<said who="#Anne">“ and it seemed like years while the flat was drifting down to the bridge and the water rising in it every moment . I prayed ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>, most earnestly , but I did n't shut my eyes to pray , for I knew the only way God could save me was to let the flat float close enough to one of the bridge piles for me to climb up on it . You know the piles are just old tree trunks and there are lots of knots and old branch stubs on them . It was proper to pray , but I had to do my part by watching out and right well I knew it . I just said , ‘ Dear God , please take the flat close to a pile and I 'll do the rest , ’ over and over again . Under such circumstances you do n't think much about making a flowery prayer . But mine was answered , for the flat bumped right into a pile for a minute and I flung the scarf and the shawl over my shoulder and scrambled up on a big providential stub . And there I was ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>, clinging to that slippery old pile with no way of getting up or down . It was a very unromantic position , but I did n't think about that at the time . You do n't think much about romance when you have just escaped from a watery grave . I said a grateful prayer at once and then I gave all my attention to holding on tight , for I knew I should probably have to depend on human aid to get back to dry land . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1347">The flat drifted under the bridge and then promptly sank in midstream .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>,<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, already awaiting it on the lower headland , saw it disappear before their very eyes and had not a doubt but that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had gone down with it . For a moment they stood still , white as sheets , frozen with horror at the tragedy ; then , shrieking at the tops of their voices , they started on a frantic run up through the woods , never pausing as they crossed the main road to glance the way of the bridge .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, clinging desperately to her precarious foothold , saw their flying forms and heard their shrieks . Help would soon come , but meanwhile her position was a very uncomfortable one .</p>
    <p n="1348">The minutes passed by , each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily maid . Why did n't somebody come ? Where had the girls gone ? Suppose they had fainted , one and all ! Suppose nobody ever came ! Suppose she grew so tired and cramped that she could hold on no longer !<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked at the wicked green depths below her , wavering with long , oily shadows , and shivered . Her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome possibilities to her .</p>
    <p n="1349">Then , just as she thought she really could not endure the ache in her arms and wrists another moment ,<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>came rowing under the bridge in Harmon<persName>Andrews</persName>'s dory !</p>
    <p n="1350"><persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>glanced up and , much to his amazement , beheld a little white scornful face looking down upon him with big , frightened but also scornful gray eyes .</p>
    <p n="1351"><said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>! How on earth did you get there ? ”</said>he exclaimed .</p>
    <p n="1352">Without waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended his hand . There was no help for it ;<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, clinging to<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>'s hand , scrambled down into the dory , where she sat , drabbled and furious , in the stern with her arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe . It was certainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances !</p>
    <p n="1353"><said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“ What has happened ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>, taking up his oars . “ We were playing<persName>Elaine</persName>” explained<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>frigidly , without even looking at her rescuer ,<said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“ and I had to drift down to Camelot in the barge — I mean the flat . The flat began to leak and I climbed out on the pile . The girls went for help . Will you be kind enough to row me to the landing ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1354"><persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>obligingly rowed to the landing and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, disdaining assistance , sprang nimbly on shore .</p>
    <p n="1355"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm very much obliged to you , ”</said>she said haughtily as she turned away . But<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>had also sprung from the boat and now laid a detaining hand on her arm .</p>
    <p n="1356"><said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>he said hurriedly ,<said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“ look here . Ca n't we be good friends ? I 'm awfully sorry I made fun of your hair that time . I did n't mean to vex you and I only meant it for a joke . Besides , it 's so long ago . I think your hair is awfully pretty now — honest I do . Let 's be friends . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1357">For a moment<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>hesitated . She had an odd , newly awakened consciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half-shy , half-eager expression in<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>'s hazel eyes was something that was very good to see . Her heart gave a quick , queer little beat . But the bitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering determination . That scene of two years before flashed back into her recollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday .<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>had called her “ carrots ” and had brought about her disgrace before the whole school . Her resentment , which to other and older people might be as laughable as its cause , was in no whit allayed and softened by time seemingly . She hated<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>! She would never forgive him !</p>
    <p n="1358"><said who="#Anne">“ No , ”</said>she said coldly ,<said who="#Anne">“ I shall never be friends with you ,<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>; and I do n't want to be ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1359"><said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“ All right ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his cheeks .<said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“ I 'll never ask you to be friends again ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>. And I do n't care either ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1360">He pulled away with swift defiant strokes , and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>went up the steep , ferny little path under the maples . She held her head very high , but she was conscious of an odd feeling of regret . She almost wished she had answered<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>differently . Of course , he had insulted her terribly , but still —! Altogether ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>rather thought it would be a relief to sit down and have a good cry . She was really quite unstrung , for the reaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt .</p>
    <p n="1361">Halfway up the path she met<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>rushing back to the pond in a state narrowly removed from positive frenzy . They had found nobody at Orchard Slope , both Mr. and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>being away . Here<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>had succumbed to hysterics , and was left to recover from them as best she might , while<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>flew through the Haunted Wood and across the brook to Green Gables . There they had found nobody either , for<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had gone to Carmody and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was making hay in the back field .</p>
    <p n="1362"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>gasped<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, fairly falling on the former 's neck and weeping with relief and delight ,<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>— we thought — you were — drowned — and we felt like murderers — because we had made — you be —<persName>Elaine</persName>. And<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>is in hysterics — oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, how did you escape ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1363"><said who="#Anne">“ I climbed up on one of the piles , ”</said>explained<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>wearily ,<said who="#Anne">“ and<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>came along in Mr.<persName>Andrews</persName>'s dory and brought me to land . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1364"><said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, how splendid of him ! Why , it 's so romantic ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>, finding breath enough for utterance at last .<said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ Of course you 'll speak to him after this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1365"><said who="#Anne">“ Of course I wo n't , ”</said>flashed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, with a momentary return of her old spirit .<said who="#Anne">“ And I do n't want ever to hear the word ‘ romantic ’ again ,<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>. I 'm awfully sorry you were so frightened , girls . It is all my fault . I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star . Everything I do gets me or my dearest friends into a scrape . We 've gone and lost your father 's flat ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, and I have a presentiment that we 'll not be allowed to row on the pond any more . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1366"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s presentiment proved more trustworthy than presentiments are apt to do . Great was the consternation in the<persName>Barry</persName>and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Cuthbert</persName>households when the events of the afternoon became known .</p>
    <p n="1367"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Will you ever have any sense ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said>groaned<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1368"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , yes , I think I will ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>returned<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>optimistically . A good cry , indulged in the grateful solitude of the east gable , had soothed her nerves and restored her to her wonted cheerfulness .<said who="#Anne">“ I think my prospects of becoming sensible are brighter now than ever . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1369"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't see how , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1370"><said who="#Anne">“ Well , ”</said>explained<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne">“ I 've learned a new and valuable lesson today . Ever since I came to Green Gables I 've been making mistakes , and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming . The affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that did n't belong to me . The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with me . The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in cooking . Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity . I never think about my hair and nose now — at least , very seldom . And today 's mistake is going to cure me of being too romantic . I have come to the conclusion that it is no use trying to be romantic in Avonlea . It was probably easy enough in towered Camelot hundreds of years ago , but romance is not appreciated now . I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1371"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'm sure I hope so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>skeptically .</p>
    <p n="1372">But<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, who had been sitting mutely in his corner , laid a hand on<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s shoulder when<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had gone out .</p>
    <p n="1373"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Do n't give up all your romance ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>he whispered shyly ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ a little of it is a good thing — not too much , of course — but keep a little of it ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, keep a little of it . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="29">
    <p n="1374"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was bringing the cows home from the back pasture by way of Lover 's Lane . It was a September evening and all the gaps and clearings in the woods were brimmed up with ruby sunset light . Here and there the lane was splashed with it , but for the most part it was already quite shadowy beneath the maples , and the spaces under the firs were filled with a clear violet dusk like airy wine . The winds were out in their tops , and there is no sweeter music on earth than that which the wind makes in the fir trees at evening .</p>
    <p n="1375">The cows swung placidly down the lane , and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>followed them dreamily , repeating aloud the battle canto from MARMION — which had also been part of their English course the preceding winter and which<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>had made them learn off by heart — and exulting in its rushing lines and the clash of spears in its imagery . When she came to the lines</p>
    <p n="1376">The stubborn spearsmen still made good Their dark impenetrable wood ,</p>
    <p n="1377">she stopped in ecstasy to shut her eyes that she might the better fancy herself one of that heroic ring . When she opened them again it was to behold<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>coming through the gate that led into the<persName>Barry</persName>field and looking so important that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>instantly divined there was news to be told . But betray too eager curiosity she would not .</p>
    <p n="1378"><said who="#Anne">“ Is n't this evening just like a purple dream ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>? It makes me so glad to be alive . In the mornings I always think the mornings are best ; but when evening comes I think it 's lovelier still . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1379"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It 's a very fine evening , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>,<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ but oh , I have such news ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. Guess . You can have three guesses . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1380"><said who="#Anne">“ Charlotte<persName>Gillis</persName>is going to be married in the church after all and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>wants us to decorate it , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1381"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ No . Charlotte 's beau wo n't agree to that , because nobody ever has been married in the church yet , and he thinks it would seem too much like a funeral . It 's too mean , because it would be such fun . Guess again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1382"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>'s mother is going to let her have a birthday party ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1383"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>shook her head , her black eyes dancing with merriment .</p>
    <p n="1384"><said who="#Anne">“ I can n't think what it can be , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>in despair ,<said who="#Anne">“ unless it 's that<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>MacPherson saw you home from prayer meeting last night . Did he ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1385"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I should think not , ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>indignantly .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I would n't be likely to boast of it if he did , the horrid creature ! I knew you could n't guess it . Mother had a letter from<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Aunt Josephine</persName>today , and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Aunt Josephine</persName>wants you and me to go to town next Tuesday and stop with her for the Exhibition . There ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1386"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, finding it necessary to lean up against a maple tree for support ,<said who="#Anne">“ do you really mean it ? But I 'm afraid<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>wo n't let me go . She will say that she can n't encourage gadding about . That was what she said last week when<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>invited me to go with them in their double-seated buggy to the American concert at the White Sands Hotel . I wanted to go , but<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>said I 'd be better at home learning my lessons and so would<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>. I was bitterly disappointed ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. I felt so heartbroken that I would n't say my prayers when I went to bed . But I repented of that and got up in the middle of the night and said them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1387"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I 'll tell you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>,<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ we 'll get Mother to ask<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. She 'll be more likely to let you go then ; and if she does we 'll have the time of our lives ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. I 've never been to an Exhibition , and it 's so aggravating to hear the other girls talking about their trips .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>have been twice , and they 're going this year again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1388"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm not going to think about it at all until I know whether I can go or not , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>resolutely .<said who="#Anne">“ If I did and then was disappointed , it would be more than I could bear . But in case I do go I 'm very glad my new coat will be ready by that time .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>did n't think I needed a new coat . She said my old one would do very well for another winter and that I ought to be satisfied with having a new dress . The dress is very pretty ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>— navy blue and made so fashionably .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>always makes my dresses fashionably now , because she says she does n't intend to have<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>going to<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>to make them . I 'm so glad . It is ever so much easier to be good if your clothes are fashionable . At least , it is easier for me . I suppose it does n't make such a difference to naturally good people . But<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>said I must have a new coat , so<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>bought a lovely piece of blue broadcloth , and it 's being made by a real dressmaker over at Carmody . It 's to be done Saturday night , and I 'm trying not to imagine myself walking up the church aisle on Sunday in my new suit and cap , because I 'm afraid it is n't right to imagine such things . But it just slips into my mind in spite of me . My cap is so pretty .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>bought it for me the day we were over at Carmody . It is one of those little blue velvet ones that are all the rage , with gold cord and tassels . Your new hat is elegant ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, and so becoming . When I saw you come into church last Sunday my heart swelled with pride to think you were my dearest friend . Do you suppose it 's wrong for us to think so much about our clothes ?<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>says it is very sinful . But it is such an interesting subject , is n't it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1389"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>agreed to let<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>go to town , and it was arranged that<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>should take the girls in on the following Tuesday . As Charlottetown was thirty miles away and<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>wished to go and return the same day , it was necessary to make a very early start . But<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>counted it all joy , and was up before sunrise on Tuesday morning . A glance from her window assured her that the day would be fine , for the eastern sky behind the firs of the Haunted Wood was all silvery and cloudless . Through the gap in the trees a light was shining in the western gable of Orchard Slope , a token that<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>was also up .</p>
    <p n="1390"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was dressed by the time<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had the fire on and had the breakfast ready when<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>came down , but for her own part was much too excited to eat . After breakfast the jaunty new cap and jacket were donned , and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>hastened over the brook and up through the firs to Orchard Slope .<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>were waiting for her , and they were soon on the road .</p>
    <p n="1391">It was a long drive , but<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>enjoyed every minute of it . It was delightful to rattle along over the moist roads in the early red sunlight that was creeping across the shorn harvest fields . The air was fresh and crisp , and little smoke-blue mists curled through the valleys and floated off from the hills . Sometimes the road went through woods where maples were beginning to hang out scarlet banners ; sometimes it crossed rivers on bridges that made<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s flesh cringe with the old , half-delightful fear ; sometimes it wound along a harbor shore and passed by a little cluster of weather-gray fishing huts ; again it mounted to hills whence a far sweep of curving upland or misty-blue sky could be seen ; but wherever it went there was much of interest to discuss . It was almost noon when they reached town and found their way to “ Beechwood . ” It was quite a fine old mansion , set back from the street in a seclusion of green elms and branching beeches .<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>met them at the door with a twinkle in her sharp black eyes .</p>
    <p n="1392"><said who="#Miss_Barry">“ So you 've come to see me at last , you Anne-girl , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Miss_Barry">“ Mercy , child , how you have grown ! You 're taller than I am , I declare . And you 're ever so much better looking than you used to be , too . But I dare say you know that without being told . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1393"><said who="#Anne">“ Indeed I did n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>radiantly .<said who="#Anne">“ I know I 'm not so freckled as I used to be , so I 've much to be thankful for , but I really had n't dared to hope there was any other improvement . I 'm so glad you think there is ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>. ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>'s house was furnished with “ great magnificence , ” as<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>told<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>afterward . The two little country girls were rather abashed by the splendor of the parlor where<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>left them when she went to see about dinner .</p>
    <p n="1394"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Is n't it just like a palace ? ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I never was in<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Aunt Josephine</persName>'s house before , and I 'd no idea it was so grand . I just wish<persName>Julia Bell</persName>could see this — she puts on such airs about her mother 's parlor . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1395"><said who="#Anne">“ Velvet carpet , ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>luxuriously ,<said who="#Anne">“ and silk curtains ! I 've dreamed of such things ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. But do you know I do n't believe I feel very comfortable with them after all . There are so many things in this room and all so splendid that there is no scope for imagination . That is one consolation when you are poor — there are so many more things you can imagine about . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1396">Their sojourn in town was something that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>dated from for years . From first to last it was crowded with delights .</p>
    <p n="1397">On Wednesday<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>took them to the Exhibition grounds and kept them there all day .</p>
    <p n="1398"><said who="#Anne">“ It was splendid , ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>related to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>later on .<said who="#Anne">“ I never imagined anything so interesting . I do n't really know which department was the most interesting . I think I liked the horses and the flowers and the fancywork best .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>took first prize for knitted lace . I was real glad she did . And I was glad that I felt glad , for it shows I 'm improving , do n't you think ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, when I can rejoice in<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>'s success ? Mr. Harmon<persName>Andrews</persName>took second prize for Gravenstein apples and<persName>Mr. Bell</persName>took first prize for a pig .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>said she thought it was ridiculous for a Sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs , but I do n't see why . Do you ? She said she would always think of it after this when he was praying so solemnly . Clara Louise MacPherson took a prize for painting , and<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>got first prize for homemade butter and cheese . So Avonlea was pretty well represented , was n't it ?<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>was there that day , and I never knew how much I really liked her until I saw her familiar face among all those strangers . There were thousands of people there ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. It made me feel dreadfully insignificant . And<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>took us up to the grandstand to see the horse races .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>would n't go ; she said horse racing was an abomination and , she being a church member , thought it her bounden duty to set a good example by staying away . But there were so many there I do n't believe<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>'s absence would ever be noticed . I do n't think , though , that I ought to go very often to horse races , because they ARE awfully fascinating .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>got so excited that she offered to bet me ten cents that the red horse would win . I did n't believe he would , but I refused to bet , because I wanted to tell<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>all about everything , and I felt sure it would n't do to tell her that . It 's always wrong to do anything you can n't tell the minister 's wife . It 's as good as an extra conscience to have a minister 's wife for your friend . And I was very glad I did n't bet , because the red horse DID win , and I would have lost ten cents . So you see that virtue was its own reward . We saw a man go up in a balloon . I 'd love to go up in a balloon ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>; it would be simply thrilling ; and we saw a man selling fortunes . You paid him ten cents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you .<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>gave<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told . Mine was that I would marry a dark-complected man who was very wealthy , and I would go across water to live . I looked carefully at all the dark men I saw after that , but I did n't care much for any of them , and anyhow I suppose it 's too early to be looking out for him yet . Oh , it was a never-to-be-forgotten day ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I was so tired I could n't sleep at night .<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>put us in the spare room , according to promise . It was an elegant room ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, but somehow sleeping in a spare room is n't what I used to think it was . That 's the worst of growing up , and I 'm beginning to realize it . The things you wanted so much when you were a child do n't seem half so wonderful to you when you get them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1399">Thursday the girls had a drive in the park , and in the evening<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>took them to a concert in the Academy of Music , where a noted prima donna was to sing . To<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>the evening was a glittering vision of delight .</p>
    <p n="1400"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, it was beyond description . I was so excited I could n't even talk , so you may know what it was like . I just sat in enraptured silence . Madame Selitsky was perfectly beautiful , and wore white satin and diamonds . But when she began to sing I never thought about anything else . Oh , I can n't tell you how I felt . But it seemed to me that it could never be hard to be good any more . I felt like I do when I look up to the stars . Tears came into my eyes , but , oh , they were such happy tears . I was so sorry when it was all over , and I told<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>I did n't see how I was ever to return to common life again . She said she thought if we went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream it might help me . That sounded so prosaic ; but to my surprise I found it true . The ice cream was delicious ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, and it was so lovely and dissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven o'clock at night .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>said she believed she was born for city life .<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>asked me what my opinion was , but I said I would have to think it over very seriously before I could tell her what I really thought . So I thought it over after I went to bed . That is the best time to think things out . And I came to the conclusion ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, that I was n't born for city life and that I was glad of it . It 's nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant restaurants at eleven o'clock at night once in a while ; but as a regular thing I 'd rather be in the east gable at eleven , sound asleep , but kind of knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that the wind was blowing in the firs across the brook . I told<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>so at breakfast the next morning and she laughed .<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>generally laughed at anything I said , even when I said the most solemn things . I do n't think I liked it ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, because I was n't trying to be funny . But she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1401">Friday brought going-home time , and<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>drove in for the girls .</p>
    <p n="1402"><said who="#Miss_Barry">“ Well , I hope you 've enjoyed yourselves , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>, as she bade them good-bye .</p>
    <p n="1403"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Indeed we have , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1404"><said who="#Miss_Barry">“ And you , Anne-girl ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1405"><said who="#Anne">“ I 've enjoyed every minute of the time , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, throwing her arms impulsively about the old woman 's neck and kissing her wrinkled cheek .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>would never have dared to do such a thing and felt rather aghast at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s freedom . But<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>was pleased , and she stood on her veranda and watched the buggy out of sight . Then she went back into her big house with a sigh . It seemed very lonely , lacking those fresh young lives .<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>was a rather selfish old lady , if the truth must be told , and had never cared much for anybody but herself . She valued people only as they were of service to her or amused her .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had amused her , and consequently stood high in the old lady 's good graces . But<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>found herself thinking less about<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s quaint speeches than of her fresh enthusiasms , her transparent emotions , her little winning ways , and the sweetness of her eyes and lips .</p>
    <p n="1406"><said who="#Miss_Barry">“ I thought<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>was an old fool when I heard she 'd adopted a girl out of an orphan asylum , ”</said>she said to herself ,<said who="#Miss_Barry">“ but I guess she did n't make much of a mistake after all . If I 'd a child like<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>in the house all the time I 'd be a better and happier woman . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1407"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>found the drive home as pleasant as the drive in — pleasanter , indeed , since there was the delightful consciousness of home waiting at the end of it . It was sunset when they passed through White Sands and turned into the shore road . Beyond , the Avonlea hills came out darkly against the saffron sky . Behind them the moon was rising out of the sea that grew all radiant and transfigured in her light . Every little cove along the curving road was a marvel of dancing ripples . The waves broke with a soft swish on the rocks below them , and the tang of the sea was in the strong , fresh air .</p>
    <p n="1408"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , but it 's good to be alive and to be going home , ”</said>breathed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1409">When she crossed the log bridge over the brook the kitchen light of Green Gables winked her a friendly welcome back , and through the open door shone the hearth fire , sending out its warm red glow athwart the chilly autumn night .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>ran blithely up the hill and into the kitchen , where a hot supper was waiting on the table .</p>
    <p n="1410"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ So you 've got back ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, folding up her knitting .</p>
    <p n="1411"><said who="#Anne">“ Yes , and oh , it 's so good to be back , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>joyously .<said who="#Anne">“ I could kiss everything , even to the clock .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, a broiled chicken ! You do n't mean to say you cooked that for me ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1412"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Yes , I did , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I thought you 'd be hungry after such a drive and need something real appetizing . Hurry and take off your things , and we 'll have supper as soon as<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>comes in . I 'm glad you 've got back , I must say . It 's been fearful lonesome here without you , and I never put in four longer days . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1413">After supper<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sat before the fire between<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, and gave them a full account of her visit .</p>
    <p n="1414"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 've had a splendid time , ”</said>she concluded happily ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ and I feel that it marks an epoch in my life . But the best of it all was the coming home . ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="30">
    <p n="1415"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>laid her knitting on her lap and leaned back in her chair . Her eyes were tired , and she thought vaguely that she must see about having her glasses changed the next time she went to town , for her eyes had grown tired very often of late .</p>
    <p n="1416">It was nearly dark , for the full November twilight had fallen around Green Gables , and the only light in the kitchen came from the dancing red flames in the stove .</p>
    <p n="1417"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was curled up Turk-fashion on the hearthrug , gazing into that joyous glow where the sunshine of a hundred summers was being distilled from the maple cordwood . She had been reading , but her book had slipped to the floor , and now she was dreaming , with a smile on her parted lips . Glittering castles in Spain were shaping themselves out of the mists and rainbows of her lively fancy ; adventures wonderful and enthralling were happening to her in cloudland — adventures that always turned out triumphantly and never involved her in scrapes like those of actual life .</p>
    <p n="1418"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>looked at her with a tenderness that would never have been suffered to reveal itself in any clearer light than that soft mingling of fireshine and shadow . The lesson of a love that should display itself easily in spoken word and open look was one<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>could never learn . But she had learned to love this slim , gray-eyed girl with an affection all the deeper and stronger from its very undemonstrativeness . Her love made her afraid of being unduly indulgent , indeed . She had an uneasy feeling that it was rather sinful to set one 's heart so intensely on any human creature as she had set hers on<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, and perhaps she performed a sort of unconscious penance for this by being stricter and more critical than if the girl had been less dear to her . Certainly<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>herself had no idea how<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>loved her . She sometimes thought wistfully that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was very hard to please and distinctly lacking in sympathy and understanding . But she always checked the thought reproachfully , remembering what she owed to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1419"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>abruptly ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>was here this afternoon when you were out with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1420"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>came back from her other world with a start and a sigh .</p>
    <p n="1421"><said who="#Anne">“ Was she ? Oh , I 'm so sorry I was n't in . Why did n't you call me ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>?<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I were only over in the Haunted Wood . It 's lovely in the woods now . All the little wood things — the ferns and the satin leaves and the crackerberries — have gone to sleep , just as if somebody had tucked them away until spring under a blanket of leaves . I think it was a little gray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last moonlight night and did it .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>would n't say much about that , though .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about imagining ghosts into the Haunted Wood . It had a very bad effect on<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s imagination . It blighted it .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says Myrtle<persName>Bell</persName>is a blighted being . I asked<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>why Myrtle was blighted , and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>said she guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>thinks of nothing but young men , and the older she gets the worse she is . Young men are all very well in their place , but it does n't do to drag them into everything , does it ?<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I are thinking seriously of promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids and live together forever .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>has n't quite made up her mind though , because she thinks perhaps it would be nobler to marry some wild , dashing , wicked young man and reform him .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I talk a great deal about serious subjects now , you know . We feel that we are so much older than we used to be that it is n't becoming to talk of childish matters . It 's such a solemn thing to be almost fourteen ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>took all us girls who are in our teens down to the brook last Wednesday , and talked to us about it . She said we could n't be too careful what habits we formed and what ideals we acquired in our teens , because by the time we were twenty our characters would be developed and the foundation laid for our whole future life . And she said if the foundation was shaky we could never build anything really worth while on it .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and I talked the matter over coming home from school . We felt extremely solemn ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. And we decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and form respectable habits and learn all we could and be as sensible as possible , so that by the time we were twenty our characters would be properly developed . It 's perfectly appalling to think of being twenty ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. It sounds so fearfully old and grown up . But why was<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>here this afternoon ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1422"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ That is what I want to tell you ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, if you 'll ever give me a chance to get a word in edgewise . She was talking about you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1423"><said who="#Anne">“ About me ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked rather scared . Then she flushed and exclaimed :</p>
    <p n="1424"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I know what she was saying . I meant to tell you ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, honestly I did , but I forgot .<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>caught me reading Ben Hur in school yesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian history .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>lent it to me . I was reading it at dinner hour , and I had just got to the chariot race when school went in . I was simply wild to know how it turned out — although I felt sure Ben Hur must win , because it would n't be poetical justice if he did n't — so I spread the history open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and my knee . I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history , you know , while all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur . I was so interested in it that I never noticed<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>coming down the aisle until all at once I just looked up and there she was looking down at me , so reproachful-like . I can n't tell you how ashamed I felt ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, especially when I heard<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>giggling .<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>took Ben Hur away , but she never said a word then . She kept me in at recess and talked to me . She said I had done very wrong in two respects . First , I was wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies ; and secondly , I was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a history when it was a storybook instead . I had never realized until that moment ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, that what I was doing was deceitful . I was shocked . I cried bitterly , and asked<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>to forgive me and I 'd never do such a thing again ; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking at Ben Hur for a whole week , not even to see how the chariot race turned out . But<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>said she would n't require that , and she forgave me freely . So I think it was n't very kind of her to come up here to you about it after all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1425"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>never mentioned such a thing to me ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, and its only your guilty conscience that 's the matter with you . You have no business to be taking storybooks to school . You read too many novels anyhow . When I was a girl I was n't so much as allowed to look at a novel . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1426"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , how can you call Ben Hur a novel when it 's really such a religious book ? ”</said>protested<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Of course it 's a little too exciting to be proper reading for Sunday , and I only read it on weekdays . And I never read ANY book now unless either<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>or<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>thinks it is a proper book for a girl thirteen and three-quarters to read .<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>made me promise that . She found me reading a book one day called , The Lurid Mystery of the Haunted Hall . It was one<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>had lent me , and , oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, it was so fascinating and creepy . It just curdled the blood in my veins . But<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>said it was a very silly , unwholesome book , and she asked me not to read any more of it or any like it . I did n't mind promising not to read any more like it , but it was AGONIZING to give back that book without knowing how it turned out . But my love for<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>stood the test and I did . It 's really wonderful ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, what you can do when you 're truly anxious to please a certain person . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1427"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , I guess I 'll light the lamp and get to work , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I see plainly that you do n't want to hear what<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>had to say . You 're more interested in the sound of your own tongue than in anything else . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1428"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , indeed ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I do want to hear it , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>contritely .<said who="#Anne">“ I wo n't say another word — not one . I know I talk too much , but I am really trying to overcome it , and although I say far too much , yet if you only knew how many things I want to say and do n't , you 'd give me some credit for it . Please tell me ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1429"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>wants to organize a class among her advanced students who mean to study for the entrance examination into<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s . She intends to give them extra lessons for an hour after school . And she came to ask<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and me if we would like to have you join it . What do you think about it yourself ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? Would you like to go to<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s and pass for a teacher ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1430"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>! ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>straightened to her knees and clasped her hands .<said who="#Anne">“ It 's been the dream of my life — that is , for the last six months , ever since<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>and<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>began to talk of studying for the Entrance . But I did n't say anything about it , because I supposed it would be perfectly useless . I 'd love to be a teacher . But wo n't it be dreadfully expensive ? Mr.<persName>Andrews</persName>says it cost him one hundred and fifty dollars to put<persName>Prissy</persName>through , and<persName>Prissy</persName>was n't a dunce in geometry . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1431"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I guess you need n't worry about that part of it . When<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and I took you to bring up we resolved we would do the best we could for you and give you a good education . I believe in a girl being fitted to earn her own living whether she ever has to or not . You 'll always have a home at Green Gables as long as<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and I are here , but nobody knows what is going to happen in this uncertain world , and it 's just as well to be prepared . So you can join the<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s class if you like ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1432"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, thank you . ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>flung her arms about<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s waist and looked up earnestly into her face .<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm extremely grateful to you and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. And I 'll study as hard as I can and do my very best to be a credit to you . I warn you not to expect much in geometry , but I think I can hold my own in anything else if I work hard . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1433"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I dare say you 'll get along well enough .<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>says you are bright and diligent . ”</said>Not for worlds would<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>have told<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>just what<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>had said about her ; that would have been to pamper vanity .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You need n't rush to any extreme of killing yourself over your books . There is no hurry . You wo n't be ready to try the Entrance for a year and a half yet . But it 's well to begin in time and be thoroughly grounded ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>says . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1434"><said who="#Anne">“ I shall take more interest than ever in my studies now , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>blissfully ,<said who="#Anne">“ because I have a purpose in life .<persName>Mr. Allan</persName>says everybody should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully . Only he says we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose . I would call it a worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>, would n't you ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? I think it 's a very noble profession . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1435">The<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s class was organized in due time .<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>,<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>,<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>,<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>,<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>,<persName>Charlie Sloane</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>MacPherson joined it .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana Barry</persName>did not , as her parents did not intend to send her to<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s . This seemed nothing short of a calamity to<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. Never , since the night on which<persName>Minnie</persName>May had had the croup , had she and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>been separated in anything . On the evening when the<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s class first remained in school for the extra lessons and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>saw<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>go slowly out with the others , to walk home alone through<persName>the Birch Path</persName>and<persName>Violet Vale</persName>, it was all the former could do to keep her seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum . A lump came into her throat , and she hastily retired behind the pages of her uplifted<persName corresp="#Latin">Latin</persName>grammar to hide the tears in her eyes . Not for worlds would<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>have had<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>or<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>see those tears .</p>
    <p n="1436"><said who="#Josie_Pye">“ But , oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I really felt that I had tasted the bitterness of death , as<persName>Mr. Allan</persName>said in his sermon last Sunday , when I saw<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>go out alone , ”</said>she said mournfully that night .<said>“ I thought how splendid it would have been if<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>had only been going to study for the Entrance , too . But we can n't have things perfect in this imperfect world , as<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>is n't exactly a comforting person sometimes , but there 's no doubt she says a great many very true things . And I think the<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s class is going to be extremely interesting .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>are just going to study to be teachers . That is the height of their ambition .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>says she will only teach for two years after she gets through , and then she intends to be married .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>says she will devote her whole life to teaching , and never , never marry , because you are paid a salary for teaching , but a husband wo n't pay you anything , and growls if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money . I expect<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>speaks from mournful experience , for<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says that her father is a perfect old crank , and meaner than second skimmings .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>says she is just going to college for education 's sake , because she wo n't have to earn her own living ; she says of course it is different with orphans who are living on charity — THEY have to hustle .<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>is going to be a minister .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says he could n't be anything else with a name like that to live up to . I hope it is n't wicked of me ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, but really the thought of<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>being a minister makes me laugh . He 's such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face , and his little blue eyes , and his ears sticking out like flaps . But perhaps he will be more intellectual looking when he grows up .<persName>Charlie Sloane</persName>says he 's going to go into politics and be a member of Parliament , but<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says he 'll never succeed at that , because the Sloanes are all honest people , and it 's only rascals that get on in politics nowadays . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1437"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ What is<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>going to be ? ”</said>queried<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, seeing that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was opening her Caesar .</p>
    <p n="1438"><said who="#Anne">“ I do n't happen to know what<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>'s ambition in life is — if he has any , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>scornfully .</p>
    <p n="1439">There was open rivalry between<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>now . Previously the rivalry had been rather onesided , but there was no longer any doubt that<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>was as determined to be first in class as<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was . He was a foeman worthy of her steel . The other members of the class tacitly acknowledged their superiority , and never dreamed of trying to compete with them .</p>
    <p n="1440">Since the day by the pond when she had refused to listen to his plea for forgiveness ,<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>, save for the aforesaid determined rivalry , had evinced no recognition whatever of the existence of<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>. He talked and jested with the other girls , exchanged books and puzzles with them , discussed lessons and plans , sometimes walked home with one or the other of them from prayer meeting or Debating Club . But<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>he simply ignored , and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>found out that it is not pleasant to be ignored . It was in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head that she did not care . Deep down in her wayward , feminine little heart she knew that she did care , and that if she had that chance of the Lake of Shining Waters again she would answer very differently . All at once , as it seemed , and to her secret dismay , she found that the old resentment she had cherished against him was gone — gone just when she most needed its sustaining power . It was in vain that she recalled every incident and emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel the old satisfying anger . That day by the pond had witnessed its last spasmodic flicker .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>realized that she had forgiven and forgotten without knowing it . But it was too late .</p>
    <p n="1441">And at least neither<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>nor anybody else , not even<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, should ever suspect how sorry she was and how much she wished she had n't been so proud and horrid ! She determined to “ shroud her feelings in deepest oblivion , ” and it may be stated here and now that she did it , so successfully that<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>, who possibly was not quite so indifferent as he seemed , could not console himself with any belief that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt his retaliatory scorn . The only poor comfort he had was that she snubbed<persName>Charlie Sloane</persName>, unmercifully , continually , and undeservedly .</p>
    <p n="1442">Otherwise the winter passed away in a round of pleasant duties and studies . For<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>the days slipped by like golden beads on the necklace of the year . She was happy , eager , interested ; there were lessons to be learned and honor to be won ; delightful books to read ; new pieces to be practiced for the Sunday-school choir ; pleasant Saturday afternoons at the manse with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>; and then , almost before<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>realized it , spring had come again to Green Gables and all the world was abloom once more .</p>
    <p n="1443">Studies palled just a wee bit then ; the<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s class , left behind in school while the others scattered to green lanes and leafy wood cuts and meadow byways , looked wistfully out of the windows and discovered that<persName corresp="#Latin">Latin</persName>verbs and French exercises had somehow lost the tang and zest they had possessed in the crisp winter months . Even<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>lagged and grew indifferent . Teacher and taught were alike glad when the term was ended and the glad vacation days stretched rosily before them .</p>
    <p n="1444"><said who="#Miss_Stacy">“ But you 've done good work this past year , ”</said><persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>told them on the last evening ,<said who="#Miss_Stacy">“ and you deserve a good , jolly vacation . Have the best time you can in the out-of-door world and lay in a good stock of health and vitality and ambition to carry you through next year . It will be the tug of war , you know — the last year before the Entrance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1445"><said who="#Josie_Pye">“ Are you going to be back next year ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1446"><persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>never scrupled to ask questions ; in this instance the rest of the class felt grateful to her ; none of them would have dared to ask it of<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>, but all wanted to , for there had been alarming rumors running at large through the school for some time that<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>was not coming back the next year — that she had been offered a position in the grade school of her own home district and meant to accept . The<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s class listened in breathless suspense for her answer .</p>
    <p n="1447"><said who="#Miss_Stacy">“ Yes , I think I will , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Stacy">“ I thought of taking another school , but I have decided to come back to Avonlea . To tell the truth , I 've grown so interested in my pupils here that I found I could n't leave them . So I 'll stay and see you through . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1448"><said who="#Moody_Spurgeon">“ Hurrah ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>.<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>had never been so carried away by his feelings before , and he blushed uncomfortably every time he thought about it for a week .</p>
    <p n="1449"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I 'm so glad , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, with shining eyes .<said who="#Anne">“ Dear<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Stacy</persName>, it would be perfectly dreadful if you did n't come back . I do n't believe I could have the heart to go on with my studies at all if another teacher came here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1450">When<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>got home that night she stacked all her textbooks away in an old trunk in the attic , locked it , and threw the key into the blanket box .</p>
    <p n="1451"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'm not even going to look at a schoolbook in vacation , ”</said>she told<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I 've studied as hard all the term as I possibly could and I 've pored over that geometry until I know every proposition in the first book off by heart , even when the letters ARE changed . I just feel tired of everything sensible and I 'm going to let my imagination run riot for the summer . Oh , you need n't be alarmed ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I 'll only let it run riot within reasonable limits . But I want to have a real good jolly time this summer , for maybe it 's the last summer I 'll be a little girl .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says that if I keep stretching out next year as I 've done this I 'll have to put on longer skirts . She says I 'm all running to legs and eyes . And when I put on longer skirts I shall feel that I have to live up to them and be very dignified . It wo n't even do to believe in fairies then , I 'm afraid ; so I 'm going to believe in them with all my whole heart this summer . I think we 're going to have a very gay vacation .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>is going to have a birthday party soon and there 's the Sunday school picnic and the missionary concert next month . And<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>says that some evening he 'll take<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and me over to the White Sands Hotel and have dinner there . They have dinner there in the evening , you know .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>was over once last summer and she says it was a dazzling sight to see the electric lights and the flowers and all the lady guests in such beautiful dresses .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>says it was her first glimpse into high life and she 'll never forget it to her dying day . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1452"><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>came up the next afternoon to find out why<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had not been at the Aid meeting on Thursday . When<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was not at Aid meeting people knew there was something wrong at Green Gables .</p>
    <p n="1453"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had a bad spell with his heart Thursday , ”</said><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>explained ,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ and I did n't feel like leaving him . Oh , yes , he 's all right again now , but he takes them spells oftener than he used to and I 'm anxious about him . The doctor says he must be careful to avoid excitement . That 's easy enough , for<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>does n't go about looking for excitement by any means and never did , but he 's not to do any very heavy work either and you might as well tell<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>not to breathe as not to work . Come and lay off your things ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>. You 'll stay to tea ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1454">“ Well , seeing you 're so pressing , perhaps I might as well , stay ” said<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>, who had not the slightest intention of doing anything else .</p>
    <p n="1455"><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sat comfortably in the parlor while<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>got the tea and made hot biscuits that were light and white enough to defy even<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>'s criticism .</p>
    <p n="1456"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I must say<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>has turned out a real smart girl , ”</said>admitted<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>, as<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>accompanied her to the end of the lane at sunset .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ She must be a great help to you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1457"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ She is , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>,<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ and she 's real steady and reliable now . I used to be afraid she 'd never get over her featherbrained ways , but she has and I would n't be afraid to trust her in anything now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1458"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I never would have thought she 'd have turned out so well that first day I was here three years ago , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>.<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Lawful heart , shall I ever forget that tantrum of hers ! When I went home that night I says to<persName corresp="#Thomas">Thomas</persName>, says I , ‘ Mark my words ,<persName corresp="#Thomas">Thomas</persName>,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>'ll live to rue the step she 's took . ’ But I was mistaken and I 'm real glad of it . I ai n't one of those kind of people ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, as can never be brought to own up that they 've made a mistake . No , that never was my way , thank goodness . I did make a mistake in judging<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, but it were n't no wonder , for an odder , unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in this world , that 's what . There was no ciphering her out by the rules that worked with other children . It 's nothing short of wonderful how she 's improved these three years , but especially in looks . She 's a real pretty girl got to be , though I can n't say I 'm overly partial to that pale , big-eyed style myself . I like more snap and color , like<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana Barry</persName>has or<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>.<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>'s looks are real showy . But somehow — I do n't know how it is but when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and them are together , though she ai n't half as handsome , she makes them look kind of common and overdone — something like them white June lilies she calls narcissus alongside of the big , red peonies , that 's what . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="31">
    <p n="1459"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had her “ good ” summer and enjoyed it wholeheartedly . She and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>fairly lived outdoors , reveling in all the delights that Lover 's Lane and the Dryad 's Bubble and Willowmere and Victoria Island afforded .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>offered no objections to<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s gypsyings . The Spencervale doctor who had come the night<persName>Minnie</persName>May had the croup met<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>at the house of a patient one afternoon early in vacation , looked her over sharply , screwed up his mouth , shook his head , and sent a message to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>by another person . It was :</p>
    <p n="1460"><said who="#Anne">“ Keep that redheaded girl of yours in the open air all summer and do n't let her read books until she gets more spring into her step . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1461">This message frightened<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>wholesomely . She read<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s death warrant by consumption in it unless it was scrupulously obeyed . As a result ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had the golden summer of her life as far as freedom and frolic went . She walked , rowed , berried , and dreamed to her heart 's content ; and when September came she was bright-eyed and alert , with a step that would have satisfied the Spencervale doctor and a heart full of ambition and zest once more .</p>
    <p n="1462"><said who="#Anne">“ I feel just like studying with might and main , ”</said>she declared as she brought her books down from the attic .<said who="#Anne">“ Oh , you good old friends , I 'm glad to see your honest faces once more — yes , even you , geometry . I 've had a perfectly beautiful summer ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, and now I 'm rejoicing as a strong man to run a race , as<persName>Mr. Allan</persName>said last Sunday . Does n't<persName>Mr. Allan</persName>preach magnificent sermons ?<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says he is improving every day and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up and then we 'll be left and have to turn to and break in another green preacher . But I do n't see the use of meeting trouble halfway , do you ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? I think it would be better just to enjoy<persName>Mr. Allan</persName>while we have him . If I were a man I think I 'd be a minister . They can have such an influence for good , if their theology is sound ; and it must be thrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers ’ hearts . Why can n't women be ministers ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? I asked<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>that and she was shocked and said it would be a scandalous thing . She said there might be female ministers in the States and she believed there was , but thank goodness we had n't got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we never would . But I do n't see why . I think women would make splendid ministers . When there is a social to be got up or a church tea or anything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work . I 'm sure<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>can pray every bit as well as Superintendent<persName>Bell</persName>and I 've no doubt she could preach too with a little practice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1463"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Yes , I believe she could , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>dryly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ She does plenty of unofficial preaching as it is . Nobody has much of a chance to go wrong in Avonlea with<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>to oversee them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1464"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>in a burst of confidence ,<said who="#Anne">“ I want to tell you something and ask you what you think about it . It has worried me terribly — on Sunday afternoons , that is , when I think specially about such matters . I do really want to be good ; and when I 'm with you or<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>or<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>I want it more than ever and I want to do just what would please you and what you would approve of . But mostly when I 'm with<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>I feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the very thing she tells me I ought n't to do . I feel irresistibly tempted to do it . Now , what do you think is the reason I feel like that ? Do you think it 's because I 'm really bad and unregenerate ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1465"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>looked dubious for a moment . Then she laughed .</p>
    <p n="1466"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ If you are I guess I am too ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, for<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>often has that very effect on me . I sometimes think she 'd have more of an influence for good , as you say yourself , if she did n't keep nagging people to do right . There should have been a special commandment against nagging . But there , I should n't talk so .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>is a good Christian woman and she means well . There is n't a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks her share of work . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1467"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm very glad you feel the same , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>decidedly .<said who="#Anne">“ It 's so encouraging . I sha n't worry so much over that after this . But I dare say there 'll be other things to worry me . They keep coming up new all the time — things to perplex you , you know . You settle one question and there 's another right after . There are so many things to be thought over and decided when you 're beginning to grow up . It keeps me busy all the time thinking them over and deciding what is right . It 's a serious thing to grow up , is n't it ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? But when I have such good friends as you and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>and<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>I ought to grow up successfully , and I 'm sure it will be my own fault if I do n't . I feel it 's a great responsibility because I have only the one chance . If I do n't grow up right I can n't go back and begin over again . I 've grown two inches this summer ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. Mr.<persName>Gillis</persName>measured me at<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>'s party . I 'm so glad you made my new dresses longer . That dark-green one is so pretty and it was sweet of you to put on the flounce . Of course I know it was n't really necessary , but flounces are so stylish this fall and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>has flounces on all her dresses . I know I 'll be able to study better because of mine . I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my mind about that flounce . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1468"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It 's worth something to have that , ”</said>admitted<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1469"><persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>came back to Avonlea school and found all her pupils eager for work once more . Especially did the<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s class gird up their loins for the fray , for at the end of the coming year , dimly shadowing their pathway already , loomed up that fateful thing known as “ the Entrance , ” at the thought of which one and all felt their hearts sink into their very shoes . Suppose they did not pass ! That thought was doomed to haunt<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>through the waking hours of that winter , Sunday afternoons inclusive , to the almost entire exclusion of moral and theological problems . When<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had bad dreams she found herself staring miserably at pass lists of the Entrance exams , where<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>'s name was blazoned at the top and in which hers did not appear at all .</p>
    <p n="1470">But it was a jolly , busy , happy swift-flying winter . Schoolwork was as interesting , class rivalry as absorbing , as of yore . New worlds of thought , feeling , and ambition , fresh , fascinating fields of unexplored knowledge seemed to be opening out before<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s eager eyes .</p>
    <p n="1471"><said who="#Anne">“ Hills peeped o'er hill and Alps on Alps arose . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1472">Much of all this was due to<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>'s tactful , careful , broadminded guidance . She led her class to think and explore and discover for themselves and encouraged straying from the old beaten paths to a degree that quite shocked<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>and the school trustees , who viewed all innovations on established methods rather dubiously .</p>
    <p n="1473">Apart from her studies<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>expanded socially , for<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, mindful of the Spencervale doctor 's dictum , no longer vetoed occasional outings . The Debating Club flourished and gave several concerts ; there were one or two parties almost verging on grown-up affairs ; there were sleigh drives and skating frolics galore .</p>
    <p n="1474">Betweentimes<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>grew , shooting up so rapidly that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was astonished one day , when they were standing side by side , to find the girl was taller than herself .</p>
    <p n="1475"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Why ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, how you 've grown ! ”</said>she said , almost unbelievingly . A sigh followed on the words .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>felt a queer regret over<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s inches . The child she had learned to love had vanished somehow and here was this tall , serious-eyed girl of fifteen , with the thoughtful brows and the proudly poised little head , in her place .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>loved the girl as much as she had loved the child , but she was conscious of a queer sorrowful sense of loss . And that night , when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had gone to prayer meeting with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sat alone in the wintry twilight and indulged in the weakness of a cry .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, coming in with a lantern , caught her at it and gazed at her in such consternation that<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had to laugh through her tears .</p>
    <p n="1476"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I was thinking about<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>she explained .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ She 's got to be such a big girl — and she 'll probably be away from us next winter . I 'll miss her terrible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1477"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ She 'll be able to come home often , ”</said>comforted<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, to whom<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was as yet and always would be the little , eager girl he had brought home from Bright River on that June evening four years before .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ The branch railroad will be built to Carmody by that time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1478"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It wo n't be the same thing as having her here all the time , ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>gloomily , determined to enjoy her luxury of grief uncomforted .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ But there — men can n't understand these things ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1479">There were other changes in<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>no less real than the physical change . For one thing , she became much quieter . Perhaps she thought all the more and dreamed as much as ever , but she certainly talked less .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>noticed and commented on this also .</p>
    <p n="1480"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You do n't chatter half as much as you used to ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, nor use half as many big words . What has come over you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1481"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>colored and laughed a little , as she dropped her book and looked dreamily out of the window , where big fat red buds were bursting out on the creeper in response to the lure of the spring sunshine .</p>
    <p n="1482"><said who="#Anne">“ I do n't know — I do n't want to talk as much , ”</said>she said , denting her chin thoughtfully with her forefinger .<said who="#Anne">“ It 's nicer to think dear , pretty thoughts and keep them in one 's heart , like treasures . I do n't like to have them laughed at or wondered over . And somehow I do n't want to use big words any more . It 's almost a pity , is n't it , now that I 'm really growing big enough to say them if I did want to . It 's fun to be almost grown up in some ways , but it 's not the kind of fun I expected ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. There 's so much to learn and do and think that there is n't time for big words . Besides ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>says the short ones are much stronger and better . She makes us write all our essays as simply as possible . It was hard at first . I was so used to crowding in all the fine big words I could think of — and I thought of any number of them . But I 've got used to it now and I see it 's so much better . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1483"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ What has become of your story club ? I have n't heard you speak of it for a long time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1484"><said who="#Anne">“ The story club is n't in existence any longer . We had n't time for it — and anyhow I think we had got tired of it . It was silly to be writing about love and murder and elopements and mysteries .<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>sometimes has us write a story for training in composition , but she wo n't let us write anything but what might happen in Avonlea in our own lives , and she criticizes it very sharply and makes us criticize our own too . I never thought my compositions had so many faults until I began to look for them myself . I felt so ashamed I wanted to give up altogether , but<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>said I could learn to write well if I only trained myself to be my own severest critic . And so I am trying to . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1485"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You 've only two more months before the Entrance , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Do you think you 'll be able to get through ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1486"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>shivered .</p>
    <p n="1487"><said who="#Anne">“ I do n't know . Sometimes I think I 'll be all right — and then I get horribly afraid . We 've studied hard and<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>has drilled us thoroughly , but we may n't get through for all that . We 've each got a stumbling block . Mine is geometry of course , and<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>'s is<persName corresp="#Latin">Latin</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>and Charlie 's is algebra , and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>'s is arithmetic .<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>says he feels it in his bones that he is going to fail in English history .<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>is going to give us examinations in June just as hard as we 'll have at the Entrance and mark us just as strictly , so we 'll have some idea . I wish it was all over ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. It haunts me . Sometimes I wake up in the night and wonder what I 'll do if I do n't pass . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1488"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Why , go to school next year and try again , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>unconcernedly .</p>
    <p n="1489"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I do n't believe I 'd have the heart for it . It would be such a disgrace to fail , especially if<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gil</persName>— if the others passed . And I get so nervous in an examination that I 'm likely to make a mess of it . I wish I had nerves like<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>. Nothing rattles her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1490"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sighed and , dragging her eyes from the witcheries of the spring world , the beckoning day of breeze and blue , and the green things upspringing in the garden , buried herself resolutely in her book . There would be other springs , but if she did not succeed in passing the Entrance ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt convinced that she would never recover sufficiently to enjoy them .</p>

    <p n="1491">With the end of June came the close of the term and the close of<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>'s rule in Avonlea school .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>walked home that evening feeling very sober indeed . Red eyes and damp handkerchiefs bore convincing testimony to the fact that<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>'s farewell words must have been quite as touching as<persName corresp="#Mr._Phillips">Mr. Phillips</persName>'s had been under similar circumstances three years before .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>looked back at the schoolhouse from the foot of the spruce hill and sighed deeply .</p>
    <p n="1492"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It does seem as if it was the end of everything , does n't it ? ”</said>she said dismally .</p>
    <p n="1493"><said who="#Anne">“ You ought n't to feel half as badly as I do , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, hunting vainly for a dry spot on her handkerchief .<said who="#Anne">“ You 'll be back again next winter , but I suppose I 've left the dear old school forever — if I have good luck , that is . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1494"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It wo n't be a bit the same .<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>wo n't be there , nor you nor<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>nor<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>probably . I shall have to sit all alone , for I could n't bear to have another deskmate after you . Oh , we have had jolly times , have n't we ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? It 's dreadful to think they 're all over . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1495">Two big tears rolled down by<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s nose .</p>
    <p n="1496"><said who="#Anne">“ If you would stop crying I could , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>imploringly .<said who="#Anne">“ Just as soon as I put away my hanky I see you brimming up and that starts me off again . As<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says , ‘ If you can n't be cheerful , be as cheerful as you can . ’ After all , I dare say I 'll be back next year . This is one of the times I KNOW I 'm not going to pass . They 're getting alarmingly frequent . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1497"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Why , you came out splendidly in the exams<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>gave . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1498"><said who="#Anne">“ Yes , but those exams did n't make me nervous . When I think of the real thing you can n't imagine what a horrid cold fluttery feeling comes round my heart . And then my number is thirteen and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>says it 's so unlucky . I am NOT superstitious and I know it can make no difference . But still I wish it was n't thirteen . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1499"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I do wish I was going in with you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Would n't we have a perfectly elegant time ? But I suppose you 'll have to cram in the evenings . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1500"><said who="#Anne">“ No ;<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>has made us promise not to open a book at all . She says it would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not think about the exams at all and go to bed early . It 's good advice , but I expect it will be hard to follow ; good advice is apt to be , I think .<persName>Prissy Andrews</persName>told me that she sat up half the night every night of her Entrance week and crammed for dear life ; and I had determined to sit up AT LEAST as long as she did . It was so kind of your<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Aunt Josephine</persName>to ask me to stay at Beechwood while I 'm in town . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1501"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ You 'll write to me while you 're in , wo n't you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1502"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'll write Tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes , ”</said>promised<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1503"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I 'll be haunting the post office Wednesday , ”</said>vowed<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1504"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>went to town the following Monday and on Wednesday<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>haunted the post office , as agreed , and got her letter .</p>
    <p n="1505">“ Dearest<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>” [ wrote<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>] ,</p>
    <p n="1506">“ Here it is Tuesday night and I 'm writing this in the library at Beechwood . Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and wished so much you were with me . I could n't “ cram ” because I 'd promised<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>not to , but it was as hard to keep from opening my history as it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were learned .</p>
    <p n="1507"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ This morning<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>came for me and we went to the Academy , calling for<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>on our way .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>asked me to feel her hands and they were as cold as ice .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>said I looked as if I had n't slept a wink and she did n't believe I was strong enough to stand the grind of the teacher 's course even if I did get through . There are times and seasons even yet when I do n't feel that I 've made any great headway in learning to like<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>!</said></p>
    <p n="1508"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from all over the Island . The first person we saw was<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>sitting on the steps and muttering away to himself .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>asked him what on earth he was doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over and over to steady his nerves and for pity 's sake not to interrupt him , because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot everything he ever knew , but the multiplication table kept all his facts firmly in their proper place !</said></p>
    <p n="1509"><said >“ When we were assigned to our rooms<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>had to leave us .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and I sat together and<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>was so composed that I envied her . No need of the multiplication table for good , steady , sensible<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>! I wondered if I looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear across the room . Then a man came in and began distributing the English examination sheets . My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled around as I picked it up . Just one awful moment —<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, I felt exactly as I did four years ago when I asked<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>if I might stay at Green Gables — and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began beating again — I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether !— for I knew I could do something with THAT paper anyhow .</said></p>
    <p n="1510"><said who="#Miss_Stacy">“ At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in the afternoon . The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully mixed up in the dates . Still , I think I did fairly well today . But oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it it takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my Euclid . If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would recite it from now till tomorrow morning .</said></p>
    <p n="1511"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I went down to see the other girls this evening . On my way I met<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>wandering distractedly around . He said he knew he had failed in history and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he was going home on the morning train ; and it would be easier to be a carpenter than a minister , anyhow . I cheered him up and persuaded him to stay to the end because it would be unfair to<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>if he did n't . Sometimes I have wished I was born a boy , but when I see<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>I 'm always glad I 'm a girl and not his sister .</said></p>
    <p n="1512"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse ; she had just discovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper . When she recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream . How we wished you had been with us .</said></p>
    <p n="1513"><said who="#Miss_Stacy">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, if only the geometry examination were over ! But there , as<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>would say , the sun will go on rising and setting whether I fail in geometry or not . That is true but not especially comforting . I think I 'd rather it did n't go on if I failed !</said></p>
    <p n="1514"><said who="#Miss_Stacy">“ Yours devotedly ,</said></p>
    <p n="1515"><said who="#Miss_Stacy">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>”</said></p>
    <p n="1516">The geometry examination and all the others were over in due time and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>arrived home on Friday evening , rather tired but with an air of chastened triumph about her .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>was over at Green Gables when she arrived and they met as if they had been parted for years .</p>
    <p n="1517"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ You old darling , it 's perfectly splendid to see you back again . It seems like an age since you went to town and oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, how did you get along ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1518"><said who="#Anne">“ Pretty well , I think , in everything but the geometry . I do n't know whether I passed in it or not and I have a creepy , crawly presentiment that I did n't . Oh , how good it is to be back ! Green Gables is the dearest , loveliest spot in the world . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1519"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ How did the others do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1520"><said who="#Anne">“ The girls say they know they did n't pass , but I think they did pretty well .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it !<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>still thinks he failed in history and Charlie says he failed in algebra . But we do n't really know anything about it and wo n't until the pass list is out . That wo n't be for a fortnight . Fancy living a fortnight in such suspense ! I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up until it is over . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1521"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>knew it would be useless to ask how<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>had fared , so she merely said :</p>
    <p n="1522"><said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“ Oh , you 'll pass all right . Do n't worry . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1523"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'd rather not pass at all than not come out pretty well up on the list , ”</said>flashed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, by which she meant — and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>knew she meant — that success would be incomplete and bitter if she did not come out ahead of<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1524">With this end in view<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had strained every nerve during the examinations . So had<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>. They had met and passed each other on the street a dozen times without any sign of recognition and every time<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had held her head a little higher and wished a little more earnestly that she had made friends with<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>when he asked her , and vowed a little more determinedly to surpass him in the examination . She knew that all Avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first ; she even knew that Jimmy Glover and Ned Wright had a bet on the question and that<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>had said there was no doubt in the world that<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>would be first ; and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable if she failed .</p>
    <p n="1525">But she had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well . She wanted to “ pass high ” for the sake of<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>— especially<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>.<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had declared to her his conviction that she “ would beat the whole Island . ” That ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt , was something it would be foolish to hope for even in the wildest dreams . But she did hope fervently that she would be among the first ten at least , so that she might see<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s kindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement . That , she felt , would be a sweet reward indeed for all her hard work and patient grubbing among unimaginative equations and conjugations .</p>
    <p n="1526">At the end of the fortnight<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>took to “ haunting ” the post office also , in the distracted company of<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>,<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>, opening the Charlottetown dailies with shaking hands and cold , sinkaway feelings as bad as any experienced during the Entrance week . Charlie and<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>were not above doing this too , but<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>stayed resolutely away .</p>
    <p n="1527"><said who="#Anne">“ I have n't got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood , ”</said>he told<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me suddenly whether I 've passed or not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1528">When three weeks had gone by without the pass list appearing<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>began to feel that she really could n't stand the strain much longer . Her appetite failed and her interest in Avonlea doings languished .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>wanted to know what else you could expect with a Tory superintendent of education at the head of affairs , and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, noting<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s paleness and indifference and the lagging steps that bore her home from the post office every afternoon , began seriously to wonder if he had n't better vote Grit at the next election .</p>
    <p n="1529">But one evening the news came .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was sitting at her open window , for the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the world , as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk , sweet-scented with flower breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the stir of poplars . The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the reflection of the west , and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was wondering dreamily if the spirit of color looked like that , when she saw<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>come flying down through the firs , over the log bridge , and up the slope , with a fluttering newspaper in her hand .</p>
    <p n="1530"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sprang to her feet , knowing at once what that paper contained . The pass list was out ! Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt her . She could not move a step . It seemed an hour to her before<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>came rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even knocking , so great was her excitement .</p>
    <p n="1531"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, you 've passed , ”</said>she cried ,<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ passed the VERY FIRST — you and<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>both — you 're ties — but your name is first . Oh , I 'm so proud ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1532"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>flung the paper on the table and herself on<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s bed , utterly breathless and incapable of further speech .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>lighted the lamp , oversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her shaking hands could accomplish the task . Then she snatched up the paper . Yes , she had passed — there was her name at the very top of a list of two hundred ! That moment was worth living for .</p>
    <p n="1533"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ You did just splendidly ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>puffed<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, recovering sufficiently to sit up and speak , for<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, starry eyed and rapt , had not uttered a word .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“<persName>Father</persName>brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes ago — it came out on the afternoon train , you know , and wo n't be here till tomorrow by mail — and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over like a wild thing . You 've all passed , every one of you ,<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>and all , although he 's conditioned in history .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>did pretty well — they 're halfway up — and so did Charlie .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>just scraped through with three marks to spare , but you 'll see she 'll put on as many airs as if she 'd led . Wo n't<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>be delighted ? Oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, what does it feel like to see your name at the head of a pass list like that ? If it were me I know I 'd go crazy with joy . I am pretty near crazy as it is , but you 're as calm and cool as a spring evening . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1534"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm just dazzled inside , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I want to say a hundred things , and I can n't find words to say them in . I never dreamed of this — yes , I did too , just once ! I let myself think ONCE , ‘ What if I should come out first ? ’ quakingly , you know , for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to think I could lead the Island . Excuse me a minute ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. I must run right out to the field to tell<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. Then we 'll go up the road and tell the good news to the others . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1535">They hurried to the hayfield below the barn where<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was coiling hay , and , as luck would have it ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>was talking to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>at the lane fence .</p>
    <p n="1536"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne">“ I 've passed and I 'm first — or one of the first ! I 'm not vain , but I 'm thankful . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1537"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I always said it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, gazing at the pass list delightedly .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I knew you could beat them all easy . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1538"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You 've done pretty well , I must say ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, trying to hide her extreme pride in<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>from<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>'s critical eye . But that good soul said heartily :</p>
    <p n="1539"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I just guess she has done well , and far be it from me to be backward in saying it . You 're a credit to your friends ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, that 's what , and we 're all proud of you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1540">That night<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious little talk with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>at the manse , knelt sweetly by her open window in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude and aspiration that came straight from her heart . There was in it thankfulness for the past and reverent petition for the future ; and when she slept on her white pillow her dreams were as fair and bright and beautiful as maidenhood might desire .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="33">
    <p n="1541"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Put on your white organdy , by all means ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>advised<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>decidedly .</p>
    <p n="1542">They were together in the east gable chamber ; outside it was only twilight — a lovely yellowish-green twilight with a clear-blue cloudless sky . A big round moon , slowly deepening from her pallid luster into burnished silver , hung over the Haunted Wood ; the air was full of sweet summer sounds — sleepy birds twittering , freakish breezes , faraway voices and laughter . But in<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s room the blind was drawn and the lamp lighted , for an important toilet was being made .</p>
    <p n="1543">The east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that night four years before , when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had felt its bareness penetrate to the marrow of her spirit with its inhospitable chill . Changes had crept in ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>conniving at them resignedly , until it was as sweet and dainty a nest as a young girl could desire .</p>
    <p n="1544">The velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s early visions had certainly never materialized ; but her dreams had kept pace with her growth , and it is not probable she lamented them . The floor was covered with a pretty matting , and the curtains that softened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of pale-green art muslin . The walls , hung not with gold and silver brocade tapestry , but with a dainty apple-blossom paper , were adorned with a few good pictures given<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>by<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>.<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>'s photograph occupied the place of honor , and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>made a sentimental point of keeping fresh flowers on the bracket under it . Tonight a spike of white lilies faintly perfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance . There was no “ mahogany furniture , ” but there was a white-painted bookcase filled with books , a cushioned wicker rocker , a toilet table befrilled with white muslin , a quaint , gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink Cupids and purple grapes painted over its arched top , that used to hang in the spare room , and a low white bed .</p>
    <p n="1545"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was dressing for a concert at the White Sands Hotel . The guests had got it up in aid of the Charlottetown hospital , and had hunted out all the available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it along . Bertha Sampson and Pearl Clay of the White Sands Baptist choir had been asked to sing a duet ; Milton Clark of Newbridge was to give a violin solo ; Winnie Adella Blair of Carmody was to sing a Scotch ballad ; and Laura<persName>Spencer</persName>of Spencervale and<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>of Avonlea were to recite .</p>
    <p n="1546">As<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>would have said at one time , it was “ an epoch in her life , ” and she was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was in the seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was not far behind , although she would have died rather than admit it , and said she did n't think it was very proper for a lot of young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible person with them .</p>
    <p n="1547"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>were to drive over with<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>and her brother<persName>Billy</persName>in their double-seated buggy ; and several other Avonlea girls and boys were going too . There was a party of visitors expected out from town , and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers .</p>
    <p n="1548"><said who="#Anne">“ Do you really think the organdy will be best ? ”</said>queried<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>anxiously .<said who="#Anne">“ I do n't think it 's as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin — and it certainly is n't so fashionable . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1549"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ But it suits you ever so much better , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It 's so soft and frilly and clinging . The muslin is stiff , and makes you look too dressed up . But the organdy seems as if it grew on you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1550"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sighed and yielded .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>was beginning to have a reputation for notable taste in dressing , and her advice on such subjects was much sought after . She was looking very pretty herself on this particular night in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink , from which<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was forever debarred ; but she was not to take any part in the concert , so her appearance was of minor importance . All her pains were bestowed upon<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, who , she vowed , must , for the credit of Avonlea , be dressed and combed and adorned to the<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s taste .</p>
    <p n="1551"><said who="#Queen">“ Pull out that frill a little more — so ; here , let me tie your sash ; now for your slippers . I 'm going to braid your hair in two thick braids , and tie them halfway up with big white bows — no , do n't pull out a single curl over your forehead — just have the soft part . There is no way you do your hair suits you so well ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>says you look like a Madonna when you part it so . I shall fasten this little white house rose just behind your ear . There was just one on my bush , and I saved it for you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1552"><said who="#Anne">“ Shall I put my pearl beads on ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>brought me a string from town last week , and I know he 'd like to see them on me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1553"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>pursed up her lips , put her black head on one side critically , and finally pronounced in favor of the beads , which were thereupon tied around<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s slim milk-white throat .</p>
    <p n="1554"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ There 's something so stylish about you ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, with unenvious admiration .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ You hold your head with such an air . I suppose it 's your figure . I am just a dumpling . I 've always been afraid of it , and now I know it is so . Well , I suppose I shall just have to resign myself to it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1555"><said who="#Anne">“ But you have such dimples , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, smiling affectionately into the pretty , vivacious face so near her own .<said who="#Anne">“ Lovely dimples , like little dents in cream . I have given up all hope of dimples . My dimple-dream will never come true ; but so many of my dreams have that I must n't complain . Am I all ready now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1556"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ All ready , ”</said>assured<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, as<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>appeared in the doorway , a gaunt figure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles , but with a much softer face .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Come right in and look at our elocutionist ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. Does n't she look lovely ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1557"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt .</p>
    <p n="1558"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ She looks neat and proper . I like that way of fixing her hair . But I expect she 'll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew with it , and it looks most too thin for these damp nights . Organdy 's the most unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow , and I told<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>so when he got it . But there is no use in saying anything to<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>nowadays . Time was when he would take my advice , but now he just buys things for<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>regardless , and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything off on him . Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable , and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>plunks his money down for it . Mind you keep your skirt clear of the wheel ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, and put your warm jacket on . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1559">Then<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>stalked downstairs , thinking proudly how sweet<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked , with that</p>
    <p n="1560"><said who="#Anne">“ One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown ”</said></p>
    <p n="1561">and regretting that she could not go to the concert herself to hear her girl recite .</p>
    <p n="1562"><said who="#Anne">“ I wonder if it IS too damp for my dress , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>anxiously .</p>
    <p n="1563"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Not a bit of it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, pulling up the window blind .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It 's a perfect night , and there wo n't be any dew . Look at the moonlight . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1564"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm so glad my window looks east into the sunrising , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, going over to<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ It 's so splendid to see the morning coming up over those long hills and glowing through those sharp fir tops . It 's new every morning , and I feel as if I washed my very soul in that bath of earliest sunshine . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, I love this little room so dearly . I do n't know how I 'll get along without it when I go to town next month . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1565"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ Do n't speak of your going away tonight , ”</said>begged<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I do n't want to think of it , it makes me so miserable , and I do want to have a good time this evening . What are you going to recite ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? And are you nervous ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1566"><said who="#Anne">“ Not a bit . I 've recited so often in public I do n't mind at all now . I 've decided to give ‘ The Maiden 's Vow . ’ It 's so pathetic . Laura<persName>Spencer</persName>is going to give a comic recitation , but I 'd rather make people cry than laugh . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1567"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ What will you recite if they encore you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1568"><said who="#Anne">“ They wo n't dream of encoring me , ”</said>scoffed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, who was not without her own secret hopes that they would , and already visioned herself telling<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>all about it at the next morning 's breakfast table .<said who="#Anne">“ There are<persName>Billy</persName>and<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>now — I hear the wheels . Come on . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1569"><persName>Billy</persName><persName>Andrews</persName>insisted that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>should ride on the front seat with him , so she unwillingly climbed up . She would have much preferred to sit back with the girls , where she could have laughed and chattered to her heart 's content . There was not much of either laughter or chatter in<persName>Billy</persName>. He was a big , fat , stolid youth of twenty , with a round , expressionless face , and a painful lack of conversational gifts . But he admired<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>immensely , and was puffed up with pride over the prospect of driving to White Sands with that slim , upright figure beside him .</p>
    <p n="1570"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, by dint of talking over her shoulder to the girls and occasionally passing a sop of civility to<persName>Billy</persName>— who grinned and chuckled and never could think of any reply until it was too late — contrived to enjoy the drive in spite of all . It was a night for enjoyment . The road was full of buggies , all bound for the hotel , and laughter , silver clear , echoed and reechoed along it . When they reached the hotel it was a blaze of light from top to bottom . They were met by the ladies of the concert committee , one of whom took<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>off to the performers ’ dressing room which was filled with the members of a Charlottetown Symphony Club , among whom<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt suddenly shy and frightened and countrified . Her dress , which , in the east gable , had seemed so dainty and pretty , now seemed simple and plain — too simple and plain , she thought , among all the silks and laces that glistened and rustled around her . What were her pearl beads compared to the diamonds of the big , handsome lady near her ? And how poor her one wee white rose must look beside all the hothouse flowers the others wore !<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>laid her hat and jacket away , and shrank miserably into a corner . She wished herself back in the white room at Green Gables .</p>
    <p n="1571">It was still worse on the platform of the big concert hall of the hotel , where she presently found herself . The electric lights dazzled her eyes , the perfume and hum bewildered her . She wished she were sitting down in the audience with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>, who seemed to be having a splendid time away at the back . She was wedged in between a stout lady in pink silk and a tall , scornful-looking girl in a white-lace dress . The stout lady occasionally turned her head squarely around and surveyed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>through her eyeglasses until<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, acutely sensitive of being so scrutinized , felt that she must scream aloud ; and the white-lace girl kept talking audibly to her next neighbor about the “ country bumpkins ” and “ rustic belles ” in the audience , languidly anticipating “ such fun ” from the displays of local talent on the program .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>believed that she would hate that white-lace girl to the end of life .</p>
    <p n="1572">Unfortunately for<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, a professional elocutionist was staying at the hotel and had consented to recite . She was a lithe , dark-eyed woman in a wonderful gown of shimmering gray stuff like woven moonbeams , with gems on her neck and in her dark hair . She had a marvelously flexible voice and wonderful power of expression ; the audience went wild over her selection .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, forgetting all about herself and her troubles for the time , listened with rapt and shining eyes ; but when the recitation ended she suddenly put her hands over her face . She could never get up and recite after that — never . Had she ever thought she could recite ? Oh , if she were only back at Green Gables !</p>
    <p n="1573">At this unpropitious moment her name was called . Somehow<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>— who did not notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace girl gave , and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied therein if she had — got on her feet , and moved dizzily out to the front . She was so pale that<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>, down in the audience , clasped each other 's hands in nervous sympathy .</p>
    <p n="1574"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright . Often as she had recited in public , she had never before faced such an audience as this , and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely . Everything was so strange , so brilliant , so bewildering — the rows of ladies in evening dress , the critical faces , the whole atmosphere of wealth and culture about her . Very different this from the plain benches at the Debating Club , filled with the homely , sympathetic faces of friends and neighbors . These people , she thought , would be merciless critics . Perhaps , like the white-lace girl , they anticipated amusement from her “ rustic ” efforts . She felt hopelessly , helplessly ashamed and miserable . Her knees trembled , her heart fluttered , a horrible faintness came over her ; not a word could she utter , and the next moment she would have fled from the platform despite the humiliation which , she felt , must ever after be her portion if she did so .</p>
    <p n="1575">But suddenly , as her dilated , frightened eyes gazed out over the audience , she saw<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>away at the back of the room , bending forward with a smile on his face — a smile which seemed to<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>at once triumphant and taunting . In reality it was nothing of the kind .<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>was merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and of the effect produced by<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s slender white form and spiritual face against a background of palms in particular .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>, whom he had driven over , sat beside him , and her face certainly was both triumphant and taunting . But<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>did not see<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>, and would not have cared if she had . She drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly , courage and determination tingling over her like an electric shock . She WOULD NOT fail before<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>— he should never be able to laugh at her , never , never ! Her fright and nervousness vanished ; and she began her recitation , her clear , sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of the room without a tremor or a break . Self-possession was fully restored to her , and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness she recited as she had never done before . When she finished there were bursts of honest applause .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, stepping back to her seat , blushing with shyness and delight , found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken by the stout lady in pink silk .</p>
    <p n="1576"><said who="#Anne">“ My dear , you did splendidly , ”</said>she puffed .<said who="#Anne">“ I 've been crying like a baby , actually I have . There , they 're encoring you — they 're bound to have you back ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1577"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , I can n't go , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>confusedly .<said who="#Anne">“ But yet — I must , or<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>will be disappointed . He said they would encore me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1578"><said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“ Then do n't disappoint<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, ”</said>said the pink lady , laughing .</p>
    <p n="1579">Smiling , blushing , limpid eyed ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>tripped back and gave a quaint , funny little selection that captivated her audience still further . The rest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her .</p>
    <p n="1580">When the concert was over , the stout , pink lady — who was the wife of an American millionaire — took her under her wing , and introduced her to everybody ; and everybody was very nice to her . The professional elocutionist , Mrs. Evans , came and chatted with her , telling her that she had a charming voice and “ interpreted ” her selections beautifully . Even the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment . They had supper in the big , beautifully decorated dining room ;<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>were invited to partake of this , also , since they had come with<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, but<persName>Billy</persName>was nowhere to be found , having decamped in mortal fear of some such invitation . He was in waiting for them , with the team , however , when it was all over , and the three girls came merrily out into the calm , white moonshine radiance .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>breathed deeply , and looked into the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs .</p>
    <p n="1581">Oh , it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night ! How great and still and wonderful everything was , with the murmur of the sea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants guarding enchanted coasts .</p>
    <p n="1582"><said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ Has n't it been a perfectly splendid time ? ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>, as they drove away .<said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at a hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and chicken salad every blessed day . I 'm sure it would be ever so much more fun than teaching school .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, your recitation was simply great , although I thought at first you were never going to begin . I think it was better than Mrs. Evans 's . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1583"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , no , do n't say things like that ,<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>quickly ,<said who="#Anne">“ because it sounds silly . It could n't be better than Mrs. Evans 's , you know , for she is a professional , and I 'm only a schoolgirl , with a little knack of reciting . I 'm quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty well . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1584"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I 've a compliment for you ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“ At least I think it must be a compliment because of the tone he said it in . Part of it was anyhow . There was an American sitting behind<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and me — such a romantic-looking man , with coal-black hair and eyes .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>says he is a distinguished artist , and that her mother 's cousin in Boston is married to a man that used to go to school with him . Well , we heard him say — did n't we ,<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>?— ‘ Who is that girl on the platform with the splendid Titian hair ? She has a face I should like to paint . ’ There now ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. But what does Titian hair mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1585"><said who="#Anne">“ Being interpreted it means plain red , I guess , ”</said>laughed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Titian was a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1586"><said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ DID you see all the diamonds those ladies wore ? ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>.<said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ They were simply dazzling . Would n't you just love to be rich , girls ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1587"><said who="#Anne">“ We ARE rich , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>staunchly .<said who="#Anne">“ Why , we have sixteen years to our credit , and we 're happy as queens , and we 've all got imaginations , more or less . Look at that sea , girls — all silver and shadow and vision of things not seen . We could n't enjoy its loveliness any more if we had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds . You would n't change into any of those women if you could . Would you want to be that white-lace girl and wear a sour look all your life , as if you 'd been born turning up your nose at the world ? Or the pink lady , kind and nice as she is , so stout and short that you 'd really no figure at all ? Or even Mrs. Evans , with that sad , sad look in her eyes ? She must have been dreadfully unhappy sometime to have such a look . You KNOW you would n't ,<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1588"><said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ I DON'T know — exactly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>unconvinced .<said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ I think diamonds would comfort a person for a good deal . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1589"><said who="#Anne">“ Well , I do n't want to be anyone but myself , even if I go uncomforted by diamonds all my life , ”</said>declared<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ I 'm quite content to be<persName>Anne of Green Gables</persName>, with my string of pearl beads . I know<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>gave me as much love with them as ever went with Madame the Pink Lady 's jewels . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1590">The next three weeks were busy ones at Green Gables , for<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was getting ready to go to<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s , and there was much sewing to be done , and many things to be talked over and arranged .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s outfit was ample and pretty , for<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>saw to that , and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>for once made no objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested . More — one evening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate pale green material .</p>
    <p n="1591"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, here 's something for a nice light dress for you . I do n't suppose you really need it ; you 've plenty of pretty waists ; but I thought maybe you 'd like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere of an evening in town , to a party or anything like that . I hear that<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>have got ‘ evening dresses , ’ as they call them , and I do n't mean you shall be behind them . I got<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>to help me pick it in town last week , and we 'll get Emily<persName>Gillis</persName>to make it for you . Emily has got taste , and her fits are n't to be equaled . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1592"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, it 's just lovely , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Thank you so much . I do n't believe you ought to be so kind to me — it 's making it harder every day for me to go away . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1593">The green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings as Emily 's taste permitted .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>put it on one evening for<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s benefit , and recited “ The Maiden 's Vow ” for them in the kitchen . As<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>watched the bright , animated face and graceful motions her thoughts went back to the evening<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had arrived at Green Gables , and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd , frightened child in her preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress , the heartbreak looking out of her tearful eyes . Something in the memory brought tears to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s own eyes .</p>
    <p n="1594"><said who="#Anne">“ I declare , my recitation has made you cry ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>gaily stooping over<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady 's cheek .<said who="#Anne">“ Now , I call that a positive triumph . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1595"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No , I was n't crying over your piece , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, who would have scorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I just could n't help thinking of the little girl you used to be ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. And I was wishing you could have stayed a little girl , even with all your queer ways . You 've grown up now and you 're going away ; and you look so tall and stylish and so — so — different altogether in that dress — as if you did n't belong in Avonlea at all — and I just got lonesome thinking it all over . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1596"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>! ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sat down on<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s gingham lap , took<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s lined face between her hands , and looked gravely and tenderly into<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s eyes .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I 'm not a bit changed — not really . I 'm only just pruned down and branched out . The real ME — back here — is just the same . It wo n't make a bit of difference where I go or how much I change outwardly ; at heart I shall always be your little<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, who will love you and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and dear Green Gables more and better every day of her life . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1597"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>laid her fresh young cheek against<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s faded one , and reached out a hand to pat<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s shoulder .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>would have given much just then to have possessed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s power of putting her feelings into words ; but nature and habit had willed it otherwise , and she could only put her arms close about her girl and hold her tenderly to her heart , wishing that she need never let her go .</p>
    <p n="1598"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, with a suspicious moisture in his eyes , got up and went out-of-doors . Under the stars of the blue summer night he walked agitatedly across the yard to the gate under the poplars .</p>
    <p n="1599"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I guess she ai n't been much spoiled , ”</said>he muttered , proudly .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ I guess my putting in my oar occasional never did much harm after all . She 's smart and pretty , and loving , too , which is better than all the rest . She 's been a blessing to us , and there never was a luckier mistake than what<persName corresp="#Mrs._Spencer">Mrs. Spencer</persName>made — if it WAS luck . I do n't believe it was any such thing . It was Providence , because the Almighty saw we needed her , I reckon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1600">The day finally came when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>must go to town . She and<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>drove in one fine September morning , after a tearful parting with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and an untearful practical one — on<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s side at least — with<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. But when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had gone<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>dried her tears and went to a beach picnic at White Sands with some of her Carmody cousins , where she contrived to enjoy herself tolerably well ; while<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>plunged fiercely into unnecessary work and kept at it all day long with the bitterest kind of heartache — the ache that burns and gnaws and cannot wash itself away in ready tears . But that night , when<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>went to bed , acutely and miserably conscious that the little gable room at the end of the hall was untenanted by any vivid young life and unstirred by any soft breathing , she buried her face in her pillow , and wept for her girl in a passion of sobs that appalled her when she grew calm enough to reflect how very wicked it must be to take on so about a sinful fellow creature .</p>
    <p n="1601"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and the rest of the Avonlea scholars reached town just in time to hurry off to the Academy . That first day passed pleasantly enough in a whirl of excitement , meeting all the new students , learning to know the professors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>intended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>;<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>elected to do the same . This meant getting a First Class teacher 's license in one year instead of two , if they were successful ; but it also meant much more and harder work .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>,<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>,<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>, Charlie , and<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>, not being troubled with the stirrings of ambition , were content to take up the Second Class work .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in a room with fifty other students , not one of whom she knew , except the tall , brown-haired boy across the room ; and knowing him in the fashion she did , did not help her much , as she reflected pessimistically . Yet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class ; the old rivalry could still be carried on , and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>would hardly have known what to do if it had been lacking .</p>
    <p n="1602"><said who="#Anne">“ I would n't feel comfortable without it , ”</said>she thought .<said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>looks awfully determined . I suppose he 's making up his mind , here and now , to win the medal . What a splendid chin he has ! I never noticed it before . I do wish<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>had gone in for First Class , too . I suppose I wo n't feel so much like a cat in a strange garret when I get acquainted , though . I wonder which of the girls here are going to be my friends . It 's really an interesting speculation . Of course I promised<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>that no<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s girl , no matter how much I liked her , should ever be as dear to me as she is ; but I 've lots of second-best affections to bestow . I like the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist . She looks vivid and red-rosy ; there 's that pale , fair one gazing out of the window . She has lovely hair , and looks as if she knew a thing or two about dreams . I 'd like to know them both — know them well — well enough to walk with my arm about their waists , and call them nicknames . But just now I do n't know them and they do n't know me , and probably do n't want to know me particularly . Oh , it 's lonesome ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1603">It was lonesomer still when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>found herself alone in her hall bedroom that night at twilight . She was not to board with the other girls , who all had relatives in town to take pity on them . Miss<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josephine Barry</persName>would have liked to board her , but Beechwood was so far from the Academy that it was out of the question ; so miss<persName>Barry</persName>hunted up a boarding-house , assuring<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>that it was the very place for<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1604"><said who="#Miss_Barry">“ The lady who keeps it is a reduced gentlewoman , ”</said>explained<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>.<said who="#Miss_Barry">“ Her husband was a British officer , and she is very careful what sort of boarders she takes .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>will not meet with any objectionable persons under her roof . The table is good , and the house is near the Academy , in a quiet neighborhood . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1605">All this might be quite true , and indeed , proved to be so , but it did not materially help<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>in the first agony of homesickness that seized upon her . She looked dismally about her narrow little room , with its dull-papered , pictureless walls , its small iron bedstead and empty book-case ; and a horrible choke came into her throat as she thought of her own white room at Green Gables , where she would have the pleasant consciousness of a great green still outdoors , of sweet peas growing in the garden , and moonlight falling on the orchard , of the brook below the slope and the spruce boughs tossing in the night wind beyond it , of a vast starry sky , and the light from<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s window shining out through the gap in the trees . Here there was nothing of this ;<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>knew that outside of her window was a hard street , with a network of telephone wires shutting out the sky , the tramp of alien feet , and a thousand lights gleaming on stranger faces . She knew that she was going to cry , and fought against it .</p>
    <p n="1606"><said who="#Anne">“ I WON'T cry . It 's silly — and weak — there 's the third tear splashing down by my nose . There are more coming ! I must think of something funny to stop them . But there 's nothing funny except what is connected with Avonlea , and that only makes things worse — four — five — I 'm going home next Friday , but that seems a hundred years away . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>is nearly home by now — and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>is at the gate , looking down the lane for him — six — seven — eight — oh , there 's no use in counting them ! They 're coming in a flood presently . I can n't cheer up — I do n't WANT to cheer up . It 's nicer to be miserable ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1607">The flood of tears would have come , no doubt , had not<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>appeared at that moment . In the joy of seeing a familiar face<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>forgot that there had never been much love lost between her and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>. As a part of Avonlea life even a Pye was welcome .</p>
    <p n="1608"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'm so glad you came up , ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>said sincerely .</p>
    <p n="1609"><said who="#Josie_Pye">“ You 've been crying , ”</said>remarked<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>, with aggravating pity .<said who="#Josie_Pye">“ I suppose you 're homesick — some people have so little self-control in that respect . I 've no intention of being homesick , I can tell you . Town 's too jolly after that poky old Avonlea . I wonder how I ever existed there so long . You should n't cry ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>; it is n't becoming , for your nose and eyes get red , and then you seem ALL red . I 'd a perfectly scrumptious time in the Academy today . Our French professor is simply a duck . His moustache would give you kerwollowps of the heart . Have you anything eatable around ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? I 'm literally starving . Ah , I guessed likely<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'d load you up with cake . That 's why I called round . Otherwise I 'd have gone to the park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley . He boards same place as I do , and he 's a sport . He noticed you in class today , and asked me who the red-headed girl was . I told him you were an orphan that the Cuthberts had adopted , and nobody knew very much about what you 'd been before that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1610"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was wondering if , after all , solitude and tears were not more satisfactory than<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>'s companionship when<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>appeared , each with an inch of<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s color ribbon — purple and scarlet — pinned proudly to her coat . As<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>was not “ speaking ” to<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>just then she had to subside into comparative harmlessness .</p>
    <p n="1611"><said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>with a sigh ,<said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ I feel as if I 'd lived many moons since the morning . I ought to be home studying my Virgil — that horrid old professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow . But I simply could n't settle down to study tonight .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, methinks I see the traces of tears . If you 've been crying DO own up . It will restore my self-respect , for I was shedding tears freely before<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>came along . I do n't mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey , too . Cake ? You 'll give me a teeny piece , wo n't you ? Thank you . It has the real Avonlea flavor . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1612"><persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>, perceiving the<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s calendar lying on the table , wanted to know if<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>meant to try for the gold medal .</p>
    <p n="1613"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>blushed and admitted she was thinking of it .</p>
    <p n="1614"><said who="#Josie_Pye">“ Oh , that reminds me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>,<said who="#Josie_Pye">“<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s is to get one of<persName>the Avery</persName>scholarships after all . The word came today . Frank Stockley told me — his uncle is one of the board of governors , you know . It will be announced in the Academy tomorrow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1615">An Avery scholarship !<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt her heart beat more quickly , and the horizons of her ambition shifted and broadened as if by magic . Before<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>had told the news<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s highest pinnacle of aspiration had been a teacher 's provincial license , First Class , at the end of the year , and perhaps the medal ! But now in one moment<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>saw herself winning<persName>the Avery</persName>scholarship , taking an Arts course at Redmond College , and graduating in a gown and mortar board , before the echo of<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>'s words had died away . For<persName>the Avery</persName>scholarship was in English , and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt that here her foot was on native heath .</p>
    <p n="1616">A wealthy manufacturer of New Brunswick had died and left part of his fortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed among the various high schools and academies of the Maritime Provinces , according to their respective standings . There had been much doubt whether one would be allotted to<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s , but the matter was settled at last , and at the end of the year the graduate who made the highest mark in English and English Literature would win the scholarship — two hundred and fifty dollars a year for four years at Redmond College . No wonder that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>went to bed that night with tingling cheeks !</p>
    <p n="1617"><said who="#Anne">“ I 'll win that scholarship if hard work can do it , ”</said>she resolved .<said who="#Anne">“ Would n't<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>be proud if I got to be a B. A .? Oh , it 's delightful to have ambitions . I 'm so glad I have such a lot . And there never seems to be any end to them — that 's the best of it . Just as soon as you attain to one ambition you see another one glittering higher up still . It does make life so interesting . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="35">
    <p n="1618"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s homesickness wore off , greatly helped in the wearing by her weekend visits home . As long as the open weather lasted the Avonlea students went out to Carmody on the new branch railway every Friday night .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and several other Avonlea young folks were generally on hand to meet them and they all walked over to Avonlea in a merry party .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>thought those Friday evening gypsyings over the autumnal hills in the crisp golden air , with the homelights of Avonlea twinkling beyond , were the best and dearest hours in the whole week .</p>
    <p n="1619"><persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>nearly always walked with<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>and carried her satchel for her .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>was a very handsome young lady , now thinking herself quite as grown up as she really was ; she wore her skirts as long as her mother would let her and did her hair up in town , though she had to take it down when she went home . She had large , bright-blue eyes , a brilliant complexion , and a plump showy figure . She laughed a great deal , was cheerful and good-tempered , and enjoyed the pleasant things of life frankly .</p>
    <p n="1620"><said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ But I should n't think she was the sort of girl<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>would like , ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>to<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>did not think so either , but she would not have said so for<persName>the Avery</persName>scholarship . She could not help thinking , too , that it would be very pleasant to have such a friend as<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>to jest and chatter with and exchange ideas about books and studies and ambitions .<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>had ambitions , she knew , and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>did not seem the sort of person with whom such could be profitably discussed .</p>
    <p n="1621">There was no silly sentiment in<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s ideas concerning<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>. Boys were to her , when she thought about them at all , merely possible good comrades . If she and<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>had been friends she would not have cared how many other friends he had nor with whom he walked . She had a genius for friendship ; girl friends she had in plenty ; but she had a vague consciousness that masculine friendship might also be a good thing to round out one 's conceptions of companionship and furnish broader standpoints of judgment and comparison . Not that<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>could have put her feelings on the matter into just such clear definition . But she thought that if<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>had ever walked home with her from the train , over the crisp fields and along the ferny byways , they might have had many and merry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening around them and their hopes and ambitions therein .<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>was a clever young fellow , with his own thoughts about things and a determination to get the best out of life and put the best into it .<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>told<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>that she did n't understand half the things<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>said ; he talked just like<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>did when she had a thoughtful fit on and for her part she did n't think it any fun to be bothering about books and that sort of thing when you did n't have to . Frank Stockley had lots more dash and go , but then he was n't half as good-looking as<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>and she really could n't decide which she liked best !</p>
    <p n="1622">In the Academy<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>gradually drew a little circle of friends about her , thoughtful , imaginative , ambitious students like herself . With the “ rose-red ” girl , Stella Maynard , and the “ dream girl , ” Priscilla Grant , she soon became intimate , finding the latter pale spiritual-looking maiden to be full to the brim of mischief and pranks and fun , while the vivid , black-eyed Stella had a heartful of wistful dreams and fancies , as aerial and rainbow-like as<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s own .</p>
    <p n="1623">After the Christmas holidays the Avonlea students gave up going home on Fridays and settled down to hard work . By this time all the<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s scholars had gravitated into their own places in the ranks and the various classes had assumed distinct and settled shadings of individuality . Certain facts had become generally accepted . It was admitted that the medal contestants had practically narrowed down to three —<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>,<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>, and Lewis Wilson ;<persName>the Avery</persName>scholarship was more doubtful , any one of a certain six being a possible winner . The bronze medal for mathematics was considered as good as won by a fat , funny little up-country boy with a bumpy forehead and a patched coat .</p>
    <p n="1624"><persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby Gillis</persName>was the handsomest girl of the year at the Academy ; in the Second Year classes Stella Maynard carried off the palm for beauty , with small but critical minority in favor of<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>. Ethel Marr was admitted by all competent judges to have the most stylish modes of hair-dressing , and<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane Andrews</persName>— plain , plodding , conscientious<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>— carried off the honors in the domestic science course . Even<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>attained a certain preeminence as the sharpest-tongued young lady in attendance at<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s . So it may be fairly stated that<persName corresp="#Miss_Stacy">Miss Stacy</persName>'s old pupils held their own in the wider arena of the academical course .</p>
    <p n="1625"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>worked hard and steadily . Her rivalry with<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>was as intense as it had ever been in Avonlea school , although it was not known in the class at large , but somehow the bitterness had gone out of it .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>no longer wished to win for the sake of defeating<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>; rather , for the proud consciousness of a well-won victory over a worthy foeman . It would be worth while to win , but she no longer thought life would be insupportable if she did not .</p>
    <p n="1626">In spite of lessons the students found opportunities for pleasant times .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>spent many of her spare hours at Beechwood and generally ate her Sunday dinners there and went to church with<persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>. The latter was , as she admitted , growing old , but her black eyes were not dim nor the vigor of her tongue in the least abated . But she never sharpened the latter on<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, who continued to be a prime favorite with the critical old lady .</p>
    <p n="1627"><said who="#Anne">“ That Anne-girl improves all the time , ”</said>she said .<said>“ I get tired of other girls — there is such a provoking and eternal sameness about them .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>has as many shades as a rainbow and every shade is the prettiest while it lasts . I do n't know that she is as amusing as she was when she was a child , but she makes me love her and I like people who make me love them . It saves me so much trouble in making myself love them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1628">Then , almost before anybody realized it , spring had come ; out in Avonlea the Mayflowers were peeping pinkly out on the sere barrens where snow-wreaths lingered ; and the “ mist of green ” was on the woods and in the valleys . But in Charlottetown harassed<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s students thought and talked only of examinations .</p>
    <p n="1629"><said who="#Anne">“ It does n't seem possible that the term is nearly over , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Why , last fall it seemed so long to look forward to — a whole winter of studies and classes . And here we are , with the exams looming up next week . Girls , sometimes I feel as if those exams meant everything , but when I look at the big buds swelling on those chestnut trees and the misty blue air at the end of the streets they do n't seem half so important . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1630"><persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>, who had dropped in , did not take this view of it . To them the coming examinations were constantly very important indeed — far more important than chestnut buds or Maytime hazes . It was all very well for<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, who was sure of passing at least , to have her moments of belittling them , but when your whole future depended on them — as the girls truly thought theirs did — you could not regard them philosophically .</p>
    <p n="1631"><said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ I 've lost seven pounds in the last two weeks , ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>.<said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ It 's no use to say do n't worry . I WILL worry . Worrying helps you some — it seems as if you were doing something when you 're worrying . It would be dreadful if I failed to get my license after going to<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s all winter and spending so much money . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1632"><said who="#Josie_Pye">“ I do n't care , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>.<said who="#Josie_Pye">“ If I do n't pass this year I 'm coming back next . My father can afford to send me .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, Frank Stockley says that Professor Tremaine said<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>was sure to get the medal and that Emily Clay would likely win<persName>the Avery</persName>scholarship . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1633"><said who="#Anne">“ That may make me feel badly tomorrow ,<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>, ”</said>laughed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne">“ but just now I honestly feel that as long as I know the violets are coming out all purple down in the hollow below Green Gables and that little ferns are poking their heads up in Lovers ’ Lane , it 's not a great deal of difference whether I win<persName>the Avery</persName>or not . I 've done my best and I begin to understand what is meant by the ‘ joy of the strife . ’ Next to trying and winning , the best thing is trying and failing . Girls , do n't talk about exams ! Look at that arch of pale green sky over those houses and picture to yourself what it must look like over the purply-dark beech-woods back of Avonlea . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1634"><said who="#Ruby_Gillis">“ What are you going to wear for commencement ,<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>practically .</p>
    <p n="1635"><persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>both answered at once and the chatter drifted into a side eddy of fashions . But<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, with her elbows on the window sill , her soft cheek laid against her clasped hands , and her eyes filled with visions , looked out unheedingly across city roof and spire to that glorious dome of sunset sky and wove her dreams of a possible future from the golden tissue of youth 's own optimism . All the Beyond was hers with its possibilities lurking rosily in the oncoming years — each year a rose of promise to be woven into an immortal chaplet .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="36">
    <p n="1636">On the morning when the final results of all the examinations were to be posted on the bulletin board at<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>walked down the street together .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>was smiling and happy ; examinations were over and she was comfortably sure she had made a pass at least ; further considerations troubled<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>not at all ; she had no soaring ambitions and consequently was not affected with the unrest attendant thereon . For we pay a price for everything we get or take in this world ; and although ambitions are well worth having , they are not to be cheaply won , but exact their dues of work and self-denial , anxiety and discouragement .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was pale and quiet ; in ten more minutes she would know who had won the medal and who<persName>the Avery</persName>. Beyond those ten minutes there did not seem , just then , to be anything worth being called Time .</p>
    <p n="1637"><said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ Of course you 'll win one of them anyhow , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>, who could n't understand how the faculty could be so unfair as to order it otherwise .</p>
    <p n="1638"><said who="#Anne">“ I have not hope of<persName>the Avery</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Everybody says Emily Clay will win it . And I 'm not going to march up to that bulletin board and look at it before everybody . I have n't the moral courage . I 'm going straight to the girls ’ dressing room . You must read the announcements and then come and tell me ,<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>. And I implore you in the name of our old friendship to do it as quickly as possible . If I have failed just say so , without trying to break it gently ; and whatever you do DON'T sympathize with me . Promise me this ,<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1639"><persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>promised solemnly ; but , as it happened , there was no necessity for such a promise . When they went up the entrance steps of<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s they found the hall full of boys who were carrying<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>around on their shoulders and yelling at the tops of their voices ,<said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ Hurrah for<persName>Blythe</persName>, Medalist ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1640">For a moment<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt one sickening pang of defeat and disappointment . So she had failed and<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>had won ! Well ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>would be sorry — he had been so sure she would win .</p>
    <p n="1641">And then !</p>
    <p n="1642">Somebody called out :</p>
    <p n="1643"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Three cheers for Miss<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Shirley</persName>, winner of<persName>the Avery</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1644"><said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>gasped<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>, as they fled to the girls ’ dressing room amid hearty cheers .<said who="#Jane_Andrews">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>I 'm so proud ! Is n't it splendid ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1645">And then the girls were around them and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was the center of a laughing , congratulating group . Her shoulders were thumped and her hands shaken vigorously . She was pushed and pulled and hugged and among it all she managed to whisper to<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>:</p>
    <p n="1646"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , wo n't<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>be pleased ! I must write the news home right away . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1647">Commencement was the next important happening . The exercises were held in the big assembly hall of the Academy . Addresses were given , essays read , songs sung , the public award of diplomas , prizes and medals made .</p>
    <p n="1648"><persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>were there , with eyes and ears for only one student on the platform — a tall girl in pale green , with faintly flushed cheeks and starry eyes , who read the best essay and was pointed out and whispered about as<persName>the Avery</persName>winner .</p>
    <p n="1649"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Reckon you 're glad we kept her ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, speaking for the first time since he had entered the hall , when<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had finished her essay .</p>
    <p n="1650"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It 's not the first time I 've been glad , ”</said>retorted<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ You do like to rub things in ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1651"><persName corresp="#Miss_Barry">Miss Barry</persName>, who was sitting behind them , leaned forward and poked<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>in the back with her parasol .</p>
    <p n="1652"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Are n't you proud of that Anne-girl ? I am , ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="1653"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>went home to Avonlea with<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>that evening . She had not been home since April and she felt that she could not wait another day . The apple blossoms were out and the world was fresh and young .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>was at Green Gables to meet her . In her own white room , where<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had set a flowering house rose on the window sill ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked about her and drew a long breath of happiness .</p>
    <p n="1654"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, it 's so good to be back again . It 's so good to see those pointed firs coming out against the pink sky — and that white orchard and the old Snow<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>. Is n't the breath of the mint delicious ? And that tea rose — why , it 's a song and a hope and a prayer all in one . And it 's GOOD to see you again ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1655"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ I thought you liked that Stella Maynard better than me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>reproachfully .<said who="#Diana_Barry">“<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>told me you did .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>said you were INFATUATED with her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1656"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>laughed and pelted<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>with the faded “ June lilies ” of her bouquet .</p>
    <p n="1657"><said who="#Anne">“ Stella Maynard is the dearest girl in the world except one and you are that one ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, ”</said>she said .<said who="#Anne">“ I love you more than ever — and I 've so many things to tell you . But just now I feel as if it were joy enough to sit here and look at you . I 'm tired , I think — tired of being studious and ambitious . I mean to spend at least two hours tomorrow lying out in the orchard grass , thinking of absolutely nothing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1658"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ You 've done splendidly ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. I suppose you wo n't be teaching now that you 've won<persName>the Avery</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1659"><said who="#Anne">“ No . I 'm going to Redmond in September . Does n't it seem wonderful ? I 'll have a brand new stock of ambition laid in by that time after three glorious , golden months of vacation .<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>and<persName corresp="#Ruby_Gillis">Ruby</persName>are going to teach . Is n't it splendid to think we all got through even to<persName corresp="#Moody_Spurgeon">Moody Spurgeon</persName>and<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1660"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ The Newbridge trustees have offered<persName corresp="#Jane_Andrews">Jane</persName>their school already , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>.<said who="#Diana_Barry">“<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>is going to teach , too . He has to . His father can n't afford to send him to college next year , after all , so he means to earn his own way through . I expect he 'll get the school here if Miss Ames decides to leave . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1661"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt a queer little sensation of dismayed surprise . She had not known this ; she had expected that<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>would be going to Redmond also . What would she do without their inspiring rivalry ? Would not work , even at a coeducational college with a real degree in prospect , be rather flat without her friend the enemy ?</p>
    <p n="1662">The next morning at breakfast it suddenly struck<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>that<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was not looking well . Surely he was much grayer than he had been a year before .</p>
    <p n="1663"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>she said hesitatingly when he had gone out ,<said who="#Anne">“ is<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>quite well ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1664"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ No , he is n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>in a troubled tone .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ He 's had some real bad spells with his heart this spring and he wo n't spare himself a mite . I 've been real worried about him , but he 's some better this while back and we 've got a good hired man , so I 'm hoping he 'll kind of rest and pick up . Maybe he will now you 're home . You always cheer him up . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1665"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>leaned across the table and took<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s face in her hands .</p>
    <p n="1666"><said who="#Anne">“ You are not looking as well yourself as I 'd like to see you ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. You look tired . I 'm afraid you 've been working too hard . You must take a rest , now that I 'm home . I 'm just going to take this one day off to visit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams , and then it will be your turn to be lazy while I do the work . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1667"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>smiled affectionately at her girl .</p>
    <p n="1668"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ It 's not the work — it 's my head . I 've got a pain so often now — behind my eyes . Doctor<persName>Spencer</persName>'s been fussing with glasses , but they do n't do me any good . There is a distinguished oculist coming to the Island the last of June and the doctor says I must see him . I guess I 'll have to . I can n't read or sew with any comfort now . Well ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, you 've done real well at<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s I must say . To take First Class License in one year and win<persName>the Avery</persName>scholarship — well , well ,<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>says pride goes before a fall and she does n't believe in the higher education of women at all ; she says it unfits them for woman 's true sphere . I do n't believe a word of it . Speaking of<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>reminds me — did you hear anything about the Abbey Bank lately ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1669"><said who="#Anne">“ I heard it was shaky , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Why ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1670"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ That is what<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>said . She was up here one day last week and said there was some talk about it .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>felt real worried . All we have saved is in that bank — every penny . I wanted<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>to put it in the Savings Bank in the first place , but old Mr. Abbey was a great friend of father 's and he 'd always banked with him .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>said any bank with him at the head of it was good enough for anybody . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1671"><said who="#Anne">“ I think he has only been its nominal head for many years , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ He is a very old man ; his nephews are really at the head of the institution . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1672"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Well , when<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Rachel</persName>told us that , I wanted<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>to draw our money right out and he said he 'd think of it . But Mr. Russell told him yesterday that the bank was all right . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1673"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had her good day in the companionship of the outdoor world . She never forgot that day ; it was so bright and golden and fair , so free from shadow and so lavish of blossom .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>spent some of its rich hours in the orchard ; she went to the Dryad 's Bubble and Willowmere and<persName>Violet Vale</persName>; she called at the manse and had a satisfying talk with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>; and finally in the evening she went with<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>for the cows , through Lovers ’ Lane to the back pasture . The woods were all gloried through with sunset and the warm splendor of it streamed down through the hill gaps in the west .<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>walked slowly with bent head ;<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, tall and erect , suited her springing step to his .</p>
    <p n="1674"><said who="#Anne">“ You 've been working too hard today ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, ”</said>she said reproachfully .<said who="#Anne">“ Why wo n't you take things easier ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1675"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I can n't seem to , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, as he opened the yard gate to let the cows through .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ It 's only that I 'm getting old ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, and keep forgetting it . Well , well , I 've always worked pretty hard and I 'd rather drop in harness . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1676"><said who="#Anne">“ If I had been the boy you sent for , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>wistfully ,<said who="#Anne">“ I 'd be able to help you so much now and spare you in a hundred ways . I could find it in my heart to wish I had been , just for that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1677"><said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Well now , I 'd rather have you than a dozen boys ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>patting her hand .<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ Just mind you that — rather than a dozen boys . Well now , I guess it was n't a boy that took<persName>the Avery</persName>scholarship , was it ? It was a girl — my girl — my girl that I 'm proud of . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1678">He smiled his shy smile at her as he went into the yard .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>took the memory of it with her when she went to her room that night and sat for a long while at her open window , thinking of the past and dreaming of the future . Outside the Snow<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>was mistily white in the moonshine ; the frogs were singing in the marsh beyond Orchard Slope .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>always remembered the silvery , peaceful beauty and fragrant calm of that night . It was the last night before sorrow touched her life ; and no life is ever quite the same again when once that cold , sanctifying touch has been laid upon it .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="37">
    <p n="1679">It was<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>who spoke , alarm in every jerky word .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>came through the hall , her hands full of white narcissus ,— it was long before<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>could love the sight or odor of white narcissus again ,— in time to hear her and to see<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>standing in the porch doorway , a folded paper in his hand , and his face strangely drawn and gray .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>dropped her flowers and sprang across the kitchen to him at the same moment as<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. They were both too late ; before they could reach him<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had fallen across the threshold .</p>
    <p n="1680"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ He 's fainted , ”</said>gasped<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, run for Martin — quick , quick ! He 's at the barn . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1681">Martin , the hired man , who had just driven home from the post office , started at once for the doctor , calling at Orchard Slope on his way to send Mr. and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Barry">Mrs. Barry</persName>over .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>, who was there on an errand , came too . They found<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>distractedly trying to restore<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>to consciousness .</p>
    <p n="1682"><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>pushed them gently aside , tried his pulse , and then laid her ear over his heart . She looked at their anxious faces sorrowfully and the tears came into her eyes .</p>
    <p n="1683"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>she said gravely .<said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I do n't think — we can do anything for him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1684"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>, you do n't think — you can n't think<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>is — is — ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>could not say the dreadful word ; she turned sick and pallid .</p>
    <p n="1685"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ Child , yes , I 'm afraid of it . Look at his face . When you 've seen that look as often as I have you 'll know what it means . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1686"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked at the still face and there beheld the seal of the Great Presence .</p>
    <p n="1687">When the doctor came he said that death had been instantaneous and probably painless , caused in all likelihood by some sudden shock . The secret of the shock was discovered to be in the paper<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had held and which Martin had brought from the office that morning . It contained an account of the failure of the Abbey Bank .</p>
    <p n="1688">The news spread quickly through Avonlea , and all day friends and neighbors thronged Green Gables and came and went on errands of kindness for the dead and living . For the first time shy , quiet<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>was a person of central importance ; the white majesty of death had fallen on him and set him apart as one crowned .</p>
    <p n="1689">When the calm night came softly down over Green Gables the old house was hushed and tranquil . In the parlor lay<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>in his coffin , his long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little kindly smile as if he but slept , dreaming pleasant dreams . There were flowers about him — sweet old-fashioned flowers which his mother had planted in the homestead garden in her bridal days and for which<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>had always had a secret , wordless love .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had gathered them and brought them to him , her anguished , tearless eyes burning in her white face . It was the last thing she could do for him .</p>
    <p n="1690">The Barrys and<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>stayed with them that night .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>, going to the east gable , where<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>was standing at her window , said gently :</p>
    <p n="1691"><said>“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>dear , would you like to have me sleep with you tonight ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1692"><said who="#Anne">“ Thank you ,<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>. ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked earnestly into her friend 's face .<said who="#Anne">“ I think you wo n't misunderstand me when I say I want to be alone . I 'm not afraid . I have n't been alone one minute since it happened — and I want to be . I want to be quite silent and quiet and try to realize it . I can n't realize it . Half the time it seems to me that<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>can n't be dead ; and the other half it seems as if he must have been dead for a long time and I 've had this horrible dull ache ever since . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1693"><persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>did not quite understand .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s impassioned grief , breaking all the bounds of natural reserve and lifelong habit in its stormy rush , she could comprehend better than<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s tearless agony . But she went away kindly , leaving<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>alone to keep her first vigil with sorrow .</p>
    <p n="1694"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>hoped that the tears would come in solitude . It seemed to her a terrible thing that she could not shed a tear for<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, whom she had loved so much and who had been so kind to her ,<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>who had walked with her last evening at sunset and was now lying in the dim room below with that awful peace on his brow . But no tears came at first , even when she knelt by her window in the darkness and prayed , looking up to the stars beyond the hills — no tears , only the same horrible dull ache of misery that kept on aching until she fell asleep , worn out with the day 's pain and excitement .</p>
    <p n="1695">In the night she awakened , with the stillness and the darkness about her , and the recollection of the day came over her like a wave of sorrow . She could see<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s face smiling at her as he had smiled when they parted at the gate that last evening — she could hear his voice saying ,<said who="#Matthew_Cuthbert">“ My girl — my girl that I 'm proud of . ”</said>Then the tears came and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>wept her heart out .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>heard her and crept in to comfort her .</p>
    <p n="1696"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ There — there — do n't cry so , dearie . It can n't bring him back . It — it — is n't right to cry so . I knew that today , but I could n't help it then . He 'd always been such a good , kind brother to me — but God knows best . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1697"><said who="#Anne">“ Oh , just let me cry ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, ”</said>sobbed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ The tears do n't hurt me like that ache did . Stay here for a little while with me and keep your arm round me — so . I could n't have<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>stay , she 's good and kind and sweet — but it 's not her sorrow — she 's outside of it and she could n't come close enough to my heart to help me . It 's our sorrow — yours and mine . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, what will we do without him ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1698"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ We 've got each other ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. I do n't know what I 'd do if you were n't here — if you 'd never come . Oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, I know I 've been kind of strict and harsh with you maybe — but you must n't think I did n't love you as well as<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>did , for all that . I want to tell you now when I can . It 's never been easy for me to say things out of my heart , but at times like this it 's easier . I love you as dear as if you were my own flesh and blood and you 've been my joy and comfort ever since you came to Green Gables . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1699">Two days afterwards they carried<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew Cuthbert</persName>over his homestead threshold and away from the fields he had tilled and the orchards he had loved and the trees he had planted ; and then Avonlea settled back to its usual placidity and even at Green Gables affairs slipped into their old groove and work was done and duties fulfilled with regularity as before , although always with the aching sense of “ loss in all familiar things . ”<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, new to grief , thought it almost sad that it could be so — that they COULD go on in the old way without<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>. She felt something like shame and remorse when she discovered that the sunrises behind the firs and the pale pink buds opening in the garden gave her the old inrush of gladness when she saw them — that<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s visits were pleasant to her and that<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s merry words and ways moved her to laughter and smiles — that , in brief , the beautiful world of blossom and love and friendship had lost none of its power to please her fancy and thrill her heart , that life still called to her with many insistent voices .</p>
    <p n="1700"><said who="#Diana_Barry">“ It seems like disloyalty to<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>, somehow , to find pleasure in these things now that he has gone , ”</said>she said wistfully to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>one evening when they were together in the manse garden .<said>“ I miss him so much — all the time — and yet ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>, the world and life seem very beautiful and interesting to me for all . Today<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>said something funny and I found myself laughing . I thought when it happened I could never laugh again . And it somehow seems as if I ought n't to . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1701"><said who="#Mrs._Allan">“ When<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>was here he liked to hear you laugh and he liked to know that you found pleasure in the pleasant things around you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>gently .<said who="#Mrs._Allan">“ He is just away now ; and he likes to know it just the same . I am sure we should not shut our hearts against the healing influences that nature offers us . But I can understand your feeling . I think we all experience the same thing . We resent the thought that anything can please us when someone we love is no longer here to share the pleasure with us , and we almost feel as if we were unfaithful to our sorrow when we find our interest in life returning to us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1702"><said who="#Anne">“ I was down to the graveyard to plant a rosebush on<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s grave this afternoon , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>dreamily .<said who="#Anne">“ I took a slip of the little white Scotch rosebush his mother brought out from Scotland long ago ;<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>always liked those roses the best — they were so small and sweet on their thorny stems . It made me feel glad that I could plant it by his grave — as if I were doing something that must please him in taking it there to be near him . I hope he has roses like them in heaven . Perhaps the souls of all those little white roses that he has loved so many summers were all there to meet him . I must go home now .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>is all alone and she gets lonely at twilight . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1703"><said who="#Mrs._Allan">“ She will be lonelier still , I fear , when you go away again to college , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Allan">Mrs. Allan</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1704"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>did not reply ; she said good night and went slowly back to green Gables .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>was sitting on the front door-steps and<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sat down beside her . The door was open behind them , held back by a big pink conch shell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions .</p>
    <p n="1705"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>gathered some sprays of pale-yellow honeysuckle and put them in her hair . She liked the delicious hint of fragrance , as some aerial benediction , above her every time she moved .</p>
    <p n="1706"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Doctor<persName>Spencer</persName>was here while you were away , ”</said><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>said .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ He says that the specialist will be in town tomorrow and he insists that I must go in and have my eyes examined .

    <p n="1707"><said who="#Anne">“ I shall be all right .<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>will come over for company for me . I shall attend to the ironing and baking beautifully — you need n't fear that I 'll starch the handkerchiefs or flavor the cake with liniment . ”</said></p>

I did suffer terribly over my hair and my freckles . My freckles are really gone ; and people are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn now — all but<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>. She informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder than ever , or at least my black dress made it look redder , and she asked me if people who had red hair ever got used to having it .<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, I 've almost decided to give up trying to like<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie Pye</persName>.

    <p n="1716"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>looked up with swift interest .</p>

I 've always kind of wished I 'd forgiven him when I had the chance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1719"><said who="#Anne">“ So you 've had a bit of romance in your life , too , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>softly .</p>

    <p n="1721"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>went to town the next day and returned in the evening .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had gone over to Orchard Slope with<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>and came back to find<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>in the kitchen , sitting by the table with her head leaning on her hand . Something in her dejected attitude struck a chill to<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s heart . She had never seen<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sit limply inert like that .</p>
    <p n="1722"><said who="#Anne">“ Are you very tired ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1723"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Yes — no — I do n't know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>wearily , looking up .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I suppose I am tired but I have n't thought about it . It 's not that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1724"><said who="#Anne">“ Did you see the oculist ? What did he say ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>anxiously .</p>
    <p n="1725"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Yes , I saw him . He examined my eyes . He says that if I give up all reading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes , and if I 'm careful not to cry , and if I wear the glasses he 's given me he thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured . But if I do n't he says I 'll certainly be stone-blind in six months . Blind !<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, just think of it ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1726">For a minute<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, after her first quick exclamation of dismay , was silent . It seemed to her that she could NOT speak . Then she said bravely , but with a catch in her voice :</p>
    <p n="1727"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, DON'T think of it . You know he has given you hope . If you are careful you wo n't lose your sight altogether ; and if his glasses cure your headaches it will be a great thing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1728"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I do n't call it much hope , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>bitterly .<said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ What am I to live for if I can n't read or sew or do anything like that ? I might as well be blind — or dead . And as for crying , I can n't help that when I get lonesome . But there , it 's no good talking about it . If you 'll get me a cup of tea I 'll be thankful . I 'm about done out . Do n't say anything about this to any one for a spell yet , anyway . I can n't bear that folks should come here to question and sympathize and talk about it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1729">When<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had eaten her lunch<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>persuaded her to go to bed . Then<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>went herself to the east gable and sat down by her window in the darkness alone with her tears and her heaviness of heart . How sadly things had changed since she had sat there the night after coming home ! Then she had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy with promise .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>felt as if she had lived years since then , but before she went to bed there was a smile on her lips and peace in her heart . She had looked her duty courageously in the face and found it a friend — as duty ever is when we meet it frankly .</p>
    <p n="1730">One afternoon a few days later<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>came slowly in from the front yard where she had been talking to a caller — a man whom<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>knew by sight as Sadler from Carmody .<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>wondered what he could have been saying to bring that look to<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s face .</p>
    <p n="1731"><said who="#Anne">“ What did Mr. Sadler want ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1732"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sat down by the window and looked at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. There were tears in her eyes in defiance of the oculist 's prohibition and her voice broke as she said :</p>
    <p n="1733"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ He heard that I was going to sell Green Gables and he wants to buy it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1734"><said who="#Anne">“ Buy it ! Buy Green Gables ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>wondered if she had heard aright .<said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, you do n't mean to sell Green Gables ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1735"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, I do n't know what else is to be done . I 've thought it all over . If my eyes were strong I could stay here and make out to look after things and manage , with a good hired man . But as it is I can n't . I may lose my sight altogether ; and anyway I 'll not be fit to run things . Oh , I never thought I 'd live to see the day when I 'd have to sell my home . But things would only go behind worse and worse all the time , till nobody would want to buy it . Every cent of our money went in that bank ; and there 's some notes<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>gave last fall to pay .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>advises me to sell the farm and board somewhere — with her I suppose . It wo n't bring much — it 's small and the buildings are old . But it 'll be enough for me to live on I reckon . I 'm thankful you 're provided for with that scholarship ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. I 'm sorry you wo n't have a home to come to in your vacations , that 's all , but I suppose you 'll manage somehow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1736"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>broke down and wept bitterly .</p>
    <p n="1737"><said who="#Anne">“ You must n't sell Green Gables , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>resolutely .</p>
    <p n="1738"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, I wish I did n't have to . But you can see for yourself . I can n't stay here alone . I 'd go crazy with trouble and loneliness . And my sight would go — I know it would . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1739"><said who="#Anne">“ You wo n't have to stay here alone ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I 'll be with you . I 'm not going to Redmond . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1741"><said who="#Anne">“ Just what I say . I 'm not going to take the scholarship . I decided so the night after you came home from town . You surely do n't think I could leave you alone in your trouble ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, after all you 've done for me . I 've been thinking and planning . Let me tell you my plans .<persName>Mr. Barry</persName>wants to rent the farm for next year . So you wo n't have any bother over that . And I 'm going to teach . I 've applied for the school here — but I do n't expect to get it for I understand the trustees have promised it to<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>. But I can have the Carmody school — Mr. Blair told me so last night at the store . Of course that wo n't be quite as nice or convenient as if I had the Avonlea school . But I can board home and drive myself over to Carmody and back , in the warm weather at least . And even in winter I can come home Fridays . We 'll keep a horse for that . Oh , I have it all planned out ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. And I 'll read to you and keep you cheered up . You sha'n ' t be dull or lonesome . And we 'll be real cozy and happy here together , you and I . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1742"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>had listened like a woman in a dream .</p>
    <p n="1743"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, I could get on real well if you were here , I know . But I can n't let you sacrifice yourself so for me . It would be terrible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1744"><said who="#Anne">“ Nonsense ! ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>laughed merrily .<said who="#Anne">“ There is no sacrifice . Nothing could be worse than giving up Green Gables — nothing could hurt me more . We must keep the dear old place . My mind is quite made up ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>.

Besides , I mean to study at home here and take a little college course all by myself . Oh , I 've dozens of plans ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I 've been thinking them out for a week . I shall give life here my best , and I believe it will give its best to me in return . When I left<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s my future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road . I thought I could see along it for many a milestone . Now there is a bend in it . I do n't know what lies around the bend , but I 'm going to believe that the best does . It has a fascination of its own , that bend ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. I wonder how the road beyond it goes — what there is of green glory and soft , checkered light and shadows — what new landscapes — what new beauties — what curves and hills and valleys further on . ”</said></p>

I 'm sixteen and a half , ‘ obstinate as a mule , ’ as<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>once told me , ”</said>laughed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ Oh ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, do n't you go pitying me . I do n't like to be pitied , and there is no need for it . I 'm heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear Green Gables .

    <p n="1750">When it became noised abroad in Avonlea that<persName corresp="#Anne_Shirley">Anne Shirley</persName>had given up the idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there was a good deal of discussion over it .

She told<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure to the girl 's eyes . Neither did good<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>. She came up one evening and found<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>sitting at the front door in the warm , scented summer dusk . They liked to sit there when the twilight came down and the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled the dewy air .</p>
    <p n="1751"><persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Rachel</persName>deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the door , behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks , with a long breath of mingled weariness and relief .</p>

Well ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, I hear you 've given up your notion of going to college . I was real glad to hear it . You 've got as much education now as a woman can be comfortable with . I do n't believe in girls going to college with the men and cramming their heads full of<persName corresp="#Latin">Latin</persName>and Greek and all that nonsense . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1757"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I do n't know it . I guess you 're going to teach right here in Avonlea . The trustees have decided to give you the school . ”</said></p>

He said he was going to teach at White Sands . Of course he knew how much you wanted to stay with<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, and I must say I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him , that 's what . Real self-sacrificing , too , for he 'll have his board to pay at White Sands , and everybody knows he 's got to earn his own way through college . So the trustees decided to take you . I was tickled to death when<persName corresp="#Thomas">Thomas</persName>came home and told me . ”</said></p>

    <p n="1761"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ I guess you can n't prevent him now . He 's signed papers with the White Sands trustees . So it would n't do him any good now if you were to refuse . Of course you 'll take the school . You 'll get along all right , now that there are no Pyes going .<persName corresp="#Josie_Pye">Josie</persName>was the last of them , and a good thing she was , that 's what . There 's been some Pye or other going to Avonlea school for the last twenty years , and I guess their mission in life was to keep school teachers reminded that earth is n't their home . Bless my heart ! What does all that winking and blinking at the<persName>Barry</persName>gable mean ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1762"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>is signaling for me to go over , ”</said>laughed<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne">“ You know we keep up the old custom . Excuse me while I run over and see what she wants . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1763"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>ran down the clover slope like a deer , and disappeared in the firry shadows of the Haunted Wood .<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>looked after her indulgently .</p>
    <p n="1764"><said who="#Rachel_Lynde">“ There 's a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1765"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ There 's a good deal more of the woman about her in others , ”</said>retorted<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>, with a momentary return of her old crispness .</p>
    <p n="1766">But crispness was no longer<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>'s distinguishing characteristic . As<persName corresp="#Rachel_Lynde">Mrs. Lynde</persName>told her<persName corresp="#Thomas">Thomas</persName>that night .</p>
    <p n="1767"><said who="#Thomas">“<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla Cuthbert</persName>has got MELLOW . That 's what . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1768"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>went to the little Avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh flowers on<persName corresp="#Matthew_Cuthbert">Matthew</persName>'s grave and water the Scotch rosebush . She lingered there until dusk , liking the peace and calm of the little place , with its poplars whose rustle was like low , friendly speech , and its whispering grasses growing at will among the graves . When she finally left it and walked down the long hill that sloped to the Lake of Shining Waters it was past sunset and all Avonlea lay before her in a dreamlike afterlight —<said who="#Anne">“ a haunt of ancient peace . ”</said>There was a freshness in the air as of a wind that had blown over honey-sweet fields of clover . Home lights twinkled out here and there among the homestead trees . Beyond lay the sea , misty and purple , with its haunting , unceasing murmur . The west was a glory of soft mingled hues , and the pond reflected them all in still softer shadings . The beauty of it all thrilled<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s heart , and she gratefully opened the gates of her soul to it .</p>
    <p n="1769"><said who="#Thomas">“ Dear old world , ”</said>she murmured ,<said who="#Thomas">“ you are very lovely , and I am glad to be alive in you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1770">Halfway down the hill a tall lad came whistling out of a gate before the<persName>Blythe</persName>homestead . It was<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>, and the whistle died on his lips as he recognized<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. He lifted his cap courteously , but he would have passed on in silence , if<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>had not stopped and held out her hand .</p>
    <p n="1771"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>, ”</said>she said , with scarlet cheeks ,<said who="#Anne">“ I want to thank you for giving up the school for me . It was very good of you — and I want you to know that I appreciate it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1772"><persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>took the offered hand eagerly .</p>
    <p n="1773"><said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“ It was n't particularly good of me at all ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. I was pleased to be able to do you some small service . Are we going to be friends after this ? Have you really forgiven me my old fault ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1774"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand .</p>
    <p n="1775"><said who="#Anne">“ I forgave you that day by the pond landing , although I did n't know it . What a stubborn little goose I was . I 've been — I may as well make a complete confession — I 've been sorry ever since . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1776"><said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“ We are going to be the best of friends , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert</persName>, jubilantly .<said who="#Gilbert_Blythe">“ We were born to be good friends ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>. You 've thwarted destiny enough . I know we can help each other in many ways . You are going to keep up your studies , are n't you ? So am I . Come , I 'm going to walk home with you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1777"><persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>looked curiously at<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>when the latter entered the kitchen .</p>
    <p n="1778"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ Who was that came up the lane with you ,<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1779"><said who="#Anne">“<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>, ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>, vexed to find herself blushing .<said who="#Anne">“ I met him on<persName>Barry</persName>'s hill . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1780"><said who="#Marilla_Cuthbert">“ I did n't think you and<persName corresp="#Gilbert_Blythe">Gilbert Blythe</persName>were such good friends that you 'd stand for half an hour at the gate talking to him , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>with a dry smile .</p>
    <p n="1781"><said who="#Anne">“ We have n't been — we 've been good enemies . But we have decided that it will be much more sensible to be good friends in the future . Were we really there half an hour ? It seemed just a few minutes . But , you see , we have five years ’ lost conversations to catch up with ,<persName corresp="#Marilla_Cuthbert">Marilla</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1782"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>sat long at her window that night companioned by a glad content . The wind purred softly in the cherry boughs , and the mint breaths came up to her . The stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow and<persName corresp="#Diana_Barry">Diana</persName>'s light gleamed through the old gap .</p>
    <p n="1783"><persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>'s horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after coming home from<persName corresp="#Queen">Queen</persName>'s ; but if the path set before her feet was to be narrow she knew that flowers of quiet happiness would bloom along it . The joy of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship were to be hers ; nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her ideal world of dreams . And there was always the bend in the road !</p>
    <p n="1784"><said who="#Anne">“ ‘ God 's in his heaven , all 's right with the world , ’ ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Anne">Anne</persName>softly .</p>
