    <p n="1"><persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter Elliot</persName>, of<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>, in Somersetshire , was a man who , for his own amusement , never took up any book but the Baronetage ; there he found occupation for an idle hour , and consolation in a distressed one ; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect , by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents ; there any unwelcome sensations , arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century ; and there , if every other leaf were powerless , he could read his own history with an interest which never failed . This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened :</p>
    <p>“ ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL .</p>
    <p n="2"><said who="#Kellynch_Hall">“<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Walter</persName>Elliot , born March 1 , 1760 , married , July 15 , 1784 ,<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, daughter of James Stevenson , Esq . of South Park , in the county of Gloucester , by which lady ( who died 1800 ) he has issue<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, born June 1 , 1785 ;<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, born August 9 , 1787 ; a still-born son , November 5 , 1789 ;<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, born November 20 , 1791 . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3">Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer 's hands ; but<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>had improved it by adding , for the information of himself and his family , these words , after the date of<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s birth — “ Married , December 16 , 1810 ,<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, son and heir of<persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>, Esq . of Uppercross , in the county of Somerset , ” and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife .</p>
    <p n="4">Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in Cheshire ; how mentioned in Dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>II , with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto :— “ Principal seat ,<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>, in the county of Somerset , ” and<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s handwriting again in this finale :—</p>
    <p n="5"><said>“ Heir presumptive , William<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Walter</persName>Elliot , Esq ., great grandson of the second<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="6">Vanity was the beginning and the end of<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter Elliot</persName>'s character ; vanity of person and of situation . He had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty-four , was still a very fine man . Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did , nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society . He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy ; and the<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter Elliot</persName>, who united these gifts , was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion .</p>
    <p n="7">His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment ; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own .<persName>Lady Elliot</persName>had been an excellent woman , sensible and amiable ; whose judgement and conduct , if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her<persName>Lady Elliot</persName>, had never required indulgence afterwards .— She had humoured , or softened , or concealed his failings , and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years ; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself , had found enough in her duties , her friends , and her children , to attach her to life , and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them .— Three girls , the two eldest sixteen and fourteen , was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath , an awful charge rather , to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited , silly father . She had , however , one very intimate friend , a sensible , deserving woman , who had been brought , by strong attachment to herself , to settle close by her , in the village of Kellynch ; and on her kindness and advice ,<persName>Lady Elliot</persName>mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters .</p>
    <p n="8">This friend , and<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, did not marry , whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance . Thirteen years had passed away since<persName>Lady Elliot</persName>'s death , and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends , and one remained a widower , the other a widow .</p>
    <p n="9">That<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again , than when she does not ; but<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s continuing in singleness requires explanation . Be it known then , that<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, like a good father , ( having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications ) , prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters ’ sake . For one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do .<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>had succeeded , at sixteen , to all that was possible , of her mother 's rights and consequence ; and being very handsome , and very like himself , her influence had always been great , and they had gone on together most happily . His two other children were of very inferior value .<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming Mrs<persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>; but<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister ; her word had no weight , her convenience was always to give way — she was only<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="10">To<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, indeed , she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter , favourite , and friend .<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>loved them all ; but it was only in<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>that she could fancy the mother to revive again .</p>
    <p n="11">A few years before ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>had been a very pretty girl , but her bloom had vanished early ; and as even in its height , her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ) , there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem . He had never indulged much hope , he had now none , of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work . All equality of alliance must rest with<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, for<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none :<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>would , one day or other , marry suitably .</p>
    <p n="12">It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost . It was so with<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, still the same handsome<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>haggard ,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>coarse , every face in the neighbourhood worsting , and the rapid increase of the crow 's foot about<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s temples had long been a distress to him .</p>
    <p n="13"><persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>did not quite equal her father in personal contentment . Thirteen years had seen her mistress of<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>, presiding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was . For thirteen years had she been doing the honours , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country . Thirteen winters ’ revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded , and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms , as she travelled up to London with her father , for a few weeks ’ annual enjoyment of the great world . She had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions ; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever , but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two . Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth , but now she liked it not . Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister , made the book an evil ; and more than once , when her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away .</p>
    <p n="14">She had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of . The heir presumptive , the very William<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Walter</persName>Elliot , Esq ., whose rights had been so generously supported by her father , had disappointed her .</p>
    <p n="15">She had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should . He had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after<persName>Lady Elliot</persName>'s death ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to London , when<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>was in her first bloom ,<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>had been forced into the introduction .</p>
    <p n="16">He was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed . He was invited to<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year ; but he never came . The following spring he was seen again in town , found equally agreeable , again encouraged , invited , and expected , and again he did not come ; and the next tidings were that he was married . Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot , he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth .</p>
    <p n="17"><persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>has resented it . As the head of the house , he felt that he ought to have been consulted , especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand ; “ For they must have been seen together , ” he observed ,<said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ once at Tattersall 's , and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons . ”</said>His disapprobation was expressed , but apparently very little regarded .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>had attempted no apology , and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family , as<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>considered him unworthy of it : all acquaintance between them had ceased .</p>
    <p n="18">This very awkward history of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was still , after an interval of several years , felt with anger by<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, who had liked the man for himself , and still more for being her father 's heir , and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter Elliot</persName>'s eldest daughter . There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal . Yet so miserably had he conducted himself , that though she was at this present time ( the summer of 1814 ) wearing black ribbons for his wife , she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again . The disgrace of his first marriage might , perhaps , as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring , have been got over , had he not done worse ; but he had , as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends , they had been informed , spoken most disrespectfully of them all , most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to , and the honours which were hereafter to be his own . This could not be pardoned .</p>
    <p n="19">Such were<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>Elliot 's sentiments and sensations ; such the cares to alloy , the agitations to vary , the sameness and the elegance , the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life ; such the feelings to give interest to a long , uneventful residence in one country circle , to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad , no talents or accomplishments for home , to occupy .</p>
    <p n="20">But now , another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these . Her father was growing distressed for money . She knew , that when he now took up the Baronetage , it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople , and the unwelcome hints of<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>, his agent , from his thoughts . The Kellynch property was good , but not equal to<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s apprehension of the state required in its possessor . While<persName>Lady Elliot</persName>lived , there had been method , moderation , and economy , which had just kept him within his income ; but with her had died all such right-mindedness , and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it . It had not been possible for him to spend less ; he had done nothing but what<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter Elliot</persName>was imperiously called on to do ; but blameless as he was , he was not only growing dreadfully in debt , but was hearing of it so often , that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer , even partially , from his daughter . He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town ; he had gone so far even as to say ,<said who="#Elizabeth">“ Can we retrench ? Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench ? ”</said>and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, to do her justice , had , in the first ardour of female alarm , set seriously to think what could be done , and had finally proposed these two branches of economy , to cut off some unnecessary charities , and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room ; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, as had been the usual yearly custom . But these measures , however good in themselves , were insufficient for the real extent of the evil , the whole of which<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards .<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy . She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate , as did her father ; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity , or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne .</p>
    <p n="21">There was only a small part of his estate that<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>could dispose of ; but had every acre been alienable , it would have made no difference . He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power , but he would never condescend to sell . No ; he would never disgrace his name so far . The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire , as he had received it .</p>
    <p n="22">Their two confidential friends ,<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>, who lived in the neighbouring market town , and<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, were called to advise them ; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure , without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="2">
    <p n="23"><persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>, a civil , cautious lawyer , who , whatever might be his hold or his views on<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else , excused himself from offering the slightest hint , and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted .</p>
    <p n="24"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>was most anxiously zealous on the subject , and gave it much serious consideration . She was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities , whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great , from the opposition of two leading principles . She was of strict integrity herself , with a delicate sense of honour ; but she was as desirous of saving<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s feelings , as solicitous for the credit of the family , as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them , as anybody of sense and honesty could well be . She was a benevolent , charitable , good woman , and capable of strong attachments , most correct in her conduct , strict in her notions of decorum , and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding . She had a cultivated mind , and was , generally speaking , rational and consistent ; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry ; she had a value for rank and consequence , which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them . Herself the widow of only a knight , she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due ; and<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance , an attentive neighbour , an obliging landlord , the husband of her very dear friend , the father of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>and her sisters , was , as being<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, in her apprehension , entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties .</p>
    <p n="25">They must retrench ; that did not admit of a doubt . But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. She drew up plans of economy , she made exact calculations , and she did what nobody else thought of doing : she consulted<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question . She consulted , and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>. Every emendation of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s had been on the side of honesty against importance . She wanted more vigorous measures , a more complete reformation , a quicker release from debt , a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity .</p>
    <p n="26"><said who="#Lady_Russell">“ If we can persuade your father to all this , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, looking over her paper ,<said who="#Lady_Russell">“ much may be done . If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, that<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter Elliot</persName>will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle . What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ? There will be nothing singular in his case ; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering , as it always does of our conduct . I have great hope of prevailing . We must be serious and decided ; for after all , the person who has contracted debts must pay them ; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman , and the head of a house , like your father , there is still more due to the character of an honest man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="27">This was the principle on which<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>wanted her father to be proceeding , his friends to be urging him . She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure , and saw no dignity in anything short of it . She wanted it to be prescribed , and felt as a duty . She rated<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s influence highly ; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own conscience prompted , she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete , than to half a reformation . Her knowledge of her father and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both , and so on , through the whole list of<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s too gentle reductions .</p>
    <p n="28">How<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence .<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s had no success at all : could not be put up with , were not to be borne .<said who="#Lady_Russell">“ What ! every comfort of life knocked off ! Journeys , London , servants , horses , table — contractions and restrictions every where ! To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman ! No , he would sooner quit<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>at once , than remain in it on such disgraceful terms . ”</said></p>
    <p n="29"><said who="#Mr_Shepherd">“ Quit<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>. ”</said>The hint was immediately taken up by<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>, whose interest was involved in the reality of<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s retrenching , and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode .<said who="#Mr_Shepherd">“ Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate , he had no scruple , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Mr_Shepherd">“ in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side . It did not appear to him that<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support . In any other place<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>might judge for himself ; and would be looked up to , as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household . ”</said></p>
    <p n="30"><persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>would quit<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision , the great question of whither he should go was settled , and the first outline of this important change made out .</p>
    <p n="31">There had been three alternatives , London , Bath , or another house in the country . All<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s wishes had been for the latter . A small house in their own neighbourhood , where they might still have<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s society , still be near<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch , was the object of her ambition . But the usual fate of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>attended her , in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on . She disliked Bath , and did not think it agreed with her ; and Bath was to be her home .</p>
    <p n="32"><persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>had at first thought more of London ; but<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred . It was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament : he might there be important at comparatively little expense . Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from Kellynch , only fifty miles , and<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there .</p>
    <p n="33"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>felt obliged to oppose her dear<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s known wishes . It would be too much to expect<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw , and to<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s feelings they must have been dreadful . And with regard to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s dislike of Bath , she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising , first , from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there , after her mother 's death ; and secondly , from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself .</p>
    <p n="34"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>was fond of Bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend 's health , by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had been too little from home , too little seen . Her spirits were not high . A larger society would improve them . She wanted her to be more known .</p>
    <p n="35">The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>was certainly much strengthened by one part , and a very material part of the scheme , which had been happily engrafted on the beginning . He was not only to quit his home , but to see it in the hands of others ; a trial of fortitude , which stronger heads than<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s have found too much .<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>was to be let . This , however , was a profound secret , not to be breathed beyond their own circle .</p>
    <p n="36"><persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house .<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>had once mentioned the word “ advertise , ” but never dared approach it again .<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner ; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention ; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant , on his own terms , and as a great favour , that he would let it at all .</p>
    <p n="37">How quick come the reasons for approving what we like !<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>had another excellent one at hand , for being extremely glad that<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and his family were to remove from the country .<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>had been lately forming an intimacy , which she wished to see interrupted . It was with the daughter of<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>, who had returned , after an unprosperous marriage , to her father 's house , with the additional burden of two children . She was a clever young woman , who understood the art of pleasing — the art of pleasing , at least , at<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>; and who had made herself so acceptable to<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, as to have been already staying there more than once , in spite of all that<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, who thought it a friendship quite out of place , could hint of caution and reserve .</p>
    <p n="38"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, indeed , had scarcely any influence with<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, and seemed to love her , rather because she would love her , than because<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>deserved it . She had never received from her more than outward attention , nothing beyond the observances of complaisance ; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry , against previous inclination . She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>included in the visit to London , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain :<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>than in this selection of<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility .</p>
    <p n="39">From situation ,<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>was , in<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s estimate , a very unequal , and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion ; and a removal that would leave<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>behind , and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>'s reach , was therefore an object of first-rate importance .</p>

    <p n="40"><said who="#Mr_Shepherd">“ I must take leave to observe ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>one morning at<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>, as he laid down the newspaper ,<said who="#Mr_Shepherd">“ that the present juncture is much in our favour . This peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore . They will be all wanting a home . Could not be a better time ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, for having a choice of tenants , very responsible tenants . Many a noble fortune has been made during the war . If a rich admiral were to come in our way ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>— ”</said></p>
    <p n="41"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ He would be a very lucky man ,<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Shepherd</persName>, ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>;<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ that 's all I have to remark . A prize indeed would<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>be to him ; rather the greatest prize of all , let him have taken ever so many before ; hey ,<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Shepherd</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="42"><persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>laughed , as he knew he must , at this wit , and then added —</p>
    <p n="43"><said>“ I presume to observe ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, that , in the way of business , gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with . I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business ; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions , and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with . Therefore ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, what I would take leave to suggest is , that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention ; which must be contemplated as a possible thing , because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other ; consequence has its tax ; I , John<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Shepherd</persName>, might conceal any family-matters that I chose , for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me ; but<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter Elliot</persName>has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude ; and therefore , thus much I venture upon , that it will not greatly surprise me if , with all our caution , some rumour of the truth should get abroad ; in the supposition of which , as I was going to observe , since applications will unquestionably follow , I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to ; and beg leave to add , that two hours will bring me over at any time , to save you the trouble of replying . ”</said></p>
    <p n="44"><persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>only nodded . But soon afterwards , rising and pacing the room , he observed sarcastically —</p>
    <p n="45"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ There are few among the gentlemen of the navy , I imagine , who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description . ”</said></p>
    <p n="46"><said who="#Mrs_Clay">“ They would look around them , no doubt , and bless their good fortune , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>, for<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>was present : her father had driven her over , nothing being of so much use to<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>'s health as a drive to Kellynch :<said who="#Mrs_Clay">“ but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant . I have known a good deal of the profession ; and besides their liberality , they are so neat and careful in all their ways ! These valuable pictures of yours ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, if you chose to leave them , would be perfectly safe . Everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of ! The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now . You need not be afraid ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected . ”</said></p>
    <p n="47"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ As to all that , ”</said>rejoined<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>coolly ,<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ supposing I were induced to let my house , I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it . I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant . The park would be open to him of course , and few navy officers , or men of any other description , can have had such a range ; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds , is another thing . I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable ; and I should recommend<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden . I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>any extraordinary favour , I assure you , be he sailor or soldier . ”</said></p>
    <p n="48">After a short pause ,<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>presumed to say —</p>
    <p n="49"><said>“ In all these cases , there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant . Your interest ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, is in pretty safe hands . Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights . I venture to hint , that<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter Elliot</persName>cannot be half so jealous for his own , as John<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Shepherd</persName>will be for him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="50">Here<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>spoke —</p>
    <p n="51"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ The navy , I think , who have done so much for us , have at least an equal claim with any other set of men , for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give . Sailors work hard enough for their comforts , we must all allow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="52"><said who="#Mr_Shepherd">“ Very true , very true . What<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne</persName>says , is very true , ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>'s rejoinder , and “ Oh ! certainly , ” was his daughter 's ; but<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s remark was , soon afterwards —</p>
    <p n="53"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ The profession has its utility , but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="54"><said who="#Mr_Shepherd">“ Indeed ! ”</said>was the reply , and with a look of surprise .</p>
    <p n="55"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Yes ; it is in two points offensive to me ; I have two strong grounds of objection to it . First , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man 's youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man . I have observed it all my life . A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line . One day last spring , in town , I was in company with two men , striking instances of what I am talking of ; Lord St Ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; I was to give place to Lord St Ives , and a certain<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>Baldwin , the most deplorable-looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top . ‘ In the name of heaven , who is that old fellow ? ’ said I to a friend of mine who was standing near , ( Sir Basil Morley ) . ‘ Old fellow ! ’ cried Sir Basil , ‘ it is<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>Baldwin . What do you take his age to be ? ’ ‘ Sixty , ’ said I , ‘ or perhaps sixty-two . ’ ‘ Forty , ’ replied Sir Basil , ‘ forty , and no more . ’ Picture to yourselves my amazement ; I shall not easily forget<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>Baldwin . I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do ; but to a degree , I know it is the same with them all : they are all knocked about , and exposed to every climate , and every weather , till they are not fit to be seen . It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once , before they reach<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>Baldwin 's age . ”</said></p>
    <p n="56"><said who="#Mrs_Clay">“ Nay ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>,<said who="#Mrs_Clay">“ this is being severe indeed . Have a little mercy on the poor men . We are not all born to be handsome . The sea is no beautifier , certainly ; sailors do grow old betimes ; I have observed it ; they soon lose the look of youth . But then , is not it the same with many other professions , perhaps most other ? Soldiers , in active service , are not at all better off : and even in the quieter professions , there is a toil and a labour of the mind , if not of the body , which seldom leaves a man 's looks to the natural effect of time . The lawyer plods , quite care-worn ; the physician is up at all hours , and travelling in all weather ; and even the clergyman — ”</said>she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman ;— “ and even the clergyman , you know is obliged to go into infected rooms , and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere . In fact , as I have long been convinced , though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn , it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any , who can live in a regular way , in the country , choosing their own hours , following their own pursuits , and living on their own property , without the torment of trying for more ; it is only their lot , I say , to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost : I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young . ”</p>
    <p n="57">It seemed as if<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>, in this anxiety to bespeak<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s good will towards a naval officer as tenant , had been gifted with foresight ; for the very first application for the house was from an<persName>Admiral Croft</persName>, with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton ; and indeed , he had received a hint of<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>from a London correspondent . By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make ,<persName>Admiral Croft</persName>was a native of Somersetshire , who having acquired a very handsome fortune , was wishing to settle in his own country , and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood , which , however , had not suited him ; that accidentally hearing — ( it was just as he had foretold ,<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>observed ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s concerns could not be kept a secret ,) — accidentally hearing of the possibility of<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>being to let , and understanding his (<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>'s ) connection with the owner , he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries , and had , in the course of a pretty long conference , expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel ; and given<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>, in his explicit account of himself , every proof of his being a most responsible , eligible tenant .</p>
    <p n="58"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ And who is<persName>Admiral Croft</persName>? ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s cold suspicious inquiry .</p>
    <p n="59"><persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>answered for his being of a gentleman 's family , and mentioned a place ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, after the little pause which followed , added —</p>
    <p n="60"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ He is a rear admiral of the white . He was in the Trafalgar action , and has been in the East Indies since ; he was stationed there , I believe , several years . ”</said></p>
    <p n="61"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ Then I take it for granted , ”</said>observed<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>,<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery . ”</said></p>
    <p n="62"><persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>hastened to assure him , that<persName>Admiral Croft</persName>was a very hale , hearty , well-looking man , a little weather-beaten , to be sure , but not much , and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour ; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms , only wanted a comfortable home , and to get into it as soon as possible ; knew he must pay for his convenience ; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that consequence might fetch ; should not have been surprised if<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>had asked more ; had inquired about the manor ; would be glad of the deputation , certainly , but made no great point of it ; said he sometimes took out a gun , but never killed ; quite the gentleman .</p>
    <p n="63"><persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>'s family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant . He was a married man , and without children ; the very state to be wished for . A house was never taken good care of ,<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>observed , without a lady : he did not know , whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady , as where there were many children . A lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world . He had seen<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>, too ; she was at Taunton with the admiral , and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over .</p>
    <p n="64"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ And a very well-spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be , ”</said>continued he ;<said>“ asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford . Bless me ! what was his name ? At this moment I cannot recollect his name , though I have heard it so lately . Penelope , my dear , can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford :<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>'s brother ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="65">But<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>was talking so eagerly with<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, that she did not hear the appeal .</p>
    <p n="66"><said who="#Miss_Elliot">“ I have no conception whom you can mean ,<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Shepherd</persName>; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent . ”</said></p>
    <p n="67"><said who="#Mr_Shepherd">“ Bless me ! how very odd ! I shall forget my own name soon , I suppose . A name that I am so very well acquainted with ; knew the gentleman so well by sight ; seen him a hundred times ; came to consult me once , I remember , about a trespass of one of his neighbours ; farmer 's man breaking into his orchard ; wall torn down ; apples stolen ; caught in the fact ; and afterwards , contrary to my judgement , submitted to an amicable compromise . Very odd indeed ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="68">After waiting another moment —</p>
    <p n="69"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ You mean Mr<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>, I suppose ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="70"><persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>was all gratitude .</p>
    <p n="71"><said who="#Mr_Shepherd">“<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>was the very name ! Mr<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>was the very man . He had the curacy of Monkford , you know ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, some time back , for two or three years . Came there about the year — - 5 , I take it . You remember him , I am sure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="72"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>? Oh ! ay ,— Mr<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>, the curate of Monkford . You misled me by the term gentleman . I thought you were speaking of some man of property : Mr<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>was nobody , I remember ; quite unconnected ; nothing to do with the Strafford family . One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common . ”</said></p>
    <p n="73">As<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>, and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter Elliot</persName>: an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s estimate of the dues of a tenant .</p>
    <p n="74">It succeeded , however ; and though<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house , and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms , he was talked into allowing<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>to proceed in the treaty , and authorising him to wait on<persName>Admiral Croft</persName>, who still remained at Taunton , and fix a day for the house being seen .</p>
    <p n="75"><persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>was not very wise ; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel , that a more unobjectionable tenant , in all essentials , than<persName>Admiral Croft</persName>bid fair to be , could hardly offer . So far went his understanding ; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing , in<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>'s situation in life , which was just high enough , and not too high .<said who="#the_Admiral">“ I have let my house to<persName>Admiral Croft</persName>, ”</said>would sound extremely well ; very much better than to any mere Mr —; a Mr ( save , perhaps , some half dozen in the nation ,) always needs a note of explanation . An admiral speaks his own consequence , and , at the same time , can never make a baronet look small . In all their dealings and intercourse ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter Elliot</persName>must ever have the precedence .</p>
    <p n="76">Nothing could be done without a reference to<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>: but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal , that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand ; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her .</p>
    <p n="77"><persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>was completely empowered to act ; and no sooner had such an end been reached , than<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, who had been a most attentive listener to the whole , left the room , to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks ; and as she walked along a favourite grove , said , with a gentle sigh ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ A few months more , and he , perhaps , may be walking here . ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="4">
    <p n="78">He was not Mr<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>, the former curate of Monkford , however suspicious appearances may be , but a Captain<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>, his brother , who being made commander in consequence of the action off St Domingo , and not immediately employed , had come into Somersetshire , in the summer of 1806 ; and having no parent living , found a home for half a year at Monkford . He was , at that time , a remarkably fine young man , with a great deal of intelligence , spirit , and brilliancy ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>an extremely pretty girl , with gentleness , modesty , taste , and feeling . Half the sum of attraction , on either side , might have been enough , for he had nothing to do , and she had hardly anybody to love ; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail . They were gradually acquainted , and when acquainted , rapidly and deeply in love . It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other , or which had been the happiest : she , in receiving his declarations and proposals , or he in having them accepted .</p>
    <p n="79">A short period of exquisite felicity followed , and but a short one . Troubles soon arose .<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, on being applied to , without actually withholding his consent , or saying it should never be , gave it all the negative of great astonishment , great coldness , great silence , and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter . He thought it a very degrading alliance ; and<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, though with more tempered and pardonable pride , received it as a most unfortunate one .</p>
    <p n="80"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>, with all her claims of birth , beauty , and mind , to throw herself away at nineteen ; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man , who had nothing but himself to recommend him , and no hopes of attaining affluence , but in the chances of a most uncertain profession , and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession , would be , indeed , a throwing away , which she grieved to think of !<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>, so young ; known to so few , to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune ; or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing , anxious , youth-killing dependence ! It must not be , if by any fair interference of friendship , any representations from one who had almost a mother 's love , and mother 's rights , it would be prevented .</p>
    <p n="81"><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>had no fortune . He had been lucky in his profession ; but spending freely , what had come freely , had realized nothing . But he was confident that he should soon be rich : full of life and ardour , he knew that he should soon have a ship , and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted . He had always been lucky ; he knew he should be so still . Such confidence , powerful in its own warmth , and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it , must have been enough for<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>; but<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>saw it very differently . His sanguine temper , and fearlessness of mind , operated very differently on her . She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil . It only added a dangerous character to himself . He was brilliant , he was headstrong .<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>had little taste for wit , and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror . She deprecated the connexion in every light .</p>
    <p n="82">Such opposition , as these feelings produced , was more than<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could combat . Young and gentle as she was , it might yet have been possible to withstand her father 's ill-will , though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister ; but<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, whom she had always loved and relied on , could not , with such steadiness of opinion , and such tenderness of manner , be continually advising her in vain . She was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing : indiscreet , improper , hardly capable of success , and not deserving it . But it was not a merely selfish caution , under which she acted , in putting an end to it . Had she not imagined herself consulting his good , even more than her own , she could hardly have given him up . The belief of being prudent , and self-denying , principally for his advantage , was her chief consolation , under the misery of a parting , a final parting ; and every consolation was required , for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions , on his side , totally unconvinced and unbending , and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment . He had left the country in consequence .</p>
    <p n="83">A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance ; but not with a few months ended<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s share of suffering from it . Her attachment and regrets had , for a long time , clouded every enjoyment of youth , and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect .</p>
    <p n="84">More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close ; and time had softened down much , perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him , but she had been too dependent on time alone ; no aid had been given in change of place ( except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture ) , or in any novelty or enlargement of society . No one had ever come within the Kellynch circle , who could bear a comparison with<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>, as he stood in her memory . No second attachment , the only thoroughly natural , happy , and sufficient cure , at her time of life , had been possible to the nice tone of her mind , the fastidiousness of her taste , in the small limits of the society around them . She had been solicited , when about two-and-twenty , to change her name , by the young man , who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister ; and<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>had lamented her refusal ; for<persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>was the eldest son of a man , whose landed property and general importance were second in that country , only to<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s , and of good character and appearance ; and however<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>might have asked yet for something more , while<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was nineteen , she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father 's house , and settled so permanently near herself . But in this case ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had left nothing for advice to do ; and though<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion , never wished the past undone , she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s being tempted , by some man of talents and independence , to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits .</p>
    <p n="85">They knew not each other 's opinion , either its constancy or its change , on the one leading point of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s conduct , for the subject was never alluded to ; but<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, at seven-and-twenty , thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen . She did not blame<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her ; but she felt that were any young person , in similar circumstances , to apply to her for counsel , they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness , such uncertain future good . She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home , and every anxiety attending his profession , all their probable fears , delays , and disappointments , she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement , than she had been in the sacrifice of it ; and this , she fully believed , had the usual share , had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs , without reference to the actual results of their case , which , as it happened , would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on . All his sanguine expectations , all his confidence had been justified . His genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path . He had , very soon after their engagement ceased , got employ : and all that he had told her would follow , had taken place . He had distinguished himself , and early gained the other step in rank , and must now , by successive captures , have made a handsome fortune . She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority , but she could not doubt his being rich ; and , in favour of his constancy , she had no reason to believe him married .</p>
    <p n="86">How eloquent could<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>have been ! how eloquent , at least , were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment , and a cheerful confidence in futurity , against that over-anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence ! She had been forced into prudence in her youth , she learned romance as she grew older : the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning .</p>
    <p n="87">With all these circumstances , recollections and feelings , she could not hear that<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain ; and many a stroll , and many a sigh , were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea . She often told herself it was folly , before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no evil . She was assisted , however , by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness , among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past , which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it . She could do justice to the superiority of<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s motives in this , over those of her father and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness ; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung ; and in the event of<persName>Admiral Croft</persName>'s really taking<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her , of the past being known to those three only among her connexions , by whom no syllable , she believed , would ever be whispered , and in the trust that among his , the brother only with whom he had been residing , had received any information of their short-lived engagement . That brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man , and , moreover , a single man at the time , she had a fond dependence on no human creature 's having heard of it from him .</p>
    <p n="88">The sister ,<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>, had then been out of England , accompanying her husband on a foreign station , and her own sister ,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, had been at school while it all occurred ; and never admitted by the pride of some , and the delicacy of others , to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards .</p>
    <p n="89">With these supports , she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the Crofts , which , with<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, still resident in Kellynch , and<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>fixed only three miles off , must be anticipated , need not involve any particular awkwardness .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="5">
    <p n="90">On the morning appointed for<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>'s seeing<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s , and keep out of the way till all was over ; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them .</p>
    <p n="91">This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory , and decided the whole business at once . Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement , and saw nothing , therefore , but good manners in the other ; and with regard to the gentlemen , there was such an hearty good humour , such an open , trusting liberality on<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>'s side , as could not but influence<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>'s assurances of his being known , by report , to<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>, as a model of good breeding .</p>
    <p n="92">The house and grounds , and furniture , were approved , the Crofts were approved , terms , time , every thing , and every body , was right ; and<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>'s clerks were set to work , without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that “ This indenture sheweth . ”</p>
    <p n="93"><persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, without hesitation , declared<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>to be the best-looking sailor he had ever met with , and went so far as to say , that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair , he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where ; and<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>, with sympathetic cordiality , observed to his wife as they drove back through the park ,<said who="#the_Admiral">“ I thought we should soon come to a deal , my dear , in spite of what they told us at Taunton . The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire , but there seems to be no harm in him . ”</said>— reciprocal compliments , which would have been esteemed about equal .</p>
    <p n="94">The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas ; and as<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month , there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement .</p>
    <p n="95"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, convinced that<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>would not be allowed to be of any use , or any importance , in the choice of the house which they were going to secure , was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon , and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas ; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks , she was unable to give the full invitation she wished , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath , and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country , did not think that , everything considered , she wished to remain . It would be most right , and most wise , and , therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others .</p>
    <p n="96">Something occurred , however , to give her a different duty .<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, often a little unwell , and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints , and always in the habit of claiming<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>when anything was the matter , was indisposed ; and foreseeing that she should not have a day 's health all the autumn , entreated , or rather required her , for it was hardly entreaty , to come to Uppercross Cottage , and bear her company as long as she should want her , instead of going to Bath .</p>
    <p n="97"><said who="#Mary">“ I cannot possibly do without<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s reasoning ; and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s reply was ,<said who="#Mary">“ Then I am sure<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had better stay , for nobody will want her in Bath . ”</said></p>
    <p n="98">To be claimed as a good , though in an improper style , is at least better than being rejected as no good at all ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, glad to be thought of some use , glad to have anything marked out as a duty , and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country , and her own dear country , readily agreed to stay .</p>
    <p n="99">This invitation of<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s removed all<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s difficulties , and it was consequently soon settled that<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>should not go to Bath till<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>took her , and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge .</p>
    <p n="100">So far all was perfectly right ; but<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>plan , when it burst on her , which was ,<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>'s being engaged to go to Bath with<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her .<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all , wondered , grieved , and feared ; and the affront it contained to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, in<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>'s being of so much use , while<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could be of none , was a very sore aggravation .</p>
    <p n="101"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>herself was become hardened to such affronts ; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>. With a great deal of quiet observation , and a knowledge , which she often wished less , of her father 's character , she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible . She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>had freckles , and a projecting tooth , and a clumsy wrist , which he was continually making severe remarks upon , in her absence ; but she was young , and certainly altogether well-looking , and possessed , in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners , infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was so impressed by the degree of their danger , that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister . She had little hope of success ; but<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself , should never , she thought , have reason to reproach her for giving no warning .</p>
    <p n="102">She spoke , and seemed only to offend .<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her , and indignantly answered for each party 's perfectly knowing their situation .</p>
    <p n="103"><said who="#Elizabeth">“<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>, ”</said>said she , warmly ,<said who="#Elizabeth">“ never forgets who she is ; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , I can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people . And as to my father , I really should not have thought that he , who has kept himself single so long for our sakes , need be suspected now . If<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>were a very beautiful woman , I grant you , it might be wrong to have her so much with me ; not that anything in the world , I am sure , would induce my father to make a degrading match , but he might be rendered unhappy . But poor<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>who , with all her merits , can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty , I really think poor<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>may be staying here in perfect safety . One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes , though I know you must fifty times . That tooth of her 's and those freckles . Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him . I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few , but he abominates them . You must have heard him notice<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>'s freckles . ”</said></p>
    <p n="104"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ There is hardly any personal defect , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to . ”</said></p>
    <p n="105"><said who="#Elizabeth">“ I think very differently , ”</said>answered<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, shortly ;<said who="#Elizabeth">“ an agreeable manner may set off handsome features , but can never alter plain ones . However , at any rate , as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have , I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="106"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had done ; glad that it was over , and not absolutely hopeless of doing good .<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, though resenting the suspicion , might yet be made observant by it .</p>
    <p n="107">The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>,<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>to Bath . The party drove off in very good spirits ;<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>walked up at the same time , in a sort of desolate tranquillity , to the Lodge , where she was to spend the first week .</p>
    <p n="108">Her friend was not in better spirits than herself .<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>felt this break-up of the family exceedingly . Their respectability was as dear to her as her own , and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit . It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds , and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into ; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village , and be out of the way when<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>first arrived , she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>. Accordingly their removal was made together , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was set down at Uppercross Cottage , in the first stage of<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s journey .</p>
    <p n="109">Uppercross was a moderate-sized village , which a few years back had been completely in the old English style , containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers ; the mansion of the squire , with its high walls , great gates , and old trees , substantial and unmodernized , and the compact , tight parsonage , enclosed in its own neat garden , with a vine and a pear-tree trained round its casements ; but upon the marriage of the young ‘ squire , it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage , for his residence , and Uppercross Cottage , with its veranda , French windows , and other prettiness , was quite as likely to catch the traveller 's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House , about a quarter of a mile farther on .</p>
    <p n="110">Here<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had often been staying . She knew the ways of Uppercross as well as those of Kellynch . The two families were so continually meeting , so much in the habit of running in and out of each other 's house at all hours , that it was rather a surprise to her to find<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>alone ; but being alone , her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course . Though better endowed than the elder sister ,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>had not<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s understanding nor temper . While well , and happy , and properly attended to , she had great good humour and excellent spirits ; but any indisposition sunk her completely . She had no resources for solitude ; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot self-importance , was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill-used . In person , she was inferior to both sisters , and had , even in her bloom , only reached the dignity of being “ a fine girl . ” She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing-room , the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby , under the influence of four summers and two children ; and , on<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s appearing , greeted her with —</p>
    <p n="111"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ So , you are come at last ! I began to think I should never see you . I am so ill I can hardly speak . I have not seen a creature the whole morning ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="112"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I am sorry to find you unwell , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="113"><said who="#Mary">“ Yes , I made the best of it ; I always do : but I was very far from well at the time ; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning : very unfit to be left alone , I am sure . Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way , and not able to ring the bell ! So ,<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>would not get out . I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer . ”</said></p>
    <p n="114"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>said what was proper , and enquired after her husband .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Oh !<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>is out shooting . I have not seen him since seven o'clock . He would go , though I told him how ill I was . He said he should not stay out long ; but he has never come back , and now it is almost one . I assure you , I have not seen a soul this whole long morning . ”</said></p>
    <p n="115"><said who="#Mary">“ You have had your little boys with you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="116"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Yes , as long as I could bear their noise ; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good . Little<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>does not mind a word I say , and<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Walter</persName>is growing quite as bad . ”</said></p>
    <p n="117"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Well , you will soon be better now , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, cheerfully .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ You know I always cure you when I come . How are your neighbours at the Great House ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="118"><said who="#Mary">“ I can give you no account of them . I have not seen one of them to-day , except<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>, who just stopped and spoke through the window , but without getting off his horse ; and though I told him how ill I was , not one of them have been near me . It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves , I suppose , and they never put themselves out of their way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="119"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ You will see them yet , perhaps , before the morning is gone . It is early . ”</said></p>
    <p n="120"><said who="#Mary">“ I never want them , I assure you . They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me . Oh !<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, I am so very unwell ! It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="121"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself ! You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner . ”</said></p>
    <p n="122"><said who="#Mary">“ Dear me ! what can you possibly have to do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="123"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ A great many things , I assure you . More than I can recollect in a moment ; but I can tell you some . I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father 's books and pictures . I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie , trying to understand , and make him understand , which of<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s plants are for<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>. I have had all my own little concerns to arrange , books and music to divide , and all my trunks to repack , from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons : and one thing I have had to do ,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, of a more trying nature : going to almost every house in the parish , as a sort of take-leave . I was told that they wished it . But all these things took up a great deal of time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="124"><said who="#Mary">“ Oh ! well ! ”</said>and after a moment 's pause ,<said who="#Mary">“ but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="125"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Did you go then ? I have made no enquiries , because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party . ”</said></p>
    <p n="126"><said who="#Mary">“ Oh yes ! I went . I was very well yesterday ; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning . It would have been strange if I had not gone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="127"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I am very glad you were well enough , and I hope you had a pleasant party . ”</said></p>
    <p n="128"><said who="#Mary">“ Nothing remarkable . One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be , and who will be there ; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one 's own . Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>took me , and we were so crowded ! They are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>always sits forward . So , there was I , crowded into the back seat with<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>and Louise ; and I think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="129">A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s side produced nearly a cure on<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s . She could soon sit upright on the sofa , and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner-time . Then , forgetting to think of it , she was at the other end of the room , beautifying a nosegay ; then , she ate her cold meat ; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk .</p>
    <p n="130"><said who="#Mary">“ Where shall we go ? ”</said>said she , when they were ready .<said who="#Mary">“ I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="131"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I have not the smallest objection on that account , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves . ”</said></p>
    <p n="132"><said who="#Mary">“ Oh ! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible . They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister . However , we may as well go and sit with them a little while , and when we have that over , we can enjoy our walk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="133"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent ; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it , from believing that , though there were on each side continual subjects of offence , neither family could now do without it . To the Great House accordingly they went , to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour , with a small carpet and shining floor , to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp , flower-stands and little tables placed in every direction . Oh ! could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot , could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on , have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness ! The portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment .</p>
    <p n="134">The Musgroves , like their houses , were in a state of alteration , perhaps of improvement . The father and mother were in the old English style , and the young people in the new . Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>were a very good sort of people ; friendly and hospitable , not much educated , and not at all elegant . Their children had more modern minds and manners . There was a numerous family ; but the only two grown up , excepting<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, were<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, young ladies of nineteen and twenty , who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments , and were now like thousands of other young ladies , living to be fashionable , happy , and merry . Their dress had every advantage , their faces were rather pretty , their spirits extremely good , their manner unembarrassed and pleasant ; they were of consequence at home , and favourites abroad .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance ; but still , saved as we all are , by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange , she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments ; and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together , that good-humoured mutual affection , of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters .</p>
    <p n="135">They were received with great cordiality . Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family , which was generally , as<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>very well knew , the least to blame . The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough ; and she was not at all surprised at the end of it , to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves , at<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s particular invitation .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="6">
    <p n="136"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had not wanted this visit to Uppercross , to learn that a removal from one set of people to another , though at a distance of only three miles , will often include a total change of conversation , opinion , and idea . She had never been staying there before , without being struck by it , or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown , or unconsidered there , were the affairs which at<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest ; yet , with all this experience , she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson , in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle , was become necessary for her ; for certainly , coming as she did , with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks , she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>:<said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ So ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne</persName>,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and your sister are gone ; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in ? ”</said>and this , without much waiting for an answer ; or in the young ladies ’ addition of ,<said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter ; but remember , papa , if we do go , we must be in a good situation : none of your Queen Squares for us ! ”</said>or in the anxious supplement from<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, of —<said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ Upon my word , I shall be pretty well off , when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="137">She could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future , and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>.</p>
    <p n="138">The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard , and to destroy , their own horses , dogs , and newspapers to engage them , and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping , neighbours , dress , dancing , and music . She acknowledged it to be very fitting , that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse ; and hoped , ere long , to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into . With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross , it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination , her memory , and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible .</p>
    <p n="139">She had no dread of these two months .<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>was not so repulsive and unsisterly as<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers ; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort . She was always on friendly terms with her brother-in-law ; and in the children , who loved her nearly as well , and respected her a great deal more than their mother , she had an object of interest , amusement , and wholesome exertion .</p>
    <p n="140"><persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could believe , with<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits . As it was , he did nothing with much zeal , but sport ; and his time was otherwise trifled away , without benefit from books or anything else . He had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife 's occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s admiration , and upon the whole , though there was very often a little disagreement ( in which she had sometimes more share than she wished , being appealed to by both parties ) , they might pass for a happy couple . They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money , and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father ; but here , as on most topics , he had the superiority , for while<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>thought it a great shame that such a present was not made , he always contended for his father 's having many other uses for his money , and a right to spend it as he liked .</p>
    <p n="141">As to the management of their children , his theory was much better than his wife 's , and his practice not so bad .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I could manage them very well , if it were not for<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s interference , ”</said>was what<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>often heard him say , and had a good deal of faith in ; but when listening in turn to<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s reproach of “<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>spoils the children so that I cannot get them into any order , ” she never had the smallest temptation to say ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Very true . ”</said></p>
    <p n="142">One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties , and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house . Known to have some influence with her sister , she was continually requested , or at least receiving hints to exert it , beyond what was practicable .<said who="#Charles">“ I wish you could persuade<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>not to be always fancying herself ill , ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>'s language ; and , in an unhappy mood , thus spoke<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>:<said who="#Mary">“ I do believe if<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>were to see me dying , he would not think there was anything the matter with me . I am sure ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, if you would , you might persuade him that I really am very ill — a great deal worse than I ever own . ”</said></p>
    <p n="143"><persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s declaration was ,<said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ I hate sending the children to the Great House , though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them , for she humours and indulges them to such a degree , and gives them so much trash and sweet things , that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day . ”</said>And<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>took the first opportunity of being alone with<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, to say , “ Oh !<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne</persName>, I cannot help wishing Mrs<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>had a little of your method with those children . They are quite different creatures with you ! But to be sure , in general they are so spoilt ! It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them . They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen , poor little dears ! without partiality ; but Mrs<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>knows no more how they should be treated —! Bless me ! how troublesome they are sometimes . I assure you ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne</persName>, it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should . I believe Mrs<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; “ do n't do this , ” and “ do n't do that ; ” or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them . ”</p>
    <p n="144">She had this communication , moreover , from<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>.<said who="#Mary">“<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>thinks all her servants so steady , that it would be high treason to call it in question ; but I am sure , without exaggeration , that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid , instead of being in their business , are gadding about the village , all day long . I meet them wherever I go ; and I declare , I never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them . If Jemima were not the trustiest , steadiest creature in the world , it would be enough to spoil her ; for she tells me , they are always tempting her to take a walk with them . ”</said>And on<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>'s side , it was ,<said who="#Mary">“ I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter-in-law 's concerns , for I know it would not do ; but I shall tell you ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne</persName>, because you may be able to set things to rights , that I have no very good opinion of Mrs<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>'s nursery-maid : I hear strange stories of her ; she is always upon the gad ; and from my own knowledge , I can declare , she is such a fine-dressing lady , that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near . Mrs<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>quite swears by her , I know ; but I just give you this hint , that you may be upon the watch ; because , if you see anything amiss , you need not be afraid of mentioning it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="145">Again , it was<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s complaint , that<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due , when they dined at the Great House with other families ; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place . And one day when<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was walking with only the Musgroves , one of them after talking of rank , people of rank , and jealousy of rank , said ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I have no scruple of observing to you , how nonsensical some persons are about their place , because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it ; but I wish anybody could give<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious , especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma . Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma , but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it . It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world , but I know it is taken notice of by many persons . ”</said></p>
    <p n="146">How was<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>to set all these matters to rights ? She could do little more than listen patiently , soften every grievance , and excuse each to the other ; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours , and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister 's benefit .</p>
    <p n="147">In all other respects , her visit began and proceeded very well . Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject , by being removed three miles from Kellynch ;<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s ailments lessened by having a constant companion , and their daily intercourse with the other family , since there was neither superior affection , confidence , nor employment in the cottage , to be interrupted by it , was rather an advantage . It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible , for they met every morning , and hardly ever spent an evening asunder ; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>'s respectable forms in the usual places , or without the talking , laughing , and singing of their daughters .</p>
    <p n="148">She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves , but having no voice , no knowledge of the harp , and no fond parents , to sit by and fancy themselves delighted , her performance was little thought of , only out of civility , or to refresh the others , as she was well aware . She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself ; but this was no new sensation . Excepting one short period of her life , she had never , since the age of fourteen , never since the loss of her dear mother , known the happiness of being listened to , or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste . In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world ; and Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>'s fond partiality for their own daughters ’ performance , and total indifference to any other person 's , gave her much more pleasure for their sakes , than mortification for her own .</p>
    <p n="149">The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company . The neighbourhood was not large , but the Musgroves were visited by everybody , and had more dinner-parties , and more callers , more visitors by invitation and by chance , than any other family . There were more completely popular .</p>
    <p n="150">The girls were wild for dancing ; and the evenings ended , occasionally , in an unpremeditated little ball . There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross , in less affluent circumstances , who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures : they would come at any time , and help play at anything , or dance anywhere ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post , played country dances to them by the hour together ; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>more than anything else , and often drew this compliment ;— “ Well done ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne</persName>! very well done indeed ! Lord bless me ! how those little fingers of yours fly about ! ”</p>
    <p n="151">So passed the first three weeks . Michaelmas came ; and now<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s heart must be in Kellynch again . A beloved home made over to others ; all the precious rooms and furniture , groves , and prospects , beginning to own other eyes and other limbs ! She could not think of much else on the 29th of September ; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, who , on having occasion to note down the day of the month , exclaimed ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Dear me , is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch ? I am glad I did not think of it before . How low it makes me ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="152">The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness , and were to be visited .<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>deplored the necessity for herself .<said who="#Charles">“ Nobody knew how much she should suffer . She should put it off as long as she could ; ”</said>but was not easy till she had talked<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>into driving her over on an early day , and was in a very animated , comfortable state of imaginary agitation , when she came back .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going . She wished , however to see the Crofts , and was glad to be within when the visit was returned . They came : the master of the house was not at home , but the two sisters were together ; and as it chanced that<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>fell to the share of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, while<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>sat by<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys , she was well able to watch for a likeness , and if it failed her in the features , to catch it in the voice , or in the turn of sentiment and expression .</p>
    <p n="153"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>, though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person . She had bright dark eyes , good teeth , and altogether an agreeable face ; though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion , the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband , made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty . Her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>gave her credit , indeed , for feelings of great consideration towards herself , in all that related to Kellynch , and it pleased her : especially , as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute , in the instant even of introduction , that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>'s side , to give a bias of any sort . She was quite easy on that head , and consequently full of strength and courage , till for a moment electrified by<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>'s suddenly saying ,—</p>
    <p n="154"><said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ It was you , and not your sister , I find , that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with , when he was in this country . ”</said></p>
    <p n="155"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>hoped she had outlived the age of blushing ; but the age of emotion she certainly had not .</p>
    <p n="156"><said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married ? ”</said>added<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>.</p>
    <p n="157">She could now answer as she ought ; and was happy to feel , when<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>'s next words explained it to be Mr<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>of whom she spoke , that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother . She immediately felt how reasonable it was , that<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>should be thinking and speaking of<persName>Edward</persName>, and not of<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>; and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour 's present state with proper interest .</p>
    <p n="158">The rest was all tranquillity ; till , just as they were moving , she heard<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>say to<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>—</p>
    <p n="159"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ We are expecting a brother of<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>'s here soon ; I dare say you know him by name . ”</said></p>
    <p n="160">He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys , clinging to him like an old friend , and declaring he should not go ; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets , &amp; c ., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was left to persuade herself , as well as she could , that the same brother must still be in question . She could not , however , reach such a degree of certainty , as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house , where the Crofts had previously been calling .</p>
    <p n="161">The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage ; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot , the coach was beginning to be listened for , when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in . That she was coming to apologize , and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves , was the first black idea ; and<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>was quite ready to be affronted , when<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>made all right by saying , that she only came on foot , to leave more room for the harp , which was bringing in the carriage .</p>
    <p n="162"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ And I will tell you our reason , ”</said>she added ,<said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ and all about it . I am come on to give you notice , that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening , especially mamma ; she is thinking so much of poor<persName>Richard</persName>! And we agreed it would be best to have the harp , for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte . I will tell you why she is out of spirits . When the Crofts called this morning , ( they called here afterwards , did not they ? ) , they happened to say , that her brother ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, is just returned to England , or paid off , or something , and is coming to see them almost directly ; and most unluckily it came into mamma 's head , when they were gone , that<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>, or something very like it , was the name of poor<persName>Richard</persName>'s captain at one time ; I do not know when or where , but a great while before he died , poor fellow ! And upon looking over his letters and things , she found it was so , and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man , and her head is quite full of it , and of poor<persName>Richard</persName>! So we must be as merry as we can , that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things . ”</said></p>
    <p n="163">The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were , that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome , hopeless son ; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year ; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore ; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family , though quite as much as he deserved ; seldom heard of , and scarcely at all regretted , when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross , two years before .</p>
    <p n="164">He had , in fact , though his sisters were now doing all they could for him , by calling him “ poor<persName>Richard</persName>, ” been nothing better than a thick-headed , unfeeling , unprofitable Dick<persName corresp="#Musgrove">Musgrove</persName>, who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name , living or dead .</p>
    <p n="165">He had been several years at sea , and had , in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable , and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of , been six months on board Captain<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>'s frigate , the Laconia ; and from the Laconia he had , under the influence of his captain , written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence ; that is to say , the only two disinterested letters ; all the rest had been mere applications for money .</p>
    <p n="166">In each letter he had spoken well of his captain ; but yet , so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters , so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships , that it had made scarcely any impression at the time ; and that<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>should have been suddenly struck , this very day , with a recollection of the name of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>, as connected with her son , seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur .</p>
    <p n="167">She had gone to her letters , and found it all as she supposed ; and the re-perusal of these letters , after so long an interval , her poor son gone for ever , and all the strength of his faults forgotten , had affected her spirits exceedingly , and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had known on first hearing of his death .<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>was , in a lesser degree , affected likewise ; and when they reached the cottage , they were evidently in want , first , of being listened to anew on this subject , and afterwards , of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them .</p>
    <p n="168">To hear them talking so much of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, repeating his name so often , puzzling over past years , and at last ascertaining that it might , that it probably would , turn out to be the very same<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>whom they recollected meeting , once or twice , after their coming back from Clifton — a very fine young man — but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago , was a new sort of trial to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s nerves . She found , however , that it was one to which she must inure herself . Since he actually was expected in the country , she must teach herself to be insensible on such points . And not only did it appear that he was expected , and speedily , but the Musgroves , in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick , and very high respect for his character , stamped as it was by poor Dick 's having been six months under his care , and mentioning him in strong , though not perfectly well-spelt praise , as “ a fine dashing felow , only two perticular about the schoolmaster , ” were bent on introducing themselves , and seeking his acquaintance , as soon as they could hear of his arrival .</p>
    <p n="169">The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="7">
    <p n="170">A very few days more , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was known to be at Kellynch , and<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>had called on him , and come back warm in his praise , and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross , by the end of another week . It had been a great disappointment to<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>to find that no earlier day could be fixed , so impatient was he to shew his gratitude , by seeing<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>under his own roof , and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars . But a week must pass ; only a week , in<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s reckoning , and then , she supposed , they must meet ; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week .</p>
    <p n="171"><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>made a very early return to<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>'s civility , and she was all but calling there in the same half hour . She and<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>were actually setting forward for the Great House , where , as she afterwards learnt , they must inevitably have found him , when they were stopped by the eldest boy 's being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall . The child 's situation put the visit entirely aside ; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference , even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account .</p>
    <p n="172">His collar-bone was found to be dislocated , and such injury received in the back , as roused the most alarming ideas . It was an afternoon of distress , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had every thing to do at once ; the apothecary to send for , the father to have pursued and informed , the mother to support and keep from hysterics , the servants to control , the youngest child to banish , and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe ; besides sending , as soon as she recollected it , proper notice to the other house , which brought her an accession rather of frightened , enquiring companions , than of very useful assistants .</p>
    <p n="173">Her brother 's return was the first comfort ; he could take best care of his wife ; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary . Till he came and had examined the child , their apprehensions were the worse for being vague ; they suspected great injury , but knew not where ; but now the collar-bone was soon replaced , and though Mr Robinson felt and felt , and rubbed , and looked grave , and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt , still they were all to hope the best , and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind ; and then it was , just before they parted , that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew 's state , as to give the information of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s visit ; staying five minutes behind their father and mother , to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him , how much handsomer , how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance , who had been at all a favourite before . How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner , how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power , and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma 's farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow — actually on the morrow ; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner , as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought . And in short , he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace , that they could assure them all , their heads were both turned by him ; and off they ran , quite as full of glee as of love , and apparently more full of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>than of little<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>.</p>
    <p n="174">The same story and the same raptures were repeated , when the two girls came with their father , through the gloom of the evening , to make enquiries ; and<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir , could add his confirmation and praise , and hope there would be now no occasion for putting<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>off , and only be sorry to think that the cottage party , probably , would not like to leave the little boy , to give him the meeting .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Oh no ; as to leaving the little boy , ”</said>both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, in the joy of the escape , could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs .</p>
    <p n="175"><persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>, indeed , afterwards , shewed more of inclination ;<said who="#Charles_Musgrove">“ the child was going on so well , and he wished so much to be introduced to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, that , perhaps , he might join them in the evening ; he would not dine from home , but he might walk in for half an hour . ”</said>But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife , with “ Oh ! no , indeed ,<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, I cannot bear to have you go away . Only think if anything should happen ? ”</p>
    <p n="176">The child had a good night , and was going on well the next day . It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine ; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm , and<persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>began , consequently , to feel no necessity for longer confinement . The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible ; but what was there for a father to do ? This was quite a female case , and it would be highly absurd in him , who could be of no use at home , to shut himself up . His father very much wished him to meet<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, and there being no sufficient reason against it , he ought to go ; and it ended in his making a bold , public declaration , when he came in from shooting , of his meaning to dress directly , and dine at the other house .</p>
    <p n="177"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Nothing can be going on better than the child , ”</said>said he ;<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ so I told my father , just now , that I would come , and he thought me quite right . Your sister being with you , my love , I have no scruple at all . You would not like to leave him yourself , but you see I can be of no use .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>will send for me if anything is the matter . ”</said></p>
    <p n="178">Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain .<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>knew , from<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>'s manner of speaking , that he was quite determined on going , and that it would be of no use to teaze him . She said nothing , therefore , till he was out of the room , but as soon as there was only<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>to hear —</p>
    <p n="179"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves , with this poor sick child ; and not a creature coming near us all the evening ! I knew how it would be . This is always my luck . If there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it , and<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>is as bad as any of them . Very unfeeling ! I must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy . Talks of his being going on so well ! How does he know that he is going on well , or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence ? I did not think<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>would have been so unfeeling . So here he is to go away and enjoy himself , and because I am the poor mother , I am not to be allowed to stir ; and yet , I am sure , I am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child . My being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried . I am not at all equal to it . You saw how hysterical I was yesterday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="180"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm — of the shock . You will not be hysterical again . I dare say we shall have nothing to distress us . I perfectly understand Mr Robinson 's directions , and have no fears ; and indeed ,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, I cannot wonder at your husband . Nursing does not belong to a man ; it is not his province . A sick child is always the mother 's property : her own feelings generally make it so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="181"><said who="#Mary">“ I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother , but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick-room than<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill ; and you saw , this morning , that if I told him to keep quiet , he was sure to begin kicking about . I have not nerves for the sort of thing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="182"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ But , could you be comfortable yourself , to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="183"><said who="#Mary">“ Yes ; you see his papa can , and why should not I ? Jemima is so careful ; and she could send us word every hour how he was . I really think<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>might as well have told his father we would all come . I am not more alarmed about little<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>now than he is . I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday , but the case is very different to-day . ”</said></p>
    <p n="184"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Well , if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself , suppose you were to go , as well as your husband . Leave little<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>to my care . Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>cannot think it wrong while I remain with him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="185"><said who="#Mary">“ Are you serious ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, her eyes brightening .<said who="#Mary">“ Dear me ! that 's a very good thought , very good , indeed . To be sure , I may just as well go as not , for I am of no use at home — am I ? and it only harasses me . You , who have not a mother 's feelings , are a great deal the properest person . You can make little<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>do anything ; he always minds you at a word . It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima . Oh ! I shall certainly go ; I am sure I ought if I can , quite as much as<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, and I know you do not mind being left alone . An excellent thought of yours , indeed ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>. I will go and tell<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, and get ready directly . You can send for us , you know , at a moment 's notice , if anything is the matter ; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you . I should not go , you may be sure , if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child . ”</said></p>
    <p n="186">The next moment she was tapping at her husband 's dressing-room door , and as<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>followed her up stairs , she was in time for the whole conversation , which began with<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s saying , in a tone of great exultation —</p>
    <p n="187"><said who="#Mary">“ I mean to go with you ,<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, for I am of no more use at home than you are . If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child , I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>will stay ;<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>undertakes to stay at home and take care of him . It is<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s own proposal , and so I shall go with you , which will be a great deal better , for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday . ”</said></p>
    <p n="188"><said who="#Charles">“ This is very kind of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, ”</said>was her husband 's answer ,<said who="#Charles">“ and I should be very glad to have you go ; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself , to nurse our sick child . ”</said></p>
    <p n="189"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was now at hand to take up her own cause , and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him , where conviction was at least very agreeable , he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone , though he still wanted her to join them in the evening , when the child might be at rest for the night , and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her , but she was quite unpersuadable ; and this being the case , she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits . They were gone , she hoped , to be happy , however oddly constructed such happiness might seem ; as for herself , she was left with as many sensations of comfort , as were , perhaps , ever likely to be hers . She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child ; and what was it to her if<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>were only half a mile distant , making himself agreeable to others ?</p>
    <p n="190">She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting . Perhaps indifferent , if indifference could exist under such circumstances . He must be either indifferent or unwilling . Had he wished ever to see her again , he need not have waited till this time ; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago , when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting .</p>
    <p n="191">Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance , and their visit in general . There had been music , singing , talking , laughing , all that was most agreeable ; charming manners in<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, no shyness or reserve ; they seemed all to know each other perfectly , and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>. He was to come to breakfast , but not at the Cottage , though that had been proposed at first ; but then he had been pressed to come to the Great House instead , and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs<persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>'s way , on account of the child , and therefore , somehow , they hardly knew how , it ended in<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>'s being to meet him to breakfast at his father 's .</p>
    <p n="192"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>understood it . He wished to avoid seeing her . He had inquired after her , she found , slightly , as might suit a former slight acquaintance , seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged , actuated , perhaps , by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet .</p>
    <p n="193">The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house , and on the morrow the difference was so great that<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>were not more than beginning breakfast when<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>came in to say that they were just setting off , that he was come for his dogs , that his sisters were following with<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>; his sisters meaning to visit<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>and the child , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient ; and though<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>had answered for the child 's being in no such state as could make it inconvenient ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice .</p>
    <p n="194"><persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over . And it was soon over . In two minutes after<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>'s preparation , the others appeared ; they were in the drawing-room . Her eye half met<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s , a bow , a curtsey passed ; she heard his voice ; he talked to<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, said all that was right , said something to the Miss Musgroves , enough to mark an easy footing ; the room seemed full , full of persons and voices , but a few minutes ended it .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>shewed himself at the window , all was ready , their visitor had bowed and was gone , the Miss Musgroves were gone too , suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen : the room was cleared , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>might finish her breakfast as she could .</p>
    <p n="195"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ It is over ! it is over ! ”</said>she repeated to herself again and again , in nervous gratitude .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ The worst is over ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="196"><persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>talked , but she could not attend . She had seen him . They had met . They had been once more in the same room .</p>
    <p n="197">Soon , however , she began to reason with herself , and try to be feeling less . Eight years , almost eight years had passed , since all had been given up . How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness ! What might not eight years do ? Events of every description , changes , alienations , removals — all , all must be comprised in it , and oblivion of the past — how natural , how certain too ! It included nearly a third part of her own life .</p>
    <p n="198">Alas ! with all her reasoning , she found , that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing .</p>
    <p n="199">Now , how were his sentiments to be read ? Was this like wishing to avoid her ? And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question .</p>
    <p n="200">On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented , she was soon spared all suspense ; for , after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>:—</p>
    <p n="201"><said who="#Mary">“<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>is not very gallant by you ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, though he was so attentive to me .<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>asked him what he thought of you , when they went away , and he said , ‘ You were so altered he should not have known you again . ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="202"><persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>had no feelings to make her respect her sister 's in a common way , but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound .</p>
    <p n="203"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Altered beyond his knowledge . ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>fully submitted , in silent , deep mortification . Doubtless it was so , and she could take no revenge , for he was not altered , or not for the worse . She had already acknowledged it to herself , and she could not think differently , let him think of her as he would . No : the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing , manly , open look , in no respect lessening his personal advantages . She had seen the same<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>.</p>
    <p n="204"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ So altered that he should not have known her again ! ”</said>These were words which could not but dwell with her . Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them . They were of sobering tendency ; they allayed agitation ; they composed , and consequently must make her happier .</p>
    <p n="205"><persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>had used such words , or something like them , but without an idea that they would be carried round to her . He had thought her wretchedly altered , and in the first moment of appeal , had spoken as he felt . He had not forgiven<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>. She had used him ill , deserted and disappointed him ; and worse , she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so , which his own decided , confident temper could not endure . She had given him up to oblige others . It had been the effect of over-persuasion . It had been weakness and timidity .</p>
    <p n="206">He had been most warmly attached to her , and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal ; but , except from some natural sensation of curiosity , he had no desire of meeting her again . Her power with him was gone for ever .</p>
    <p n="207">It was now his object to marry . He was rich , and being turned on shore , fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted ; actually looking round , ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow . He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves , if they could catch it ; a heart , in short , for any pleasing young woman who came in his way , excepting<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>. This was his only secret exception , when he said to his sister , in answer to her suppositions :—</p>
    <p n="208"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Yes , here I am , Sophia , quite ready to make a foolish match . Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking . A little beauty , and a few smiles , and a few compliments to the navy , and I am a lost man . Should not this be enough for a sailor , who has had no society among women to make him nice ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="209">He said it , she knew , to be contradicted . His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>was not out of his thoughts , when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with .<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ A strong mind , with sweetness of manner , ”</said>made the first and the last of the description .</p>
    <p n="210"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ That is the woman I want , ”</said>said he .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with , but it must not be much . If I am a fool , I shall be a fool indeed , for I have thought on the subject more than most men . ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="8">
    <p n="211">From this time<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>were repeatedly in the same circle . They were soon dining in company together at<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>'s , for the little boy 's state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself ; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings .</p>
    <p n="212">Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof ; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each ; they could not but be reverted to ; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him , in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth . His profession qualified him , his disposition lead him , to talk ; and “ That was in the year six ; ” “ That happened before I went to sea in the year six , ” occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together : and though his voice did not falter , and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>felt the utter impossibility , from her knowledge of his mind , that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself . There must be the same immediate association of thought , though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain .</p>
    <p n="213">They had no conversation together , no intercourse but what the commonest civility required . Once so much to each other ! Now nothing ! There had been a time , when of all the large party now filling the drawing-room at Uppercross , they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another . With the exception , perhaps , of<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>, who seemed particularly attached and happy , (<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples ) , there could have been no two hearts so open , no tastes so similar , no feelings so in unison , no countenances so beloved . Now they were as strangers ; nay , worse than strangers , for they could never become acquainted . It was a perpetual estrangement .</p>
    <p n="214">When he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind . There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party ; and he was very much questioned , and especially by the two Miss Musgroves , who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him , as to the manner of living on board , daily regulations , food , hours , &amp; c ., and their surprise at his accounts , at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable , drew from him some pleasant ridicule , which reminded<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>of the early days when she too had been ignorant , and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat , or any cook to dress it if there were , or any servant to wait , or any knife and fork to use .</p>
    <p n="215">From thus listening and thinking , she was roused by a whisper of<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>'s who , overcome by fond regrets , could not help saying —</p>
    <p n="216"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ Ah !<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne</persName>, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son , I dare say he would have been just such another by this time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="217"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>suppressed a smile , and listened kindly , while<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>relieved her heart a little more ; and for a few minutes , therefore , could not keep pace with the conversation of the others .</p>
    <p n="218">When she could let her attention take its natural course again , she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List ( their own navy list , the first that had ever been at Uppercross ) , and sitting down together to pore over it , with the professed view of finding out the ships that<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>had commanded .</p>
    <p n="219"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Your first was the Asp , I remember ; we will look for the Asp . ”</said></p>
    <p n="220"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ You will not find her there . Quite worn out and broken up . I was the last man who commanded her . Hardly fit for service then . Reported fit for home service for a year or two , and so I was sent off to the West Indies . ”</said></p>
    <p n="221">The girls looked all amazement .</p>
    <p n="222"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ The Admiralty , ”</said>he continued ,<said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ entertain themselves now and then , with sending a few hundred men to sea , in a ship not fit to be employed . But they have a great many to provide for ; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not , it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="223"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ Phoo ! phoo ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>,<said who="#the_Admiral">“ what stuff these young fellows talk ! Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day . For an old built sloop , you would not see her equal . Lucky fellow to get her ! He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time . Lucky fellow to get anything so soon , with no more interest than his . ”</said></p>
    <p n="224"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ I felt my luck ,<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>, I assure you ; ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, seriously .<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire . It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea ; a very great object , I wanted to be doing something . ”</said></p>
    <p n="225"><said who="#Admiral">“ To be sure you did . What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together ? If a man had not a wife , he soon wants to be afloat again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="226"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ But ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>,<said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp , to see what an old thing they had given you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="227"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ I knew pretty well what she was before that day ; ”</said>said he , smiling .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse , which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember , and which at last , on some very wet day , is lent to yourself . Ah ! she was a dear old Asp to me . She did all that I wanted . I knew she would . I knew that we should either go to the bottom together , or that she would be the making of me ; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her ; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining , I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn , to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted . I brought her into Plymouth ; and here another instance of luck . We had not been six hours in the Sound , when a gale came on , which lasted four days and nights , and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time ; our touch with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition . Four-and-twenty hours later , and I should only have been a gallant<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers ; and being lost in only a sloop , nobody would have thought about me . ”</said><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s shudderings were to herself alone ; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere , in their exclamations of pity and horror .</p>
    <p n="228"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ And so then , I suppose , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>, in a low voice , as if thinking aloud , “ so then he went away to the Laconia , and there he met with our poor boy .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, my dear , ” ( beckoning him to her ) ,<said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ do ask<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>where it was he first met with your poor brother . I always forgot . ”</said></p>
    <p n="229"><said who="#Charles">“ It was at Gibraltar , mother , I know . Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar , with a recommendation from his former captain to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="230"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ Oh ! but ,<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, tell<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me , for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend . ”</said></p>
    <p n="231"><persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case , only nodded in reply , and walked away .</p>
    <p n="232">The girls were now hunting for the Laconia ; and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble , and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate , and present non-commissioned class , observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had .</p>
    <p n="233"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Ah ! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia ! How fast I made money in her . A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands . Poor<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>, sister ! You know how much he wanted money : worse than myself . He had a wife . Excellent fellow . I shall never forget his happiness . He felt it all , so much for her sake . I wished for him again the next summer , when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean . ”</said></p>
    <p n="234"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ And I am sure , Sir , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>,<said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ it was a lucky day for us , when you were put captain into that ship . We shall never forget what you did . ”</said></p>
    <p n="235">Her feelings made her speak low ; and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, hearing only in part , and probably not having Dick<persName corresp="#Musgrove">Musgrove</persName>at all near his thoughts , looked rather in suspense , and as if waiting for more .</p>
    <p n="236"><said who="#Musgrove">“ My brother , ”</said>whispered one of the girls ;<said who="#Musgrove">“ mamma is thinking of poor<persName>Richard</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="237"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ Poor dear fellow ! ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>;<said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ he was grown so steady , and such an excellent correspondent , while he was under your care ! Ah ! it would have been a happy thing , if he had never left you . I assure you ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, we are very sorry he ever left you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="238">There was a momentary expression in<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s face at this speech , a certain glance of his bright eye , and curl of his handsome mouth , which convinced<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, that instead of sharing in<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>'s kind wishes , as to her son , he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him ; but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself ; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious , and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa , on which she and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>were sitting , took a place by the latter , and entered into conversation with her , in a low voice , about her son , doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace , as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent 's feelings .</p>
    <p n="239">They were actually on the same sofa , for<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>had most readily made room for him ; they were divided only by<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>. It was no insignificant barrier , indeed .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>was of a comfortable , substantial size , infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour , than tenderness and sentiment ; and while the agitations of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s slender form , and pensive face , may be considered as very completely screened ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son , whom alive nobody had cared for .</p>
    <p n="240">Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions . A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction , as the most graceful set of limbs in the world . But , fair or not fair , there are unbecoming conjunctions , which reason will patronize in vain — which taste cannot tolerate — which ridicule will seize .</p>
    <p n="241"><persName corresp="#the_Admiral">The Admiral</persName>, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him , being called to order by his wife , now came up to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, and without any observation of what he might be interrupting , thinking only of his own thoughts , began with —</p>
    <p n="242"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ If you had been a week later at Lisbon , last spring ,<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>, you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>Grierson and her daughters . ”</said></p>
    <p n="243"><said who="#Frederick">“ Should I ? I am glad I was not a week later then . ”</said></p>
    <p n="244"><persName corresp="#the_Admiral">The Admiral</persName>abused him for his want of gallantry . He defended himself ; though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his , excepting for a ball , or a visit , which a few hours might comprehend .</p>
    <p n="245"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ But , if I know myself , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#the_Admiral">“ this is from no want of gallantry towards them . It is rather from feeling how impossible it is , with all one 's efforts , and all one 's sacrifices , to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have . There can be no want of gallantry ,<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>, in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high , and this is what I do . I hate to hear of women on board , or to see them on board ; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere , if I can help it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="246">This brought his sister upon him .</p>
    <p n="247"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ Oh !<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>! But I cannot believe it of you .— All idle refinement !— Women may be as comfortable on board , as in the best house in England . I believe I have lived as much on board as most women , and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war . I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me , even at<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>, ”</said>( with a kind bow to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>) ,<said who="#the_Admiral">“ beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in ; and they have been five altogether . ”</said></p>
    <p n="248"><said who="#Frederick">“ Nothing to the purpose , ”</said>replied her brother .<said who="#Frederick">“ You were living with your husband , and were the only woman on board . ”</said></p>
    <p n="249"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ But you , yourself , brought<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>, her sister , her cousin , and three children , round from Portsmouth to Plymouth . Where was this superfine , extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="250"><said who="#Frederick">“ All merged in my friendship , Sophia . I would assist any brother officer 's wife that I could , and I would bring anything of<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>'s from the world 's end , if he wanted it . But do not imagine that I did not feel it an evil in itself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="251"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ Depend upon it , they were all perfectly comfortable . ”</said></p>
    <p n="252"><said who="#Frederick">“ I might not like them the better for that perhaps . Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board . ”</said></p>
    <p n="253"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>, you are talking quite idly . Pray , what would become of us poor sailors ’ wives , who often want to be conveyed to one port or another , after our husbands , if everybody had your feelings ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="254"><said who="#Frederick">“ My feelings , you see , did not prevent my taking<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>and all her family to Plymouth . ”</said></p>
    <p n="255"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman , and as if women were all fine ladies , instead of rational creatures . We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days . ”</said></p>
    <p n="256"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ Ah ! my dear , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>,<said who="#the_Admiral">“ when he had got a wife , he will sing a different tune . When he is married , if we have the good luck to live to another war , we shall see him do as you and I , and a great many others , have done . We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife . ”</said></p>
    <p n="257"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Ay , that we shall . ”</said></p>
    <p n="258"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Now I have done , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>.<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ When once married people begin to attack me with ,— ‘ Oh ! you will think very differently , when you are married . ’ I can only say , ‘ No , I shall not ; ’ and then they say again , ‘ Yes , you will , ’ and there is an end of it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="259">He got up and moved away .</p>
    <p n="260"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ What a great traveller you must have been , ma'am ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>to<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>.</p>
    <p n="261"><said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ Pretty well , ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage ; though many women have done more . I have crossed the Atlantic four times , and have been once to the East Indies , and back again , and only once ; besides being in different places about home : Cork , and Lisbon , and Gibraltar . But I never went beyond the Streights , and never was in the West Indies . We do not call Bermuda or Bahama , you know , the West Indies . ”</said></p>
    <p n="262"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>had not a word to say in dissent ; she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life .</p>
    <p n="263"><said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ And I do assure you , ma'am , ”</said>pursued<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>,<said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war ; I speak , you know , of the higher rates . When you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and I can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship . While we were together , you know , there was nothing to be feared . Thank God ! I have always been blessed with excellent health , and no climate disagrees with me . A little disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea , but never knew what sickness was afterwards . The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind , the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell , or had any ideas of danger , was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal , when<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>( Captain Croft then ) was in the North Seas . I lived in perpetual fright at that time , and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself , or when I should hear from him next ; but as long as we could be together , nothing ever ailed me , and I never met with the smallest inconvenience . ”</said></p>
    <p n="264"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ Aye , to be sure . Yes , indeed , oh yes ! I am quite of your opinion ,<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>, ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>'s hearty answer .<said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ There is nothing so bad as a separation . I am quite of your opinion . I know what it is , for<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>always attends the assizes , and I am so glad when they are over , and he is safe back again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="265">The evening ended with dancing . On its being proposed ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>offered her services , as usual ; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument , she was extremely glad to be employed , and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved .</p>
    <p n="266">It was a merry , joyous party , and no one seemed in higher spirits than<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>. She felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference , and especially the attention of all the young women , could do . The Miss Hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals . If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ?</p>
    <p n="267">These were some of the thoughts which occupied<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, while her fingers were mechanically at work , proceeding for half an hour together , equally without error , and without consciousness . Once she felt that he was looking at herself , observing her altered features , perhaps , trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him ; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her ; she was hardly aware of it , till she heard the answer ; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>never danced ? The answer was ,<said who="#Miss_Elliot">“ Oh , no ; never ; she has quite given up dancing . She had rather play . She is never tired of playing . ”</said>Once , too , he spoke to her . She had left the instrument on the dancing being over , and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of . Unintentionally she returned to that part of the room ; he saw her , and , instantly rising , said , with studied politeness —</p>
    <p n="268"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I beg your pardon , madam , this is your seat ; ”</said>and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative , he was not to be induced to sit down again .</p>
    <p n="269"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>did not wish for more of such looks and speeches . His cold politeness , his ceremonious grace , were worse than anything .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="9">
    <p n="270"><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was come to Kellynch as to a home , to stay as long as he liked , being as thoroughly the object of<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>'s fraternal kindness as of his wife 's . He had intended , on first arriving , to proceed very soon into Shropshire , and visit the brother settled in that country , but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off . There was so much of friendliness , and of flattery , and of everything most bewitching in his reception there ; the old were so hospitable , the young so agreeable , that he could not but resolve to remain where he was , and take all the charms and perfections of<persName>Edward</persName>'s wife upon credit a little longer .</p>
    <p n="271">It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day . The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come , particularly in the morning , when he had no companion at home , for<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>were generally out of doors together , interesting themselves in their new possessions , their grass , and their sheep , and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person , or driving out in a gig , lately added to their establishment .</p>
    <p n="272">Hitherto there had been but one opinion of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>among the Musgroves and their dependencies . It was unvarying , warm admiration everywhere ; but this intimate footing was not more than established , when a certain<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>returned among them , to be a good deal disturbed by it , and to think<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>very much in the way .</p>
    <p n="273"><persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>was the eldest of all the cousins , and a very amiable , pleasing young man , between whom and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s introduction . He was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father 's house , only two miles from Uppercross . A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period , and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners , and of seeing<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>.</p>
    <p n="274"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>and Mrs<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Hayter</persName>were sisters . They had each had money , but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence . Mr<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Hayter</persName>had some property of his own , but it was insignificant compared with<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>'s ; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country , the young Hayters would , from their parents ’ inferior , retired , and unpolished way of living , and their own defective education , have been hardly in any class at all , but for their connexion with Uppercross , this eldest son of course excepted , who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman , and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest .</p>
    <p n="275">The two families had always been on excellent terms , there being no pride on one side , and no envy on the other , and only such a consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves , as made them pleased to improve their cousins .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>'s attentions to<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation .<said who="#Charles">“ It would not be a great match for her ; but if<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>liked him , ”</said>— and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>did seem to like him .</p>
    <p n="276"><persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>fully thought so herself , before<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>came ; but from that time Cousin<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>had been very much forgotten .</p>
    <p n="277">Which of the two sisters was preferred by<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was as yet quite doubtful , as far as<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s observation reached .<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>was perhaps the prettiest ,<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>had the higher spirits ; and she knew not now , whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him .</p>
    <p n="278">Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>, either from seeing little , or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters , and of all the young men who came near them , seemed to leave everything to take its chance . There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion-house ; but it was different at the Cottage : the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder ; and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves ’ company , and<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>had but just reappeared , when<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister , as to which was the one liked best .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>gave it for<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>for<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful .</p>
    <p n="279"><persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>“ had never seen a pleasanter man in his life ; and from what he had once heard<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>himself say , was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war . Here was a fortune at once ; besides which , there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war ; and he was sure<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy . Oh ! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters . ”</p>
    <p n="280"><said who="#Mary">“ Upon my word it would , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>.<said who="#Mary">“ Dear me ! If he should rise to any very great honours ! If he should ever be made a baronet ! ‘ Lady<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>’ sounds very well . That would be a noble thing , indeed , for<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>! She would take place of me then , and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>would not dislike that . Sir<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>and Lady<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>! It would be but a new creation , however , and I never think much of your new creations . ”</said></p>
    <p n="281">It suited<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>best to think<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>the one preferred on the very account of<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>, whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to . She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters , and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed — very sad for herself and her children .</p>
    <p n="282"><said who="#Charles_Hayter">“ You know , ”</said>said she ,<said>“ I cannot think him at all a fit match for<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made , she has no right to throw herself away . I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family , and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them . And , pray , who is<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>? Nothing but a country curate . A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross . ”</said></p>
    <p n="283">Her husband , however , would not agree with her here ; for besides having a regard for his cousin ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>was an eldest son , and he saw things as an eldest son himself .</p>
    <p n="284"><said who="#Charles_Hayter">“ Now you are talking nonsense ,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, ”</said>was therefore his answer .<said>“ It would not be a great match for<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, but<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>has a very fair chance , through the Spicers , of getting something from the Bishop in the course of a year or two ; and you will please to remember , that he is the eldest son ; whenever my uncle dies , he steps into very pretty property . The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres , besides the farm near Taunton , which is some of the best land in the country . I grant you , that any of them but<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>would be a very shocking match for<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, and indeed it could not be ; he is the only one that could be possible ; but he is a very good-natured , good sort of a fellow ; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands , he will make a different sort of place of it , and live in a very different sort of way ; and with that property , he will never be a contemptible man — good , freehold property . No , no ;<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>might do worse than marry<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>; and if she has him , and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>can get<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, I shall be very well satisfied . ”</said></p>
    <p n="285"><said who="#Mary">“<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>may say what he pleases , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, as soon as he was out of the room ,<said who="#Mary">“ but it would be shocking to have<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>marry<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>; a very bad thing for her , and still worse for me ; and therefore it is very much to be wished that<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>may soon put him quite out of her head , and I have very little doubt that he has . She took hardly any notice of<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>yesterday . I wish you had been there to see her behaviour . And as to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s liking<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>as well as<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, it is nonsense to say so ; for he certainly does like<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>a great deal the best . But<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>is so positive ! I wish you had been with us yesterday , for then you might have decided between us ; and I am sure you would have thought as I did , unless you had been determined to give it against me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="286">A dinner at<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>'s had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>; but she had staid at home , under the mixed plea of a headache of her own , and some return of indisposition in little<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>. She had thought only of avoiding<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening .</p>
    <p n="287">As to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s views , she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister , or impeaching his own honour , than that he should prefer<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>to<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, or<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>to<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>. Either of them would , in all probability , make him an affectionate , good-humoured wife . With regard to<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>, she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman , and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned ; but if<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings , the alternation could not be understood too soon .</p>
    <p n="288"><persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin 's behaviour . She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was to be regarded as the probable cause . He had been absent only two Sundays , and when they parted , had left her interested , even to the height of his wishes , in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy , and obtaining that of Uppercross instead . It had then seemed the object nearest her heart , that<persName>Dr Shirley</persName>, the rector , who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office , but was now growing too infirm for many of them , should be quite fixed on engaging a curate ; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford , and should give<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>the promise of it . The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross , instead of going six miles another way ; of his having , in every respect , a better curacy ; of his belonging to their dear<persName>Dr Shirley</persName>, and of dear , good<persName>Dr Shirley</persName>'s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue , had been a great deal , even to<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, but had been almost everything to<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>. When he came back , alas ! the zeal of the business was gone by .<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with<persName>Dr Shirley</persName>: she was at a window , looking out for<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>; and even<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>had at best only a divided attention to give , and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation .</p>
    <p n="289"><said who="#Henrietta">“ Well , I am very glad indeed : but I always thought you would have it ; I always thought you sure . It did not appear to me that — in short , you know ,<persName>Dr Shirley</persName>must have a curate , and you had secured his promise . Is he coming ,<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="290">One morning , very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves , at which<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had not been present ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>walked into the drawing-room at the Cottage , where were only herself and the little invalid<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, who was lying on the sofa .</p>
    <p n="291">The surprise of finding himself almost alone with<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>, deprived his manners of their usual composure : he started , and could only say , “ I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here :<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>told me I should find them here , ” before he walked to the window to recollect himself , and feel how he ought to behave .</p>
    <p n="292"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ They are up stairs with my sister : they will be down in a few moments , I dare say , ”</said>had been<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s reply , in all the confusion that was natural ; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him , she would have been out of the room the next moment , and released<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>as well as herself .</p>
    <p n="293">He continued at the window ; and after calmly and politely saying , “ I hope the little boy is better , ” was silent .</p>
    <p n="294">She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa , and remain there to satisfy her patient ; and thus they continued a few minutes , when , to her very great satisfaction , she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule . She hoped , on turning her head , to see the master of the house ; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy —<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>, probably not at all better pleased by the sight of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>than<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>had been by the sight of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="295">She only attempted to say ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ How do you do ? Will you not sit down ? The others will be here presently . ”</said></p>
    <p n="296"><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, however , came from his window , apparently not ill-disposed for conversation ; but<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table , and taking up the newspaper ; and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>returned to his window .</p>
    <p n="297">Another minute brought another addition . The younger boy , a remarkable stout , forward child , of two years old , having got the door opened for him by some one without , made his determined appearance among them , and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on , and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away .</p>
    <p n="298">There being nothing to eat , he could only have some play ; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother , he began to fasten himself upon her , as she knelt , in such a way that , busy as she was about<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, she could not shake him off . She spoke to him , ordered , entreated , and insisted in vain . Once she did contrive to push him away , but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly .</p>
    <p n="299"><said who="#Charles">“<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Walter</persName>, ”</said>said she ,<said who="#Charles">“ get down this moment . You are extremely troublesome . I am very angry with you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="300"><said who="#Charles_Hayter">“<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Walter</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>,<said who="#Charles_Hayter">“ why do you not do as you are bid ? Do not you hear your aunt speak ? Come to me ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Walter</persName>, come to cousin<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="301">But not a bit did<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Walter</persName>stir .</p>
    <p n="302">In another moment , however , she found herself in the state of being released from him ; some one was taking him from her , though he had bent down her head so much , that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck , and he was resolutely borne away , before she knew that<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>had done it .</p>
    <p n="303">Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless . She could not even thank him . She could only hang over little<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, with most disordered feelings . His kindness in stepping forward to her relief , the manner , the silence in which it had passed , the little particulars of the circumstance , with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child , that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks , and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants , produced such a confusion of varying , but very painful agitation , as she could not recover from , till enabled by the entrance of<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares , and leave the room . She could not stay . It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four — they were now altogether ; but she could stay for none of it . It was evident that<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>was not well inclined towards<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>. She had a strong impression of his having said , in a vext tone of voice , after<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s interference , “ You ought to have minded me ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Walter</persName>; I told you not to teaze your aunt ; ” and could comprehend his regretting that<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>should do what he ought to have done himself . But neither<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>'s feelings , nor anybody 's feelings , could interest her , till she had a little better arranged her own . She was ashamed of herself , quite ashamed of being so nervous , so overcome by such a trifle ; but so it was , and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="10">
    <p n="304">Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion , though too wise to acknowledge as much at home , where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife ; for while she considered<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>to be rather the favourite , she could not but think , as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience , that<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was not in love with either . They were more in love with him ; yet there it was not love . It was a little fever of admiration ; but it might , probably must , end in love with some .<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>seemed aware of being slighted , and yet<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>had sometimes the air of being divided between them .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about , and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to . She did not attribute guile to any . It was the highest satisfaction to her to believe<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning . There was no triumph , no pitiful triumph in his manner . He had , probably , never heard , and never thought of any claims of<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>. He was only wrong in accepting the attentions ( for accepting must be the word ) of two young women at once .</p>
    <p n="305">After a short struggle , however ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>seemed to quit the field . Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross ; a most decided change . He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner ; and having been found on the occasion by<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>with some large books before him , Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>were sure all could not be right , and talked , with grave faces , of his studying himself to death . It was<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him to-morrow .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could only feel that<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>was wise .</p>
    <p n="306">One morning , about this time<persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>being gone a-shooting together , as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion-house .</p>
    <p n="307">It was a very fine November day , and the Miss Musgroves came through the little grounds , and stopped for no other purpose than to say , that they were going to take a long walk , and therefore concluded<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>could not like to go with them ; and when<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>immediately replied , with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker , “ Oh , yes , I should like to join you very much , I am very fond of a long walk ; ”<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>felt persuaded , by the looks of the two girls , that it was precisely what they did not wish , and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce , of everything being to be communicated , and everything being to be done together , however undesired and inconvenient . She tried to dissuade<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>from going , but in vain ; and that being the case , thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves ’ much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise , as she might be useful in turning back with her sister , and lessening the interference in any plan of their own .</p>
    <p n="308"><said who="#Mary">“ I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, as she went up stairs .<said who="#Mary">“ Everybody is always supposing that I am not a good walker ; and yet they would not have been pleased , if we had refused to join them . When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us , how can one say no ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="309">Just as they were setting off , the gentlemen returned . They had taken out a young dog , who had spoilt their sport , and sent them back early . Their time and strength , and spirits , were , therefore , exactly ready for this walk , and they entered into it with pleasure . Could<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>have foreseen such a junction , she would have staid at home ; but , from some feelings of interest and curiosity , she fancied now that it was too late to retract , and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves , who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance .</p>
    <p n="310"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s object was , not to be in the way of anybody ; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary , to keep with her brother and sister . Her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day , from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves , and withered hedges , and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn , that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness , that season which had drawn from every poet , worthy of being read , some attempt at description , or some lines of feeling . She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations ; but it was not possible , that when within reach of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves , she should not try to hear it ; yet she caught little very remarkable . It was mere lively chat , such as any young persons , on an intimate footing , might fall into . He was more engaged with<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>than with<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>.<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister . This distinction appeared to increase , and there was one speech of<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>'s which struck her . After one of the many praises of the day , which were continually bursting forth ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>added :—</p>
    <p n="311"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ What glorious weather for<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>and my sister ! They meant to take a long drive this morning ; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills . They talked of coming into this side of the country . I wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day . Oh ! it does happen very often , I assure you ; but my sister makes nothing of it ; she would as lieve be tossed out as not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="312"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ Ah ! You make the most of it , I know , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>,<said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ but if it were really so , I should do just the same in her place . If I loved a man , as she loves<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>, I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else . ”</said></p>
    <p n="313">It was spoken with enthusiasm .</p>
    <p n="314"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ Had you ? ”</said>cried he , catching the same tone ;<said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ I honour you ! ”</said>And there was silence between them for a little while .</p>
    <p n="315"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not immediately fall into a quotation again . The sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by , unless some tender sonnet , fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year , with declining happiness , and the images of youth and hope , and spring , all gone together , blessed her memory . She roused herself to say , as they struck by order into another path ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop ? ”</said>But nobody heard , or , at least , nobody answered her .</p>
    <p n="316">Winthrop , however , or its environs — for young men are , sometimes to be met with , strolling about near home — was their destination ; and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures , where the ploughs at work , and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence , and meaning to have spring again , they gained the summit of the most considerable hill , which parted Uppercross and Winthrop , and soon commanded a full view of the latter , at the foot of the hill on the other side .</p>
    <p n="317">Winthrop , without beauty and without dignity , was stretched before them an indifferent house , standing low , and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farm-yard .</p>
    <p n="318"><persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>exclaimed ,<said who="#Mary">“ Bless me ! here is Winthrop . I declare I had no idea ! Well now , I think we had better turn back ; I am excessively tired . ”</said></p>
    <p n="319"><persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>wished ; but “ No ! ” said<persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>, and “ No , no ! ” cried<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>more eagerly , and taking her sister aside , seemed to be arguing the matter warmly .</p>
    <p n="320"><persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, in the meanwhile , was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt , now that he was so near ; and very evidently , though more fearfully , trying to induce his wife to go too . But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength ; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop , as she felt so tired , she resolutely answered , “ Oh ! no , indeed ! walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good ; ” and , in short , her look and manner declared , that go she would not .</p>
    <p n="321">After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations , it was settled between<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>and his two sisters , that he and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>should just run down for a few minutes , to see their aunt and cousins , while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill .<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>seemed the principal arranger of the plan ; and , as she went a little way with them , down the hill , still talking to<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her , and saying to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>—</p>
    <p n="322"><said who="#Mary">“ It is very unpleasant , having such connexions ! But , I assure you , I have never been in the house above twice in my life . ”</said></p>
    <p n="323">She received no other answer , than an artificial , assenting smile , followed by a contemptuous glance , as he turned away , which<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>perfectly knew the meaning of .</p>
    <p n="324">The brow of the hill , where they remained , was a cheerful spot :<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>returned ; and<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile , was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her ; but when<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>drew<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>away , to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row , and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound ,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>was happy no longer ; she quarrelled with her own seat , was sure<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>had got a much better somewhere , and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also . She turned through the same gate , but could not see them .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>found a nice seat for her , on a dry sunny bank , under the hedge-row , in which she had no doubt of their still being , in some spot or other .<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>sat down for a moment , but it would not do ; she was sure<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>had found a better seat somewhere else , and she would go on till she overtook her .</p>
    <p n="325"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, really tired herself , was glad to sit down ; and she very soon heard<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>in the hedge-row , behind her , as if making their way back along the rough , wild sort of channel , down the centre . They were speaking as they drew near .<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>'s voice was the first distinguished . She seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech . What<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>first heard was —</p>
    <p n="326"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ And so , I made her go . I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense . What ! would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do , and that I knew to be right , by the airs and interference of such a person , or of any person I may say ? No , I have no idea of being so easily persuaded . When I have made up my mind , I have made it ; and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="327"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ She would have turned back then , but for you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="328"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ She would indeed . I am almost ashamed to say it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="329"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ Happy for her , to have such a mind as yours at hand ! After the hints you gave just now , which did but confirm my own observations , the last time I was in company with him , I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on . I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question ; and woe betide him , and her too , when it comes to things of consequence , when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind , if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this . Your sister is an amiable creature ; but yours is the character of decision and firmness , I see . If you value her conduct or happiness , infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can . But this , no doubt , you have been always doing . It is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character , that no influence over it can be depended on . You are never sure of a good impression being durable ; everybody may sway it . Let those who would be happy be firm . Here is a nut , ”</said>said he , catching one down from an upper bough , “ to exemplify : a beautiful glossy nut , which , blessed with original strength , has outlived all the storms of autumn . Not a puncture , not a weak spot anywhere . This nut , ” he continued , with playful solemnity ,<said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot , is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of . ”</said>Then returning to his former earnest tone —<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ My first wish for all whom I am interested in , is that they should be firm . If<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>would be beautiful and happy in her November of life , she will cherish all her present powers of mind . ”</said></p>
    <p n="330">He had done , and was unanswered . It would have surprised<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>if<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>could have readily answered such a speech : words of such interest , spoken with such serious warmth ! She could imagine what<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>was feeling . For herself , she feared to move , lest she should be seen . While she remained , a bush of low rambling holly protected her , and they were moving on . Before they were beyond her hearing , however ,<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>spoke again .</p>
    <p n="331"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>is good-natured enough in many respects , ”</said>said she ;<said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride — the Elliot pride . She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride . We do so wish that<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>had married<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>instead . I suppose you know he wanted to marry<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="332">After a moment 's pause ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>said —</p>
    <p n="333"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Do you mean that she refused him ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="334"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ Oh ! yes ; certainly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="335"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ When did that happen ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="336"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ I do not exactly know , for<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>. I wish she had accepted him . We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s doing , that she did not . They think<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>might not be learned and bookish enough to please<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, and that therefore , she persuaded<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>to refuse him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="337">The sounds were retreating , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>distinguished no more . Her own emotions still kept her fixed . She had much to recover from , before she could move . The listener 's proverbial fate was not absolutely hers ; she had heard no evil of herself , but she had heard a great deal of very painful import . She saw how her own character was considered by<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation .</p>
    <p n="338">As soon as she could , she went after<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, and having found , and walked back with her to their former station , by the stile , felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected , and once more in motion together . Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give .</p>
    <p n="339"><persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>returned , bringing , as may be conjectured ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>with them . The minutiae of the business<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not attempt to understand ; even<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here ; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman 's side , and a relenting on the lady 's , and that they were now very glad to be together again , did not admit a doubt .<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>looked a little ashamed , but very well pleased ;—<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>exceedingly happy : and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross .</p>
    <p n="340">Everything now marked out<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>for<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two . In a long strip of meadow land , where there was ample space for all , they were thus divided , forming three distinct parties ; and to that party of the three which boasted least animation , and least complaisance ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>necessarily belonged . She joined<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, and was tired enough to be very glad of<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>'s other arm ; but<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, though in very good humour with her , was out of temper with his wife .<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>had shewn herself disobliging to him , and was now to reap the consequence , which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch ; and when<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>began to complain of it , and lament her being ill-used , according to custom , in being on the hedge side , while<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was never incommoded on the other , he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of , and they could hardly get him along at all .</p>
    <p n="341">This long meadow bordered a lane , which their footpath , at the end of it was to cross , and when the party had all reached the gate of exit , the carriage advancing in the same direction , which had been some time heard , was just coming up , and proved to be<persName>Admiral Croft</persName>'s gig . He and his wife had taken their intended drive , and were returning home . Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in , they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired ; it would save her a full mile , and they were going through Uppercross . The invitation was general , and generally declined . The Miss Musgroves were not at all tired , and<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>was either offended , by not being asked before any of the others , or what<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>called the Elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise .</p>
    <p n="342">The walking party had crossed the lane , and were surmounting an opposite stile , and<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>was putting his horse in motion again , when<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister . The something might be guessed by its effects .</p>
    <p n="343"><said who="#Mrs_Croft">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, I am sure you are tired , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>.<said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home . Here is excellent room for three , I assure you . If we were all like you , I believe we might sit four . You must , indeed , you must . ”</said></p>
    <p n="344"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was still in the lane ; and though instinctively beginning to decline , she was not allowed to proceed .<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">The Admiral</persName>'s kind urgency came in support of his wife 's ; they would not be refused ; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, without saying a word , turned to her , and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage .</p>
    <p n="345">Yes ; he had done it . She was in the carriage , and felt that he had placed her there , that his will and his hands had done it , that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue , and his resolution to give her rest . She was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her , which all these things made apparent . This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before . She understood him . He could not forgive her , but he could not be unfeeling . Though condemning her for the past , and considering it with high and unjust resentment , though perfectly careless of her , and though becoming attached to another , still he could not see her suffer , without the desire of giving her relief . It was a remainder of former sentiment ; it was an impulse of pure , though unacknowledged friendship ; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart , which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain , that she knew not which prevailed .</p>
    <p n="346">Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given . They had travelled half their way along the rough lane , before she was quite awake to what they said . She then found them talking of “<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>. ”</p>
    <p n="347"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls , Sophy , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>;<said who="#the_Admiral">“ but there is no saying which . He has been running after them , too , long enough , one would think , to make up his mind . Ay , this comes of the peace . If it were war now , he would have settled it long ago . We sailors ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war . How many days was it , my dear , between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="348"><said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ We had better not talk about it , my dear , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>, pleasantly ;<said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ for if<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>were to hear how soon we came to an understanding , she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together . I had known you by character , however , long before . ”</said></p>
    <p n="349"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ Well , and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl , and what were we to wait for besides ? I do not like having such things so long in hand . I wish<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>would spread a little more canvass , and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch . Then there would always be company for them . And very nice young ladies they both are ; I hardly know one from the other . ”</said></p>
    <p n="350"><said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ Very good humoured , unaffected girls , indeed , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>, in a tone of calmer praise , such as made<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother ;<said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ and a very respectable family . One could not be connected with better people . My dear<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>, that post ! we shall certainly take that post . ”</said></p>
    <p n="351">But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger ; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut , nor ran foul of a dung-cart ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, with some amusement at their style of driving , which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs , found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="11">
    <p n="352">The time now approached for<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s return : the day was even fixed ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled , was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch , and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it .</p>
    <p n="353">It would place her in the same village with<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, within half a mile of him ; they would have to frequent the same church , and there must be intercourse between the two families . This was against her ; but on the other hand , he spent so much of his time at Uppercross , that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind , than as going towards him ; and , upon the whole , she believed she must , on this interesting question , be the gainer , almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society , in leaving poor<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>for<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>.</p>
    <p n="354">She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>at the Hall : those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her ; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>never meeting anywhere . They did not like each other , and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good ; and were<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>to see them together , she might think that he had too much self-possession , and she too little .</p>
    <p n="355">These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross , where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough . Her usefulness to little<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months ’ visit there , but he was gaining strength apace , and she had nothing else to stay for .</p>
    <p n="356">The conclusion of her visit , however , was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined .<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, after being unseen and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days , appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away .</p>
    <p n="357">A letter from his friend ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>, having found him out at last , had brought intelligence of<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>'s being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter ; of their being therefore , quite unknowingly , within twenty miles of each other .<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme . He had been there for four-and-twenty hours . His acquittal was complete , his friendship warmly honoured , a lively interest excited for his friend , and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party , that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves , and a project for going thither was the consequence .</p>
    <p n="358">The young people were all wild to see Lyme .<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>talked of going there again himself , it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross ; though November , the weather was by no means bad ; and , in short ,<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, who was the most eager of the eager , having formed the resolution to go , and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked , being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way , bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer ; and to Lyme they were to go —<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>,<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>.</p>
    <p n="359">The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>, for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning . They were , consequently , to stay the night there , and not to be expected back till the next day 's dinner . This was felt to be a considerable amendment ; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour , and set off very punctually , it was so much past noon before the two carriages ,<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>'s coach containing the four ladies , and<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>'s curricle , in which he drove<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, were descending the long hill into Lyme , and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself , that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them , before the light and warmth of the day were gone .</p>
    <p n="360">After securing accommodations , and ordering a dinner at one of the inns , the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea . They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme , as a public place , might offer . The rooms were shut up , the lodgers almost all gone , scarcely any family but of the residents left ; and , as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves , the remarkable situation of the town , the principal street almost hurrying into the water , the walk to the Cobb , skirting round the pleasant little bay , which , in the season , is animated with bathing machines and company ; the Cobb itself , its old wonders and new improvements , with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town , are what the stranger 's eye will seek ; and a very strange stranger it must be , who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme , to make him wish to know it better . The scenes in its neighbourhood , Charmouth , with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country , and still more , its sweet , retired bay , backed by dark cliffs , where fragments of low rock among the sands , make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide , for sitting in unwearied contemplation ; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme ; and , above all , Pinny , with its green chasms between romantic rocks , where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth , declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state , where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited , as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of Wight : these places must be visited , and visited again , to make the worth of Lyme understood .</p>
    <p n="361">The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms , and still descending , soon found themselves on the sea-shore ; and lingering only , as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea , who ever deserved to look on it at all , proceeded towards the Cobb , equally their object in itself and on<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s account : for in a small house , near the foot of an old pier of unknown date , were the Harvilles settled .<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>turned in to call on his friend ; the others walked on , and he was to join them on the Cobb .</p>
    <p n="362">They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring ; and not even<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>seemed to feel that they had parted with<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>long , when they saw him coming after them , with three companions , all well known already , by description , to be Captain and<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>, and a<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>, who was staying with them .</p>
    <p n="363"><persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia ; and the account which<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>had given of him , on his return from Lyme before , his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer , whom he had always valued highly , which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener , had been followed by a little history of his private life , which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies . He had been engaged to<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>'s sister , and was now mourning her loss . They had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion . Fortune came , his prize-money as lieutenant being great ; promotion , too , came at last ; but Fanny<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>did not live to know it . She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea .<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>had been to Fanny<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change . He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily , uniting very strong feelings with quiet , serious , and retiring manners , and a decided taste for reading , and sedentary pursuits . To finish the interest of the story , the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed , if possible , augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>was now living with them entirely .<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>had taken his present house for half a year ; his taste , and his health , and his fortune , all directing him to a residence inexpensive , and by the sea ; and the grandeur of the country , and the retirement of Lyme in the winter , appeared exactly adapted to<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>'s state of mind . The sympathy and good-will excited towards<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>was very great .</p>
    <p n="364"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ And yet , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>to herself , as they now moved forward to meet the party ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ he has not , perhaps , a more sorrowing heart than I have . I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever . He is younger than I am ; younger in feeling , if not in fact ; younger as a man . He will rally again , and be happy with another . ”</said></p>
    <p n="365">They all met , and were introduced .<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>was a tall , dark man , with a sensible , benevolent countenance ; a little lame ; and from strong features and want of health , looking much older than<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>.<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>looked , and was , the youngest of the three , and , compared with either of them , a little man . He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air , just as he ought to have , and drew back from conversation .</p>
    <p n="366"><persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>, though not equalling<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>in manners , was a perfect gentleman , unaffected , warm , and obliging .<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>, a degree less polished than her husband , seemed , however , to have the same good feelings ; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own , because the friends of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them . The dinner , already ordered at the inn , was at last , though unwillingly , accepted as a excuse ; but they seemed almost hurt that<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>should have brought any such party to Lyme , without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them .</p>
    <p n="367">There was so much attachment to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>in all this , and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon , so unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations , and dinners of formality and display , that<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ These would have been all my friends , ”</said>was her thought ; and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness .</p>
    <p n="368">On quitting the Cobb , they all went in-doors with their new friends , and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had a moment 's astonishment on the subject herself ; but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>, to turn the actual space to the best account , to supply the deficiencies of lodging-house furniture , and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected . The varieties in the fitting-up of the rooms , where the common necessaries provided by the owner , in the common indifferent plight , were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood , excellently worked up , and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>had visited , were more than amusing to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>; connected as it all was with his profession , the fruit of its labours , the effect of its influence on his habits , the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented , made it to her a something more , or less , than gratification .</p>
    <p n="369"><persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>was no reader ; but he had contrived excellent accommodations , and fashioned very pretty shelves , for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes , the property of<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>. His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise ; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within . He drew , he varnished , he carpentered , he glued ; he made toys for the children ; he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with improvements ; and if everything else was done , sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room .</p>
    <p n="370"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house ; and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, by whom she found herself walking , burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy ; their friendliness , their brotherliness , their openness , their uprightness ; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England ; that they only knew how to live , and they only deserved to be respected and loved .</p>
    <p n="371">They went back to dress and dine ; and so well had the scheme answered already , that nothing was found amiss ; though its being “ so entirely out of season , ” and the “ no thoroughfare of Lyme , ” and the “ no expectation of company , ” had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn .</p>
    <p n="372"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s company than she had at first imagined could ever be , that the sitting down to the same table with him now , and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it ( they never got beyond ) , was become a mere nothing .</p>
    <p n="373">The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow , but<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>had promised them a visit in the evening ; and he came , bringing his friend also , which was more than had been expected , it having been agreed that<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers . He ventured among them again , however , though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general .</p>
    <p n="374">While Captains<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>and<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>led the talk on one side of the room , and by recurring to former days , supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others , it fell to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s lot to be placed rather apart with<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him . He was shy , and disposed to abstraction ; but the engaging mildness of her countenance , and gentleness of her manners , soon had their effect ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was well repaid the first trouble of exertion . He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading , though principally in poetry ; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening 's indulgence in the discussion of subjects , which his usual companions had probably no concern in , she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction , which had naturally grown out of their conversation . For , though shy , he did not seem reserved ; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints ; and having talked of poetry , the richness of the present age , and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets , trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred , and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos ; and moreover , how the Giaour was to be pronounced , he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet , and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other ; he repeated , with such tremulous feeling , the various lines which imaged a broken heart , or a mind destroyed by wretchedness , and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood , that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry , and to say , that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely ; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly .</p>
    <p n="375">His looks shewing him not pained , but pleased with this allusion to his situation , she was emboldened to go on ; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind , she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study ; and on being requested to particularize , mentioned such works of our best moralists , such collections of the finest letters , such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering , as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts , and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances .</p>
    <p n="376"><persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>listened attentively , and seemed grateful for the interest implied ; and though with a shake of the head , and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his , noted down the names of those she recommended , and promised to procure and read them .</p>
    <p n="377">When the evening was over ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="12">
    <p n="378"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning , agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast . They went to the sands , to watch the flowing of the tide , which a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted . They praised the morning ; gloried in the sea ; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling breeze — and were silent ; till<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>suddenly began again with —</p>
    <p n="379"><said who="#Henrietta">“ Oh ! yes ,— I am quite convinced that , with very few exceptions , the sea-air always does good . There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to<persName>Dr Shirley</persName>, after his illness , last spring twelve-month . He declares himself , that coming to Lyme for a month , did him more good than all the medicine he took ; and , that being by the sea , always makes him feel young again . Now , I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea . I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely , and fix at Lyme . Do not you ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>? Do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and Mrs Shirley ? She has cousins here , you know , and many acquaintance , which would make it cheerful for her , and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand , in case of his having another seizure . Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley , who have been doing good all their lives , wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross , where , excepting our family , they seem shut out from all the world . I wish his friends would propose it to him . I really think they ought . And , as to procuring a dispensation , there could be no difficulty at his time of life , and with his character . My only doubt is , whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish . He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions ; over-scrupulous I must say . Do not you think ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, it is being over-scrupulous ? Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience , when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties , which may be just as well performed by another person ? And at Lyme too , only seventeen miles off , he would be near enough to hear , if people thought there was anything to complain of . ”</said></p>
    <p n="380"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>smiled more than once to herself during this speech , and entered into the subject , as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man , though here it was good of a lower standard , for what could be offered but general acquiescence ? She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business ; felt the claims of<persName>Dr Shirley</persName>to repose as she ought ; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active , respectable young man , as a resident curate , and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate 's being married .</p>
    <p n="381"><said who="#Henrietta">“ I wish , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, very well pleased with her companion ,<said who="#Henrietta">“ I wish<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>lived at Uppercross , and were intimate with<persName>Dr Shirley</persName>. I have always heard of<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody ! I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything ! I am afraid of her , as I have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but I respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross . ”</said></p>
    <p n="382"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was amused by<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>'s manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>'s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the<persName corresp="#Musgrove">Musgrove</persName>family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>coming towards them . They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready ; but<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>recollecting , immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop , invited them all to go back with her into the town . They were all at her disposal .</p>
    <p n="383">When they came to the steps , leading upwards from the beach , a gentleman , at the same moment preparing to come down , politely drew back , and stopped to give them way . They ascended and passed him ; and as they passed ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s face caught his eye , and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration , which she could not be insensible of . She was looking remarkably well ; her very regular , very pretty features , having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion , and by the animation of eye which it had also produced . It was evident that the gentleman , ( completely a gentleman in manner ) admired her exceedingly .<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it . He gave her a momentary glance , a glance of brightness , which seemed to say ,<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ That man is struck with you , and even I , at this moment , see something like<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="384">After attending<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>through her business , and loitering about a little longer , they returned to the inn ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room , had nearly run against the very same gentleman , as he came out of an adjoining apartment . She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves , and determined that a well-looking groom , who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back , should be his servant . Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea . It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves ; and this second meeting , short as it was , also proved again by the gentleman 's looks , that he thought hers very lovely , and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies , that he was a man of exceedingly good manners . He seemed about thirty , and though not handsome , had an agreeable person .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>felt that she should like to know who he was .</p>
    <p n="385">They had nearly done breakfast , when the sound of a carriage , ( almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme ) drew half the party to the window . It was a gentleman 's carriage , a curricle , but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door ; somebody must be going away . It was driven by a servant in mourning .</p>
    <p n="386">The word curricle made<persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>jump up that he might compare it with his own ; the servant in mourning roused<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s curiosity , and the whole six were collected to look , by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household , and taking his seat , to drive off .</p>
    <p n="387"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Ah ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, instantly , and with half a glance at<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ it is the very man we passed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="388">The Miss Musgroves agreed to it ; and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could , they returned to the breakfast table . The waiter came into the room soon afterwards .</p>
    <p n="389"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Pray , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, immediately ,<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="390"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Yes , Sir , a<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, a gentleman of large fortune , came in last night from Sidmouth . Dare say you heard the carriage , sir , while you were at dinner ; and going on now for Crewkherne , in his way to Bath and London . ”</said></p>
    <p n="391"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Elliot ! ”</said>Many had looked on each other , and many had repeated the name , before all this had been got through , even by the smart rapidity of a waiter .</p>
    <p n="392"><said who="#Mary">“ Bless me ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>; “ it must be our cousin ; it must be our<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, it must , indeed !<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, must not it ? In mourning , you see , just as our<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>must be . How very extraordinary ! In the very same inn with us !<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, must not it be our<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>? my father 's next heir ? Pray sir , ” turning to the waiter ,<said who="#Mary">“ did not you hear , did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynch family ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="393"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ No , ma'am , he did not mention no particular family ; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman , and would be a baronight some day . ”</said></p>
    <p n="394"><said who="#Mary">“ There ! you see ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>in an ecstasy ,<said who="#Mary">“ just as I said ! Heir to<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter Elliot</persName>! I was sure that would come out , if it was so . Depend upon it , that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish , wherever he goes . But ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, only conceive how extraordinary ! I wish I had looked at him more . I wish we had been aware in time , who it was , that he might have been introduced to us . What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other ! Do you think he had the Elliot countenance ? I hardly looked at him , I was looking at the horses ; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance , I wonder the arms did not strike me ! Oh ! the great-coat was hanging over the panel , and hid the arms , so it did ; otherwise , I am sure , I should have observed them , and the livery too ; if the servant had not been in mourning , one should have known him by the livery . ”</said></p>
    <p n="395"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>,<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ we must consider it to be the arrangement of Providence , that you should not be introduced to your cousin . ”</said></p>
    <p n="396">When she could command<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s attention ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>quietly tried to convince her that their father and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>had not , for many years , been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable .</p>
    <p n="397">At the same time , however , it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin , and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman , and had an air of good sense . She would not , upon any account , mention her having met with him the second time ; luckily<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk , but she would have felt quite ill-used by<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s having actually run against him in the passage , and received his very polite excuses , while she had never been near him at all ; no , that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret .</p>
    <p n="398"><said who="#Mary">“ Of course , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>,<said who="#Mary">“ you will mention our seeing<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, the next time you write to Bath . I think my father certainly ought to hear of it ; do mention all about him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="399"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>avoided a direct reply , but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated , but as what ought to be suppressed . The offence which had been given her father , many years back , she knew ;<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s particular share in it she suspected ; and that<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt .<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>never wrote to Bath herself ; all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>fell on<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="400">Breakfast had not been long over , when they were joined by Captain and<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>and<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>; with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme . They ought to be setting off for Uppercross by one , and in the mean while were to be all together , and out of doors as long as they could .</p>
    <p n="401"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>found<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>getting near her , as soon as they were all fairly in the street . Their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again ; and they walked together some time , talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron , and still as unable as before , and as unable as any other two readers , to think exactly alike of the merits of either , till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party , and instead of<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>, she had<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>by her side .</p>
    <p n="402"><said who="#Captain_Harville">“<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, ”</said>said he , speaking rather low ,<said who="#Captain_Harville">“ you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much . I wish he could have such company oftener . It is bad for him , I know , to be shut up as he is ; but what can we do ? We cannot part . ”</said></p>
    <p n="403"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ that I can easily believe to be impossible ; but in time , perhaps — we know what time does in every case of affliction , and you must remember ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>, that your friend may yet be called a young mourner — only last summer , I understand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="404"><said who="#Captain_Harville">“ Ay , true enough , ”</said>( with a deep sigh )<said who="#Captain_Harville">“ only June . ”</said></p>
    <p n="405"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ And not known to him , perhaps , so soon . ”</said></p>
    <p n="406"><said who="#Captain_Harville">“ Not till the first week of August , when he came home from the Cape , just made into the Grappler . I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him ; he sent in letters , but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth . There the news must follow him , but who was to tell it ? not I. I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm . Nobody could do it , but that good fellow ”</said>( pointing to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>. )<said who="#Captain_Harville">“ The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before ; no danger of her being sent to sea again . He stood his chance for the rest ; wrote up for leave of absence , but without waiting the return , travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth , rowed off to the Grappler that instant , and never left the poor fellow for a week . That 's what he did , and nobody else could have saved poor James . You may think ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, whether he is dear to us ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="407"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different .</p>
    <p n="408"><persName>Mrs Harville</persName>'s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home , determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk ; they would accompany them to their door , and then return and set off themselves . By all their calculations there was just time for this ; but as they drew near the Cobb , there was such a general wish to walk along it once more , all were so inclined , and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>soon grew so determined , that the difference of a quarter of an hour , it was found , would be no difference at all ; so with all the kind leave-taking , and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined , they parted from Captain and<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>at their own door , and still accompanied by<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>, who seemed to cling to them to the last , proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb .</p>
    <p n="409"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>found<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>again drawing near her . Lord Byron 's “ dark blue seas ” could not fail of being brought forward by their present view , and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible . It was soon drawn , perforce another way .</p>
    <p n="410">There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant for the ladies , and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower , and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight , excepting<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>; she must be jumped down them by<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>. In all their walks , he had had to jump her from the stiles ; the sensation was delightful to her . The hardness of the pavement for her feet , made him less willing upon the present occasion ; he did it , however . She was safely down , and instantly , to show her enjoyment , ran up the steps to be jumped down again . He advised her against it , thought the jar too great ; but no , he reasoned and talked in vain , she smiled and said , “ I am determined I will : ” he put out his hands ; she was too precipitate by half a second , she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb , and was taken up lifeless ! There was no wound , no blood , no visible bruise ; but her eyes were closed , she breathed not , her face was like death . The horror of the moment to all who stood around !</p>
    <p n="411"><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, who had caught her up , knelt with her in his arms , looking on her with a face as pallid as her own , in an agony of silence .<said who="#Mary">“ She is dead ! she is dead ! ”</said>screamed<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, catching hold of her husband , and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable ; and in another moment ,<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, sinking under the conviction , lost her senses too , and would have fallen on the steps , but for<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, who caught and supported her between them .</p>
    <p n="412"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Is there no one to help me ? ”</said>were the first words which burst from<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, in a tone of despair , and as if all his own strength were gone .</p>
    <p n="413"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Go to him , go to him , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ for heaven 's sake go to him . I can support her myself . Leave me , and go to him . Rub her hands , rub her temples ; here are salts ; take them , take them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="414"><persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>obeyed , and<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>at the same moment , disengaging himself from his wife , they were both with him ; and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>was raised up and supported more firmly between them , and everything was done that<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had prompted , but in vain ; while<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, staggering against the wall for his support , exclaimed in the bitterest agony —</p>
    <p n="415"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Oh God ! her father and mother ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="416"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ A surgeon ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="417">He caught the word ; it seemed to rouse him at once , and saying only — “ True , true , a surgeon this instant , ” was darting away , when<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>eagerly suggested —</p>
    <p n="418"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>, would not it be better for<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>? He knows where a surgeon is to be found . ”</said></p>
    <p n="419">Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea , and in a moment ( it was all done in rapid moments )<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>had resigned the poor corpse-like figure entirely to the brother 's care , and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity .</p>
    <p n="420">As to the wretched party left behind , it could scarcely be said which of the three , who were completely rational , was suffering most :<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, or<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, who , really a very affectionate brother , hung over<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>with sobs of grief , and could only turn his eyes from one sister , to see the other in a state as insensible , or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife , calling on him for help which he could not give .</p>
    <p n="421"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, attending with all the strength and zeal , and thought , which instinct supplied , to<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, still tried , at intervals , to suggest comfort to the others , tried to quiet<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, to animate<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, to assuage the feelings of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>. Both seemed to look to her for directions .</p>
    <p n="422"><said who="#Charles">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>,<said who="#Charles">“ What is to be done next ? What , in heaven 's name , is to be done next ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="423"><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s eyes were also turned towards her .</p>
    <p n="424"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Had not she better be carried to the inn ? Yes , I am sure : carry her gently to the inn . ”</said></p>
    <p n="425"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Yes , yes , to the inn , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, comparatively collected , and eager to be doing something .<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ I will carry her myself .<persName corresp="#Musgrove">Musgrove</persName>, take care of the others . ”</said></p>
    <p n="426">By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the Cobb , and many were collected near them , to be useful if wanted , at any rate , to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady , nay , two dead young ladies , for it proved twice as fine as the first report . To some of the best-looking of these good people<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>was consigned , for , though partially revived , she was quite helpless ; and in this manner ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>walking by her side , and<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>attending to his wife , they set forward , treading back with feelings unutterable , the ground , which so lately , so very lately , and so light of heart , they had passed along .</p>
    <p n="427">They were not off the Cobb , before the Harvilles met them .<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>had been seen flying by their house , with a countenance which showed something to be wrong ; and they had set off immediately , informed and directed as they passed , towards the spot . Shocked as<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>was , he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful ; and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done . She must be taken to their house ; all must go to their house ; and await the surgeon 's arrival there . They would not listen to scruples : he was obeyed ; they were all beneath his roof ; and while<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, under<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>'s direction , was conveyed up stairs , and given possession of her own bed , assistance , cordials , restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them .</p>
    <p n="428"><persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>had once opened her eyes , but soon closed them again , without apparent consciousness . This had been a proof of life , however , of service to her sister ; and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, was kept , by the agitation of hope and fear , from a return of her own insensibility .<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, too , was growing calmer .</p>
    <p n="429">The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible . They were sick with horror , while he examined ; but he was not hopeless . The head had received a severe contusion , but he had seen greater injuries recovered from : he was by no means hopeless ; he spoke cheerfully .</p>
    <p n="430">That he did not regard it as a desperate case , that he did not say a few hours must end it , was at first felt , beyond the hope of most ; and the ecstasy of such a reprieve , the rejoicing , deep and silent , after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered , may be conceived .</p>
    <p n="431">The tone , the look , with which “ Thank God ! ” was uttered by<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was sure could never be forgotten by her ; nor the sight of him afterwards , as he sat near a table , leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed , as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul , and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them .</p>
    <p n="432"><persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>'s limbs had escaped . There was no injury but to the head .</p>
    <p n="433">It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done , as to their general situation . They were now able to speak to each other and consult . That<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>must remain where she was , however distressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble , did not admit a doubt . Her removal was impossible . The Harvilles silenced all scruples ; and , as much as they could , all gratitude . They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect .<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>must give up his room to them , and get another bed elsewhere ; and the whole was settled . They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more ; and yet perhaps , by “ putting the children away in the maid 's room , or swinging a cot somewhere , ” they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides , supposing they might wish to stay ; though , with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove , there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>'s care entirely .<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>was a very experienced nurse , and her nursery-maid , who had lived with her long , and gone about with her everywhere , was just such another . Between these two , she could want no possible attendance by day or night . And all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible .</p>
    <p n="434"><persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>,<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>were the three in consultation , and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror .<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Uppercross , the necessity of some one 's going to Uppercross ; the news to be conveyed ; how it could be broken to Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>; the lateness of the morning ; an hour already gone since they ought to have been off ; the impossibility of being in tolerable time . ”</said>At first , they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations ; but , after a while ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, exerting himself , said —</p>
    <p n="435"><said who="#Henrietta">“ We must be decided , and without the loss of another minute . Every minute is valuable . Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly .<persName corresp="#Musgrove">Musgrove</persName>, either you or I must go . ”</said></p>
    <p n="436"><persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>agreed , but declared his resolution of not going away . He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would . So far it was decided ; and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>at first declared the same . She , however , was soon persuaded to think differently . The usefulness of her staying ! She who had not been able to remain in<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>'s room , or to look at her , without sufferings which made her worse than helpless ! She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good , yet was still unwilling to be away , till , touched by the thought of her father and mother , she gave it up ; she consented , she was anxious to be at home .</p>
    <p n="437">The plan had reached this point , when<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, coming quietly down from<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>'s room , could not but hear what followed , for the parlour door was open .</p>
    <p n="438"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Then it is settled ,<persName corresp="#Musgrove">Musgrove</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>,<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ that you stay , and that I take care of your sister home . But as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>, I think it need be only one . Mrs<persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>will , of course , wish to get back to her children ; but if<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>will stay , no one so proper , so capable as<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="439">She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of . The other two warmly agreed with what he said , and she then appeared .</p>
    <p n="440"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ You will stay , I am sure ; you will stay and nurse her ; ”</said>cried he , turning to her and speaking with a glow , and yet a gentleness , which seemed almost restoring the past . She coloured deeply , and he recollected himself and moved away . She expressed herself most willing , ready , happy to remain .<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ It was what she had been thinking of , and wishing to be allowed to do . A bed on the floor in<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>'s room would be sufficient for her , if<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>would but think so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="441">One thing more , and all seemed arranged . Though it was rather desirable that Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>should be previously alarmed by some share of delay ; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take them back , would be a dreadful extension of suspense ; and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>proposed , and<persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>agreed , that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn , and leave<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>'s carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early , when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>'s night .</p>
    <p n="442"><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>now hurried off to get everything ready on his part , and to be soon followed by the two ladies . When the plan was made known to<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, however , there was an end of all peace in it . She was so wretched and so vehement , complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>;<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, who was nothing to<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, while she was her sister , and had the best right to stay in<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>'s stead ! Why was not she to be as useful as<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>? And to go home without<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, too , without her husband ! No , it was too unkind . And in short , she said more than her husband could long withstand , and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way , there was no help for it ; the change of<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>for<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was inevitable .</p>
    <p n="443"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill-judging claims of<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>; but so it must be , and they set off for the town ,<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>taking care of his sister , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>attending to her . She gave a moment 's recollection , as they hurried along , to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning . There she had listened to<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>'s schemes for<persName>Dr Shirley</persName>'s leaving Uppercross ; farther on , she had first seen<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare .</p>
    <p n="444"><persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>was most considerately attentive to her ; and , united as they all seemed by the distress of the day , she felt an increasing degree of good-will towards him , and a pleasure even in thinking that it might , perhaps , be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance .</p>
    <p n="445"><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was on the watch for them , and a chaise and four in waiting , stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street ; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other , the change in his countenance , the astonishment , the expressions begun and suppressed , with which<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>was listened to , made but a mortifying reception of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>.</p>
    <p n="446">She endeavoured to be composed , and to be just . Without emulating the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry , she would have attended on<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>with a zeal above the common claims of regard , for his sake ; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend .</p>
    <p n="447">In the mean while she was in the carriage . He had handed them both in , and placed himself between them ; and in this manner , under these circumstances , full of astonishment and emotion to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, she quitted Lyme . How the long stage would pass ; how it was to affect their manners ; what was to be their sort of intercourse , she could not foresee . It was all quite natural , however . He was devoted to<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>; always turning towards her ; and when he spoke at all , always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits . In general , his voice and manner were studiously calm . To spare<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>from agitation seemed the governing principle . Once only , when she had been grieving over the last ill-judged , ill-fated walk to the Cobb , bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of , he burst forth , as if wholly overcome —</p>
    <p n="448"><said who="#Henrietta">“ Do n't talk of it , do n't talk of it , ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Henrietta">“ Oh God ! that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment ! Had I done as I ought ! But so eager and so resolute ! Dear , sweet<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>! ”</said></p>
    <p n="449"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>wondered whether it ever occurred to him now , to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character ; and whether it might not strike him that , like all other qualities of the mind , it should have its proportions and limits . She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character .</p>
    <p n="450">They got on fast .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon . Their actual speed , heightened by some dread of the conclusion , made the road appear but half as long as on the day before . It was growing quite dusk , however , before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross , and there had been total silence among them for some time ,<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>leaning back in the corner , with a shawl over her face , giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep ; when , as they were going up their last hill ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>found herself all at once addressed by<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>. In a low , cautious voice , he said :—</p>
    <p n="451"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ I have been considering what we had best do . She must not appear at first . She could not stand it . I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her , while I go in and break it to Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>. Do you think this is a good plan ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="452">She did : he was satisfied , and said no more . But the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her , as a proof of friendship , and of deference for her judgement , a great pleasure ; and when it became a sort of parting proof , its value did not lessen .</p>
    <p n="453">When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over , and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped , and the daughter all the better for being with them , he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme ; and when the horses were baited , he was off .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="13">
    <p n="455">The remainder of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s time at Uppercross , comprehending only two days , was spent entirely at the Mansion House ; and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there , both as an immediate companion , and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future , which , in Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>'s distressed state of spirits , would have been difficulties .</p>
    <p n="456">They had an early account from Lyme the next morning .<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>was much the same . No symptoms worse than before had appeared .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>came a few hours afterwards , to bring a later and more particular account . He was tolerably cheerful . A speedy cure must not be hoped , but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted . In speaking of the Harvilles , he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness , especially of<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>'s exertions as a nurse .<said>“ She really left nothing for<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>to do . He and<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night .<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>had been hysterical again this morning . When he came away , she was going to walk out with<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>, which , he hoped , would do her good . He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>left nothing for anybody to do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="457"><persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>was to return to Lyme the same afternoon , and his father had at first half a mind to go with him , but the ladies could not consent . It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others , and increase his own distress ; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon . A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne , and<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family , one who having brought up all the children , and seen the very last , the lingering and long-petted Master Harry , sent to school after his brothers , was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her , and who , consequently , was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>. Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither , had occurred before to<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>; but without<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, it would hardly have been resolved on , and found practicable so soon .</p>
    <p n="458">They were indebted , the next day , to<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>, for all the minute knowledge of<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, which it was so essential to obtain every twenty-four hours . He made it his business to go to Lyme , and his account was still encouraging . The intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger . Every report agreed in<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s appearing fixed in Lyme .</p>
    <p n="459"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was to leave them on the morrow , an event which they all dreaded .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ What should they do without her ? They were wretched comforters for one another . ”</said>And so much was said in this way , that<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy , and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once . She had little difficulty ; it was soon determined that they would go ; go to-morrow , fix themselves at the inn , or get into lodgings , as it suited , and there remain till dear<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>could be moved . They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with ; they might at least relieve<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>from the care of her own children ; and in short , they were so happy in the decision , that<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was delighted with what she had done , and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations , and sending them off at an early hour , though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence .</p>
    <p n="460">She was the last , excepting the little boys at the cottage , she was the very last , the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses , of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character . A few days had made a change indeed !</p>
    <p n="461">If<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>recovered , it would all be well again . More than former happiness would be restored . There could not be a doubt , to her mind there was none , of what would follow her recovery . A few months hence , and the room now so deserted , occupied but by her silent , pensive self , might be filled again with all that was happy and gay , all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love , all that was most unlike<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>!</p>
    <p n="462">An hour 's complete leisure for such reflections as these , on a dark November day , a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows , was enough to make the sound of<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s carriage exceedingly welcome ; and yet , though desirous to be gone , she could not quit the Mansion House , or look an adieu to the Cottage , with its black , dripping and comfortless veranda , or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village , without a saddened heart . Scenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious . It stood the record of many sensations of pain , once severe , but now softened ; and of some instances of relenting feeling , some breathings of friendship and reconciliation , which could never be looked for again , and which could never cease to be dear . She left it all behind her , all but the recollection that such things had been .</p>
    <p n="463"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had never entered Kellynch since her quitting<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s house in September . It had not been necessary , and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and escape from . Her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the Lodge , and to gladden the eyes of its mistress .</p>
    <p n="464">There was some anxiety mixed with<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s joy in meeting her . She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross . But happily , either<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was improved in plumpness and looks , or<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>fancied her so ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, in receiving her compliments on the occasion , had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin , and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty .</p>
    <p n="465">When they came to converse , she was soon sensible of some mental change . The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch , and which she had felt slighted , and been compelled to smother among the Musgroves , were now become but of secondary interest . She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath . Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>should still be with them ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>, and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>, than her own father 's house in Camden Place , or her own sister 's intimacy with<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>. She was actually forced to exert herself to meet<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude , on topics which had by nature the first claim on her .</p>
    <p n="466">There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject . They must speak of the accident at Lyme .<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>had not been arrived five minutes the day before , when a full account of the whole had burst on her ; but still it must be talked of , she must make enquiries , she must regret the imprudence , lament the result , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s name must be mentioned by both .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was conscious of not doing it so well as<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>. She could not speak the name , and look straight forward to<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s eye , till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>. When this was told , his name distressed her no longer .</p>
    <p n="467"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>had only to listen composedly , and wish them happy , but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure , in pleased contempt , that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>, should , eight years afterwards , be charmed by a<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>.</p>
    <p n="468">The first three or four days passed most quietly , with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme , which found their way to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, she could not tell how , and brought a rather improving account of<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>. At the end of that period ,<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s politeness could repose no longer , and the fainter self-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone ,<said who="#Lady_Russell">“ I must call on<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>; I really must call upon her soon .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, have you courage to go with me , and pay a visit in that house ? It will be some trial to us both . ”</said></p>
    <p n="469"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>did not shrink from it ; on the contrary , she truly felt as she said , in observing —</p>
    <p n="470"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two ; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine . By remaining in the neighbourhood , I am become inured to it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="471">She could have said more on the subject ; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts , and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants , felt the parish to be so sure of a good example , and the poor of the best attention and relief , that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal , she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay , and that<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>had passed into better hands than its owners ’ . These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain , and severe was its kind ; but they precluded that pain which<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>would suffer in entering the house again , and returning through the well-known apartments .</p>
    <p n="472">In such moments<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had no power of saying to herself ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ These rooms ought to belong only to us . Oh , how fallen in their destination ! How unworthily occupied ! An ancient family to be so driven away ! Strangers filling their place ! ”</said>No , except when she thought of her mother , and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside , she had no sigh of that description to heave .</p>
    <p n="473"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite , and on the present occasion , receiving her in that house , there was particular attention .</p>
    <p n="474">The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic , and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid , it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn ; that<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>had been in Kellynch yesterday ( the first time since the accident ) , had brought<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>the last note , which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of ; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme , and without any present intention of quitting it any more . He had enquired after her , she found , particularly ; had expressed his hope of<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>'s not being the worse for her exertions , and had spoken of those exertions as great . This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done .</p>
    <p n="475">As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove 's recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter !<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">The Admiral</persName>wound it up summarily by exclaiming —</p>
    <p n="476"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ Ay , a very bad business indeed . A new sort of way this , for a young fellow to be making love , by breaking his mistress 's head , is not it ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>? This is breaking a head and giving a plaster , truly ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="477"><persName>Admiral Croft</persName>'s manners were not quite of the tone to suit<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, but they delighted<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>. His goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible .</p>
    <p n="478"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Now , this must be very bad for you , ”</said>said he , suddenly rousing from a little reverie ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ to be coming and finding us here . I had not recollected it before , I declare , but it must be very bad . But now , do not stand upon ceremony . Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="479"><said who="#Lady_Russell">“ Another time , Sir , I thank you , not now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="480"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Well , whenever it suits you . You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time ; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door . A good place is not it ? But , ”</said>( checking himself ) ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler 's room . Ay , so it always is , I believe . One man 's ways may be as good as another 's , but we all like our own best . And so you must judge for yourself , whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="481"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, finding she might decline it , did so , very gratefully .</p>
    <p n="482"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ We have made very few changes either , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>, after thinking a moment .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Very few . We told you about the laundry-door , at Uppercross . That has been a very great improvement . The wonder was , how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did , so long ! You will tell<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>what we have done , and that<persName corresp="#Mr_Shepherd">Mr Shepherd</persName>thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had . Indeed , I must do ourselves the justice to say , that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better . My wife should have the credit of them , however . I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my dressing-room , which was your father 's . A very good man , and very much the gentleman I am sure : but I should think ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, ”</said>( looking with serious reflection ) ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life . Such a number of looking-glasses ! oh Lord ! there was no getting away from one 's self . So I got Sophy to lend me a hand , and we soon shifted their quarters ; and now I am quite snug , with my little shaving glass in one corner , and another great thing that I never go near . ”</said></p>
    <p n="483"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, amused in spite of herself , was rather distressed for an answer , and<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>, fearing he might not have been civil enough , took up the subject again , to say —</p>
    <p n="484"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ The next time you write to your good father ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, pray give him my compliments and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>'s , and say that we are settled here quite to our liking , and have no fault at all to find with the place . The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little , I grant you , but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard , which may not happen three times a winter . And take it altogether , now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge , there is not one that we like better than this . Pray say so , with my compliments . He will be glad to hear it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="485"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>were very well pleased with each other : but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present ; for when it was returned , the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks , to visit their connexions in the north of the county , and probably might not be at home again before<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>would be removing to Bath .</p>
    <p n="486">So ended all danger to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>of meeting<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>at<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>, or of seeing him in company with her friend . Everything was safe enough , and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject .</p>

    <p n="487">Though<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>'s going than<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>conceived they could have been at all wanted , they were yet the first of the family to be at home again ; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge . They had left<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them .</p>
    <p n="488">They had been all in lodgings together .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>had got<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>'s children away as much as she could , every possible supply from Uppercross had been furnished , to lighten the inconvenience to the Harvilles , while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day ; and in short , it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable .</p>
    <p n="489"><persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>had had her evils ; but upon the whole , as was evident by her staying so long , she had found more to enjoy than to suffer .<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait , and at first<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>had always given<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme . She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight .</p>
    <p n="490"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>enquired after<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s face was clouded directly .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>laughed .</p>
    <p n="491"><said>“ Oh !<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>is very well , I believe , but he is a very odd young man . I do not know what he would be at . We asked him to come home with us for a day or two :<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>undertook to give him some shooting , and he seemed quite delighted , and , for my part , I thought it was all settled ; when behold ! on Tuesday night , he made a very awkward sort of excuse ; ‘ he never shot ’ and he had ‘ been quite misunderstood , ’ and he had promised this and he had promised that , and the end of it was , I found , that he did not mean to come . I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull ; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken man as<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="492"><persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>laughed again and said , “ Now<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, you know very well how it really was . It was all your doing , ” ( turning to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>. )<said>“ He fancied that if he went with us , he should find you close by : he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross ; and when he discovered that<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>lived three miles off , his heart failed him , and he had not courage to come . That is the fact , upon my honour ,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>knows it is . ”</said></p>
    <p n="493">But<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>did not give into it very graciously , whether from not considering<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot , or from not wanting to believe<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself , must be left to be guessed .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s good-will , however , was not to be lessened by what she heard . She boldly acknowledged herself flattered , and continued her enquiries .</p>
    <p n="494"><said who="#Charles">“ Oh ! he talks of you , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>,<said who="#Mary">“ in such terms — ”</said><persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>interrupted him .<said who="#Mary">“ I declare ,<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, I never heard him mention<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>twice all the time I was there . I declare ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, he never talks of you at all . ”</said></p>
    <p n="495"><said who="#Charles">“ No , ”</said>admitted<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>,<said who="#Charles">“ I do not know that he ever does , in a general way ; but however , it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly . His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation , and he wants to talk to you about them ; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks — oh ! I cannot pretend to remember it , but it was something very fine — I overheard him telling<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>all about it ; and then ‘<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>’ was spoken of in the highest terms ! Now<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, I declare it was so , I heard it myself , and you were in the other room . ‘ Elegance , sweetness , beauty . ’ Oh ! there was no end of<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>'s charms . ”</said></p>
    <p n="496"><said who="#Mary">“ And I am sure , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, warmly ,<said who="#Mary">“ it was a very little to his credit , if he did . Miss<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>only died last June . Such a heart is very little worth having ; is it ,<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>? I am sure you will agree with me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="497"><said who="#Lady_Russell">“ I must see<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>before I decide , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, smiling .</p>
    <p n="498"><said who="#Charles">“ And that you are very likely to do very soon , I can tell you , ma'am , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>.<said who="#Charles">“ Though he had not nerves for coming away with us , and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here , he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself , you may depend on it . I told him the distance and the road , and I told him of the church 's being so very well worth seeing ; for as he has a taste for those sort of things , I thought that would be a good excuse , and he listened with all his understanding and soul ; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon . So , I give you notice ,<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="499"><said who="#Lady_Russell">“ Any acquaintance of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s will always be welcome to me , ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s kind answer .</p>
    <p n="500"><said who="#Mary">“ Oh ! as to being<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s acquaintance , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>,<said who="#Mary">“ I think he is rather my acquaintance , for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight . ”</said></p>
    <p n="501"><said who="#Lady_Russell">“ Well , as your joint acquaintance , then , I shall be very happy to see<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="502"><said who="#Mary">“ You will not find anything very agreeable in him , I assure you , ma'am . He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived . He has walked with me , sometimes , from one end of the sands to the other , without saying a word . He is not at all a well-bred young man . I am sure you will not like him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="503"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ There we differ ,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I think<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>would like him . I think she would be so much pleased with his mind , that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner . ”</said></p>
    <p n="504"><said who="#Charles">“ So do I ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>.<said who="#Charles">“ I am sure<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>would like him . He is just<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s sort . Give him a book , and he will read all day long . ”</said></p>
    <p n="505"><said who="#Mary">“ Yes , that he will ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, tauntingly .<said who="#Mary">“ He will sit poring over his book , and not know when a person speaks to him , or when one drop 's one 's scissors , or anything that happens . Do you think<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>would like that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="506"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>could not help laughing .<said who="#Lady_Russell">“ Upon my word , ”</said>said she ,<said who="#Lady_Russell">“ I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture , steady and matter of fact as I may call myself . I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions . I wish he may be induced to call here . And when he does ,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, you may depend upon hearing my opinion ; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="507"><said who="#Mary">“ You will not like him , I will answer for it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="508"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>began talking of something else .<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>spoke with animation of their meeting with , or rather missing ,<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>so extraordinarily .</p>
    <p n="509"><said who="#Lady_Russell">“ He is a man , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>,<said who="#Lady_Russell">“ whom I have no wish to see . His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family , has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="510">This decision checked<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s eagerness , and stopped her short in the midst of the Elliot countenance .</p>
    <p n="511">With regard to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, though<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>hazarded no enquiries , there was voluntary communication sufficient . His spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected . As<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>improved , he had improved , and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week . He had not seen<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview , that he did not press for it at all ; and , on the contrary , seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days , till her head was stronger . He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week , and wanted to persuade<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>to go with him ; but , as<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>maintained to the last ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch .</p>
    <p n="512">There can be no doubt that<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>were both occasionally thinking of<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>, from this time .<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald ; nor could<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father 's grounds , or any visit of charity in the village , without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him .<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>came not , however . He was either less disposed for it than<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>had imagined , or he was too shy ; and after giving him a week 's indulgence ,<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite .</p>
    <p n="513">The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school , bringing with them<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>'s little children , to improve the noise of Uppercross , and lessen that of Lyme .<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>remained with<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters .</p>
    <p n="514"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>paid their compliments to them once , when<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again . Though neither<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, nor<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, nor<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>, nor<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>were there , the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in .</p>
    <p n="515">Immediately surrounding<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>were the little Harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them . On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>also came in , of course , during their visit , and<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>made a point of paying his respects to<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, and sat down close to her for ten minutes , talking with a very raised voice , but from the clamour of the children on his knees , generally in vain . It was a fine family-piece .</p>
    <p n="516"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, judging from her own temperament , would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves , which<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>'s illness must have so greatly shaken . But<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>, who got<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>near her on purpose to thank her most cordially , again and again , for all her attentions to them , concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing , with a happy glance round the room , that after all she had gone through , nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home .</p>
    <p n="517"><persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>was now recovering apace . Her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home , before her brothers and sisters went to school again . The Harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at Uppercross , whenever she returned .<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was gone , for the present , to see his brother in Shropshire .</p>
    <p n="518"><said who="#Lady_Russell">“ I hope I shall remember , in future , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, as soon as they were reseated in the carriage ,<said who="#Lady_Russell">“ not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays . ”</said></p>
    <p n="519">Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters ; and sounds are quite innoxious , or most distressing , by their sort rather than their quantity . When<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>not long afterwards , was entering Bath on a wet afternoon , and driving through the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place , amidst the dash of other carriages , the heavy rumble of carts and drays , the bawling of newspapermen , muffin-men and milkmen , and the ceaseless clink of pattens , she made no complaint . No , these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures ; her spirits rose under their influence ; and like<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>, she was feeling , though not saying , that after being long in the country , nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness .</p>
    <p n="520"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>did not share these feelings . She persisted in a very determined , though very silent disinclination for Bath ; caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings , smoking in rain , without any wish of seeing them better ; felt their progress through the streets to be , however disagreeable , yet too rapid ; for who would be glad to see her when she arrived ? And looked back , with fond regret , to the bustles of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch .</p>
    <p n="521"><persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was in Bath . He had called in Camden Place ; had called a second time , a third ; had been pointedly attentive . If<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>and her father did not deceive themselves , had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance , and proclaim the value of the connection , as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect . This was very wonderful if it were true ; and<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, of his being “ a man whom she had no wish to see . ” She had a great wish to see him . If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch , he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree .</p>
    <p n="522"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance , but she felt that she would rather see<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>again than not , which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath .</p>
    <p n="523">She was put down in Camden Place ; and<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>then drove to her own lodgings , in Rivers Street .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="15">
    <p n="524"><persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>had taken a very good house in Camden Place , a lofty dignified situation , such as becomes a man of consequence ; and both he and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>were settled there , much to their satisfaction .</p>
    <p n="525"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>entered it with a sinking heart , anticipating an imprisonment of many months , and anxiously saying to herself ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Oh ! when shall I leave you again ? ”</said>A degree of unexpected cordiality , however , in the welcome she received , did her good . Her father and sister were glad to see her , for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture , and met her with kindness . Her making a fourth , when they sat down to dinner , was noticed as an advantage .</p>
    <p n="526"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>was very pleasant , and very smiling , but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival , but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for . They were evidently in excellent spirits , and she was soon to listen to the causes . They had no inclination to listen to her . After laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood , which<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not pay , they had only a few faint enquiries to make , before the talk must be all their own . Uppercross excited no interest , Kellynch very little : it was all Bath .</p>
    <p n="527">They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered their expectations in every respect . Their house was undoubtedly the best in Camden Place ; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of , and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up , or the taste of the furniture . Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after . Everybody was wanting to visit them . They had drawn back from many introductions , and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing .</p>
    <p n="528">Here were funds of enjoyment . Could<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>wonder that her father and sister were happy ? She might not wonder , but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change , should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder , should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town ; and she must sigh , and smile , and wonder too , as<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>threw open the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the other , boasting of their space ; at the possibility of that woman , who had been mistress of<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>, finding extent to be proud of between two walls , perhaps thirty feet asunder .</p>
    <p n="529">But this was not all which they had to make them happy . They had<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>too .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had a great deal to hear of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. He was not only pardoned , they were delighted with him . He had been in Bath about a fortnight ; ( he had passed through Bath in November , in his way to London , when the intelligence of<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s being settled there had of course reached him , though only twenty-four hours in the place , but he had not been able to avail himself of it ;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath , and his first object on arriving , had been to leave his card in Camden Place , following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet , and when they did meet , by such great openness of conduct , such readiness to apologize for the past , such solicitude to be received as a relation again , that their former good understanding was completely re-established .</p>
    <p n="530">They had not a fault to find in him . He had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side . It had originated in misapprehension entirely . He had never had an idea of throwing himself off ; he had feared that he was thrown off , but knew not why , and delicacy had kept him silent . Upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours , he was quite indignant . He , who had ever boasted of being an Elliot , and whose feelings , as to connection , were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day . He was astonished , indeed , but his character and general conduct must refute it . He could refer<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>to all who knew him ; and certainly , the pains he had been taking on this , the first opportunity of reconciliation , to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir-presumptive , was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject .</p>
    <p n="531">The circumstances of his marriage , too , were found to admit of much extenuation . This was an article not to be entered on by himself ; but a very intimate friend of his , a<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>, a highly respectable man , perfectly the gentleman , ( and not an ill-looking man ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>added ) , who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings , and had , at his own particular request , been admitted to their acquaintance through<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage , which made a material difference in the discredit of it .</p>
    <p n="532"><persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>had known<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>long , had been well acquainted also with his wife , had perfectly understood the whole story . She was certainly not a woman of family , but well educated , accomplished , rich , and excessively in love with his friend . There had been the charm . She had sought him . Without that attraction , not all her money would have tempted Elliot , and<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>was , moreover , assured of her having been a very fine woman . Here was a great deal to soften the business . A very fine woman with a large fortune , in love with him !<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>seemed to admit it as complete apology ; and though<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light , she allowed it be a great extenuation .</p>
    <p n="533"><persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>had called repeatedly , had dined with them once , evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked , for they gave no dinners in general ; delighted , in short , by every proof of cousinly notice , and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place .</p>
    <p n="534"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>listened , but without quite understanding it . Allowances , large allowances , she knew , must be made for the ideas of those who spoke . She heard it all under embellishment . All that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators . Still , however , she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared , in<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s wishing , after an interval of so many years , to be well received by them . In a worldly view , he had nothing to gain by being on terms with<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>; nothing to risk by a state of variance . In all probability he was already the richer of the two , and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title . A sensible man , and he had looked like a very sensible man , why should it be an object to him ? She could only offer one solution ; it was , perhaps , for<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s sake . There might really have been a liking formerly , though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way ; and now that he could afford to please himself , he might mean to pay his addresses to her .<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>was certainly very handsome , with well-bred , elegant manners , and her character might never have been penetrated by<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, knowing her but in public , and when very young himself . How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one . Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>were his object ; and that<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s frequent visits were talked of .</p>
    <p n="535"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme , but without being much attended to .<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ Oh ! yes , perhaps , it had been<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. They did not know . It might be him , perhaps . ”</said>They could not listen to her description of him . They were describing him themselves ;<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>especially . He did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance , his air of elegance and fashion , his good shaped face , his sensible eye ; but , at the same time , “ must lament his being very much under-hung , a defect which time seemed to have increased ; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>appeared to think that he (<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted ; ” but<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>had “ not been able to return the compliment entirely , which had embarrassed him . He did not mean to complain , however .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was better to look at than most men , and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere . ”</p>
    <p n="536"><persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings , were talked of the whole evening .<said who="#Mrs_Wallis">“<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>had been so impatient to be introduced to them ! and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>so anxious that he should ! ”</said>and there was a<persName corresp="#Mrs_Wallis">Mrs Wallis</persName>, at present known only to them by description , as she was in daily expectation of her confinement ; but<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>spoke of her as “ a most charming woman , quite worthy of being known in Camden Place , ” and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted .<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>thought much of<persName corresp="#Mrs_Wallis">Mrs Wallis</persName>; she was said to be an excessively pretty woman , beautiful .<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ He longed to see her . He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets . The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women . He did not mean to say that there were no pretty women , but the number of the plain was out of all proportion . He had frequently observed , as he walked , that one handsome face would be followed by thirty , or five-and-thirty frights ; and once , as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street , he had counted eighty-seven women go by , one after another , without there being a tolerable face among them . It had been a frosty morning , to be sure , a sharp frost , which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of . But still , there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath ; and as for the men ! they were infinitely worse . Such scarecrows as the streets were full of ! It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable , by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced . He had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>( who was a fine military figure , though sandy-haired ) without observing that every woman 's eye was upon him ; every woman 's eye was sure to be upon<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>. ”</said>Modest<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>! He was not allowed to escape , however . His daughter and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>united in hinting that<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>'s companion might have as good a figure as<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>, and certainly was not sandy-haired .</p>
    <p n="537"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ How is<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>looking ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, in the height of his good humour .<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ The last time I saw her she had a red nose , but I hope that may not happen every day . ”</said></p>
    <p n="538"><said who="#Colonel_Wallis">“ Oh ! no , that must have been quite accidental . In general she has been in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas . ”</said></p>
    <p n="539"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds , and grow coarse , I would send her a new hat and pelisse . ”</said></p>
    <p n="540"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown , or a cap , would not be liable to any such misuse , when a knock at the door suspended everything .<said who="#Colonel_Wallis">“ A knock at the door ! and so late ! It was ten o'clock . Could it be<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>? They knew he was to dine in Lansdown Crescent . It was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did . They could think of no one else .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>decidedly thought it<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s knock . ”</said><persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>was right . With all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give ,<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was ushered into the room .</p>
    <p n="541">It was the same , the very same man , with no difference but of dress .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>drew a little back , while the others received his compliments , and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour , but “ he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before , ” &amp; c. &amp; c ; which was all as politely done , and as politely taken , as possible , but her part must follow then .<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>talked of his youngest daughter ; “<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter ” ( there was no occasion for remembering<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>) ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, smiling and blushing , very becomingly shewed to<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten , and instantly saw , with amusement at his little start of surprise , that he had not been at all aware of who she was . He looked completely astonished , but not more astonished than pleased ; his eyes brightened ! and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship , alluded to the past , and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already . He was quite as good-looking as he had appeared at Lyme , his countenance improved by speaking , and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be , so polished , so easy , so particularly agreeable , that she could compare them in excellence to only one person 's manners . They were not the same , but they were , perhaps , equally good .</p>
    <p n="542">He sat down with them , and improved their conversation very much . There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man . Ten minutes were enough to certify that . His tone , his expressions , his choice of subject , his knowing where to stop ; it was all the operation of a sensible , discerning mind . As soon as he could , he began to talk to her of Lyme , wanting to compare opinions respecting the place , but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time ; to give his own route , understand something of hers , and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her . She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme . His regret increased as he listened . He had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs ; had heard voices , mirth continually ; thought they must be a most delightful set of people , longed to be with them , but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself . If he had but asked who the party were ! The name of<persName corresp="#Musgrove">Musgrove</persName>would have told him enough .<said who="#Musgrove">“ Well , it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn , which he had adopted , when quite a young man , on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious .</said></p>
    <p n="543"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing , are more absurd , I believe , than those of any other set of beings in the world . The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view . ”</said></p>
    <p n="544">But he must not be addressing his reflections to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>alone : he knew it ; he was soon diffused again among the others , and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme .</p>
    <p n="545">His enquiries , however , produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there , soon after his leaving the place . Having alluded to “ an accident , ” he must hear the whole . When he questioned ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>began to question also , but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt . She could only compare<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>to<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, in the wish of really comprehending what had passed , and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it .</p>
    <p n="546">He staid an hour with them . The elegant little clock on the mantel-piece had struck “ eleven with its silver sounds , ” and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale , before<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long .</p>
    <p n="547"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in Camden Place could have passed so well !</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="16">
    <p n="548">There was one point which<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, on returning to her family , would have been more thankful to ascertain even than<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s being in love with<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, which was , her father 's not being in love with<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>; and she was very far from easy about it , when she had been at home a few hours . On going down to breakfast the next morning , she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady 's side of meaning to leave them . She could imagine<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>to have said , that “ now<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne</persName>was come , she could not suppose herself at all wanted ; ” for<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>was replying in a sort of whisper , “ That must not be any reason , indeed . I assure you I feel it none . She is nothing to me , compared with you ; ” and she was in full time to hear her father say ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ My dear madam , this must not be . As yet , you have seen nothing of Bath . You have been here only to be useful . You must not run away from us now . You must stay to be acquainted with<persName corresp="#Mrs_Wallis">Mrs Wallis</persName>, the beautiful<persName corresp="#Mrs_Wallis">Mrs Wallis</persName>. To your fine mind , I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification . ”</said></p>
    <p n="549">He spoke and looked so much in earnest , that<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was not surprised to see<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>stealing a glance at<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>and herself . Her countenance , perhaps , might express some watchfulness ; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister . The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties , and promise to stay .</p>
    <p n="550">In the course of the same morning ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>and her father chancing to be alone together , he began to compliment her on her improved looks ; he thought her “ less thin in her person , in her cheeks ; her skin , her complexion , greatly improved ; clearer , fresher . Had she been using any thing in particular ? ”<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ No , nothing . ”</said>“ Merely Gowland , ” he supposed .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ No , nothing at all . ”</said>“ Ha ! he was surprised at that ; ” and added ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are ; you cannot be better than well ; or I should recommend Gowland , the constant use of Gowland , during the spring months .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>has been using it at my recommendation , and you see what it has done for her . You see how it has carried away her freckles . ”</said></p>
    <p n="551">If<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>could but have heard this ! Such personal praise might have struck her , especially as it did not appear to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>that the freckles were at all lessened . But everything must take its chance . The evil of a marriage would be much diminished , if<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>were also to marry . As for herself , she might always command a home with<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>.</p>
    <p n="552"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point , in her intercourse in Camden Place . The sight of<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>in such favour , and of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>so overlooked , was a perpetual provocation to her there ; and vexed her as much when she was away , as a person in Bath who drinks the water , gets all the new publications , and has a very large acquaintance , has time to be vexed .</p>
    <p n="553">As<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others . His manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, almost ready to exclaim ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Can this be<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>? ”</said>and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man . Everything united in him ; good understanding , correct opinions , knowledge of the world , and a warm heart . He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour , without pride or weakness ; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune , without display ; he judged for himself in everything essential , without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum . He was steady , observant , moderate , candid ; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness , which fancied itself strong feeling ; and yet , with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely , and a value for all the felicities of domestic life , which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess . She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage .<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>said it , and<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>saw it ; but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind , nor ( she began pretty soon to suspect ) to prevent his thinking of a second choice . Her satisfaction in<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>outweighed all the plague of<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>.</p>
    <p n="554">It was now some years since<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently ; and it did not surprise her , therefore , that<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent , nothing to require more motives than appeared , in<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s great desire of a reconciliation . In<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s view , it was perfectly natural that<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, at a mature time of life , should feel it a most desirable object , and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people , to be on good terms with the head of his family ; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear , and only erring in the heyday of youth .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>presumed , however , still to smile about it , and at last to mention “<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>. ”<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>listened , and looked , and made only this cautious reply :— “<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>! very well ; time will explain . ”</p>
    <p n="555">It was a reference to the future , which<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, after a little observation , felt she must submit to . She could determine nothing at present . In that house<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>must be first ; and she was in the habit of such general observance as “<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, ” that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, too , it must be remembered , had not been a widower seven months . A little delay on his side might be very excusable . In fact ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could never see the crape round his hat , without fearing that she was the inexcusable one , in attributing to him such imaginations ; for though his marriage had not been very happy , still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved .</p>
    <p n="556">However it might end , he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in Bath : she saw nobody equal to him ; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme , which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again , and to see more of , as herself . They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times . He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness . She knew it well ; and she remembered another person 's look also .</p>
    <p n="557">They did not always think alike . His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers . It was not merely complaisance , it must be a liking to the cause , which made him enter warmly into her father and sister 's solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them . The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Dalrymple</persName>, and her daughter , the Honourable<persName>Miss Carteret</persName>; and all the comfort of No . —, Camden Place , was swept away for many days ; for the Dalrymples ( in<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s opinion , most unfortunately ) were cousins of the Elliots ; and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly .</p>
    <p n="558"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility , and she must acknowledge herself disappointed . She had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life , and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen ; a wish that they had more pride ; for “ our cousins<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>and<persName>Miss Carteret</persName>; ” “ our cousins , the Dalrymples , ” sounded in her ears all day long .</p>
    <p n="559"><persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>had once been in company with the late viscount , but had never seen any of the rest of the family ; and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony , ever since the death of that said late viscount , when , in consequence of a dangerous illness of<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s at the same time , there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch . No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland . The neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner ; for when poor<persName>Lady Elliot</persName>died herself , no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch , and , consequently , there was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed . How to have this anxious business set to rights , and be admitted as cousins again , was the question : and it was a question which , in a more rational manner , neither<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>nor<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>thought unimportant .<said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ Family connexions were always worth preserving , good company always worth seeking ;<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>had taken a house , for three months , in Laura Place , and would be living in style . She had been at Bath the year before , and<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>had heard her spoken of as a charming woman . It was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed , if it could be done , without any compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots . ”</said></p>
    <p n="560"><persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, however , would choose his own means , and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation , regret , and entreaty , to his right honourable cousin . Neither<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>nor<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>could admire the letter ; but it did all that was wanted , in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess .<said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ She was very much honoured , and should be happy in their acquaintance . ”</said>The toils of the business were over , the sweets began . They visited in Laura Place , they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Dalrymple</persName>, and the Honourable<persName>Miss Carteret</persName>, to be arranged wherever they might be most visible : and “ Our cousins in Laura Place , ” — “ Our cousin ,<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>and<persName>Miss Carteret</persName>, ” were talked of to everybody .</p>
    <p n="561"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was ashamed . Had<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>and her daughter even been very agreeable , she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created , but they were nothing . There was no superiority of manner , accomplishment , or understanding .<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>had acquired the name of “ a charming woman , ” because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody .<persName>Miss Carteret</persName>, with still less to say , was so plain and so awkward , that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but for her birth .</p>
    <p n="562"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>confessed she had expected something better ; but yet “ it was an acquaintance worth having ; ” and when<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>ventured to speak her opinion of them to<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, he agreed to their being nothing in themselves , but still maintained that , as a family connexion , as good company , as those who would collect good company around them , they had their value .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>smiled and said ,</p>
    <p n="563"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ My idea of good company ,<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, is the company of clever , well-informed people , who have a great deal of conversation ; that is what I call good company . ”</said></p>
    <p n="564"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ You are mistaken , ”</said>said he gently , “ that is not good company ; that is the best . Good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice . Birth and good manners are essential ; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company ; on the contrary , it will do very well . My cousin<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>shakes her head . She is not satisfied . She is fastidious . My dear cousin ” ( sitting down by her ) ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman I know ; but will it answer ? Will it make you happy ? Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place , and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible ? You may depend upon it , that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter , and as rank is rank , your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family ( our family let me say ) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for . ”</said></p>
    <p n="565"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Yes , ”</said>sighed<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ we shall , indeed , be known to be related to them ! ”</said>then recollecting herself , and not wishing to be answered , she added , “ I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance . I suppose ” ( smiling )<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I have more pride than any of you ; but I confess it does vex me , that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged , which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="566"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ Pardon me , dear cousin , you are unjust in your own claims . In London , perhaps , in your present quiet style of living , it might be as you say : but in Bath ;<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter Elliot</persName>and his family will always be worth knowing : always acceptable as acquaintance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="567"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I certainly am proud , too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place . ”</said></p>
    <p n="568"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ I love your indignation , ”</said>said he ; “ it is very natural . But here you are in Bath , and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter Elliot</persName>. You talk of being proud ; I am called proud , I know , and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise ; for our pride , if investigated , would have the same object , I have no doubt , though the kind may seem a little different . In one point , I am sure , my dear cousin , ” ( he continued , speaking lower , though there was no one else in the room )<said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ in one point , I am sure , we must feel alike . We must feel that every addition to your father 's society , among his equals or superiors , may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="569">He looked , as he spoke , to the seat which<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>had been lately occupying : a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant ; and though<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not believe in their having the same sort of pride , she was pleased with him for not liking<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father 's getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="17">
    <p n="570">While<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>were assiduously pushing their good fortune in Laura Place ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description .</p>
    <p n="571">She had called on her former governess , and had heard from her of there being an old school-fellow in Bath , who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering . Miss Hamilton , now<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had gone unhappy to school , grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved , feeling her separation from home , and suffering as a girl of fourteen , of strong sensibility and not high spirits , must suffer at such a time ; and Miss Hamilton , three years older than herself , but still from the want of near relations and a settled home , remaining another year at school , had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery , and could never be remembered with indifference .</p>
    <p n="572">Miss Hamilton had left school , had married not long afterwards , was said to have married a man of fortune , and this was all that<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had known of her , till now that their governess 's account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form .</p>
    <p n="573">She was a widow and poor . Her husband had been extravagant ; and at his death , about two years before , had left his affairs dreadfully involved . She had had difficulties of every sort to contend with , and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever , which , finally settling in her legs , had made her for the present a cripple . She had come to Bath on that account , and was now in lodgings near the hot baths , living in a very humble way , unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant , and of course almost excluded from society .</p>
    <p n="574">Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>would give<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>therefore lost no time in going . She mentioned nothing of what she had heard , or what she intended , at home . It would excite no proper interest there . She only consulted<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments , and was most happy to convey her as near to<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>'s lodgings in Westgate Buildings , as<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>chose to be taken .</p>
    <p n="575">The visit was paid , their acquaintance re-established , their interest in each other more than re-kindled . The first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion . Twelve years were gone since they had parted , and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined . Twelve years had changed<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>from the blooming , silent , unformed girl of fifteen , to the elegant little woman of seven-and-twenty , with every beauty except bloom , and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle ; and twelve years had transformed the fine-looking , well-grown Miss Hamilton , in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority , into a poor , infirm , helpless widow , receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour ; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away , and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times .</p>
    <p n="576"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>found in<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on , and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation . Neither the dissipations of the past — and she had lived very much in the world — nor the restrictions of the present , neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits .</p>
    <p n="577">In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s astonishment increased . She could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>'s . She had been very fond of her husband : she had buried him . She had been used to affluence : it was gone . She had no child to connect her with life and happiness again , no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs , no health to make all the rest supportable . Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour , and a dark bedroom behind , with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance , which there was only one servant in the house to afford , and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath . Yet , in spite of all this ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression , to hours of occupation and enjoyment . How could it be ? She watched , observed , reflected , and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only . A submissive spirit might be patient , a strong understanding would supply resolution , but here was something more ; here was that elasticity of mind , that disposition to be comforted , that power of turning readily from evil to good , and of finding employment which carried her out of herself , which was from nature alone . It was the choicest gift of Heaven ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>viewed her friend as one of those instances in which , by a merciful appointment , it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want .</p>
    <p n="578">There had been a time ,<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>told her , when her spirits had nearly failed . She could not call herself an invalid now , compared with her state on first reaching Bath . Then she had , indeed , been a pitiable object ; for she had caught cold on the journey , and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain ; and all this among strangers , with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse , and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense . She had weathered it , however , and could truly say that it had done her good . It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands . She had seen too much of the world , to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere , but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve , and would not use her ill ; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse , as a sister of her landlady , a nurse by profession , and who had always a home in that house when unemployed , chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her .<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ And she , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>,<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ besides nursing me most admirably , has really proved an invaluable acquaintance . As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit , which has been a great amusement ; and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases , pin-cushions and card-racks , which you always find me so busy about , and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood . She had a large acquaintance , of course professionally , among those who can afford to buy , and she disposes of my merchandise . She always takes the right time for applying . Everybody 's heart is open , you know , when they have recently escaped from severe pain , or are recovering the blessing of health , and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak . She is a shrewd , intelligent , sensible woman . Hers is a line for seeing human nature ; and she has a fund of good sense and observation , which , as a companion , make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received ‘ the best education in the world , ’ know nothing worth attending to . Call it gossip , if you will , but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour 's leisure to bestow on me , she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable : something that makes one know one 's species better . One likes to hear what is going on , to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly . To me , who live so much alone , her conversation , I assure you , is a treat . ”</said></p>
    <p n="579"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure , replied ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I can easily believe it . Women of that class have great opportunities , and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to . Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing ! And it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting . What instances must pass before them of ardent , disinterested , self-denying attachment , of heroism , fortitude , patience , resignation : of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most . A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="580"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>more doubtingly , “ sometimes it may , though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe . Here and there , human nature may be great in times of trial ; but generally speaking , it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber : it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude , that one hears of . There is so little real friendship in the world ! and unfortunately ” ( speaking low and tremulously )<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late . ”</said></p>
    <p n="581"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>saw the misery of such feelings . The husband had not been what he ought , and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved . It was but a passing emotion however with<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>; she shook it off , and soon added in a different tone —</p>
    <p n="582"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present , will furnish much either to interest or edify me . She is only nursing<persName corresp="#Mrs_Wallis">Mrs Wallis</persName>of Marlborough Buildings ; a mere pretty , silly , expensive , fashionable woman , I believe ; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery . I mean to make my profit of<persName corresp="#Mrs_Wallis">Mrs Wallis</persName>, however . She has plenty of money , and I intend she shall buy all the high-priced things I have in hand now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="583"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had called several times on her friend , before the existence of such a person was known in Camden Place . At last , it became necessary to speak of her .<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>,<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>, returned one morning from Laura Place , with a sudden invitation from<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>for the same evening , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was already engaged , to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings . She was not sorry for the excuse . They were only asked , she was sure , because<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>being kept at home by a bad cold , was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her ; and she declined on her own account with great alacrity —<said who="#Lady_Dalrymple">“ She was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow . ”</said>They were not much interested in anything relative to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>; but still there were questions enough asked , to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was ; and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>was disdainful , and<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>severe .</p>
    <p n="584"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Westgate Buildings ! ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ and who is<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne Elliot</persName>to be visiting in Westgate Buildings ? A<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>. A widow<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>; and who was her husband ? One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere . And what is her attraction ? That she is old and sickly . Upon my word ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne Elliot</persName>, you have the most extraordinary taste ! Everything that revolts other people , low company , paltry rooms , foul air , disgusting associations are inviting to you . But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow : she is not so near her end , I presume , but that she may hope to see another day . What is her age ? Forty ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="585"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ No , sir , she is not one-and-thirty ; but I do not think I can put off my engagement , because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself . She goes into the warm bath to-morrow , and for the rest of the week , you know , we are engaged . ”</said></p>
    <p n="586"><said who="#Elizabeth">“ But what does<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>think of this acquaintance ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>.</p>
    <p n="587"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ She sees nothing to blame in it , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>;<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ on the contrary , she approves it , and has generally taken me when I have called on<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="588"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement , ”</said>observed<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>.<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ Sir Henry<persName>Russell</persName>'s widow , indeed , has no honours to distinguish her arms , but still it is a handsome equipage , and no doubt is well known to convey a<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>. A widow<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>lodging in Westgate Buildings ! A poor widow barely able to live , between thirty and forty ; a mere<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, an every-day<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, of all people and all names in the world , to be the chosen friend of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne Elliot</persName>, and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland !<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>! Such a name ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="589"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>, who had been present while all this passed , now thought it advisable to leave the room , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could have said much , and did long to say a little in defence of her friend 's not very dissimilar claims to theirs , but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her . She made no reply . She left it to himself to recollect , that<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty , with little to live on , and no surname of dignity .</p>
    <p n="590"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>kept her appointment ; the others kept theirs , and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening . She had been the only one of the set absent , for<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>had not only been quite at her ladyship 's service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>; and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>had made a point of leaving<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>early , and<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>. To her , its greatest interest must be , in having been very much talked of between her friend and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>; in having been wished for , regretted , and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause . Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. He thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence . He could meet even<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>in a discussion of her merits ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not be given to understand so much by her friend , could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man , without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create .</p>
    <p n="591"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>was now perfectly decided in her opinion of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>in time as of his deserving her , and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood , and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing . She would not speak to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>with half the certainty she felt on the subject , she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter , of a possible attachment on his side , of the desirableness of the alliance , supposing such attachment to be real and returned .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>heard her , and made no violent exclamations ; she only smiled , blushed , and gently shook her head .</p>
    <p n="592"><said who="#Lady_Russell">“ I am no match-maker , as you well know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>,<said who="#Lady_Russell">“ being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations . I only mean that if<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>should some time hence pay his addresses to you , and if you should be disposed to accept him , I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together . A most suitable connection everybody must consider it , but I think it might be a very happy one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="593"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>is an exceedingly agreeable man , and in many respects I think highly of him , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>;<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ but we should not suit . ”</said></p>
    <p n="594"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>let this pass , and only said in rejoinder ,<said who="#Lady_Russell">“ I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch , the future<persName>Lady Elliot</persName>, to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother 's place , succeeding to all her rights , and all her popularity , as well as to all her virtues , would be the highest possible gratification to me . You are your mother 's self in countenance and disposition ; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was , in situation and name , and home , presiding and blessing in the same spot , and only superior to her in being more highly valued ! My dearest<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="595"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was obliged to turn away , to rise , to walk to a distant table , and , leaning there in pretended employment , try to subdue the feelings this picture excited . For a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched . The idea of becoming what her mother had been ; of having the precious name of “<persName>Lady Elliot</persName>” first revived in herself ; of being restored to Kellynch , calling it her home again , her home for ever , was a charm which she could not immediately resist .<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>said not another word , willing to leave the matter to its own operation ; and believing that , could<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself !— she believed , in short , what<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>did not believe . The same image of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>speaking for himself brought<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>to composure again . The charm of Kellynch and of “<persName>Lady Elliot</persName>” all faded away . She never could accept him . And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one ; her judgement , on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>.</p>
    <p n="596">Though they had now been acquainted a month , she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character . That he was a sensible man , an agreeable man , that he talked well , professed good opinions , seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle , this was all clear enough . He certainly knew what was right , nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed ; but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct . She distrusted the past , if not the present . The names which occasionally dropt of former associates , the allusions to former practices and pursuits , suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been . She saw that there had been bad habits ; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing ; that there had been a period of his life ( and probably not a short one ) when he had been , at least , careless in all serious matters ; and , though he might now think very differently , who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever , cautious man , grown old enough to appreciate a fair character ? How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed ?</p>
    <p n="597"><persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was rational , discreet , polished , but he was not open . There was never any burst of feeling , any warmth of indignation or delight , at the evil or good of others . This , to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, was a decided imperfection . Her early impressions were incurable . She prized the frank , the open-hearted , the eager character beyond all others . Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still . She felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing , than of those whose presence of mind never varied , whose tongue never slipped .</p>
    <p n="598"><persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was too generally agreeable . Various as were the tempers in her father 's house , he pleased them all . He endured too well , stood too well with every body . He had spoken to her with some degree of openness of<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>; had appeared completely to see what<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>was about , and to hold her in contempt ; and yet<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>found him as agreeable as any body .</p>
    <p n="599"><persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>saw either less or more than her young friend , for she saw nothing to excite distrust . She could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>in Kellynch church , in the course of the following autumn .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="18">
    <p n="600">It was the beginning of February ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, having been a month in Bath , was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme . She wanted to hear much more than<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>had communicated . It was three weeks since she had heard at all . She only knew that<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>was at home again ; and that<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, though considered to be recovering fast , was still in Lyme ; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening , when a thicker letter than usual from<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>was delivered to her ; and , to quicken the pleasure and surprise , with<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>'s compliments .</p>
    <p n="601">The Crofts must be in Bath ! A circumstance to interest her . They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally .</p>
    <p n="602"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ What is this ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>.<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ The Crofts have arrived in Bath ? The Crofts who rent Kellynch ? What have they brought you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="603"><said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ A letter from Uppercross Cottage , Sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="604"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ Oh ! those letters are convenient passports . They secure an introduction . I should have visited<persName>Admiral Croft</persName>, however , at any rate . I know what is due to my tenant . ”</said></p>
    <p n="605"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could listen no longer ; she could not even have told how the poor<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>'s complexion escaped ; her letter engrossed her . It had been begun several days back .</p>
    <p n="606"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ February 1st .</said></p>
    <p n="607"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,— I make no apology for my silence , because I know how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath . You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross , which , as you well know , affords little to write about . We have had a very dull Christmas ; Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>have not had one dinner party all the holidays . I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody . The holidays , however , are over at last : I believe no children ever had such long ones . I am sure I had not . The house was cleared yesterday , except of the little Harvilles ; but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home .<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>must be an odd mother to part with them so long . I do not understand it . They are not at all nice children , in my opinion ; but<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>seems to like them quite as well , if not better , than her grandchildren . What dreadful weather we have had ! It may not be felt in Bath , with your nice pavements ; but in the country it is of some consequence . I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January , except<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome . Between ourselves , I think it a great pity<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>did not remain at Lyme as long as<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>; it would have kept her a little out of his way . The carriage is gone to-day , to bring<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>and the Harvilles to-morrow . We are not asked to dine with them , however , till the day after ,<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey , which is not very likely , considering the care that will be taken of her ; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow . I am glad you find<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>so agreeable , and wish I could be acquainted with him too ; but I have my usual luck : I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on ; always the last of my family to be noticed . What an immense time<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>has been staying with<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>! Does she never mean to go away ? But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant , we might not be invited . Let me know what you think of this . I do not expect my children to be asked , you know . I can leave them at the Great House very well , for a month or six weeks . I have this moment heard that the Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately ; they think<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>gouty .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>heard it quite by chance ; they have not had the civility to give me any notice , or of offering to take anything . I do not think they improve at all as neighbours . We see nothing of them , and this is really an instance of gross inattention .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>joins me in love , and everything proper . Yours affectionately ,</said></p>
    <p n="608"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>M — -  .</said></p>
    <p n="609"><said who="#Admiral">“ I am sorry to say that I am very far from well ; and Jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much about . I dare say I shall catch it ; and my sore-throats , you know , are always worse than anybody 's . ”</said></p>
    <p n="610">So ended the first part , which had been afterwards put into an envelope , containing nearly as much more .</p>
    <p n="611"><said who="#Admiral">“ I kept my letter open , that I might send you word how<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>bore her journey , and now I am extremely glad I did , having a great deal to add . In the first place , I had a note from<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>yesterday , offering to convey anything to you ; a very kind , friendly note indeed , addressed to me , just as it ought ; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like .<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">The Admiral</persName>does not seem very ill , and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants . I shall be truly glad to have them back again . Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family . But now for<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>. I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little . She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely , and in the evening we went to ask her how she did , when we were rather surprised not to find<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>of the party , for he had been invited as well as the Harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ? Neither more nor less than his being in love with<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away , and he had written to her father by<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>. True , upon my honour ! Are not you astonished ? I shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it , for I never did .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter . We are all very well pleased , however , for though it is not equal to her marrying<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, it is infinitely better than<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>; and<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>has written his consent , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>is expected to-day .<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister 's account ; but , however ,<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>is a great favourite with both . Indeed ,<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>wonders what<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>will say ; but if you remember , I never thought him attached to<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>; I never could see anything of it . And this is the end , you see , of<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>'s being supposed to be an admirer of yours . How<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me . I hope he will be more agreeable now . Certainly not a great match for<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters . ”</said></p>
    <p n="612"><persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>need not have feared her sister 's being in any degree prepared for the news . She had never in her life been more astonished .<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>! It was almost too wonderful for belief , and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room , preserve an air of calmness , and answer the common questions of the moment . Happily for her , they were not many .<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond .</p>
    <p n="613"><said who="#Elizabeth">“ How is<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>; and without waiting for an answer ,<said who="#Elizabeth">“ And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="614"><said who="#Miss_Elliot">“ They come on<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>'s account . He is thought to be gouty . ”</said></p>
    <p n="615"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ Gout and decrepitude ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>.<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ Poor old gentleman . ”</said></p>
    <p n="616"><said who="#Elizabeth">“ Have they any acquaintance here ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>.</p>
    <p n="617"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ I do not know ; but I can hardly suppose that , at<persName>Admiral Croft</persName>'s time of life , and in his profession , he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="618"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ I suspect , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>coolly ,<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ that<persName>Admiral Croft</persName>will be best known in Bath as the renter of<persName corresp="#Kellynch_Hall">Kellynch Hall</persName>.<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="619"><said who="#Elizabeth">“ Oh , no ! I think not . Situated as we are with<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>, cousins , we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve . If we were not related , it would not signify ; but as cousins , she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours . We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level . There are several odd-looking men walking about here , who , I am told , are sailors . The Crofts will associate with them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="620">This was<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s share of interest in the letter ; when<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>had paid her tribute of more decent attention , in an enquiry after Mrs<persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>, and her fine little boys ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was at liberty .</p>
    <p n="621">In her own room , she tried to comprehend it . Well might<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>wonder how<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>would feel ! Perhaps he had quitted the field , had given<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her . She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity , or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend . She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly .</p>
    <p n="622"><persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>! The high-spirited , joyous-talking<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>, and the dejected , thinking , feeling , reading ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>, seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other . Their minds most dissimilar ! Where could have been the attraction ? The answer soon presented itself . It had been in situation . They had been thrown together several weeks ; they had been living in the same small family party : since<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>'s coming away , they must have been depending almost entirely on each other , and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, just recovering from illness , had been in an interesting state , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>was not inconsolable . That was a point which<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had not been able to avoid suspecting before ; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, from the present course of events , they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself . She did not mean , however , to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity , than<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>might have allowed . She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment . He had an affectionate heart . He must love somebody .</p>
    <p n="623">She saw no reason against their being happy .<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>had fine naval fervour to begin with , and they would soon grow more alike . He would gain cheerfulness , and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron ; nay , that was probably learnt already ; of course they had fallen in love over poetry . The idea of<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>turned into a person of literary taste , and sentimental reflection was amusing , but she had no doubt of its being so . The day at Lyme , the fall from the Cobb , might influence her health , her nerves , her courage , her character to the end of her life , as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate .</p>
    <p n="624">The conclusion of the whole was , that if the woman who had been sensible of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s merits could be allowed to prefer another man , there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder ; and if<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>lost no friend by it , certainly nothing to be regretted . No , it was not regret which made<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s heart beat in spite of herself , and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>unshackled and free . She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate . They were too much like joy , senseless joy !</p>
    <p n="625">She longed to see the Crofts ; but when the meeting took place , it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them . The visit of ceremony was paid and returned ; and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>was mentioned , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>, too , without even half a smile .</p>
    <p n="626">The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street , perfectly to<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s satisfaction . He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance , and did , in fact , think and talk a great deal more about<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>, than<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>ever thought or talked about him .</p>
    <p n="627">The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for , and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form , and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure . They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together . He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout , and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>seemed to go shares with him in everything , and to walk for her life to do him good .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>saw them wherever she went .<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>took her out in her carriage almost every morning , and she never failed to think of them , and never failed to see them . Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her . She always watched them as long as she could , delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of , as they walked along in happy independence , or equally delighted to see<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>'s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend , and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy ,<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her .</p>
    <p n="628"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was too much engaged with<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>to be often walking herself ; but it so happened that one morning , about a week or ten days after the Croft 's arrival , it suited her best to leave her friend , or her friend 's carriage , in the lower part of the town , and return alone to Camden Place , and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>. He was standing by himself at a printshop window , with his hands behind him , in earnest contemplation of some print , and she not only might have passed him unseen , but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice . When he did perceive and acknowledge her , however , it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour .<said who="#the_Admiral">“ Ha ! is it you ? Thank you , thank you . This is treating me like a friend . Here I am , you see , staring at a picture . I can never get by this shop without stopping . But what a thing here is , by way of a boat ! Do look at it . Did you ever see the like ? What queer fellows your fine painters must be , to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that ? And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease , and looking about them at the rocks and mountains , as if they were not to be upset the next moment , which they certainly must be . I wonder where that boat was built ! ”</said>( laughing heartily ) ; “ I would not venture over a horsepond in it . Well , ” ( turning away ) ,<said who="#the_Admiral">“ now , where are you bound ? Can I go anywhere for you , or with you ? Can I be of any use ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="629"><said who="#Lady_Russell">“ None , I thank you , unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together . I am going home . ”</said></p>
    <p n="630"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ That I will , with all my heart , and farther , too . Yes , yes we will have a snug walk together , and I have something to tell you as we go along . There , take my arm ; that 's right ; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there . Lord ! what a boat it is ! ”</said>taking a last look at the picture , as they began to be in motion .</p>
    <p n="631"><said who="#Lady_Russell">“ Did you say that you had something to tell me , sir ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="632"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ Yes , I have , presently . But here comes a friend , Captain Brigden ; I shall only say , ‘ How d'ye do ? ’ as we pass , however . I shall not stop . ‘ How d'ye do ? ’ Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife . She , poor soul , is tied by the leg . She has a blister on one of her heels , as large as a three-shilling piece . If you look across the street , you will see<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>Brand coming down and his brother . Shabby fellows , both of them ! I am glad they are not on this side of the way . Sophy cannot bear them . They played me a pitiful trick once : got away with some of my best men . I will tell you the whole story another time . There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson . Look , he sees us ; he kisses his hand to you ; he takes you for my wife . Ah ! the peace has come too soon for that younker . Poor old Sir Archibald ! How do you like Bath ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>? It suits us very well . We are always meeting with some old friend or other ; the streets full of them every morning ; sure to have plenty of chat ; and then we get away from them all , and shut ourselves in our lodgings , and draw in our chairs , and are snug as if we were at Kellynch , ay , or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal . We do not like our lodgings here the worse , I can tell you , for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth . The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way . ”</said></p>
    <p n="633">When they were got a little farther ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>ventured to press again for what he had to communicate . She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified ; but she was still obliged to wait , for<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont ; and as she was not really<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>, she must let him have his own way . As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont , he began —</p>
    <p n="634"><said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ Well , now you shall hear something that will surprise you . But first of all , you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about . That young lady , you know , that we have all been so concerned for . The Miss Musgrove , that all this has been happening to . Her Christian name : I always forget her Christian name . ”</said></p>
    <p n="635"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did ; but now she could safely suggest the name of “<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>. ”</p>
    <p n="636"><said>“ Ay , ay , Miss<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>, that is the name . I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names . I should never be out if they were all Sophys , or something of that sort . Well , this Miss<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, we all thought , you know , was to marry<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>. He was courting her week after week . The only wonder was , what they could be waiting for , till the business at Lyme came ; then , indeed , it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right . But even then there was something odd in their way of going on . Instead of staying at Lyme , he went off to Plymouth , and then he went off to see<persName>Edward</persName>. When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to<persName>Edward</persName>'s , and there he has been ever since . We have seen nothing of him since November . Even Sophy could not understand it . But now , the matter has taken the strangest turn of all ; for this young lady , the same Miss Musgrove , instead of being to marry<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>, is to marry James<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>. You know James<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="637"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ A little . I am a little acquainted with<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="638"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Well , she is to marry him . Nay , most likely they are married already , for I do not know what they should wait for . ”</said></p>
    <p n="639"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I thought<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>a very pleasing young man , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ and I understand that he bears an excellent character . ”</said></p>
    <p n="640"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ Oh ! yes , yes , there is not a word to be said against James<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>. He is only a commander , it is true , made last summer , and these are bad times for getting on , but he has not another fault that I know of . An excellent , good-hearted fellow , I assure you ; a very active , zealous officer too , which is more than you would think for , perhaps , for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice . ”</said></p>
    <p n="641"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Indeed you are mistaken there , sir ; I should never augur want of spirit from<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>'s manners . I thought them particularly pleasing , and I will answer for it , they would generally please . ”</said></p>
    <p n="642"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ Well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but James<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality , Sophy and I cannot help thinking<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>'s manners better than his . There is something about<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>more to our taste . ”</said></p>
    <p n="643"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was caught . She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other , not at all to represent<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>'s manners as the very best that could possibly be ; and , after a little hesitation , she was beginning to say , “ I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends , ” but<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>interrupted her with —</p>
    <p n="644"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ And the thing is certainly true . It is not a mere bit of gossip . We have it from<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>himself . His sister had a letter from him yesterday , in which he tells us of it , and he had just had it in a letter from<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>, written upon the spot , from Uppercross . I fancy they are all at Uppercross . ”</said></p>
    <p n="645">This was an opportunity which<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not resist ; she said , therefore ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I hope ,<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>, I hope there is nothing in the style of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s letter to make you and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>particularly uneasy . It did seem , last autumn , as if there were an attachment between him and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally , and without violence . I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="646"><said who="#Admiral">“ Not at all , not at all ; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end . ”</said></p>
    <p n="647"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>looked down to hide her smile .</p>
    <p n="648"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ No , no ;<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that . If the girl likes another man better , it is very fit she should have him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="649"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ Certainly . But what I mean is , that I hope there is nothing in<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill-used by his friend , which might appear , you know , without its being absolutely said . I should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>should be destroyed , or even wounded , by a circumstance of this sort . ”</said></p>
    <p n="650"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Yes , yes , I understand you . But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter . He does not give the least fling at<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>; does not so much as say , ‘ I wonder at it , I have a reason of my own for wondering at it . ’ No , you would not guess , from his way of writing , that he had ever thought of this Miss ( what 's her name ? ) for himself . He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together ; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that , I think . ”</said></p>
    <p n="651"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>did not receive the perfect conviction which<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>meant to convey , but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther . She therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet attention , and<persName corresp="#the_Admiral">the Admiral</persName>had it all his own way .</p>
    <p n="652"><said who="#the_Admiral">“ Poor<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>! ”</said>said he at last .<said who="#the_Admiral">“ Now he must begin all over again with somebody else . I think we must get him to Bath . Sophy must write , and beg him to come to Bath . Here are pretty girls enough , I am sure . It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again , for that other Miss Musgrove , I find , is bespoke by her cousin , the young parson . Do not you think ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, we had better try to get him to Bath ? ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="19">
    <p n="653">While<persName>Admiral Croft</persName>was taking this walk with<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, and expressing his wish of getting<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>to Bath ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was already on his way thither . Before<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>had written , he was arrived , and the very next time<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>walked out , she saw him .</p>
    <p n="654"><persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was attending his two cousins and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>. They were in Milsom Street . It began to rain , not much , but enough to make shelter desirable for women , and quite enough to make it very desirable for<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>to have the advantage of being conveyed home in<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>'s carriage , which was seen waiting at a little distance ; she ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>, therefore , turned into Molland 's , while<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>stepped to<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>, to request her assistance . He soon joined them again , successful , of course ;<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>would be most happy to take them home , and would call for them in a few minutes .</p>
    <p n="655">Her ladyship 's carriage was a barouche , and did not hold more than four with any comfort .<persName>Miss Carteret</persName>was with her mother ; consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden Place ladies . There could be no doubt as to<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>. Whoever suffered inconvenience , she must suffer none , but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two . The rain was a mere trifle , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was most sincere in preferring a walk with<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. But the rain was also a mere trifle to<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all , and her boots were so thick ! much thicker than<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne</persName>'s ; and , in short , her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>as<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could be , and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined , that the others were obliged to settle it for them ;<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>maintaining that<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>had a little cold already , and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>deciding on appeal , that his cousin<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s boots were rather the thickest .</p>
    <p n="656">It was fixed accordingly , that<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>should be of the party in the carriage ; and they had just reached this point , when<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, as she sat near the window , descried , most decidedly and distinctly ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>walking down the street .</p>
    <p n="657">Her start was perceptible only to herself ; but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world , the most unaccountable and absurd ! For a few minutes she saw nothing before her ; it was all confusion . She was lost , and when she had scolded back her senses , she found the others still waiting for the carriage , and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>( always obliging ) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>'s .</p>
    <p n="658">She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door ; she wanted to see if it rained . Why was she to suspect herself of another motive ?<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>must be out of sight . She left her seat , she would go ; one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half , or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was . She would see if it rained . She was sent back , however , in a moment by the entrance of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>himself , among a party of gentlemen and ladies , evidently his acquaintance , and whom he must have joined a little below Milsom Street . He was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before ; he looked quite red . For the first time , since their renewed acquaintance , she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two . She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments . All the overpowering , blinding , bewildering , first effects of strong surprise were over with her . Still , however , she had enough to feel ! It was agitation , pain , pleasure , a something between delight and misery .</p>
    <p n="659">He spoke to her , and then turned away . The character of his manner was embarrassment . She could not have called it either cold or friendly , or anything so certainly as embarrassed .</p>
    <p n="660">After a short interval , however , he came towards her , and spoke again . Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed : neither of them , probably , much the wiser for what they heard , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly . They had by dint of being so very much together , got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness ; but he could not do it now . Time had changed him , or<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>had changed him . There was consciousness of some sort or other . He looked very well , not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits , and he talked of Uppercross , of the Musgroves , nay , even of<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her ; but yet it was<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>not comfortable , not easy , not able to feign that he was .</p>
    <p n="661">It did not surprise , but it grieved<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>to observe that<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>would not know him . She saw that he saw<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, that<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>saw him , that there was complete internal recognition on each side ; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance , expecting it , and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness .</p>
    <p n="662"><persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>'s carriage , for which<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>was growing very impatient , now drew up ; the servant came in to announce it . It was beginning to rain again , and altogether there was a delay , and a bustle , and a talking , which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>was calling to convey<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>. At last<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>and her friend , unattended but by the servant , ( for there was no cousin returned ) , were walking off ; and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, watching them , turned again to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, and by manner , rather than words , was offering his services to her .</p>
    <p n="663"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ I am much obliged to you , ”</said>was her answer ,<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ but I am not going with them . The carriage would not accommodate so many . I walk : I prefer walking . ”</said></p>
    <p n="664"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ But it rains . ”</said></p>
    <p n="665"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Oh ! very little , Nothing that I regard . ”</said></p>
    <p n="666">After a moment 's pause he said : “ Though I came only yesterday , I have equipped myself properly for Bath already , you see , ” ( pointing to a new umbrella ) ;<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I wish you would make use of it , if you are determined to walk ; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair . ”</said></p>
    <p n="667">She was very much obliged to him , but declined it all , repeating her conviction , that the rain would come to nothing at present , and adding ,<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ I am only waiting for<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. He will be here in a moment , I am sure . ”</said></p>
    <p n="668">She had hardly spoken the words when<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>walked in .<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>recollected him perfectly . There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme , admiring<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>as she passed , except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend . He came in with eagerness , appeared to see and think only of her , apologised for his stay , was grieved to have kept her waiting , and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased ; and in another moment they walked off together , her arm under his , a gentle and embarrassed glance , and a “ Good morning to you ! ” being all that she had time for , as she passed away .</p>
    <p n="669">As soon as they were out of sight , the ladies of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s party began talking of them .</p>
    <p n="670"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>does not dislike his cousin , I fancy ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="671"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Oh ! no , that is clear enough . One can guess what will happen there . He is always with them ; half lives in the family , I believe . What a very good-looking man ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="672"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Yes , and Miss Atkinson , who dined with him once at the Wallises , says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with . ”</said></p>
    <p n="673"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ She is pretty , I think ;<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>; very pretty , when one comes to look at her . It is not the fashion to say so , but I confess I admire her more than her sister . ”</said></p>
    <p n="674"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Oh ! so do I . ”</said></p>
    <p n="675"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ And so do I . No comparison . But the men are all wild after<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>.<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>is too delicate for them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="676"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>would have been particularly obliged to her cousin , if he would have walked by her side all the way to Camden Place , without saying a word . She had never found it so difficult to listen to him , though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care , and though his subjects were principally such as were wont to be always interesting : praise , warm , just , and discriminating , of<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, and insinuations highly rational against<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>. But just now she could think only of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>. She could not understand his present feelings , whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not ; and till that point were settled , she could not be quite herself .</p>
    <p n="677">She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time ; but alas ! alas ! she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet .</p>
    <p n="678">Another circumstance very essential for her to know , was how long he meant to be in Bath ; he had not mentioned it , or she could not recollect it . He might be only passing through . But it was more probable that he should be come to stay . In that case , so liable as every body was to meet every body in Bath ,<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>would in all likelihood see him somewhere . Would she recollect him ? How would it all be ?</p>
    <p n="679">She had already been obliged to tell<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>that<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>was to marry<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>. It had cost her something to encounter<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s surprise ; and now , if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him .</p>
    <p n="680">The following morning<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was out with her friend , and for the first hour , in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain ; but at last , in returning down Pulteney Street , she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street . There were many other men about him , many groups walking the same way , but there was no mistaking him . She looked instinctively at<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>; but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself . No , it was not to be supposed that<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>would perceive him till they were nearly opposite . She looked at her however , from time to time , anxiously ; and when the moment approached which must point him out , though not daring to look again ( for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen ) , she was yet perfectly conscious of<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him — of her being , in short , intently observing him . She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s mind , the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes , the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him , and in foreign climes and in active service too , without robbing him of one personal grace !</p>
    <p n="681">At last ,<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>drew back her head .<said who="#Lady_Russell">“ Now , how would she speak of him ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="682"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ You will wonder , ”</said>said she ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ what has been fixing my eye so long ; but I was looking after some window-curtains , which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night . They described the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way , and this part of the street , as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath , but could not recollect the exact number , and I have been trying to find out which it could be ; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description . ”</said></p>
    <p n="683"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>sighed and blushed and smiled , in pity and disdain , either at her friend or herself . The part which provoked her most , was that in all this waste of foresight and caution , she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them .</p>
    <p n="684">A day or two passed without producing anything . The theatre or the rooms , where he was most likely to be , were not fashionable enough for the Elliots , whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties , in which they were getting more and more engaged ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, wearied of such a state of stagnation , sick of knowing nothing , and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried , was quite impatient for the concert evening . It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>. Of course they must attend . It was really expected to be a good one , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was very fond of music . If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again , she fancied she should be satisfied ; and as to the power of addressing him , she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred .<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>had turned from him ,<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>overlooked him ; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances ; she felt that she owed him attention .</p>
    <p n="685">She had once partly promised<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>to spend the evening with her ; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off , with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>gave a most good-humoured acquiescence .</p>
    <p n="686"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ By all means , ”</said>said she ;<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ only tell me all about it , when you do come . Who is your party ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="687"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>named them all .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>made no reply ; but when she was leaving her said , and with an expression half serious , half arch ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Well , I heartily wish your concert may answer ; and do not fail me to-morrow if you can come ; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="688"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was startled and confused ; but after standing in a moment 's suspense , was obliged , and not sorry to be obliged , to hurry away .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="20">
    <p n="689"><persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, his two daughters , and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>, were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening ; and as<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>must be waited for , they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room . But hardly were they so settled , when the door opened again , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>walked in alone .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was the nearest to him , and making yet a little advance , she instantly spoke . He was preparing only to bow and pass on , but her gentle “ How do you do ? ” brought him out of the straight line to stand near her , and make enquiries in return , in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground . Their being in the back ground was a support to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>; she knew nothing of their looks , and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done .</p>
    <p n="690">While they were speaking , a whispering between her father and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>caught her ear . She could not distinguish , but she must guess the subject ; and on<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s making a distant bow , she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance , and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>herself . This , though late , and reluctant , and ungracious , was yet better than nothing , and her spirits improved .</p>
    <p n="691">After talking , however , of the weather , and Bath , and the concert , their conversation began to flag , and so little was said at last , that she was expecting him to go every moment , but he did not ; he seemed in no hurry to leave her ; and presently with renewed spirit , with a little smile , a little glow , he said —</p>
    <p n="692"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme . I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock , and the more from its not overpowering you at the time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="693">She assured him that she had not .</p>
    <p n="694"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ It was a frightful hour , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ a frightful day ! ”</said>and he passed his hand across his eyes , as if the remembrance were still too painful , but in a moment , half smiling again , added ,<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ The day has produced some effects however ; has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful . When you had the presence of mind to suggest that<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon , you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery . ”</said></p>
    <p n="695"><said who="#Elizabeth">“ Certainly I could have none . But it appears — I should hope it would be a very happy match . There are on both sides good principles and good temper . ”</said></p>
    <p n="696"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Yes , ”</said>said he , looking not exactly forward ;<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ but there , I think , ends the resemblance . With all my soul I wish them happy , and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it . They have no difficulties to contend with at home , no opposition , no caprice , no delays . The Musgroves are behaving like themselves , most honourably and kindly , only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter 's comfort . All this is much , very much in favour of their happiness ; more than perhaps — ”</said></p>
    <p n="697">He stopped . A sudden recollection seemed to occur , and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground . After clearing his throat , however , he proceeded thus —</p>
    <p n="698"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I confess that I do think there is a disparity , too great a disparity , and in a point no less essential than mind . I regard<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>as a very amiable , sweet-tempered girl , and not deficient in understanding , but<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>is something more . He is a clever man , a reading man ; and I confess , that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise . Had it been the effect of gratitude , had he learnt to love her , because he believed her to be preferring him , it would have been another thing . But I have no reason to suppose it so . It seems , on the contrary , to have been a perfectly spontaneous , untaught feeling on his side , and this surprises me . A man like him , in his situation ! with a heart pierced , wounded , almost broken ! Fanny<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>was a very superior creature , and his attachment to her was indeed attachment . A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman . He ought not ; he does not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="699">Either from the consciousness , however , that his friend had recovered , or from other consciousness , he went no farther ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>who , in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered , and in spite of all the various noises of the room , the almost ceaseless slam of the door , and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through , had distinguished every word , was struck , gratified , confused , and beginning to breathe very quick , and feel an hundred things in a moment . It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject ; and yet , after a pause , feeling the necessity of speaking , and having not the smallest wish for a total change , she only deviated so far as to say —</p>
    <p n="700"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ You were a good while at Lyme , I think ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="701"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ About a fortnight . I could not leave it till<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>'s doing well was quite ascertained . I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace . It had been my doing , solely mine . She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak . The country round Lyme is very fine . I walked and rode a great deal ; and the more I saw , the more I found to admire . ”</said></p>
    <p n="702"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I should very much like to see Lyme again , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="703"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Indeed ! I should not have supposed that you could have found anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling . The horror and distress you were involved in , the stretch of mind , the wear of spirits ! I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust . ”</said></p>
    <p n="704"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ The last hours were certainly very painful , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>; “ but when pain is over , the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure . One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it , unless it has been all suffering , nothing but suffering , which was by no means the case at Lyme . We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours , and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment . So much novelty and beauty ! I have travelled so little , that every fresh place would be interesting to me ; but there is real beauty at Lyme ; and in short ” ( with a faint blush at some recollections ) ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable . ”</said></p>
    <p n="705">As she ceased , the entrance door opened again , and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting .<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>,<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>, ”</said>was the rejoicing sound ; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her .<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>and<persName>Miss Carteret</persName>, escorted by<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>and<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant , advanced into the room . The others joined them , and it was a group in which<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>found herself also necessarily included . She was divided from<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>. Their interesting , almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time , but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on ! She had learnt , in the last ten minutes , more of his feelings towards<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of ; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party , to the needful civilities of the moment , with exquisite , though agitated sensations . She was in good humour with all . She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all , and to pity every one , as being less happy than herself .</p>
    <p n="706">The delightful emotions were a little subdued , when on stepping back from the group , to be joined again by<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, she saw that he was gone . She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room . He was gone ; he had disappeared , she felt a moment 's regret . But “ they should meet again . He would look for her , he would find her out before the evening were over , and at present , perhaps , it was as well to be asunder . She was in need of a little interval for recollection . ”</p>
    <p n="707">Upon<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s appearance soon afterwards , the whole party was collected , and all that remained was to marshal themselves , and proceed into the Concert Room ; and be of all the consequence in their power , draw as many eyes , excite as many whispers , and disturb as many people as they could .</p>
    <p n="708">Very , very happy were both<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>as they walked in .<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>arm in arm with<persName>Miss Carteret</persName>, and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Dalrymple</persName>before her , had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>— but it would be an insult to the nature of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s felicity , to draw any comparison between it and her sister 's ; the origin of one all selfish vanity , of the other all generous attachment .</p>
    <p n="709"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>saw nothing , thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room . Her happiness was from within . Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed ; but she knew nothing about it . She was thinking only of the last half hour , and as they passed to their seats , her mind took a hasty range over it . His choice of subjects , his expressions , and still more his manner and look , had been such as she could see in only one light . His opinion of<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>'s inferiority , an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give , his wonder at<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>, his feelings as to a first , strong attachment ; sentences begun which he could not finish , his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance , all , all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least ; that anger , resentment , avoidance , were no more ; and that they were succeeded , not merely by friendship and regard , but by the tenderness of the past . Yes , some share of the tenderness of the past . She could not contemplate the change as implying less . He must love her .</p>
    <p n="710">These were thoughts , with their attendant visions , which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation ; and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him , without even trying to discern him . When their places were determined on , and they were all properly arranged , she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room , but he was not ; her eye could not reach him ; and the concert being just opening , she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way .</p>
    <p n="711">The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches :<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was among those on the foremost , and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>had manoeuvred so well , with the assistance of his friend<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>, as to have a seat by her .<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, surrounded by her cousins , and the principal object of<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>'s gallantry , was quite contented .</p>
    <p n="712"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening ; it was just occupation enough : she had feelings for the tender , spirits for the gay , attention for the scientific , and patience for the wearisome ; and had never liked a concert better , at least during the first act . Towards the close of it , in the interval succeeding an Italian song , she explained the words of the song to<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. They had a concert bill between them .</p>
    <p n="713"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ This , ”</said>said she ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ is nearly the sense , or rather the meaning of the words , for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of , but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give ; for I do not pretend to understand the language . I am a very poor Italian scholar . ”</said></p>
    <p n="714"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ Yes , yes , I see you are . I see you know nothing of the matter . You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted , transposed , curtailed Italian lines , into clear , comprehensible , elegant English . You need not say anything more of your ignorance . Here is complete proof . ”</said></p>
    <p n="715"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I will not oppose such kind politeness ; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient . ”</said></p>
    <p n="716"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long , ”</said>replied he ,<said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ without knowing something of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne Elliot</persName>; and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments , and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman . ”</said></p>
    <p n="717"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ For shame ! for shame ! this is too much flattery . I forget what we are to have next , ”</said>turning to the bill .</p>
    <p n="718"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ Perhaps , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, speaking low ,<said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of . ”</said></p>
    <p n="719"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Indeed ! How so ? You can have been acquainted with it only since I came to Bath , excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family . ”</said></p>
    <p n="720"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ I knew you by report long before you came to Bath . I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately . I have been acquainted with you by character many years . Your person , your disposition , accomplishments , manner ; they were all present to me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="721"><persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise . No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery . To have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance , by nameless people , is irresistible ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was all curiosity . She wondered , and questioned him eagerly ; but in vain . He delighted in being asked , but he would not tell .</p>
    <p n="722"><said>“ No , no , some time or other , perhaps , but not now . He would mention no names now ; but such , he could assure her , had been the fact . He had many years ago received such a description of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne Elliot</persName>as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit , and excited the warmest curiosity to know her . ”</said></p>
    <p n="723"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>of Monkford ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s brother . He might have been in<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s company , but she had not courage to ask the question .</p>
    <p n="724"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ The name of<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>, ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ has long had an interesting sound to me . Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy ; and , if I dared , I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change . ”</said></p>
    <p n="725">Such , she believed , were his words ; but scarcely had she received their sound , than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her , which rendered every thing else trivial . Her father and<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>were speaking .</p>
    <p n="726"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ A well-looking man , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>,<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ a very well-looking man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="727"><said who="#Lady_Dalrymple">“ A very fine young man indeed ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>.<said who="#Lady_Dalrymple">“ More air than one often sees in Bath . Irish , I dare say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="728"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ No , I just know his name . A bowing acquaintance .<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>;<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>of the navy . His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire , the Croft , who rents Kellynch . ”</said></p>
    <p n="729">Before<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>had reached this point ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s eyes had caught the right direction , and distinguished<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>standing among a cluster of men at a little distance . As her eyes fell on him , his seemed to be withdrawn from her . It had that appearance . It seemed as if she had been one moment too late ; and as long as she dared observe , he did not look again : but the performance was recommencing , and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward .</p>
    <p n="730">When she could give another glance , he had moved away . He could not have come nearer to her if he would ; she was so surrounded and shut in : but she would rather have caught his eye .</p>
    <p n="731"><persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s speech , too , distressed her . She had no longer any inclination to talk to him . She wished him not so near her .</p>
    <p n="732">The first act was over . Now she hoped for some beneficial change ; and , after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party , some of them did decide on going in quest of tea .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was one of the few who did not choose to move . She remained in her seat , and so did<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>; and she did not mean , whatever she might feel on<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s account , to shrink from conversation with<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, if he gave her the opportunity . She was persuaded by<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s countenance that she had seen him .</p>
    <p n="733">He did not come however .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance , but he never came . The anxious interval wore away unproductively . The others returned , the room filled again , benches were reclaimed and repossessed , and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out , another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes , as real or affected taste for it prevailed . To<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation . She could not quit that room in peace without seeing<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>once more , without the interchange of one friendly look .</p>
    <p n="734">In re-settling themselves there were now many changes , the result of which was favourable for her .<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>declined sitting down again , and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was invited by<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>and<persName>Miss Carteret</persName>, in a manner not to be refused , to sit between them ; and by some other removals , and a little scheming of her own ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before , much more within reach of a passer-by . She could not do so , without comparing herself with Miss Larolles , the inimitable Miss Larolles ; but still she did it , and not with much happier effect ; though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours , she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed .</p>
    <p n="735">Such was her situation , with a vacant space at hand , when<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was again in sight . She saw him not far off . He saw her too ; yet he looked grave , and seemed irresolute , and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her . She felt that something must be the matter . The change was indubitable . The difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room was strikingly great . Why was it ? She thought of her father , of<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>. Could there have been any unpleasant glances ? He began by speaking of the concert gravely , more like the<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>of Uppercross ; owned himself disappointed , had expected singing ; and in short , must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>replied , and spoke in defence of the performance so well , and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly , that his countenance improved , and he replied again with almost a smile . They talked for a few minutes more ; the improvement held ; he even looked down towards the bench , as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying ; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>to turn round . It came from<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. He begged her pardon , but she must be applied to , to explain Italian again .<persName>Miss Carteret</persName>was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not refuse ; but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit .</p>
    <p n="736">A few minutes , though as few as possible , were inevitably consumed ; and when her own mistress again , when able to turn and look as she had done before , she found herself accosted by<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell .<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ He must wish her good night ; he was going ; he should get home as fast as he could . ”</said></p>
    <p n="737"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Is not this song worth staying for ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging .</p>
    <p n="738"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ No ! ”</said>he replied impressively , “ there is nothing worth my staying for ; ” and he was gone directly .</p>
    <p n="739">Jealousy of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>! It was the only intelligible motive .<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>jealous of her affection ! Could she have believed it a week ago ; three hours ago ! For a moment the gratification was exquisite . But , alas ! there were very different thoughts to succeed . How was such jealousy to be quieted ? How was the truth to reach him ? How , in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations , would he ever learn of her real sentiments ? It was misery to think of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s attentions . Their evil was incalculable .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="21">
    <p n="740"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>would be most likely to call ; for to avoid<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was almost a first object .</p>
    <p n="741">She felt a great deal of good-will towards him . In spite of the mischief of his attentions , she owed him gratitude and regard , perhaps compassion . She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance , of the right which he seemed to have to interest her , by everything in situation , by his own sentiments , by his early prepossession . It was altogether very extraordinary ; flattering , but painful . There was much to regret . How she might have felt had there been no<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>in the case , was not worth enquiry ; for there was a<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad , her affection would be his for ever . Their union , she believed , could not divide her more from other men , than their final separation .</p>
    <p n="742">Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy , could never have passed along the streets of Bath , than<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings . It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way .</p>
    <p n="743">She was sure of a pleasant reception ; and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming , seemed hardly to have expected her , though it had been an appointment .</p>
    <p n="744">An account of the concert was immediately claimed ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it . All that she could tell she told most gladly , but the all was little for one who had been there , and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, who had already heard , through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter , rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could relate , and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company . Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well know by name to<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>.</p>
    <p n="745"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ The little Durands were there , I conclude , ”</said>said she ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ with their mouths open to catch the music , like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed . They never miss a concert . ”</said></p>
    <p n="746"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Yes ; I did not see them myself , but I heard<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>say they were in the room . ”</said></p>
    <p n="747"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ The Ibbotsons , were they there ? and the two new beauties , with the tall Irish officer , who is talked of for one of them . ”</said></p>
    <p n="748"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ I do not know . I do not think they were . ”</said></p>
    <p n="749"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Old Lady<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>Maclean ? I need not ask after her . She never misses , I know ; and you must have seen her . She must have been in your own circle ; for as you went with<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>, you were in the seats of grandeur , round the orchestra , of course . ”</said></p>
    <p n="750"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ No , that was what I dreaded . It would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect . But happily<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>always chooses to be farther off ; and we were exceedingly well placed , that is , for hearing ; I must not say for seeing , because I appear to have seen very little . ”</said></p>
    <p n="751"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Oh ! you saw enough for your own amusement . I can understand . There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd , and this you had . You were a large party in yourselves , and you wanted nothing beyond . ”</said></p>
    <p n="752"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ But I ought to have looked about me more , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about , that the object only had been deficient .</p>
    <p n="753"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ No , no ; you were better employed . You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening . I see it in your eye . I perfectly see how the hours passed : that you had always something agreeable to listen to . In the intervals of the concert it was conversation . ”</said></p>
    <p n="754"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>half smiled and said ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Do you see that in my eye ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="755"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Yes , I do . Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world , the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together . ”</said></p>
    <p n="756">A blush overspread<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s cheeks . She could say nothing .</p>
    <p n="757"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ And such being the case , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, after a short pause ,<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning . It is really very good of you to come and sit with me , when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="758"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>heard nothing of this . She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend 's penetration , unable to imagine how any report of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>could have reached her . After another short silence —</p>
    <p n="759"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Pray , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>,<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ is<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>aware of your acquaintance with me ? Does he know that I am in Bath ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="760"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>! ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, looking up surprised . A moment 's reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under . She caught it instantaneously ; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety , soon added , more composedly ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Are you acquainted with<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="761"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ I have been a good deal acquainted with him , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, gravely ,<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ but it seems worn out now . It is a great while since we met . ”</said></p>
    <p n="762"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I was not at all aware of this . You never mentioned it before . Had I known it , I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="763"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ To confess the truth , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, assuming her usual air of cheerfulness ,<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have . I want you to talk about me to<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. I want your interest with him . He can be of essential service to me ; and if you would have the goodness , my dear<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, to make it an object to yourself , of course it is done . ”</said></p>
    <p n="764"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I should be extremely happy ; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>;<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, a greater right to influence him , than is really the case . I am sure you have , somehow or other , imbibed such a notion . You must consider me only as<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s relation . If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="765"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>gave her a penetrating glance , and then , smiling , said —</p>
    <p n="766"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ I have been a little premature , I perceive ; I beg your pardon . I ought to have waited for official information , But now , my dear<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, as an old friend , do give me a hint as to when I may speak . Next week ? To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled , and build my own selfish schemes on<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s good fortune . ”</said></p>
    <p n="767"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ No , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ nor next week , nor next , nor next . I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week . I am not going to marry<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. I should like to know why you imagine I am ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="768"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>looked at her again , looked earnestly , smiled , shook her head , and exclaimed —</p>
    <p n="769"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Now , how I do wish I understood you ! How I do wish I knew what you were at ! I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel , when the right moment occurs . Till it does come , you know , we women never mean to have anybody . It is a thing of course among us , that every man is refused , till he offers . But why should you be cruel ? Let me plead for my — present friend I cannot call him , but for my former friend . Where can you look for a more suitable match ? Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike , agreeable man ? Let me recommend<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>; and who can know him better than<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="770"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>,<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s wife has not been dead much above half a year . He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="771"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Oh ! if these are your only objections , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, archly ,<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>is safe , and I shall give myself no more trouble about him . Do not forget me when you are married , that 's all . Let him know me to be a friend of yours , and then he will think little of the trouble required , which it is very natural for him now , with so many affairs and engagements of his own , to avoid and get rid of as he can ; very natural , perhaps . Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same . Of course , he cannot be aware of the importance to me . Well , my dear<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, I hope and trust you will be very happy .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>has sense to understand the value of such a woman . Your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been . You are safe in all worldly matters , and safe in his character . He will not be led astray ; he will not be misled by others to his ruin . ”</said></p>
    <p n="772"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I can readily believe all that of my cousin . He seems to have a calm decided temper , not at all open to dangerous impressions . I consider him with great respect . I have no reason , from any thing that has fallen within my observation , to do otherwise . But I have not known him long ; and he is not a man , I think , to be known intimately soon . Will not this manner of speaking of him ,<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, convince you that he is nothing to me ? Surely this must be calm enough . And , upon my word , he is nothing to me . Should he ever propose to me ( which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing ) , I shall not accept him . I assure you I shall not . I assure you ,<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>had not the share which you have been supposing , in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford : not<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>; it is not<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>that — ”</said></p>
    <p n="773">She stopped , regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much ; but less would hardly have been sufficient .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>would hardly have believed so soon in<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s failure , but from the perception of there being a somebody else . As it was , she instantly submitted , and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, eager to escape farther notice , was impatient to know why<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>should have fancied she was to marry<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>; where she could have received the idea , or from whom she could have heard it .</p>
    <p n="774"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ Do tell me how it first came into your head . ”</said></p>
    <p n="775"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ It first came into my head , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>,<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ upon finding how much you were together , and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you ; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way . But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago . ”</said></p>
    <p n="776"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ And has it indeed been spoken of ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="777"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="778"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ No . Was not it Mrs Speed , as usual , or the maid ? I observed no one in particular . ”</said></p>
    <p n="779"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ It was my friend Mrs Rooke ; Nurse Rooke ; who , by-the-bye , had a great curiosity to see you , and was delighted to be in the way to let you in . She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday ; and she it was who told me you were to marry<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. She had had it from<persName corresp="#Mrs_Wallis">Mrs Wallis</persName>herself , which did not seem bad authority . She sat an hour with me on Monday evening , and gave me the whole history . ”</said>“ The whole history , ” repeated<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, laughing .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ She could not make a very long history , I think , of one such little article of unfounded news . ”</said></p>
    <p n="780"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>said nothing .</p>
    <p n="781"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ But , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, presently ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ though there is no truth in my having this claim on<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could . Shall I mention to him your being in Bath ? Shall I take any message ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="782"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ No , I thank you : no , certainly not . In the warmth of the moment , and under a mistaken impression , I might , perhaps , have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances ; but not now . No , I thank you , I have nothing to trouble you with . ”</said></p>
    <p n="783"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I think you spoke of having known<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>many years ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="784"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ I did . ”</said></p>
    <p n="785"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Not before he was married , I suppose ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="786"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Yes ; he was not married when I knew him first . ”</said></p>
    <p n="787"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ And — were you much acquainted ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="788"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Intimately . ”</said></p>
    <p n="789"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Indeed ! Then do tell me what he was at that time of life . I have a great curiosity to know what<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was as a very young man . Was he at all such as he appears now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="790"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ I have not seen<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>these three years , ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>'s answer , given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity . They were both silent :<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>very thoughtful . At last —</p>
    <p n="791"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I beg your pardon , my dear<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, ”</said>she cried , in her natural tone of cordiality ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you , but I have been uncertain what I ought to do . I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you . There were many things to be taken into the account . One hates to be officious , to be giving bad impressions , making mischief . Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving , though there may be nothing durable beneath . However , I have determined ; I think I am right ; I think you ought to be made acquainted with<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s real character . Though I fully believe that , at present , you have not the smallest intention of accepting him , there is no saying what may happen . You might , some time or other , be differently affected towards him . Hear the truth , therefore , now , while you are unprejudiced .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>is a man without heart or conscience ; a designing , wary , cold-blooded being , who thinks only of himself ; whom for his own interest or ease , would be guilty of any cruelty , or any treachery , that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character . He has no feeling for others . Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin , he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction . He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion . Oh ! he is black at heart , hollow and black ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="792"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s astonished air , and exclamation of wonder , made her pause , and in a calmer manner , she added ,</p>
    <p n="793"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ My expressions startle you . You must allow for an injured , angry woman . But I will try to command myself . I will not abuse him . I will only tell you what I have found him . Facts shall speak . He was the intimate friend of my dear husband , who trusted and loved him , and thought him as good as himself . The intimacy had been formed before our marriage . I found them most intimate friends ; and I , too , became excessively pleased with<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, and entertained the highest opinion of him . At nineteen , you know , one does not think very seriously ; but<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>appeared to me quite as good as others , and much more agreeable than most others , and we were almost always together . We were principally in town , living in very good style . He was then the inferior in circumstances ; he was then the poor one ; he had chambers in the Temple , and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman . He had always a home with us whenever he chose it ; he was always welcome ; he was like a brother . My poor<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, who had the finest , most generous spirit in the world , would have divided his last farthing with him ; and I know that his purse was open to him ; I know that he often assisted him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="794"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ This must have been about that very period of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s life , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ which has always excited my particular curiosity . It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister . I never knew him myself ; I only heard of him ; but there was a something in his conduct then , with regard to my father and sister , and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage , which I never could quite reconcile with present times . It seemed to announce a different sort of man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="795"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ I know it all , I know it all , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>.<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ He had been introduced to<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and your sister before I was acquainted with him , but I heard him speak of them for ever . I know he was invited and encouraged , and I know he did not choose to go . I can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , I knew all about it at the time . I was privy to all the fors and againsts ; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans ; and though I did not know his wife previously , her inferior situation in society , indeed , rendered that impossible , yet I knew her all her life afterwards , or at least till within the last two years of her life , and can answer any question you may wish to put . ”</said></p>
    <p n="796"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Nay , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I have no particular enquiry to make about her . I have always understood they were not a happy couple . But I should like to know why , at that time of his life , he should slight my father 's acquaintance as he did . My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him . Why did<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>draw back ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="797"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>,<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ at that period of his life , had one object in view : to make his fortune , and by a rather quicker process than the law . He was determined to make it by marriage . He was determined , at least , not to mar it by an imprudent marriage ; and I know it was his belief ( whether justly or not , of course I cannot decide ) , that your father and sister , in their civilities and invitations , were designing a match between the heir and the young lady , and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence . That was his motive for drawing back , I can assure you . He told me the whole story . He had no concealments with me . It was curious , that having just left you behind me in Bath , my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin ; and that , through him , I should be continually hearing of your father and sister . He described one<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, and I thought very affectionately of the other . ”</said></p>
    <p n="798"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Perhaps , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, struck by a sudden idea ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ you sometimes spoke of me to<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>? ”</said></p>
    <p n="799"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ To be sure I did ; very often . I used to boast of my own<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>, and vouch for your being a very different creature from — ”</said></p>
    <p n="800">She checked herself just in time .</p>
    <p n="801"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ This accounts for something which<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>said last night , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ This explains it . I found he had been used to hear of me . I could not comprehend how . What wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned ! How sure to be mistaken ! But I beg your pardon ; I have interrupted you .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>married then completely for money ? The circumstances , probably , which first opened your eyes to his character . ”</said></p>
    <p n="802"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>hesitated a little here .<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Oh ! those things are too common . When one lives in the world , a man or woman 's marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought . I was very young , and associated only with the young , and we were a thoughtless , gay set , without any strict rules of conduct . We lived for enjoyment . I think differently now ; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions ; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was doing . ‘ To do the best for himself , ’ passed as a duty . ”</said></p>
    <p n="803"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ But was not she a very low woman ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="804"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Yes ; which I objected to , but he would not regard . Money , money , was all that he wanted . Her father was a grazier , her grandfather had been a butcher , but that was all nothing . She was a fine woman , had had a decent education , was brought forward by some cousins , thrown by chance into<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s company , and fell in love with him ; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side , with respect to her birth . All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune , before he committed himself . Depend upon it , whatever esteem<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>may have for his own situation in life now , as a young man he had not the smallest value for it . His chance for the Kellynch estate was something , but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt . I have often heard him declare , that if baronetcies were saleable , anybody should have his for fifty pounds , arms and motto , name and livery included ; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject . It would not be fair ; and yet you ought to have proof , for what is all this but assertion , and you shall have proof . ”</said></p>
    <p n="805"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Indeed , my dear<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, I want none , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ You have asserted nothing contradictory to what<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>appeared to be some years ago . This is all in confirmation , rather , of what we used to hear and believe . I am more curious to know why he should be so different now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="806"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ But for my satisfaction , if you will have the goodness to ring for<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>; stay : I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom , and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet . ”</said></p>
    <p n="807"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it , did as she was desired . The box was brought and placed before her , and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, sighing over it as she unlocked it , said —</p>
    <p n="808"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ This is full of papers belonging to him , to my husband ; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him . The letter I am looking for was one written by<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>to him before our marriage , and happened to be saved ; why , one can hardly imagine . But he was careless and immethodical , like other men , about those things ; and when I came to examine his papers , I found it with others still more trivial , from different people scattered here and there , while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed . Here it is ; I would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy . I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="809">This was the letter , directed to “<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName><persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Smith</persName>, Esq . Tunbridge Wells , ” and dated from London , as far back as July , 1803 :—</p>
    <p n="810"><said >“ Dear<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Smith</persName>,— I have received yours . Your kindness almost overpowers me . I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common , but I have lived three-and-twenty years in the world , and have seen none like it . At present , believe me , I have no need of your services , being in cash again . Give me joy : I have got rid of<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and Miss . They are gone back to Kellynch , and almost made me swear to visit them this summer ; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor , to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer . The baronet , nevertheless , is not unlikely to marry again ; he is quite fool enough . If he does , however , they will leave me in peace , which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion . He is worse than last year .</said></p>
    <p n="811"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ I wish I had any name but Elliot . I am sick of it . The name of<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Walter</persName>I can drop , thank God ! and I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again , meaning , for the rest of my life , to be only yours truly ,— Wm . Elliot . ”</said></p>
    <p n="812">Such a letter could not be read without putting<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>in a glow ; and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, observing the high colour in her face , said —</p>
    <p n="813"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ The language , I know , is highly disrespectful . Though I have forgot the exact terms , I have a perfect impression of the general meaning . But it shows you the man . Mark his professions to my poor husband . Can any thing be stronger ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="814"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father . She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour , that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies , that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others , before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over , and say —</p>
    <p n="815"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Thank you . This is full proof undoubtedly ; proof of every thing you were saying . But why be acquainted with us now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="816"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ I can explain this too , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, smiling .</p>
    <p n="817"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Can you really ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="818"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Yes . I have shewn you<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>as he was a dozen years ago , and I will shew him as he is now . I cannot produce written proof again , but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire , of what he is now wanting , and what he is now doing . He is no hypocrite now . He truly wants to marry you . His present attentions to your family are very sincere : quite from the heart . I will give you my authority : his friend<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="819"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>! you are acquainted with him ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="820"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ No . It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that ; it takes a bend or two , but nothing of consequence . The stream is as good as at first ; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>talks unreservedly to<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>of his views on you , which said<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>, I imagine to be , in himself , a sensible , careful , discerning sort of character ; but<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>has a very pretty silly wife , to whom he tells things which he had better not , and he repeats it all to her . She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery , repeats it all to her nurse ; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you , very naturally brings it all to me . On Monday evening , my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings . When I talked of a whole history , therefore , you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="821"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, your authority is deficient . This will not do .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father . That was all prior to my coming to Bath . I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived . ”</said></p>
    <p n="822"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ I know you did ; I know it all perfectly , but — ”</said></p>
    <p n="823"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Indeed ,<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, we must not expect to get real information in such a line . Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many , to be misconceived by folly in one , and ignorance in another , can hardly have much truth left . ”</said></p>
    <p n="824"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Only give me a hearing . You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due , by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm . Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement . He had seen you indeed , before he came to Bath , and admired you , but without knowing it to be you . So says my historian , at least . Is this true ? Did he see you last summer or autumn , ‘ somewhere down in the west , ’ to use her own words , without knowing it to be you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="825"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ He certainly did . So far it is very true . At Lyme . I happened to be at Lyme . ”</said></p>
    <p n="826"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Well , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, triumphantly ,<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted . He saw you then at Lyme , and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place , as<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne Elliot</persName>, and from that moment , I have no doubt , had a double motive in his visits there . But there was another , and an earlier , which I will now explain . If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable , stop me . My account states , that your sister 's friend , the lady now staying with you , whom I have heard you mention , came to Bath with<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>and<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>as long ago as September ( in short when they first came themselves ) , and has been staying there ever since ; that she is a clever , insinuating , handsome woman , poor and plausible , and altogether such in situation and manner , as to give a general idea , among<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s acquaintance , of her meaning to be<persName>Lady Elliot</persName>, and as general a surprise that<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>should be apparently , blind to the danger . ”</said></p>
    <p n="827">Here<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>paused a moment ; but<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had not a word to say , and she continued —</p>
    <p n="828"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family , long before you returned to it ; and<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it , though he did not then visit in Camden Place ; but his regard for<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there , and when<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>came to Bath for a day or two , as he happened to do a little before Christmas ,<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>made him acquainted with the appearance of things , and the reports beginning to prevail . Now you are to understand , that time had worked a very material change in<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy . Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man . Having long had as much money as he could spend , nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence , he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to . I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased , but it is now a confirmed feeling . He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William . You may guess , therefore , that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable , and you may guess what it produced ; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible , and of fixing himself here for a time , with the view of renewing his former acquaintance , and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger , and of circumventing the lady if he found it material . This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done ; and<persName corresp="#Colonel_Wallis">Colonel Wallis</persName>was to assist in every way that he could . He was to be introduced , and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Wallis">Mrs Wallis</persName>was to be introduced , and everybody was to be introduced .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>came back accordingly ; and on application was forgiven , as you know , and re-admitted into the family ; and there it was his constant object , and his only object ( till your arrival added another motive ) , to watch<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>. He omitted no opportunity of being with them , threw himself in their way , called at all hours ; but I need not be particular on this subject . You can imagine what an artful man would do ; and with this guide , perhaps , may recollect what you have seen him do . ”</said></p>
    <p n="829"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known , or could imagine . There is always something offensive in the details of cunning . The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting , but I have heard nothing which really surprises me . I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, who would have difficulty in believing it ; but I have never been satisfied . I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared . I should like to know his present opinion , as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of ; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="830"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ Lessening , I understand , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>.<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ He thinks<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>afraid of him , aware that he sees through her , and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence . But since he must be absent some time or other , I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Wallis">Mrs Wallis</persName>has an amusing idea , as nurse tells me , that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>marry , that your father is not to marry<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>. A scheme , worthy of<persName corresp="#Mrs_Wallis">Mrs Wallis</persName>'s understanding , by all accounts ; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it . ‘ Why , to be sure , ma'am , ’ said she , ‘ it would not prevent his marrying anybody else . ’ And , indeed , to own the truth , I do not think nurse , in her heart , is a very strenuous opposer of<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>'s making a second match . She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony , you know ; and ( since self will intrude ) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next<persName>Lady Elliot</persName>, through<persName corresp="#Mrs_Wallis">Mrs Wallis</persName>'s recommendation ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="831"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I am very glad to know all this , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, after a little thoughtfulness .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ It will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him , but I shall know better what to do . My line of conduct will be more direct .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>is evidently a disingenuous , artificial , worldly man , who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness . ”</said></p>
    <p n="832">But<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was not done with .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>had been carried away from her first direction , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion .</p>
    <p n="833">She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s marriage ) they had been as before always together , and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>did not want to take blame to herself , and was most tender of throwing any on her husband ; but<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living , and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance . From his wife 's account of him she could discern Mr<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Smith</persName>to have been a man of warm feelings , easy temper , careless habits , and not strong understanding , much more amiable than his friend , and very unlike him , led by him , and probably despised by him .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, raised by his marriage to great affluence , and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself , ( for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man ) , and beginning to be rich , just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor , seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend 's probable finances , but , on the contrary , had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin ; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined .</p>
    <p n="834">The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it . They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends , and to prove that<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s had better not be tried ; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known . With a confidence in<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s regard , more creditable to his feelings than his judgement , Mr<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Smith</persName>had appointed him the executor of his will ; but<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>would not act , and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her , in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation , had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit , or listened to without corresponding indignation .</p>
    <p n="835"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was shewn some letters of his on the occasion , answers to urgent applications from<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble , and , under a cold civility , the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her . It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>felt , at some moments , that no flagrant open crime could have been worse . She had a great deal to listen to ; all the particulars of past sad scenes , all the minutiae of distress upon distress , which in former conversations had been merely hinted at , were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief , and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend 's usual state of mind .</p>
    <p n="836">There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation . She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies , which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances , might be recoverable by proper measures ; and this property , though not large , would be enough to make her comparatively rich . But there was nobody to stir in it .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>would do nothing , and she could do nothing herself , equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness , and from employing others by her want of money . She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel , and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law . This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means . To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances , that a little trouble in the right place might do it , and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims , was hard to bear .</p>
    <p n="837">It was on this point that she had hoped to engage<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s good offices with<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. She had previously , in the anticipation of their marriage , been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it ; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature , since he did not even know her to be in Bath , it immediately occurred , that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved , and she had been hastily preparing to interest<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s feelings , as far as the observances due to<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s character would allow , when<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything ; and while it took from her the new-formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety , left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way .</p>
    <p n="838">After listening to this full description of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not but express some surprise at<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>'s having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ She had seemed to recommend and praise him ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="839"><said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ My dear , ”</said>was<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>'s reply ,<said who="#Mrs_Smith">“ there was nothing else to be done . I considered your marrying him as certain , though he might not yet have made the offer , and I could no more speak the truth of him , than if he had been your husband . My heart bled for you , as I talked of happiness ; and yet he is sensible , he is agreeable , and with such a woman as you , it was not absolutely hopeless . He was very unkind to his first wife . They were wretched together . But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect , and he had never loved her . I was willing to hope that you must fare better . ”</said></p>
    <p n="840"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed . It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>! And under such a supposition , which would have been most miserable , when time had disclosed all , too late ?</p>
    <p n="841">It was very desirable that<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>should be no longer deceived ; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference , which carried them through the greater part of the morning , was , that<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, in which his conduct was involved .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="22">
    <p n="842"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>went home to think over all that she had heard . In one point , her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him . He stood as opposed to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness ; and the evil of his attentions last night , the irremediable mischief he might have done , was considered with sensations unqualified , unperplexed . Pity for him was all over . But this was the only point of relief . In every other respect , in looking around her , or penetrating forward , she saw more to distrust and to apprehend . She was concerned for the disappointment and pain<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>would be feeling ; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister , and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils , without knowing how to avert any one of them . She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him . She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, but here was a reward indeed springing from it !<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>had been able to tell her what no one else could have done . Could the knowledge have been extended through her family ? But this was a vain idea . She must talk to<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, tell her , consult with her , and having done her best , wait the event with as much composure as possible ; and after all , her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself .</p>
    <p n="843">She found , on reaching home , that she had , as she intended , escaped seeing<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit ; but hardly had she congratulated herself , and felt safe , when she heard that he was coming again in the evening .</p>
    <p n="844"><said who="#Elizabeth">“ I had not the smallest intention of asking him , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>, with affected carelessness ,<said who="#Elizabeth">“ but he gave so many hints ; so<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>says , at least . ”</said></p>
    <p n="845"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ Indeed , I do say it . I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation . Poor man ! I was really in pain for him ; for your hard-hearted sister ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne</persName>, seems bent on cruelty . ”</said></p>
    <p n="846"><said who="#Elizabeth">“ Oh ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>,<said who="#Elizabeth">“ I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman 's hints . However , when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning , I gave way immediately , for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>together . They appear to so much advantage in company with each other . Each behaving so pleasantly .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>looking up with so much respect . ”</said></p>
    <p n="847"><said who="#Mrs_Clay">“ Quite delightful ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>, not daring , however , to turn her eyes towards<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Mrs_Clay">“ Exactly like father and son ! Dear<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, may I not say father and son ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="848"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Oh ! I lay no embargo on any body 's words . If you will have such ideas ! But , upon my word , I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men . ”</said></p>
    <p n="849"><said who="#Mrs_Clay">“ My dear<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>, lifting her hands and eyes , and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence .</p>
    <p n="850"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Well , my dear Penelope , you need not be so alarmed about him . I did invite him , you know . I sent him away with smiles . When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to-morrow , I had compassion on him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="851"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>admired the good acting of the friend , in being able to shew such pleasure as she did , in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object . It was impossible but that<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>must hate the sight of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>; and yet she could assume a most obliging , placid look , and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>as she would have done otherwise .</p>
    <p n="852">To<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>herself it was most distressing to see<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>enter the room ; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her . She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere , but now she saw insincerity in everything . His attentive deference to her father , contrasted with his former language , was odious ; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness , or the sound of his artificial good sentiments .</p>
    <p n="853">She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side . It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat ; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship ; and to retrace , as quietly as she could , the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along . She was accordingly more guarded , and more cool , than she had been the night before .</p>
    <p n="854">He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised ; wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation ; but the charm was broken : he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin 's vanity ; he found , at least , that it was not to be done now , by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too-commanding claims of the others . He little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest , bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable .</p>
    <p n="855">She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath the next morning , going early , and that he would be gone the greater part of two days . He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of his return ; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain . It was bad enough that a<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>should be always before her ; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party , seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort . It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them !<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>'s selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>would have compounded for the marriage at once , with all its evils , to be clear of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it .</p>
    <p n="856">On Friday morning she meant to go very early to<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, and accomplish the necessary communication ; and she would have gone directly after breakfast , but that<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble , which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion . She saw<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>fairly off , therefore , before she began to talk of spending the morning in Rivers Street .</p>
    <p n="857"><said who="#Elizabeth">“ Very well , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>,<said who="#Elizabeth">“ I have nothing to send but my love . Oh ! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me , and pretend I have read it through . I really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out .<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>quite bores one with her new publications . You need not tell her so , but I thought her dress hideous the other night . I used to think she had some taste in dress , but I was ashamed of her at the concert . Something so formal and arrange in her air ! and she sits so upright ! My best love , of course . ”</said></p>
    <p n="858"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ And mine , ”</said>added<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>.<said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ Kindest regards . And you may say , that I mean to call upon her soon . Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card . Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life , who make themselves up so little . If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen ; but last time I called , I observed the blinds were let down immediately . ”</said></p>
    <p n="859">While her father spoke , there was a knock at the door . Who could it be ?<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, remembering the preconcerted visits , at all hours , of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, would have expected him , but for his known engagement seven miles off . After the usual period of suspense , the usual sounds of approach were heard , and “ Mr and Mrs<persName corresp="#Charles_Musgrove">Charles Musgrove</persName>” were ushered into the room .</p>
    <p n="860">Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance ; but<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was really glad to see them ; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome ; and as soon as it became clear that these , their nearest relations , were not arrived with any views of accommodation in that house ,<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>were able to rise in cordiality , and do the honours of it very well . They were come to Bath for a few days with<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>, and were at the White Hart . So much was pretty soon understood ; but till<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>were walking<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>into the other drawing-room , and regaling themselves with her admiration ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not draw upon<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>'s brain for a regular history of their coming , or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business , which had been ostentatiously dropped by<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of .</p>
    <p n="861">She then found that it consisted of<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>,<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>, beside their two selves . He gave her a very plain , intelligible account of the whole ; a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding . The scheme had received its first impulse by<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>'s wanting to come to Bath on business . He had begun to talk of it a week ago ; and by way of doing something , as shooting was over ,<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>had proposed coming with him , and<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>had seemed to like the idea of it very much , as an advantage to her husband ; but<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>could not bear to be left , and had made herself so unhappy about it , that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense , or at an end . But then , it had been taken up by his father and mother . His mother had some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see ; it was thought a good opportunity for<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>to come and buy wedding-clothes for herself and her sister ; and , in short , it ended in being his mother 's party , that everything might be comfortable and easy to<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>; and he and<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>were included in it by way of general convenience . They had arrived late the night before .<persName>Mrs Harville</persName>, her children , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>, remained with<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>and<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>at Uppercross .</p>
    <p n="862"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s only surprise was , that affairs should be in forwardness enough for<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>'s wedding-clothes to be talked of . She had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand ; but she learned from<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>that , very recently , ( since<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s last letter to herself ) ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years ; and that on the strength of his present income , with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question , the two families had consented to the young people 's wishes , and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months , quite as soon as<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>'s .<said who="#Charles">“ And a very good living it was , ”</said><persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>added : “ only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross , and in a very fine country : fine part of Dorsetshire . In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom , surrounded by three great proprietors , each more careful and jealous than the other ; and to two of the three at least ,<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>might get a special recommendation . Not that he will value it as he ought , ” he observed ,<said who="#Charles_Hayter">“<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>is too cool about sporting . That 's the worst of him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="863"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I am extremely glad , indeed , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ particularly glad that this should happen ; and that of two sisters , who both deserve equally well , and who have always been such good friends , the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other — that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort . I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both . ”</said></p>
    <p n="864"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Oh ! yes . My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer , but he has no other fault to find . Money , you know , coming down with money — two daughters at once — it cannot be a very agreeable operation , and it streightens him as to many things . However , I do not mean to say they have not a right to it . It is very fit they should have daughters ’ shares ; and I am sure he has always been a very kind , liberal father to me .<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>does not above half like<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>'s match . She never did , you know . But she does not do him justice , nor think enough about Winthrop . I cannot make her attend to the value of the property . It is a very fair match , as times go ; and I have liked<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>all my life , and I shall not leave off now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="865"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Such excellent parents as Mr and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>, ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ should be happy in their children 's marriages . They do everything to confer happiness , I am sure . What a blessing to young people to be in such hands ! Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old . I hope you think<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>perfectly recovered now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="866">He answered rather hesitatingly ,<said who="#Charles_Hayter">“ Yes , I believe I do ; very much recovered ; but she is altered ; there is no running or jumping about , no laughing or dancing ; it is quite different . If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water ; and<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long . ”</said></p>
    <p n="867"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could not help laughing .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ That cannot be much to your taste , I know , ”</said>said she ;<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ but I do believe him to be an excellent young man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="868"><said who="#Charles_Hayter">“ To be sure he is . Nobody doubts it ; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself . I have a great value for<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>; and when one can but get him to talk , he has plenty to say . His reading has done him no harm , for he has fought as well as read . He is a brave fellow . I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before . We had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father 's great barns ; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since . ”</said></p>
    <p n="869">Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>'s following the others to admire mirrors and china ; but<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross , and rejoice in its happiness ; and though she sighed as she rejoiced , her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it . She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could , but she did not want to lessen theirs .</p>
    <p n="870">The visit passed off altogether in high good humour .<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>was in excellent spirits , enjoying the gaiety and the change , and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law 's carriage with four horses , and with her own complete independence of Camden Place , that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought , and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house , as they were detailed to her . She had no demands on her father or sister , and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing-rooms .</p>
    <p n="871"><persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>was , for a short time , suffering a good deal . She felt that<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them ; but she could not bear to have the difference of style , the reduction of servants , which a dinner must betray , witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch . It was a struggle between propriety and vanity ; but vanity got the better , and then<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>was happy again . These were her internal persuasions :<said who="#Elizabeth">“ Old fashioned notions ; country hospitality ; we do not profess to give dinners ; few people in Bath do ; Lady Alicia never does ; did not even ask her own sister 's family , though they were here a month : and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>; put her quite out of her way . I am sure she would rather not come ; she cannot feel easy with us . I will ask them all for an evening ; that will be much better ; that will be a novelty and a treat . They have not seen two such drawing rooms before . They will be delighted to come to-morrow evening . It shall be a regular party , small , but most elegant . ”</said>And this satisfied<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>: and when the invitation was given to the two present , and promised for the absent ,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>was as completely satisfied . She was particularly asked to meet<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, and be introduced to<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>and<persName>Miss Carteret</persName>, who were fortunately already engaged to come ; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention .<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>was to have the honour of calling on<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>in the course of the morning ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>walked off with<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, to go and see her and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>directly .</p>
    <p n="872">Her plan of sitting with<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>must give way for the present . They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes ; but<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>convinced herself that a day 's delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence , and hastened forward to the White Hart , to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn , with an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form .</p>
    <p n="873">They found<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>and her daughter within , and by themselves , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had the kindest welcome from each .<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>was exactly in that state of recently-improved views , of fresh-formed happiness , which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all ; and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>'s real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress . It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home . She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible , invited for every day and all day long , or rather claimed as part of the family ; and , in return , she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance , and on<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>'s leaving them together , was listening to<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>'s history of<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>, and to<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>'s of herself , giving opinions on business , and recommendations to shops ; with intervals of every help which<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>required , from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts ; from finding her keys , and assorting her trinkets , to trying to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody ; which<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, well amused as she generally was , in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room , could not but have her moments of imagining .</p>
    <p n="874">A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected . A large party in an hotel ensured a quick-changing , unsettled scene . One five minutes brought a note , the next a parcel ; and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had not been there half an hour , when their dining-room , spacious as it was , seemed more than half filled : a party of steady old friends were seated around<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>came back with Captains<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Wentworth</persName>. The appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment . It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again . Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings ; she had derived from it a delightful conviction ; but she feared from his looks , that the same unfortunate persuasion , which had hastened him away from the Concert Room , still governed . He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation .</p>
    <p n="875">She tried to be calm , and leave things to take their course , and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence :— “ Surely , if there be constant attachment on each side , our hearts must understand each other ere long . We are not boy and girl , to be captiously irritable , misled by every moment 's inadvertence , and wantonly playing with our own happiness . ” And yet , a few minutes afterwards , she felt as if their being in company with each other , under their present circumstances , could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind .</p>
    <p n="876"><said who="#Mary">“<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, still at her window ,<said who="#Mary">“ there is<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>, I am sure , standing under the colonnade , and a gentleman with her . I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now . They seemed deep in talk . Who is it ? Come , and tell me . Good heavens ! I recollect . It is<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>himself . ”</said></p>
    <p n="877"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ No , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, quickly ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ it cannot be<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, I assure you . He was to leave Bath at nine this morning , and does not come back till to-morrow . ”</said></p>
    <p n="878">As she spoke , she felt that<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was looking at her , the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her , and made her regret that she had said so much , simple as it was .</p>
    <p n="879"><persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin , began talking very warmly about the family features , and protesting still more positively that it was<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, calling again upon<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>to come and look for herself , but<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>did not mean to stir , and tried to be cool and unconcerned . Her distress returned , however , on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors , as if they believed themselves quite in the secret . It was evident that the report concerning her had spread , and a short pause succeeded , which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther .</p>
    <p n="880">“ Do come ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>” cried<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>,<said who="#Mary">“ come and look yourself . You will be too late if you do not make haste . They are parting ; they are shaking hands . He is turning away . Not know<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, indeed ! You seem to have forgot all about Lyme . ”</said></p>
    <p n="881">To pacify<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>did move quietly to the window . She was just in time to ascertain that it really was<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, which she had never believed , before he disappeared on one side , as<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>walked quickly off on the other ; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest , she calmly said , “ Yes , it is<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, certainly . He has changed his hour of going , I suppose , that is all , or I may be mistaken , I might not attend ; ” and walked back to her chair , recomposed , and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well .</p>
    <p n="882">The visitors took their leave ; and<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, having civilly seen them off , and then made a face at them , and abused them for coming , began with —</p>
    <p n="883"><said who="#Charles">“ Well , mother , I have done something for you that you will like . I have been to the theatre , and secured a box for to-morrow night . A'n ' t I a good boy ? I know you love a play ; and there is room for us all . It holds nine . I have engaged<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>.<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>will not be sorry to join us , I am sure . We all like a play . Have not I done well , mother ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="884"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play , if<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>and all the others liked it , when<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming —</p>
    <p n="885"><said who="#Mary">“ Good heavens ,<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>! how can you think of such a thing ? Take a box for to-morrow night ! Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to-morrow night ? and that we were most particularly asked to meet<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>and her daughter , and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, and all the principal family connexions , on purpose to be introduced to them ? How can you be so forgetful ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="886"><said who="#Charles">“ Phoo ! phoo ! ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>,<said who="#Charles">“ what 's an evening party ? Never worth remembering . Your father might have asked us to dinner , I think , if he had wanted to see us . You may do as you like , but I shall go to the play . ”</said></p>
    <p n="887"><said who="#Mary">“ Oh !<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, I declare it will be too abominable if you do , when you promised to go . ”</said></p>
    <p n="888"><said who="#Charles">“ No , I did not promise . I only smirked and bowed , and said the word ‘ happy . ’ There was no promise . ”</said></p>
    <p n="889"><said who="#Mary">“ But you must go ,<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>. It would be unpardonable to fail . We were asked on purpose to be introduced . There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves . Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately . We are quite near relations , you know ; and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>too , whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with ! Every attention is due to<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>. Consider , my father 's heir : the future representative of the family . ”</said></p>
    <p n="890"><said who="#Charles">“ Do n't talk to me about heirs and representatives , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>.<said who="#Charles">“ I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun . If I would not go for the sake of your father , I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir . What is<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>to me ? ”</said>The careless expression was life to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, who saw that<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was all attention , looking and listening with his whole soul ; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>to herself .</p>
    <p n="891"><persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>still talked on in the same style ; he , half serious and half jesting , maintaining the scheme for the play , and she , invariably serious , most warmly opposing it , and not omitting to make it known that , however determined to go to Camden Place herself , she should not think herself very well used , if they went to the play without her .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>interposed .</p>
    <p n="892"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ We had better put it off .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday . It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne</persName>, too , if there is a party at her father 's ; and I am sure neither<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>nor I should care at all for the play , if<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne</persName>could not be with us . ”</said></p>
    <p n="893"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>felt truly obliged to her for such kindness ; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying —</p>
    <p n="894"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ If it depended only on my inclination , ma'am , the party at home ( excepting on<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>'s account ) would not be the smallest impediment . I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting , and should be too happy to change it for a play , and with you . But , it had better not be attempted , perhaps . ”</said>She had spoken it ; but she trembled when it was done , conscious that her words were listened to , and daring not even to try to observe their effect .</p>
    <p n="895">It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day ;<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife , by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would .</p>
    <p n="896"><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>left his seat , and walked to the fire-place ; probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards , and taking a station , with less bare-faced design , by<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="897"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ You have not been long enough in Bath , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ to enjoy the evening parties of the place . ”</said></p>
    <p n="898"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Oh ! no . The usual character of them has nothing for me . I am no card-player . ”</said></p>
    <p n="899"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ You were not formerly , I know . You did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="900"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I am not yet so much changed , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, and stopped , fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction . After waiting a few moments he said , and as if it were the result of immediate feeling ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ It is a period , indeed ! Eight years and a half is a period . ”</said></p>
    <p n="901">Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour ; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered , she was startled to other subjects by<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out , and calling on her companions to lose no time , lest somebody else should come in .</p>
    <p n="902">They were obliged to move .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>talked of being perfectly ready , and tried to look it ; but she felt that could<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair , in preparing to quit the room , she would have found , in all her own sensations for her cousin , in the very security of his affection , wherewith to pity her .</p>
    <p n="903">Their preparations , however , were stopped short . Alarming sounds were heard ; other visitors approached , and the door was thrown open for<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, whose entrance seemed to give a general chill .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>felt an instant oppression , and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same . The comfort , the freedom , the gaiety of the room was over , hushed into cold composure , determined silence , or insipid talk , to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister . How mortifying to feel that it was so !</p>
    <p n="904">Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular .<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was acknowledged again by each , by<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>more graciously than before . She even addressed him once , and looked at him more than once .<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>was , in fact , revolving a great measure . The sequel explained it . After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings , she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves .<said who="#Miss_Elliot">“ To-morrow evening , to meet a few friends : no formal party . ”</said>It was all said very gracefully , and the cards with which she had provided herself , the “<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>at home , ” were laid on the table , with a courteous , comprehensive smile to all , and one smile and one card more decidedly for<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>. The truth was , that<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>had been long enough in Bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his . The past was nothing . The present was that<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>would move about well in her drawing-room . The card was pointedly given , and<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>arose and disappeared .</p>
    <p n="905">The interruption had been short , though severe , and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out , but not to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>. She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed , and of the manner in which it had been received ; a manner of doubtful meaning , of surprise rather than gratification , of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance . She knew him ; she saw disdain in his eye , and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering , as an atonement for all the insolence of the past . Her spirits sank . He held the card in his hand after they were gone , as if deeply considering it .</p>
    <p n="906"><said who="#Mary">“ Only think of<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>'s including everybody ! ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>very audibly .<said who="#Mary">“ I do not wonder<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>is delighted ! You see he cannot put the card out of his hand . ”</said></p>
    <p n="907"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>caught his eye , saw his cheeks glow , and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt , and turned away , that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her .</p>
    <p n="908">The party separated . The gentlemen had their own pursuits , the ladies proceeded on their own business , and they met no more while<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>belonged to them . She was earnestly begged to return and dine , and give them all the rest of the day , but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more , and fit only for home , where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose .</p>
    <p n="909">Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning , therefore , she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place , there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>for the morrow 's party , the frequent enumeration of the persons invited , and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath , while harassing herself with the never-ending question , of whether<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>would come or not ? They were reckoning him as certain , but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together . She generally thought he would come , because she generally thought he ought ; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion , as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings .</p>
    <p n="910">She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation , to let<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>know that she had been seen with<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath , for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself , she determined to mention it , and it seemed to her there was guilt in<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>'s face as she listened . It was transient : cleared away in an instant ; but<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could imagine she read there the consciousness of having , by some complication of mutual trick , or some overbearing authority of his , been obliged to attend ( perhaps for half an hour ) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>. She exclaimed , however , with a very tolerable imitation of nature :—</p>
    <p n="911"><said who="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">“ Oh ! dear ! very true . Only think ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, to my great surprise I met with<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>in Bath Street . I was never more astonished . He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard . He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry , but I really forget by what ; for I was in a hurry , and could not much attend , and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return . He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow . He was full of ‘ to-morrow , ’ and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="23">
    <p n="912">One day only had passed since<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s conversation with<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>; but a keener interest had succeeded , and she was now so little touched by<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s conduct , except by its effects in one quarter , that it became a matter of course the next morning , still to defer her explanatory visit in Rivers Street . She had promised to be with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner . Her faith was plighted , and<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s character , like the Sultaness Scheherazade 's head , must live another day .</p>
    <p n="913">She could not keep her appointment punctually , however ; the weather was unfavourable , and she had grieved over the rain on her friends ’ account , and felt it very much on her own , before she was able to attempt the walk . When she reached the White Hart , and made her way to the proper apartment , she found herself neither arriving quite in time , nor the first to arrive . The party before her were ,<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>, talking to<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>; and she immediately heard that<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>, too impatient to wait , had gone out the moment it had cleared , but would be back again soon , and that the strictest injunctions had been left with<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>to keep her there till they returned . She had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed . There was no delay , no waste of time . She was deep in the happiness of such misery , or the misery of such happiness , instantly . Two minutes after her entering the room ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>said —</p>
    <p n="914"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ We will write the letter we were talking of ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>, now , if you will give me materials . ”</said></p>
    <p n="915">Materials were at hand , on a separate table ; he went to it , and nearly turning his back to them all , was engrossed by writing .</p>
    <p n="916"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>was giving<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>the history of her eldest daughter 's engagement , and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>felt that she did not belong to the conversation , and yet , as<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk , she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars ; such as , “ how<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>and my brother<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Hayter</persName>had met again and again to talk it over ; what my brother<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Hayter</persName>had said one day , and what<persName>Mr Musgrove</persName>had proposed the next , and what had occurred to my sister<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Hayter</persName>, and what the young people had wished , and what I said at first I never could consent to , but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well , ” and a great deal in the same style of open-hearted communication : minutiae which , even with every advantage of taste and delicacy , which good<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>could not give , could be properly interesting only to the principals .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>was attending with great good-humour , and whenever she spoke at all , it was very sensibly .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self-occupied to hear .</p>
    <p n="917"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ And so , ma'am , all these thing considered , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>, in her powerful whisper ,<said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ though we could have wished it different , yet , altogether , we did not think it fair to stand out any longer , for<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>was quite wild about it , and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>was pretty near as bad ; and so we thought they had better marry at once , and make the best of it , as many others have done before them . At any rate , said I , it will be better than a long engagement . ”</said></p>
    <p n="918"><said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ That is precisely what I was going to observe , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>.<said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once , and have to struggle with a few difficulties together , than be involved in a long engagement . I always think that no mutual — ”</said></p>
    <p n="919"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ Oh ! dear<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>, ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>, unable to let her finish her speech ,<said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement . It is what I always protested against for my children . It is all very well , I used to say , for young people to be engaged , if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months , or even in twelve ; but a long engagement — ”</said></p>
    <p n="920"><said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ Yes , dear ma'am , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>,<said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ or an uncertain engagement , an engagement which may be long . To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying , I hold to be very unsafe and unwise , and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can . ”</said></p>
    <p n="921"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>found an unexpected interest here . She felt its application to herself , felt it in a nervous thrill all over her ; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s pen ceased to move , his head was raised , pausing , listening , and he turned round the next instant to give a look , one quick , conscious look at her .</p>
    <p n="922">The two ladies continued to talk , to re-urge the same admitted truths , and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation , but<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>heard nothing distinctly ; it was only a buzz of words in her ear , her mind was in confusion .</p>
    <p n="923"><persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>, who had in truth been hearing none of it , now left his seat , and moved to a window , and<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>seeming to watch him , though it was from thorough absence of mind , became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood . He looked at her with a smile , and a little motion of the head , which expressed , “ Come to me , I have something to say ; ” and the unaffected , easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was , strongly enforced the invitation . She roused herself and went to him . The window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting , and though nearer to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s table , not very near . As she joined him ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>'s countenance re-assumed the serious , thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character .</p>
    <p n="924"><said who="#Captain_Harville">“ Look here , ”</said>said he , unfolding a parcel in his hand , and displaying a small miniature painting ,<said who="#Captain_Harville">“ do you know who that is ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="925"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Certainly :<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="926"><said who="#Miss_Elliot">“ Yes , and you may guess who it is for . But , ”</said>( in a deep tone ,) “ it was not done for her .<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, do you remember our walking together at Lyme , and grieving for him ? I little thought then — but no matter . This was drawn at the Cape . He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape , and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister , sat to him , and was bringing it home for her ; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another ! It was a commission to me ! But who else was there to employ ? I hope I can allow for him . I am not sorry , indeed , to make it over to another . He undertakes it ; ” ( looking towards<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>,) “ he is writing about it now . ” And with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding ,<said who="#Miss_Elliot">“ Poor Fanny ! she would not have forgotten him so soon ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="927"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ No , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, in a low , feeling voice .<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ That I can easily believe . ”</said></p>
    <p n="928"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ It was not in her nature . She doted on him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="929"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved . ”</said></p>
    <p n="930"><persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>smiled , as much as to say ,<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Do you claim that for your sex ? ”</said>and she answered the question , smiling also ,<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Yes . We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us . It is , perhaps , our fate rather than our merit . We cannot help ourselves . We live at home , quiet , confined , and our feelings prey upon us . You are forced on exertion . You have always a profession , pursuits , business of some sort or other , to take you back into the world immediately , and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions . ”</said></p>
    <p n="931"><said who="#Captain_Harville">“ Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men ( which , however , I do not think I shall grant ) , it does not apply to<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>. He has not been forced upon any exertion . The peace turned him on shore at the very moment , and he has been living with us , in our little family circle , ever since . ”</said></p>
    <p n="932"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ True , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ very true ; I did not recollect ; but what shall we say now ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>? If the change be not from outward circumstances , it must be from within ; it must be nature , man 's nature , which has done the business for<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="933"><said who="#Captain_Harville">“ No , no , it is not man 's nature . I will not allow it to be more man 's nature than woman 's to be inconstant and forget those they do love , or have loved . I believe the reverse . I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental ; and that as our bodies are the strongest , so are our feelings ; capable of bearing most rough usage , and riding out the heaviest weather . ”</said></p>
    <p n="934"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Your feelings may be the strongest , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, “ but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender . Man is more robust than woman , but he is not longer lived ; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments . Nay , it would be too hard upon you , if it were otherwise . You have difficulties , and privations , and dangers enough to struggle with . You are always labouring and toiling , exposed to every risk and hardship . Your home , country , friends , all quitted . Neither time , nor health , nor life , to be called your own . It would be hard , indeed ” ( with a faltering voice ) ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ if woman 's feelings were to be added to all this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="935"><said who="#Captain_Harville">“ We shall never agree upon this question , ”</said><persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>was beginning to say , when a slight noise called their attention to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room . It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down ; but<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed , and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them , striving to catch sounds , which yet she did not think he could have caught .</p>
    <p n="936"><said who="#Captain_Harville">“ Have you finished your letter ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>.</p>
    <p n="937"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Not quite , a few lines more . I shall have done in five minutes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="938"><said who="#Captain_Harville">“ There is no hurry on my side . I am only ready whenever you are . I am in very good anchorage here , ”</said>( smiling at<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,) “ well supplied , and want for nothing . No hurry for a signal at all . Well ,<persName corresp="#Miss_Elliot">Miss Elliot</persName>, ” ( lowering his voice ,) “ as I was saying we shall never agree , I suppose , upon this point . No man and woman , would , probably . But let me observe that all histories are against you — all stories , prose and verse . If I had such a memory as<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>, I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument , and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman 's inconstancy . Songs and proverbs , all talk of woman 's fickleness . But perhaps you will say , these were all written by men . ”</p>
    <p n="939"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Perhaps I shall . Yes , yes , if you please , no reference to examples in books . Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story . Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree ; the pen has been in their hands . I will not allow books to prove anything . ”</said></p>
    <p n="940"><said who="#Captain_Harville">“ But how shall we prove anything ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="941"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ We never shall . We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point . It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof . We each begin , probably , with a little bias towards our own sex ; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle ; many of which circumstances ( perhaps those very cases which strike us the most ) may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence , or in some respect saying what should not be said . ”</said></p>
    <p n="942"><said who="#Captain_Harville">“ Ah ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>, in a tone of strong feeling ,<said who="#Captain_Harville">“ if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children , and watches the boat that he has sent them off in , as long as it is in sight , and then turns away and says , ‘ God knows whether we ever meet again ! ’ And then , if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again ; when , coming back after a twelvemonth 's absence , perhaps , and obliged to put into another port , he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there , pretending to deceive himself , and saying , ‘ They cannot be here till such a day , ’ but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner , and seeing them arrive at last , as if Heaven had given them wings , by many hours sooner still ! If I could explain to you all this , and all that a man can bear and do , and glories to do , for the sake of these treasures of his existence ! I speak , you know , only of such men as have hearts ! ”</said>pressing his own with emotion .</p>
    <p n="943"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Oh ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>eagerly ,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you , and by those who resemble you . God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures ! I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman . No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives . I believe you equal to every important exertion , and to every domestic forbearance , so long as — if I may be allowed the expression — so long as you have an object . I mean while the woman you love lives , and lives for you . All the privilege I claim for my own sex ( it is not a very enviable one ; you need not covet it ) , is that of loving longest , when existence or when hope is gone . ”</said></p>
    <p n="944">She could not immediately have uttered another sentence ; her heart was too full , her breath too much oppressed .</p>
    <p n="945"><said who="#Captain_Harville">“ You are a good soul , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>, putting his hand on her arm , quite affectionately .<said who="#Captain_Harville">“ There is no quarrelling with you . And when I think of<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>, my tongue is tied . ”</said></p>
    <p n="946">Their attention was called towards the others .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>was taking leave .</p>
    <p n="947"><said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ Here ,<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>, you and I part company , I believe , ”</said>said she .<said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ I am going home , and you have an engagement with your friend . To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party , ”</said>( turning to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>. )<said who="#Mrs_Croft">“ We had your sister 's card yesterday , and I understood<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>had a card too , though I did not see it ; and you are disengaged ,<persName corresp="#Frederick">Frederick</persName>, are you not , as well as ourselves ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="948"><persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>was folding up a letter in great haste , and either could not or would not answer fully .</p>
    <p n="949"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Yes , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ very true ; here we separate , but<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>and I shall soon be after you ; that is ,<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>, if you are ready , I am in half a minute . I know you will not be sorry to be off . I shall be at your service in half a minute . ”</said></p>
    <p n="950"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>left them , and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, having sealed his letter with great rapidity , was indeed ready , and had even a hurried , agitated air , which shewed impatience to be gone .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>knew not how to understand it . She had the kindest “ Good morning , God bless you ! ” from<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>, but from him not a word , nor a look ! He had passed out of the room without a look !</p>
    <p n="951">She had only time , however , to move closer to the table where he had been writing , when footsteps were heard returning ; the door opened , it was himself . He begged their pardon , but he had forgotten his gloves , and instantly crossing the room to the writing table , he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper , placed it before<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time , and hastily collecting his gloves , was again out of the room , almost before<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>was aware of his being in it : the work of an instant !</p>
    <p n="952">The revolution which one instant had made in<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, was almost beyond expression . The letter , with a direction hardly legible , to “ Miss A. E .—, ” was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily . While supposed to be writing only to<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>, he had been also addressing her ! On the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her . Anything was possible , anything might be defied rather than suspense .<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>had little arrangements of her own at her own table ; to their protection she must trust , and sinking into the chair which he had occupied , succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written , her eyes devoured the following words :</p>
    <p n="953"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ I can listen no longer in silence . I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach . You pierce my soul . I am half agony , half hope . Tell me not that I am too late , that such precious feelings are gone for ever . I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it , eight years and a half ago . Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman , that his love has an earlier death . I have loved none but you . Unjust I may have been , weak and resentful I have been , but never inconstant . You alone have brought me to Bath . For you alone , I think and plan . Have you not seen this ? Can you fail to have understood my wishes ? I had not waited even these ten days , could I have read your feelings , as I think you must have penetrated mine . I can hardly write . I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me . You sink your voice , but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others . Too good , too excellent creature ! You do us justice , indeed . You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men . Believe it to be most fervent , most undeviating , in F. W .</said></p>
    <p n="954"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ I must go , uncertain of my fate ; but I shall return hither , or follow your party , as soon as possible . A word , a look , will be enough to decide whether I enter your father 's house this evening or never . ”</said></p>
    <p n="955">Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from . Half an hour 's solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her ; but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted , with all the restraints of her situation , could do nothing towards tranquillity . Every moment rather brought fresh agitation . It was overpowering happiness . And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation ,<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Henrietta">Henrietta</persName>all came in .</p>
    <p n="956">The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle ; but after a while she could do no more . She began not to understand a word they said , and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself . They could then see that she looked very ill , were shocked and concerned , and would not stir without her for the world . This was dreadful . Would they only have gone away , and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure ; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting , and in desperation , she said she would go home .</p>
    <p n="957"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ By all means , my dear , ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>,<said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ go home directly , and take care of yourself , that you may be fit for the evening . I wish Sarah was here to doctor you , but I am no doctor myself .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, ring and order a chair . She must not walk . ”</said></p>
    <p n="958">But the chair would never do . Worse than all ! To lose the possibility of speaking two words to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>in the course of her quiet , solitary progress up the town ( and she felt almost certain of meeting him ) could not be borne . The chair was earnestly protested against , and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Musgrove">Mrs Musgrove</persName>, who thought only of one sort of illness , having assured herself with some anxiety , that there had been no fall in the case ; that<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had not at any time lately slipped down , and got a blow on her head ; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall ; could part with her cheerfully , and depend on finding her better at night .</p>
    <p n="959">Anxious to omit no possible precaution ,<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>struggled , and said —</p>
    <p n="960"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I am afraid , ma'am , that it is not perfectly understood . Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening . I am afraid there had been some mistake ; and I wish you particularly to assure<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, that we hope to see them both . ”</said></p>
    <p n="961"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ Oh ! my dear , it is quite understood , I give you my word .<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>has no thought but of going . ”</said></p>
    <p n="962"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ Do you think so ? But I am afraid ; and I should be so very sorry . Will you promise me to mention it , when you see them again ? You will see them both this morning , I dare say . Do promise me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="963"><said who="#Mrs_Musgrove">“ To be sure I will , if you wish it .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, if you see<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>anywhere , remember to give<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Miss Anne</persName>'s message . But indeed , my dear , you need not be uneasy .<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>holds himself quite engaged , I 'll answer for it ; and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>the same , I dare say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="964"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could do no more ; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity . It could not be very lasting , however . Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself , it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>. Another momentary vexation occurred .<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>, in his real concern and good nature , would go home with her ; there was no preventing him . This was almost cruel . But she could not be long ungrateful ; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith 's , to be of use to her ; and she set off with him , with no feeling but gratitude apparent .</p>
    <p n="965">They were on Union Street , when a quicker step behind , a something of familiar sound , gave her two moments ’ preparation for the sight of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>. He joined them ; but , as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on , said nothing , only looked .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>could command herself enough to receive that look , and not repulsively . The cheeks which had been pale now glowed , and the movements which had hesitated were decided . He walked by her side . Presently , struck by a sudden thought ,<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>said —</p>
    <p n="966"><said who="#Charles">“<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, which way are you going ? Only to Gay Street , or farther up the town ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="967"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ I hardly know , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, surprised .</p>
    <p n="968"><said who="#Charles">“ Are you going as high as Belmont ? Are you going near Camden Place ? Because , if you are , I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place , and give<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>your arm to her father 's door . She is rather done for this morning , and must not go so far without help , and I ought to be at that fellow 's in the Market Place . He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off ; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment , that I might see it ; and if I do not turn back now , I have no chance . By his description , a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine , which you shot with one day round Winthrop . ”</said></p>
    <p n="969">There could not be an objection . There could be only the most proper alacrity , a most obliging compliance for public view ; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture . In half a minute<persName corresp="#Charles">Charles</persName>was at the bottom of Union Street again , and the other two proceeding together : and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk , where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed , and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow . There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything , but which had been followed by so many , many years of division and estrangement . There they returned again into the past , more exquisitely happy , perhaps , in their re-union , than when it had been first projected ; more tender , more tried , more fixed in a knowledge of each other 's character , truth , and attachment ; more equal to act , more justified in acting . And there , as they slowly paced the gradual ascent , heedless of every group around them , seeing neither sauntering politicians , bustling housekeepers , flirting girls , nor nursery-maids and children , they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements , and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment , which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest . All the little variations of the last week were gone through ; and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end .</p>
    <p n="970">She had not mistaken him . Jealousy of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>had been the retarding weight , the doubt , the torment . That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four-and-twenty hours . It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks , or words , or actions occasionally encouraged ; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper , and poured out his feelings .</p>
    <p n="971">Of what he had then written , nothing was to be retracted or qualified . He persisted in having loved none but her . She had never been supplanted . He never even believed himself to see her equal . Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge : that he had been constant unconsciously , nay unintentionally ; that he had meant to forget her , and believed it to be done . He had imagined himself indifferent , when he had only been angry ; and he had been unjust to her merits , because he had been a sufferer from them . Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself , maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness ; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice , and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself . At Lyme , he had received lessons of more than one sort . The passing admiration of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>had at least roused him , and the scenes on the Cobb and at<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>'s had fixed her superiority .</p>
    <p n="972">In his preceding attempts to attach himself to<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa Musgrove</persName>( the attempts of angry pride ) , he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible ; that he had not cared , could not care , for<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>; though till that day , till the leisure for reflection which followed it , he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>'s could so ill bear a comparison , or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own . There , he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will , between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind . There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost ; and there begun to deplore the pride , the folly , the madness of resentment , which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way .</p>
    <p n="973">From that period his penance had become severe . He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>'s accident , no sooner begun to feel himself alive again , than he had begun to feel himself , though alive , not at liberty .</p>
    <p n="974"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ I found , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ that I was considered by<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>an engaged man ! That neither<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Harville</persName>nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment . I was startled and shocked . To a degree , I could contradict this instantly ; but , when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same — her own family , nay , perhaps herself — I was no longer at my own disposal . I was hers in honour if she wished it . I had been unguarded . I had not thought seriously on this subject before . I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways ; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls , at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report , were there no other ill effects . I had been grossly wrong , and must abide the consequences . ”</said></p>
    <p n="975">He found too late , in short , that he had entangled himself ; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>at all , he must regard himself as bound to her , if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed . It determined him to leave Lyme , and await her complete recovery elsewhere . He would gladly weaken , by any fair means , whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist ; and he went , therefore , to his brother 's , meaning after a while to return to Kellynch , and act as circumstances might require .</p>
    <p n="976"><said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ I was six weeks with<persName>Edward</persName>, ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Louisa_Musgrove">“ and saw him happy . I could have no other pleasure . I deserved none . He enquired after you very particularly ; asked even if you were personally altered , little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter . ”</said></p>
    <p n="977"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>smiled , and let it pass . It was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach . It is something for a woman to be assured , in her eight-and-twentieth year , that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth ; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, by comparing it with former words , and feeling it to be the result , not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment .</p>
    <p n="978">He had remained in Shropshire , lamenting the blindness of his own pride , and the blunders of his own calculations , till at once released from<persName corresp="#Louisa_Musgrove">Louisa</persName>by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Benwick</persName>.</p>
    <p n="979"><said who="#Captain_Benwick">“ Here , ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Captain_Benwick">“ ended the worst of my state ; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness ; I could exert myself ; I could do something . But to be waiting so long in inaction , and waiting only for evil , had been dreadful . Within the first five minutes I said , ‘ I will be at Bath on Wednesday , ’ and I was . Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come ? and to arrive with some degree of hope ? You were single . It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past , as I did ; and one encouragement happened to be mine . I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others , but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man , at least , of better pretensions than myself ; and I could not help often saying , ‘ Was this for me ? ’ ”</said></p>
    <p n="980">Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said , but the concert still more . That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments . The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him : the moment of<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s appearing and tearing her away , and one or two subsequent moments , marked by returning hope or increasing despondency , were dwelt on with energy .</p>
    <p n="981"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ To see you , ”</said>cried he ,<said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ in the midst of those who could not be my well-wishers ; to see your cousin close by you , conversing and smiling , and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match ! To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you ! Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent , to consider what powerful supports would be his ! Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared ? How could I look on without agony ? Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you , was not the recollection of what had been , the knowledge of her influence , the indelible , immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done — was it not all against me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="982"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ You should have distinguished , ”</said>replied<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ You should not have suspected me now ; the case is so different , and my age is so different . If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once , remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety , not of risk . When I yielded , I thought it was to duty , but no duty could be called in aid here . In marrying a man indifferent to me , all risk would have been incurred , and all duty violated . ”</said></p>
    <p n="983"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus , ”</said>he replied ,<said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ but I could not . I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of your character . I could not bring it into play ; it was overwhelmed , buried , lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under year after year . I could think of you only as one who had yielded , who had given me up , who had been influenced by any one rather than by me . I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery . I had no reason to believe her of less authority now . The force of habit was to be added . ”</said></p>
    <p n="984"><said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ I should have thought , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>,<said who="#Anne_Elliot">“ that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="985"><said who="#Mr_Elliot">“ No , no ! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give . I left you in this belief ; and yet , I was determined to see you again . My spirits rallied with the morning , and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="986">At last<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was at home again , and happier than any one in that house could have conceived . All the surprise and suspense , and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation , she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last . An interval of meditation , serious and grateful , was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity ; and she went to her room , and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment .</p>
    <p n="987">The evening came , the drawing-rooms were lighted up , the company assembled . It was but a card party , it was but a mixture of those who had never met before , and those who met too often ; a commonplace business , too numerous for intimacy , too small for variety ; but<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had never found an evening shorter . Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness , and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for , she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her .<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>was there ; she avoided , but she could pity him . The Wallises , she had amusement in understanding them .<persName corresp="#Lady_Dalrymple">Lady Dalrymple</persName>and<persName>Miss Carteret</persName>— they would soon be innoxious cousins to her . She cared not for<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>, and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister . With the Musgroves , there was the happy chat of perfect ease ; with<persName corresp="#Captain_Harville">Captain Harville</persName>, the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister ; with<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, attempts at conversation , which a delicious consciousness cut short ; with<persName corresp="#Admiral">Admiral</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Croft">Mrs Croft</persName>, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest , which the same consciousness sought to conceal ; and with<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, some moments of communications continually occurring , and always the hope of more , and always the knowledge of his being there .</p>
    <p n="988">It was in one of these short meetings , each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants , that she said —</p>
    <p n="989"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ I have been thinking over the past , and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong , I mean with regard to myself ; and I must believe that I was right , much as I suffered from it , that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now . To me , she was in the place of a parent . Do not mistake me , however . I am not saying that she did not err in her advice . It was , perhaps , one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides ; and for myself , I certainly never should , in any circumstance of tolerable similarity , give such advice . But I mean , that I was right in submitting to her , and that if I had done otherwise , I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up , because I should have suffered in my conscience . I have now , as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature , nothing to reproach myself with ; and if I mistake not , a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman 's portion . ”</said></p>
    <p n="990">He looked at her , looked at<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, and looking again at her , replied , as if in cool deliberation —</p>
    <p n="991"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Not yet . But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time . I trust to being in charity with her soon . But I too have been thinking over the past , and a question has suggested itself , whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady ? My own self . Tell me if , when I returned to England in the year eight , with a few thousand pounds , and was posted into the Laconia , if I had then written to you , would you have answered my letter ? Would you , in short , have renewed the engagement then ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="992"><said who="#Lady_Russell">“ Would I ! ”</said>was all her answer ; but the accent was decisive enough .</p>
    <p n="993"><said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ Good God ! ”</said>he cried , “ you would ! It is not that I did not think of it , or desire it , as what could alone crown all my other success ; but I was proud , too proud to ask again . I did not understand you . I shut my eyes , and would not understand you , or do you justice . This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself . Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared . It is a sort of pain , too , which is new to me . I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed . I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards . Like other great men under reverses , ” he added , with a smile .<said who="#Captain_Wentworth">“ I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune . I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve . ”</said></p>

    <p n="994">Who can be in doubt of what followed ? When any two young people take it into their heads to marry , they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point , be they ever so poor , or ever so imprudent , or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other 's ultimate comfort . This may be bad morality to conclude with , but I believe it to be truth ; and if such parties succeed , how should a<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>and an<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne Elliot</persName>, with the advantage of maturity of mind , consciousness of right , and one independent fortune between them , fail of bearing down every opposition ? They might in fact , have borne down a great deal more than they met with , for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth .<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>made no objection , and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned .<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, with five-and-twenty thousand pounds , and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him , was no longer nobody . He was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish , spendthrift baronet , who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which Providence had placed him , and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter .</p>
    <p n="995"><persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, indeed , though he had no affection for<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, and no vanity flattered , to make him really happy on the occasion , was very far from thinking it a bad match for her . On the contrary , when he saw more of<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, saw him repeatedly by daylight , and eyed him well , he was very much struck by his personal claims , and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank ; and all this , assisted by his well-sounding name , enabled<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>at last to prepare his pen , with a very good grace , for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour .</p>
    <p n="996">The only one among them , whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>.<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>knew that<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>, and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with , and do justice to<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>. This however was what<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>had now to do . She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both ; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each ; that because<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s manners had not suited her own ideas , she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity ; and that because<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>'s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness , their general politeness and suavity , she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well-regulated mind . There was nothing less for<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>to do , than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong , and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes .</p>
    <p n="997">There is a quickness of perception in some , a nicety in the discernment of character , a natural penetration , in short , which no experience in others can equal , and<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend . But she was a very good woman , and if her second object was to be sensible and well-judging , her first was to see<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>happy . She loved<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>better than she loved her own abilities ; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over , found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child .</p>
    <p n="998">Of all the family ,<persName corresp="#Mary">Mary</persName>was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance . It was creditable to have a sister married , and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion , by keeping<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>with her in the autumn ; and as her own sister must be better than her husband 's sisters , it was very agreeable that<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>should be a richer man than either<persName corresp="#Captain_Benwick">Captain Benwick</persName>or<persName corresp="#Charles_Hayter">Charles Hayter</persName>. She had something to suffer , perhaps , when they came into contact again , in seeing<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>restored to the rights of seniority , and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette ; but she had a future to look forward to , of powerful consolation .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had no Uppercross Hall before her , no landed estate , no headship of a family ; and if they could but keep<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>from being made a baronet , she would not change situations with<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>.</p>
    <p n="999">It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation , for a change is not very probable there . She had soon the mortification of seeing<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>withdraw , and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him .</p>
    <p n="1000">The news of his cousins<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s engagement burst on<persName corresp="#Mr_Elliot">Mr Elliot</persName>most unexpectedly . It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness , his best hope of keeping<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>single by the watchfulness which a son-in-law 's rights would have given . But , though discomfited and disappointed , he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment . He soon quitted Bath ; and on<persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>'s quitting it soon afterwards , and being next heard of as established under his protection in London , it was evident how double a game he had been playing , and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman , at least .</p>
    <p n="1001"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Clay">Mrs Clay</persName>'s affections had overpowered her interest , and she had sacrificed , for the young man 's sake , the possibility of scheming longer for<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>. She has abilities , however , as well as affections ; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning , or hers , may finally carry the day ; whether , after preventing her from being the wife of<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William .</p>
    <p n="1002">It cannot be doubted that<persName corresp="#Sir_Walter_Elliot">Sir Walter</persName>and<persName corresp="#Elizabeth">Elizabeth</persName>were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion , and the discovery of their deception in her . They had their great cousins , to be sure , to resort to for comfort ; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others , without being flattered and followed in turn , is but a state of half enjoyment .</p>
    <p n="1003"><persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>, satisfied at a very early period of<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>'s meaning to love<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>as she ought , had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value . There she felt her own inferiority very keenly . The disproportion in their fortune was nothing ; it did not give her a moment 's regret ; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly , nothing of respectability , of harmony , of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters , was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity . She had but two friends in the world to add to his list ,<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>. To those , however , he was very well disposed to attach himself .<persName corresp="#Lady_Russell">Lady Russell</persName>, in spite of all her former transgressions , he could now value from his heart . While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them , he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour , and as for<persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently .</p>
    <p n="1004">Her recent good offices by<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>had been enough in themselves , and their marriage , instead of depriving her of one friend , secured her two . She was their earliest visitor in their settled life ; and<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>, by putting her in the way of recovering her husband 's property in the West Indies , by writing for her , acting for her , and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend , fully requited the services which she had rendered , or ever meant to render , to his wife .</p>
    <p n="1005"><persName corresp="#Mrs_Smith">Mrs Smith</persName>'s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income , with some improvement of health , and the acquisition of such friends to be often with , for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her ; and while these prime supplies of good remained , she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity . She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy , and yet be happy . Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits , as her friend<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>'s was in the warmth of her heart .<persName corresp="#Anne_Elliot">Anne</persName>was tenderness itself , and she had the full worth of it in<persName corresp="#Captain_Wentworth">Captain Wentworth</persName>'s affection . His profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less , the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine . She gloried in being a sailor 's wife , but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is , if possible , more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance .</p>
