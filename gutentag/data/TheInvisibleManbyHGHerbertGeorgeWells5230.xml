   <div type="chapter" n="2">
    <p n="1">At four o'clock , when it was fairly dark and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>was screwing up her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some tea ,<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy Henfrey</persName>, the clock-jobber , came into the bar .<said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ My sakes !<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>, ”</said>said he ,<said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ but this is terrible weather for thin boots ! ”</said>The snow outside was falling faster .</p>
    <p n="2"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>agreed , and then noticed he had his bag with him .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Now you 're here , Mr.<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy</persName>, ”</said>said she ,<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ I 'd be glad if you 'd give th ’ old clock in the parlour a bit of a look . ‘ Tis going , and it strikes well and hearty ; but the hour-hand wo n't do nuthin ’ but point at six . ”</said></p>
    <p n="3">And leading the way , she went across to the parlour door and rapped and entered .</p>
    <p n="4">Her visitor , she saw as she opened the door , was seated in the armchair before the fire , dozing it would seem , with his bandaged head drooping on one side . The only light in the room was the red glow from the fire — which lit his eyes like adverse railway signals , but left his downcast face in darkness — and the scanty vestiges of the day that came in through the open door . Everything was ruddy , shadowy , and indistinct to her , the more so since she had just been lighting the bar lamp , and her eyes were dazzled . But for a second it seemed to her that the man she looked at had an enormous mouth wide open — a vast and incredible mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower portion of his face . It was the sensation of a moment : the white-bound head , the monstrous goggle eyes , and this huge yawn below it . Then he stirred , started up in his chair , put up his hand . She opened the door wide , so that the room was lighter , and she saw him more clearly , with the muffler held up to his face just as she had seen him hold the serviette before . The shadows , she fancied , had tricked her .</p>
    <p n="5"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Would you mind , sir , this man a-coming to look at the clock , sir ? ”</said>she said , recovering from the momentary shock .</p>
    <p n="6"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ Look at the clock ? ”</said>he said , staring round in a drowsy manner , and speaking over his hand , and then , getting more fully awake ,<said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ certainly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="7"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>went away to get a lamp , and he rose and stretched himself . Then came the light , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Teddy_Henfrey">Mr. Teddy Henfrey</persName>, entering , was confronted by this bandaged person . He was , he says ,<said who="#Mr._Teddy_Henfrey">“ taken aback . ”</said></p>
    <p n="8"><said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ Good afternoon , ”</said>said the stranger , regarding him — as<persName corresp="#Mr._Henfrey">Mr. Henfrey</persName>says , with a vivid sense of the dark spectacles —<said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ like a lobster . ”</said></p>
    <p n="9"><said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ I hope , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Henfrey">Mr. Henfrey</persName>,<said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ that it 's no intrusion . ”</said></p>
    <p n="10"><said who="#the_stranger">“ None whatever , ”</said>said the stranger .<said who="#the_stranger">“ Though , I understand , ”</said>he said turning to<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>,<said who="#the_stranger">“ that this room is really to be mine for my own private use . ”</said></p>
    <p n="11"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ I thought , sir , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>,<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ you 'd prefer the clock — ”</said></p>
    <p n="12"><said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ Certainly , ”</said>said the stranger ,<said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ certainly — but , as a rule , I like to be alone and undisturbed .</said></p>
    <p n="13"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ But I 'm really glad to have the clock seen to , ”</said>he said , seeing a certain hesitation in<persName corresp="#Mr._Henfrey">Mr. Henfrey</persName>'s manner .<said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ Very glad . ”</said><persName corresp="#Mr._Henfrey">Mr. Henfrey</persName>had intended to apologise and withdraw , but this anticipation reassured him . The stranger turned round with his back to the fireplace and put his hands behind his back .<said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ And presently , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ when the clock-mending is over , I think I should like to have some tea . But not till the clock-mending is over . ”</said></p>
    <p n="14"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>was about to leave the room — she made no conversational advances this time , because she did not want to be snubbed in front of<persName corresp="#Mr._Henfrey">Mr. Henfrey</persName>— when her visitor asked her if she had made any arrangements about his boxes at Bramblehurst . She told him she had mentioned the matter to the postman , and that the carrier could bring them over on the morrow .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ You are certain that is the earliest ? ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="15">She was certain , with a marked coldness .</p>
    <p n="16"><said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ I should explain , ”</said>he added ,<said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ what I was really too cold and fatigued to do before , that I am an experimental investigator . ”</said></p>
    <p n="17"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Indeed , sir , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>, much impressed .</p>
    <p n="18"><said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ And my baggage contains apparatus and appliances . ”</said></p>
    <p n="19"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Very useful things indeed they are , sir , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>.</p>
    <p n="20"><said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ And I 'm very naturally anxious to get on with my inquiries . ”</said></p>
    <p n="21"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Of course , sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="22"><said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ My reason for coming to Iping , ”</said>he proceeded , with a certain deliberation of manner ,<said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ was ... a desire for solitude . I do not wish to be disturbed in my work . In addition to my work , an accident — ”</said></p>
    <p n="23"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ I thought as much , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>to herself .</p>
    <p n="24"><said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ — necessitates a certain retirement . My eyes — are sometimes so weak and painful that I have to shut myself up in the dark for hours together . Lock myself up . Sometimes — now and then . Not at present , certainly . At such times the slightest disturbance , the entry of a stranger into the room , is a source of excruciating annoyance to me — it is well these things should be understood . ”</said></p>
    <p n="25"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Certainly , sir , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ And if I might make so bold as to ask — ”</said></p>
    <p n="26"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ That I think , is all , ”</said>said the stranger , with that quietly irresistible air of finality he could assume at will .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>reserved her question and sympathy for a better occasion .</p>
    <p n="27">After<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>had left the room , he remained standing in front of the fire , glaring , so<persName corresp="#Mr._Henfrey">Mr. Henfrey</persName>puts it , at the clock-mending .<persName corresp="#Mr._Henfrey">Mr. Henfrey</persName>not only took off the hands of the clock , and the face , but extracted the works ; and he tried to work in as slow and quiet and unassuming a manner as possible . He worked with the lamp close to him , and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands , and upon the frame and wheels , and left the rest of the room shadowy . When he looked up , coloured patches swam in his eyes . Being constitutionally of a curious nature , he had removed the works — a quite unnecessary proceeding — with the idea of delaying his departure and perhaps falling into conversation with the stranger . But the stranger stood there , perfectly silent and still . So still , it got on<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>'s nerves . He felt alone in the room and looked up , and there , grey and dim , was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly , with a mist of green spots drifting in front of them . It was so uncanny to<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another . Then<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>looked down again . Very uncomfortable position ! One would like to say something . Should he remark that the weather was very cold for the time of year ?</p>
    <p n="28">He looked up as if to take aim with that introductory shot .<said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ The weather — ”</said>he began .</p>
    <p n="29"><said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ Why do n't you finish and go ? ”</said>said the rigid figure , evidently in a state of painfully suppressed rage .<said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ All you 've got to do is to fix the hour-hand on its axle . You 're simply humbugging — ”</said></p>
    <p n="30"><said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ Certainly , sir — one minute more . I overlooked — ”</said>and<persName corresp="#Mr._Henfrey">Mr. Henfrey</persName>finished and went .</p>
    <p n="31">But he went feeling excessively annoyed .<said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ Damn it ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Henfrey">Mr. Henfrey</persName>to himself , trudging down the village through the thawing snow ;<said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ a man must do a clock at times , sure-ly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="32">And again “ Ca n't a man look at you ?— Ugly ! ”</p>
    <p n="33">And yet again ,<said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ Seemingly not . If the police was wanting you you could n't be more wropped and bandaged . ”</said></p>
    <p n="34">At Gleeson 's corner he saw<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>, who had recently married the stranger 's hostess at the “ Coach and<persName>Horses</persName>, ” and who now drove the Iping conveyance , when occasional people required it , to Sidderbridge Junction , coming towards him on his return from that place .<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>had evidently been “ stopping a bit ” at Sidderbridge , to judge by his driving .<said who="#Hall">“ ‘ Ow do ,<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy</persName>? ”</said>he said , passing .</p>
    <p n="35"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ You got a rum un up home ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy</persName>.</p>
    <p n="36"><persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>very sociably pulled up .<said who="#Hall">“ What 's that ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="37"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ Rum-looking customer stopping at the ‘ Coach and<persName>Horses</persName>, ’ ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy</persName>.<said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ My sakes ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="38">And he proceeded to give<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>a vivid description of his grotesque guest .<said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ Looks a bit like a disguise , do n't it ? I 'd like to see a man 's face if I had him stopping in my place , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>.<said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ But women are that trustful — where strangers are concerned . He 's took your rooms and he ai n't even given a name ,<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="39"><said who="#Hall">“ You do n't say so ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>, who was a man of sluggish apprehension .</p>
    <p n="40"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy</persName>.<said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ By the week . Whatever he is , you can n't get rid of him under the week . And he 's got a lot of luggage coming to-morrow , so he says . Let 's hope it wo n't be stones in boxes ,<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="41">He told<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>how his aunt at Hastings had been swindled by a stranger with empty portmanteaux . Altogether he left<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>vaguely suspicious .<said who="#Hall">“ Get up , old girl , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>.<said who="#Hall">“ I s'pose I must see ‘ bout this . ”</said></p>
    <p n="42"><persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy</persName>trudged on his way with his mind considerably relieved .</p>
    <p n="43">Instead of “ seeing ‘ bout it , ” however ,<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>on his return was severely rated by his wife on the length of time he had spent in Sidderbridge , and his mild inquiries were answered snappishly and in a manner not to the point . But the seed of suspicion<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy</persName>had sown germinated in the mind of<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>in spite of these discouragements .<said who="#Mr._Hall">“ You wim ’ do n't know everything , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>, resolved to ascertain more about the personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity . And after the stranger had gone to bed , which he did about half-past nine ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard at his wife 's furniture , just to show that the stranger was n't master there , and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of mathematical computations the stranger had left . When retiring for the night he instructed<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>to look very closely at the stranger 's luggage when it came next day .</p>
    <p n="44"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ You mind you own business ,<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>,<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ and I 'll mind mine . ”</said></p>
    <p n="45">She was all the more inclined to snap at<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>because the stranger was undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger , and she was by no means assured about him in her own mind . In the middle of the night she woke up dreaming of huge white heads like turnips , that came trailing after her , at the end of interminable necks , and with vast black eyes . But being a sensible woman , she subdued her terrors and turned over and went to sleep again .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="3">
    <p n="46">So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February , at the beginning of the thaw , this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping village . Next day his luggage arrived through the slush — and very remarkable luggage it was . There were a couple of trunks indeed , such as a rational man might need , but in addition there were a box of books — big , fat books , of which some were just in an incomprehensible handwriting — and a dozen or more crates , boxes , and cases , containing objects packed in straw , as it seemed to<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>, tugging with a casual curiosity at the straw — glass bottles . The stranger , muffled in hat , coat , gloves , and wrapper , came out impatiently to meet<persName corresp="#Fearenside">Fearenside</persName>'s cart , while<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>was having a word or so of gossip preparatory to helping being them in . Out he came , not noticing<persName corresp="#Fearenside">Fearenside</persName>'s dog , who was sniffing in a dilettante spirit at<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>'s legs .<said who="#Hall">“ Come along with those boxes , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Hall">“ I 've been waiting long enough . ”</said></p>
    <p n="47">And he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to lay hands on the smaller crate .</p>
    <p n="48">No sooner had<persName corresp="#Fearenside">Fearenside</persName>'s dog caught sight of him , however , than it began to bristle and growl savagely , and when he rushed down the steps it gave an undecided hop , and then sprang straight at his hand .<said who="#Hall">“ Whup ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>, jumping back , for he was no hero with dogs , and<persName corresp="#Fearenside">Fearenside</persName>howled ,<said who="#Hall">“ Lie down ! ”</said>and snatched his whip .</p>
    <p n="49">They saw the dog 's teeth had slipped the hand , heard a kick , saw the dog execute a flanking jump and get home on the stranger 's leg , and heard the rip of his trousering . Then the finer end of<persName corresp="#Fearenside">Fearenside</persName>'s whip reached his property , and the dog , yelping with dismay , retreated under the wheels of the waggon . It was all the business of a swift half-minute . No one spoke , everyone shouted . The stranger glanced swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg , made as if he would stoop to the latter , then turned and rushed swiftly up the steps into the inn . They heard him go headlong across the passage and up the uncarpeted stairs to his bedroom .</p>
    <p n="50"><said who="#Fearenside">“ You brute , you ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Fearenside">Fearenside</persName>, climbing off the waggon with his whip in his hand , while the dog watched him through the wheel .<said who="#Fearenside">“ Come here , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Fearenside">Fearenside</persName>—<said who="#Fearenside">“ You 'd better . ”</said></p>
    <p n="51"><persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>had stood gaping .<said who="#Hall">“ He wuz bit , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>.<said who="#Hall">“ I 'd better go and see to en , ”</said>and he trotted after the stranger . He met<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>in the passage .<said who="#Hall">“ Carrier 's darg , ”</said>he said “ bit en . ”</p>
    <p n="52">He went straight upstairs , and the stranger 's door being ajar , he pushed it open and was entering without any ceremony , being of a naturally sympathetic turn of mind .</p>
    <p n="53">The blind was down and the room dim . He caught a glimpse of a most singular thing , what seemed a handless arm waving towards him , and a face of three huge indeterminate spots on white , very like the face of a pale pansy . Then he was struck violently in the chest , hurled back , and the door slammed in his face and locked . It was so rapid that it gave him no time to observe . A waving of indecipherable shapes , a blow , and a concussion . There he stood on the dark little landing , wondering what it might be that he had seen .</p>
    <p n="54">A couple of minutes after , he rejoined the little group that had formed outside the “ Coach and<persName>Horses</persName>. ” There was<persName corresp="#Fearenside">Fearenside</persName>telling about it all over again for the second time ; there was<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>saying his dog did n't have no business to bite her guests ; there was<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>, the general dealer from over the road , interrogative ; and Sandy Wadgers from the forge , judicial ; besides women and children , all of them saying fatuities : “ Would n't let en bite me , I knows ” ; “ ‘ Tas n't right have such dargs ” ;<said who="#Huxter">“ Whad ‘ e bite ‘ n for , than ? ”</said>and so forth .</p>
    <p n="55"><persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>, staring at them from the steps and listening , found it incredible that he had seen anything so very remarkable happen upstairs . Besides , his vocabulary was altogether too limited to express his impressions .</p>
    <p n="56"><said who="#Huxter">“ He do n't want no help , he says , ”</said>he said in answer to his wife 's inquiry .<said who="#Huxter">“ We 'd better be a-takin ’ of his luggage in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="57"><said who="#Mr._Huxter">“ He ought to have it cauterised at once , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>;<said who="#Mr._Huxter">“ especially if it 's at all inflamed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="58"><said who="#Mr._Hall">“ I 'd shoot en , that 's what I 'd do , ”</said>said a lady in the group .</p>
    <p n="59">Suddenly the dog began growling again .</p>
    <p n="60"><said who="#Mr._Huxter">“ Come along , ”</said>cried an angry voice in the doorway , and there stood the muffled stranger with his collar turned up , and his hat-brim bent down .<said who="#Mr._Huxter">“ The sooner you get those things in the better I 'll be pleased . ”</said>It is stated by an anonymous bystander that his trousers and gloves had been changed .</p>
    <p n="61"><said who="#Fearenside">“ Was you hurt , sir ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Fearenside">Fearenside</persName>.<said who="#Fearenside">“ I 'm rare sorry the darg — ”</said></p>
    <p n="62"><said who="#the_stranger">“ Not a bit , ”</said>said the stranger .<said who="#the_stranger">“ Never broke the skin . Hurry up with those things . ”</said></p>
    <p n="63">He then swore to himself , so<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>asserts .</p>
    <p n="64">Directly the first crate was , in accordance with his directions , carried into the parlour , the stranger flung himself upon it with extraordinary eagerness , and began to unpack it , scattering the straw with an utter disregard of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>'s carpet . And from it he began to produce bottles — little fat bottles containing powders , small and slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids , fluted blue bottles labeled Poison , bottles with round bodies and slender necks , large green-glass bottles , large white-glass bottles , bottles with glass stoppers and frosted labels , bottles with fine corks , bottles with bungs , bottles with wooden caps , wine bottles , salad-oil bottles — putting them in rows on the chiffonnier , on the mantel , on the table under the window , round the floor , on the bookshelf — everywhere . The chemist 's shop in Bramblehurst could not boast half so many . Quite a sight it was . Crate after crate yielded bottles , until all six were empty and the table high with straw ; the only things that came out of these crates besides the bottles were a number of test-tubes and a carefully packed balance .</p>
    <p n="65">And directly the crates were unpacked , the stranger went to the window and set to work , not troubling in the least about the litter of straw , the fire which had gone out , the box of books outside , nor for the trunks and other luggage that had gone upstairs .</p>
    <p n="66">When<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>took his dinner in to him , he was already so absorbed in his work , pouring little drops out of the bottles into test-tubes , that he did not hear her until she had swept away the bulk of the straw and put the tray on the table , with some little emphasis perhaps , seeing the state that the floor was in . Then he half turned his head and immediately turned it away again . But she saw he had removed his glasses ; they were beside him on the table , and it seemed to her that his eye sockets were extraordinarily hollow . He put on his spectacles again , and then turned and faced her . She was about to complain of the straw on the floor when he anticipated her .</p>
    <p n="67"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ I wish you would n't come in without knocking , ”</said>he said in the tone of abnormal exasperation that seemed so characteristic of him .</p>
    <p n="68"><said who="#Mr._Hall">“ I knocked , but seemingly — ”</said></p>
    <p n="69"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Perhaps you did . But in my investigations — my really very urgent and necessary investigations — the slightest disturbance , the jar of a door — I must ask you — ”</said></p>
    <p n="70"><said who="#Mr._Hall">“ Certainly , sir . You can turn the lock if you 're like that , you know . Any time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="71"><said who="#the_stranger">“ A very good idea , ”</said>said the stranger .</p>
    <p n="72"><said who="#Mr._Hall">“ This stror , sir , if I might make so bold as to remark — ”</said></p>
    <p n="73"><said who="#the_stranger">“ Do n't . If the straw makes trouble put it down in the bill . ”</said>And he mumbled at her — words suspiciously like curses .</p>
    <p n="74">He was so odd , standing there , so aggressive and explosive , bottle in one hand and test-tube in the other , that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>was quite alarmed . But she was a resolute woman .<said who="#Mr._Hall">“ In which case , I should like to know , sir , what you consider — ”</said></p>
    <p n="75"><said who="#the_stranger">“ A shilling — put down a shilling . Surely a shilling 's enough ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="76"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ So be it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>, taking up the table-cloth and beginning to spread it over the table .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ If you 're satisfied , of course — ”</said></p>
    <p n="77">He turned and sat down , with his coat-collar toward her .</p>
    <p n="78">All the afternoon he worked with the door locked and , as<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>testifies , for the most part in silence . But once there was a concussion and a sound of bottles ringing together as though the table had been hit , and the smash of a bottle flung violently down , and then a rapid pacing athwart the room . Fearing “ something was the matter , ” she went to the door and listened , not caring to knock .</p>
    <p n="79"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ I can n't go on , ”</said>he was raving .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ I can n't go on . Three hundred thousand , four hundred thousand ! The huge multitude ! Cheated ! All my life it may take me ! ... Patience ! Patience indeed ! ... Fool ! fool ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="80">There was a noise of hobnails on the bricks in the bar , and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>had very reluctantly to leave the rest of his soliloquy . When she returned the room was silent again , save for the faint crepitation of his chair and the occasional clink of a bottle . It was all over ; the stranger had resumed work .</p>
    <p n="81">When she took in his tea she saw broken glass in the corner of the room under the concave mirror , and a golden stain that had been carelessly wiped . She called attention to it .</p>
    <p n="82"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Put it down in the bill , ”</said>snapped her visitor .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ For God 's sake do n't worry me . If there 's damage done , put it down in the bill , ”</said>and he went on ticking a list in the exercise book before him .</p>
    <p n="83"><said who="#Fearenside">“ I 'll tell you something , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Fearenside">Fearenside</persName>, mysteriously . It was late in the afternoon , and they were in the little beer-shop of Iping Hanger .</p>
    <p n="84"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ Well ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy Henfrey</persName>.</p>
    <p n="85"><said who="#Fearenside">“ This chap you 're speaking of , what my dog bit . Well — he 's black . Leastways , his legs are . I seed through the tear of his trousers and the tear of his glove . You 'd have expected a sort of pinky to show , would n't you ? Well — there was n't none . Just blackness . I tell you , he 's as black as my hat . ”</said></p>
    <p n="86"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ My sakes ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>.<said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ It 's a rummy case altogether . Why , his nose is as pink as paint ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="87"><said who="#Fearenside">“ That 's true , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Fearenside">Fearenside</persName>.<said who="#Fearenside">“ I knows that . And I tell ‘ ee what I 'm thinking . That marn 's a piebald ,<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy</persName>. Black here and white there — in patches . And he 's ashamed of it . He 's a kind of half-breed , and the colour 's come off patchy instead of mixing . I 've heard of such things before . And it 's the common way with horses , as any one can see . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="4">
    <p n="88">I have told the circumstances of the stranger 's arrival in Iping with a certain fulness of detail , in order that the curious impression he created may be understood by the reader . But excepting two odd incidents , the circumstances of his stay until the extraordinary day of the club festival may be passed over very cursorily . There were a number of skirmishes with<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>on matters of domestic discipline , but in every case until late April , when the first signs of penury began , he over-rode her by the easy expedient of an extra payment .<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>did not like him , and whenever he dared he talked of the advisability of getting rid of him ; but he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing it ostentatiously , and avoiding his visitor as much as possible .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Wait till the summer , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>sagely ,<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ when the artisks are beginning to come . Then we 'll see . He may be a bit overbearing , but bills settled punctual is bills settled punctual , whatever you 'd like to say . ”</said></p>
    <p n="89">The stranger did not go to church , and indeed made no difference between Sunday and the irreligious days , even in costume . He worked , as<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>thought , very fitfully . Some days he would come down early and be continuously busy . On others he would rise late , pace his room , fretting audibly for hours together , smoke , sleep in the armchair by the fire . Communication with the world beyond the village he had none . His temper continued very uncertain ; for the most part his manner was that of a man suffering under almost unendurable provocation , and once or twice things were snapped , torn , crushed , or broken in spasmodic gusts of violence . He seemed under a chronic irritation of the greatest intensity . His habit of talking to himself in a low voice grew steadily upon him , but though<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>listened conscientiously she could make neither head nor tail of what she heard .</p>
    <p n="90">He rarely went abroad by daylight , but at twilight he would go out muffled up invisibly , whether the weather were cold or not , and he chose the loneliest paths and those most overshadowed by trees and banks . His goggling spectacles and ghastly bandaged face under the penthouse of his hat , came with a disagreeable suddenness out of the darkness upon one or two home-going labourers , and<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy Henfrey</persName>, tumbling out of the “ Scarlet Coat ” one night , at half-past nine , was scared shamefully by the stranger 's skull-like head ( he was walking hat in hand ) lit by the sudden light of the opened inn door . Such children as saw him at nightfall dreamt of bogies , and it seemed doubtful whether he disliked boys more than they disliked him , or the reverse ; but there was certainly a vivid enough dislike on either side .</p>
    <p n="91">It was inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and bearing should form a frequent topic in such a village as Iping . Opinion was greatly divided about his occupation .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>was sensitive on the point . When questioned , she explained very carefully that he was an “ experimental investigator , ” going gingerly over the syllables as one who dreads pitfalls . When asked what an experimental investigator was , she would say with a touch of superiority that most educated people knew such things as that , and would thus explain that he “ discovered things . ” Her visitor had had an accident , she said , which temporarily discoloured his face and hands , and being of a sensitive disposition , he was averse to any public notice of the fact .</p>
    <p n="92">Out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was a criminal trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so as to conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police . This idea sprang from the brain of<persName corresp="#Mr._Teddy_Henfrey">Mr. Teddy Henfrey</persName>. No crime of any magnitude dating from the middle or end of February was known to have occurred . Elaborated in the imagination of Mr. Gould , the probationary assistant in the National School , this theory took the form that the stranger was an Anarchist in disguise , preparing explosives , and he resolved to undertake such detective operations as his time permitted . These consisted for the most part in looking very hard at the stranger whenever they met , or in asking people who had never seen the stranger , leading questions about him . But he detected nothing .</p>
    <p n="93">Another school of opinion followed Mr.<persName corresp="#Fearenside">Fearenside</persName>, and either accepted the piebald view or some modification of it ; as , for instance , Silas Durgan , who was heard to assert that “ if he choses to show enself at fairs he 'd make his fortune in no time , ” and being a bit of a theologian , compared the stranger to the man with the one talent . Yet another view explained the entire matter by regarding the stranger as a harmless lunatic . That had the advantage of accounting for everything straight away .</p>
    <p n="94">Between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers . Sussex folk have few superstitions , and it was only after the events of early April that the thought of the supernatural was first whispered in the village . Even then it was only credited among the women folk .</p>
    <p n="95">But whatever they thought of him , people in Iping , on the whole , agreed in disliking him . His irritability , though it might have been comprehensible to an urban brain-worker , was an amazing thing to these quiet Sussex villagers . The frantic gesticulations they surprised now and then , the headlong pace after nightfall that swept him upon them round quiet corners , the inhuman bludgeoning of all tentative advances of curiosity , the taste for twilight that led to the closing of doors , the pulling down of blinds , the extinction of candles and lamps — who could agree with such goings on ? They drew aside as he passed down the village , and when he had gone by , young humourists would up with coat-collars and down with hat-brims , and go pacing nervously after him in imitation of his occult bearing . There was a song popular at that time called “ The Bogey Man ” . Miss Statchell sang it at the schoolroom concert ( in aid of the church lamps ) , and thereafter whenever one or two of the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared , a bar or so of this tune , more or less sharp or flat , was whistled in the midst of them . Also belated little children would call “ Bogey Man ! ” after him , and make off tremulously elated .</p>
    <p n="96"><persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>, the general practitioner , was devoured by curiosity . The bandages excited his professional interest , the report of the thousand and one bottles aroused his jealous regard . All through April and May he coveted an opportunity of talking to the stranger , and at last , towards Whitsuntide , he could stand it no longer , but hit upon the subscription-list for a village nurse as an excuse . He was surprised to find that<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>did not know his guest 's name .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ He give a name , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>— an assertion which was quite unfounded —<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ but I did n't rightly hear it . ”</said>She thought it seemed so silly not to know the man 's name .</p>
    <p n="97"><persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>rapped at the parlour door and entered . There was a fairly audible imprecation from within .<said who="#Cuss">“ Pardon my intrusion , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>, and then the door closed and cut<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>off from the rest of the conversation .</p>
    <p n="98">She could hear the murmur of voices for the next ten minutes , then a cry of surprise , a stirring of feet , a chair flung aside , a bark of laughter , quick steps to the door , and<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>appeared , his face white , his eyes staring over his shoulder . He left the door open behind him , and without looking at her strode across the hall and went down the steps , and she heard his feet hurrying along the road . He carried his hat in his hand . She stood behind the door , looking at the open door of the parlour . Then she heard the stranger laughing quietly , and then his footsteps came across the room . She could not see his face where she stood . The parlour door slammed , and the place was silent again .</p>
    <p n="99"><persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>went straight up the village to<persName corresp="#Bunting">Bunting</persName>the vicar .<said who="#Cuss">“ Am I mad ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>began abruptly , as he entered the shabby little study .<said who="#Cuss">“ Do I look like an insane person ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="100"><said who="#Bunting">“ What 's happened ? ”</said>said the vicar , putting the ammonite on the loose sheets of his forth-coming sermon .</p>
    <p n="101"><said who="#Cuss">“ That chap at the inn — ”</said></p>
    <p n="102"><said who="#Bunting">“ Well ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="103"><said who="#Cuss">“ Give me something to drink , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>, and he sat down .</p>
    <p n="104">When his nerves had been steadied by a glass of cheap sherry — the only drink the good vicar had available — he told him of the interview he had just had .<said who="#Bunting">“ Went in , ”</said>he gasped ,<said who="#Bunting">“ and began to demand a subscription for that Nurse Fund . He 'd stuck his hands in his pockets as I came in , and he sat down lumpily in his chair . Sniffed . I told him I 'd heard he took an interest in scientific things . He said yes . Sniffed again . Kept on sniffing all the time ; evidently recently caught an infernal cold . No wonder , wrapped up like that ! I developed the nurse idea , and all the while kept my eyes open . Bottles — chemicals — everywhere . Balance , test-tubes in stands , and a smell of — evening primrose . Would he subscribe ? Said he 'd consider it . Asked him , point-blank , was he researching . Said he was . A long research ? Got quite cross . ‘ A damnable long research , ’ said he , blowing the cork out , so to speak . ‘ Oh , ’ said I . And out came the grievance . The man was just on the boil , and my question boiled him over . He had been given a prescription , most valuable prescription — what for he would n't say . Was it medical ? ‘ Damn you ! What are you fishing after ? ’ I apologised . Dignified sniff and cough . He resumed . He 'd read it . Five ingredients . Put it down ; turned his head . Draught of air from window lifted the paper . Swish , rustle . He was working in a room with an open fireplace , he said . Saw a flicker , and there was the prescription burning and lifting chimneyward . Rushed towards it just as it whisked up the chimney . So ! Just at that point , to illustrate his story , out came his arm . ”</said></p>
    <p n="105"><said who="#Cuss">“ Well ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="106"><said who="#Bunting">“ No hand — just an empty sleeve . Lord ! I thought , that 's a deformity ! Got a cork arm , I suppose , and has taken it off . Then , I thought , there 's something odd in that . What the devil keeps that sleeve up and open , if there 's nothing in it ? There was nothing in it , I tell you . Nothing down it , right down to the joint . I could see right down it to the elbow , and there was a glimmer of light shining through a tear of the cloth . ‘ Good God ! ’ I said . Then he stopped . Stared at me with those black goggles of his , and then at his sleeve . ”</said></p>
    <p n="107"><said who="#Cuss">“ Well ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="108"><said who="#Cuss">“ That 's all . He never said a word ; just glared , and put his sleeve back in his pocket quickly . ‘ I was saying , ’ said he , ‘ that there was the prescription burning , was n't I ? ’ Interrogative cough . ‘ How the devil , ’ said I , ‘ can you move an empty sleeve like that ? ’ ‘ Empty sleeve ? ’ ‘ Yes , ’ said I , ‘ an empty sleeve . ’</said></p>
    <p n="109"><said who="#Cuss">“ ‘ It 's an empty sleeve , is it ? You saw it was an empty sleeve ? ’ He stood up right away . I stood up too . He came towards me in three very slow steps , and stood quite close . Sniffed venomously . I did n't flinch , though I 'm hanged if that bandaged knob of his , and those blinkers , are n't enough to unnerve any one , coming quietly up to you .</said></p>
    <p n="110"><said who="#Cuss">“ ‘ You said it was an empty sleeve ? ’ he said . ‘ Certainly , ’ I said . At staring and saying nothing a barefaced man , unspectacled , starts scratch . Then very quietly he pulled his sleeve out of his pocket again , and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me again . He did it very , very slowly . I looked at it . Seemed an age . ‘ Well ? ’ said I , clearing my throat , ‘ there 's nothing in it . ’</said></p>
    <p n="111"><said who="#Bunting">“ Had to say something . I was beginning to feel frightened . I could see right down it . He extended it straight towards me , slowly , slowly — just like that — until the cuff was six inches from my face . Queer thing to see an empty sleeve come at you like that ! And then — ”</said></p>
    <p n="112"><said who="#Cuss">“ Well ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="113"><said who="#Bunting">“ Something — exactly like a finger and thumb it felt — nipped my nose . ”</said></p>
    <p n="114"><persName corresp="#Bunting">Bunting</persName>began to laugh .</p>
    <p n="115"><said who="#Cuss">“ There was n't anything there ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>, his voice running up into a shriek at the “ there . ”<said who="#Cuss">“ It 's all very well for you to laugh , but I tell you I was so startled , I hit his cuff hard , and turned around , and cut out of the room — I left him — ”</said></p>
    <p n="116"><persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>stopped . There was no mistaking the sincerity of his panic . He turned round in a helpless way and took a second glass of the excellent vicar 's very inferior sherry .<said who="#Cuss">“ When I hit his cuff , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>,<said who="#Cuss">“ I tell you , it felt exactly like hitting an arm . And there was n't an arm ! There was n't the ghost of an arm ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="117"><persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>thought it over . He looked suspiciously at<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ It 's a most remarkable story , ”</said>he said . He looked very wise and grave indeed .<said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ It 's really , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>with judicial emphasis ,<said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ a most remarkable story . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="5">
    <p n="118">The facts of the burglary at the vicarage came to us chiefly through the medium of the vicar and his wife . It occurred in the small hours of Whit Monday , the day devoted in Iping to the Club festivities .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bunting">Mrs. Bunting</persName>, it seems , woke up suddenly in the stillness that comes before the dawn , with the strong impression that the door of their bedroom had opened and closed . She did not arouse her husband at first , but sat up in bed listening . She then distinctly heard the pad , pad , pad of bare feet coming out of the adjoining dressing-room and walking along the passage towards the staircase . As soon as she felt assured of this , she aroused the Rev .<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>as quietly as possible . He did not strike a light , but putting on his spectacles , her dressing-gown and his bath slippers , he went out on the landing to listen . He heard quite distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk down-stairs , and then a violent sneeze .</p>
    <p n="119">At that he returned to his bedroom , armed himself with the most obvious weapon , the poker , and descended the staircase as noiselessly as possible .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bunting">Mrs. Bunting</persName>came out on the landing .</p>
    <p n="120">The hour was about four , and the ultimate darkness of the night was past . There was a faint shimmer of light in the hall , but the study doorway yawned impenetrably black . Everything was still except the faint creaking of the stairs under<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>'s tread , and the slight movements in the study . Then something snapped , the drawer was opened , and there was a rustle of papers . Then came an imprecation , and a match was struck and the study was flooded with yellow light .<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>was now in the hall , and through the crack of the door he could see the desk and the open drawer and a candle burning on the desk . But the robber he could not see . He stood there in the hall undecided what to do , and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bunting">Mrs. Bunting</persName>, her face white and intent , crept slowly downstairs after him . One thing kept<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>'s courage ; the persuasion that this burglar was a resident in the village .</p>
    <p n="121">They heard the chink of money , and realised that the robber had found the housekeeping reserve of gold — two pounds ten in half sovereigns altogether . At that sound<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>was nerved to abrupt action . Gripping the poker firmly , he rushed into the room , closely followed by<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bunting">Mrs. Bunting</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Bunting">“ Surrender ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>, fiercely , and then stooped amazed . Apparently the room was perfectly empty .</p>
    <p n="122">Yet their conviction that they had , that very moment , heard somebody moving in the room had amounted to a certainty . For half a minute , perhaps , they stood gaping , then<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bunting">Mrs. Bunting</persName>went across the room and looked behind the screen , while<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>, by a kindred impulse , peered under the desk . Then<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bunting">Mrs. Bunting</persName>turned back the window-curtains , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>looked up the chimney and probed it with the poker . Then<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bunting">Mrs. Bunting</persName>scrutinised the waste-paper basket and<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>opened the lid of the coal-scuttle . Then they came to a stop and stood with eyes interrogating each other .</p>
    <p n="123"><said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ I could have sworn — ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>.</p>
    <p n="124"><said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ The candle ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ Who lit the candle ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="125"><said who="#Mrs._Bunting">“ The drawer ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bunting">Mrs. Bunting</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Bunting">“ And the money 's gone ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="126">She went hastily to the doorway .</p>
    <p n="127"><said who="#Mrs._Bunting">“ Of all the strange occurrences — ”</said></p>
    <p n="128">There was a violent sneeze in the passage . They rushed out , and as they did so the kitchen door slammed .<said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ Bring the candle , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>, and led the way . They both heard a sound of bolts being hastily shot back .</p>
    <p n="129">As he opened the kitchen door he saw through the scullery that the back door was just opening , and the faint light of early dawn displayed the dark masses of the garden beyond . He is certain that nothing went out of the door . It opened , stood open for a moment , and then closed with a slam . As it did so , the candle<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bunting">Mrs. Bunting</persName>was carrying from the study flickered and flared . It was a minute or more before they entered the kitchen .</p>
    <p n="130">The place was empty . They refastened the back door , examined the kitchen , pantry , and scullery thoroughly , and at last went down into the cellar . There was not a soul to be found in the house , search as they would .</p>
    <p n="131">Daylight found the vicar and his wife , a quaintly-costumed little couple , still marvelling about on their own ground floor by the unnecessary light of a guttering candle .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="6">
    <p n="132">Now it happened that in the early hours of Whit Monday , before Millie was hunted out for the day ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>both rose and went noiselessly down into the cellar . Their business there was of a private nature , and had something to do with the specific gravity of their beer . They had hardly entered the cellar when<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>found she had forgotten to bring down a bottle of sarsaparilla from their joint-room . As she was the expert and principal operator in this affair ,<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>very properly went upstairs for it .</p>
    <p n="133">On the landing he was surprised to see that the stranger 's door was ajar . He went on into his own room and found the bottle as he had been directed .</p>
    <p n="134">But returning with the bottle , he noticed that the bolts of the front door had been shot back , that the door was in fact simply on the latch . And with a flash of inspiration he connected this with the stranger 's room upstairs and the suggestions of<persName corresp="#Mr._Teddy_Henfrey">Mr. Teddy Henfrey</persName>. He distinctly remembered holding the candle while<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>shot these bolts overnight . At the sight he stopped , gaping , then with the bottle still in his hand went upstairs again . He rapped at the stranger 's door . There was no answer . He rapped again ; then pushed the door wide open and entered .</p>
    <p n="135">It was as he expected . The bed , the room also , was empty . And what was stranger , even to his heavy intelligence , on the bedroom chair and along the rail of the bed were scattered the garments , the only garments so far as he knew , and the bandages of their guest . His big slouch hat even was cocked jauntily over the bed-post .</p>
    <p n="136">As<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>stood there he heard his wife 's voice coming out of the depth of the cellar , with that rapid telescoping of the syllables and interrogative cocking up of the final words to a high note , by which the West Sussex villager is wont to indicate a brisk impatience .<said who="#Hall">“ George ! You gart whad a wand ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="137">At that he turned and hurried down to her .<said who="#Hall">“ Janny , ”</said>he said , over the rail of the cellar steps ,<said who="#Hall">“ ‘ tas the truth what<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>sez . ‘ E 's not in uz room , ‘ e e n't . And the front door 's onbolted . ”</said></p>
    <p n="138">At first<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>did not understand , and as soon as she did she resolved to see the empty room for herself .<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>, still holding the bottle , went first .<said who="#Hall">“ If ‘ e e n't there , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Hall">“ ‘ is close are . And what 's ‘ e doin ’ ‘ ithout ‘ is close , then ? ‘ Tas a most curious business . ”</said></p>
    <p n="139">As they came up the cellar steps they both , it was afterwards ascertained , fancied they heard the front door open and shut , but seeing it closed and nothing there , neither said a word to the other about it at the time .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>passed her husband in the passage and ran on first upstairs . Someone sneezed on the staircase .<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>, following six steps behind , thought that he heard her sneeze . She , going on first , was under the impression that<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>was sneezing . She flung open the door and stood regarding the room .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Of all the curious ! ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="140">She heard a sniff close behind her head as it seemed , and turning , was surprised to see<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>a dozen feet off on the topmost stair . But in another moment he was beside her . She bent forward and put her hand on the pillow and then under the clothes .</p>
    <p n="141"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Cold , ”</said>she said .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ He 's been up this hour or more . ”</said></p>
    <p n="142">As she did so , a most extraordinary thing happened . The bed-clothes gathered themselves together , leapt up suddenly into a sort of peak , and then jumped headlong over the bottom rail . It was exactly as if a hand had clutched them in the centre and flung them aside . Immediately after , the stranger 's hat hopped off the bed-post , described a whirling flight in the air through the better part of a circle , and then dashed straight at<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>'s face . Then as swiftly came the sponge from the washstand ; and then the chair , flinging the stranger 's coat and trousers carelessly aside , and laughing drily in a voice singularly like the stranger 's , turned itself up with its four legs at<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>, seemed to take aim at her for a moment , and charged at her . She screamed and turned , and then the chair legs came gently but firmly against her back and impelled her and<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>out of the room . The door slammed violently and was locked . The chair and bed seemed to be executing a dance of triumph for a moment , and then abruptly everything was still .</p>
    <p n="143"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>was left almost in a fainting condition in<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>'s arms on the landing . It was with the greatest difficulty that<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>and Millie , who had been roused by her scream of alarm , succeeded in getting her downstairs , and applying the restoratives customary in such cases .</p>
    <p n="144"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ ‘ Tas sperits , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ I know ‘ tas sperits . I 've read in papers of en . Tables and chairs leaping and dancing ... ”</said></p>
    <p n="145"><said who="#Hall">“ Take a drop more , Janny , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>.<said who="#Hall">“ ‘ Twill steady ye . ”</said></p>
    <p n="146"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Lock him out , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Do n't let him come in again . I half guessed — I might ha ’ known . With them goggling eyes and bandaged head , and never going to church of a Sunday . And all they bottles — more'n it 's right for any one to have . He 's put the sperits into the furniture .... My good old furniture ! ‘ Twas in that very chair my poor dear mother used to sit when I was a little girl . To think it should rise up against me now ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="147"><said who="#Hall">“ Just a drop more , Janny , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>.<said who="#Hall">“ Your nerves is all upset . ”</said></p>
    <p n="148">They sent Millie across the street through the golden five o'clock sunshine to rouse up Mr. Sandy Wadgers , the blacksmith .<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>'s compliments and the furniture upstairs was behaving most extraordinary . Would<persName corresp="#Mr._Wadgers">Mr. Wadgers</persName>come round ? He was a knowing man , was<persName corresp="#Mr._Wadgers">Mr. Wadgers</persName>, and very resourceful . He took quite a grave view of the case .<said who="#Mr._Wadgers">“ Arm darmed if thet ent witchcraft , ”</said>was the view of Mr. Sandy Wadgers .<said who="#Mr._Wadgers">“ You warnt horseshoes for such gentry as he . ”</said></p>
    <p n="149">He came round greatly concerned . They wanted him to lead the way upstairs to the room , but he did n't seem to be in any hurry . He preferred to talk in the passage . Over the way<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>'s apprentice came out and began taking down the shutters of the tobacco window . He was called over to join the discussion .<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>naturally followed over in the course of a few minutes . The Anglo-Saxon genius for parliamentary government asserted itself ; there was a great deal of talk and no decisive action .<said who="#Mr._Huxter">“ Let 's have the facts first , ”</said>insisted Mr. Sandy Wadgers .<said who="#Mr._Huxter">“ Let 's be sure we 'd be acting perfectly right in bustin ’ that there door open . A door onbust is always open to bustin ’ , but ye can n't onbust a door once you 've busted en . ”</said></p>
    <p n="150">And suddenly and most wonderfully the door of the room upstairs opened of its own accord , and as they looked up in amazement , they saw descending the stairs the muffled figure of the stranger staring more blackly and blankly than ever with those unreasonably large blue glass eyes of his . He came down stiffly and slowly , staring all the time ; he walked across the passage staring , then stopped .</p>
    <p n="151"><said who="#Mr._Huxter">“ Look there ! ”</said>he said , and their eyes followed the direction of his gloved finger and saw a bottle of sarsaparilla hard by the cellar door . Then he entered the parlour , and suddenly , swiftly , viciously , slammed the door in their faces .</p>
    <p n="152">Not a word was spoken until the last echoes of the slam had died away . They stared at one another .<said who="#Mr._Wadgers">“ Well , if that do n't lick everything ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Wadgers">Mr. Wadgers</persName>, and left the alternative unsaid .</p>
    <p n="153"><said who="#Mr._Huxter">“ I 'd go in and ask'n ‘ bout it , ”</said>said Wadgers , to<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Huxter">“ I 'd d'mand an explanation . ”</said></p>
    <p n="154">It took some time to bring the landlady 's husband up to that pitch . At last he rapped , opened the door , and got as far as ,<said who="#Mr._Wadgers">“ Excuse me — ”</said></p>
    <p n="155"><said who="#Mr._Huxter">“ Go to the devil ! ”</said>said the stranger in a tremendous voice , and “ Shut that door after you . ” So that brief interview terminated .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="7">
    <p n="156">The stranger went into the little parlour of the “ Coach and<persName>Horses</persName>” about half-past five in the morning , and there he remained until near midday , the blinds down , the door shut , and none , after<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>'s repulse , venturing near him .</p>
    <p n="157">All that time he must have fasted . Thrice he rang his bell , the third time furiously and continuously , but no one answered him .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Him and his ‘ go to the devil ’ indeed ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>. Presently came an imperfect rumour of the burglary at the vicarage , and two and two were put together .<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>, assisted by Wadgers , went off to find Mr. Shuckleforth , the magistrate , and take his advice . No one ventured upstairs . How the stranger occupied himself is unknown . Now and then he would stride violently up and down , and twice came an outburst of curses , a tearing of paper , and a violent smashing of bottles .</p>
    <p n="158">The little group of scared but curious people increased . Mrs.<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>came over ; some gay young fellows resplendent in black ready-made jackets and pique paper ties — for it was Whit Monday — joined the group with confused interrogations . Young Archie Harker distinguished himself by going up the yard and trying to peep under the window-blinds . He could see nothing , but gave reason for supposing that he did , and others of the Iping youth presently joined him .</p>
    <p n="159">It was the finest of all possible Whit Mondays , and down the village street stood a row of nearly a dozen booths , a shooting gallery , and on the grass by the forge were three yellow and chocolate waggons and some picturesque strangers of both sexes putting up a cocoanut shy . The gentlemen wore blue jerseys , the ladies white aprons and quite fashionable hats with heavy plumes . Wodger , of the “ Purple Fawn , ” and Mr. Jaggers , the cobbler , who also sold old second-hand ordinary bicycles , were stretching a string of union-jacks and royal ensigns ( which had originally celebrated the first Victorian Jubilee ) across the road .</p>
    <p n="160">And inside , in the artificial darkness of the parlour , into which only one thin jet of sunlight penetrated , the stranger , hungry we must suppose , and fearful , hidden in his uncomfortable hot wrappings , pored through his dark glasses upon his paper or chinked his dirty little bottles , and occasionally swore savagely at the boys , audible if invisible , outside the windows . In the corner by the fireplace lay the fragments of half a dozen smashed bottles , and a pungent twang of chlorine tainted the air . So much we know from what was heard at the time and from what was subsequently seen in the room .</p>
    <p n="161">About noon he suddenly opened his parlour door and stood glaring fixedly at the three or four people in the bar .<said who="#Huxter">“<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>, ”</said>he said . Somebody went sheepishly and called for<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>.</p>
    <p n="162"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>appeared after an interval , a little short of breath , but all the fiercer for that .<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>was still out . She had deliberated over this scene , and she came holding a little tray with an unsettled bill upon it .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Is it your bill you 're wanting , sir ? ”</said>she said .</p>
    <p n="163"><said who="#Huxter">“ Why was n't my breakfast laid ? Why have n't you prepared my meals and answered my bell ? Do you think I live without eating ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="164"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Why is n't my bill paid ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ That 's what I want to know . ”</said></p>
    <p n="165"><said who="#Hall">“ I told you three days ago I was awaiting a remittance — ”</said></p>
    <p n="166"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ I told you two days ago I was n't going to await no remittances . You can n't grumble if your breakfast waits a bit , if my bill 's been waiting these five days , can you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="167">The stranger swore briefly but vividly .</p>
    <p n="168"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Nar , nar ! ”</said>from the bar .</p>
    <p n="169"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ And I 'd thank you kindly , sir , if you 'd keep your swearing to yourself , sir , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>.</p>
    <p n="170">The stranger stood looking more like an angry diving-helmet than ever . It was universally felt in the bar that<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>had the better of him . His next words showed as much .</p>
    <p n="171"><said who="#Hall">“ Look here , my good woman — ”</said>he began .</p>
    <p n="172"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Do n't ‘ good woman ’ me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>.</p>
    <p n="173"><said who="#Hall">“ I 've told you my remittance has n't come . ”</said></p>
    <p n="174"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Remittance indeed ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>.</p>
    <p n="175"><said who="#Hall">“ Still , I daresay in my pocket — ”</said></p>
    <p n="176"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ You told me three days ago that you had n't anything but a sovereign 's worth of silver upon you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="177"><said who="#Hall">“ Well , I 've found some more — ”</said></p>
    <p n="178"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ ‘ Ul-lo ! ”</said>from the bar .</p>
    <p n="179"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ I wonder where you found it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>.</p>
    <p n="180">That seemed to annoy the stranger very much . He stamped his foot .<said who="#Hall">“ What do you mean ? ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="181"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ That I wonder where you found it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ And before I take any bills or get any breakfasts , or do any such things whatsoever , you got to tell me one or two things I do n't understand , and what nobody do n't understand , and what everybody is very anxious to understand . I want to know what you been doing t'my chair upstairs , and I want to know how ‘ tis your room was empty , and how you got in again . Them as stops in this house comes in by the doors — that 's the rule of the house , and that you did n't do , and what I want to know is how you did come in . And I want to know — ”</said></p>
    <p n="182">Suddenly the stranger raised his gloved hands clenched , stamped his foot , and said ,<said who="#Hall">“ Stop ! ”</said>with such extraordinary violence that he silenced her instantly .</p>
    <p n="183"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ You do n't understand , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ who I am or what I am . I 'll show you . By<persName>Heaven</persName>! I 'll show you . ”</said>Then he put his open palm over his face and withdrew it . The centre of his face became a black cavity .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Here , ”</said>he said . He stepped forward and handed<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>something which she , staring at his metamorphosed face , accepted automatically . Then , when she saw what it was , she screamed loudly , dropped it , and staggered back . The nose — it was the stranger 's nose ! pink and shining — rolled on the floor .</p>
    <p n="184">Then he removed his spectacles , and everyone in the bar gasped . He took off his hat , and with a violent gesture tore at his whiskers and bandages . For a moment they resisted him . A flash of horrible anticipation passed through the bar .<said who="#Hall">“ Oh , my Gard ! ”</said>said some one . Then off they came .</p>
    <p n="185">It was worse than anything .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>, standing open-mouthed and horror-struck , shrieked at what she saw , and made for the door of the house . Everyone began to move . They were prepared for scars , disfigurements , tangible horrors , but nothing ! The bandages and false hair flew across the passage into the bar , making a hobbledehoy jump to avoid them . Everyone tumbled on everyone else down the steps . For the man who stood there shouting some incoherent explanation , was a solid gesticulating figure up to the coat-collar of him , and then — nothingness , no visible thing at all !</p>
    <p n="186">People down the village heard shouts and shrieks , and looking up the street saw the “ Coach and<persName>Horses</persName>” violently firing out its humanity . They saw<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>fall down and<persName corresp="#Mr._Teddy_Henfrey">Mr. Teddy Henfrey</persName>jump to avoid tumbling over her , and then they heard the frightful screams of Millie , who , emerging suddenly from the kitchen at the noise of the tumult , had come upon the headless stranger from behind . These increased suddenly .</p>
    <p n="187">Forthwith everyone all down the street , the sweetstuff seller , cocoanut shy proprietor and his assistant , the swing man , little boys and girls , rustic dandies , smart wenches , smocked elders and aproned gipsies — began running towards the inn , and in a miraculously short space of time a crowd of perhaps forty people , and rapidly increasing , swayed and hooted and inquired and exclaimed and suggested , in front of<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>'s establishment . Everyone seemed eager to talk at once , and the result was Babel . A small group supported<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>, who was picked up in a state of collapse . There was a conference , and the incredible evidence of a vociferous eye-witness .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ O Bogey ! ”</said><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ What 's he been doin ’ , then ? ”</said><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Ai n't hurt the girl , ‘ as ‘ e ? ”</said><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Run at en with a knife , I believe . ”</said><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ No ‘ ed , I tell ye . I do n't mean no manner of speaking . I mean marn ‘ ithout a ‘ ed ! ”</said><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Narnsense ! ‘ tis some conjuring trick . ”</said><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Fetched off ‘ is wrapping , ‘ e did — ”</said></p>
    <p n="188">In its struggles to see in through the open door , the crowd formed itself into a straggling wedge , with the more adventurous apex nearest the inn .<said who="#Mr._Teddy_Henfrey">“ He stood for a moment , I heerd the gal scream , and he turned . I saw her skirts whisk , and he went after her . Did n't take ten seconds . Back he comes with a knife in uz hand and a loaf ; stood just as if he was staring . Not a moment ago . Went in that there door . I tell ‘ e , ‘ e ai n't gart no ‘ ed at all . You just missed en — ”</said></p>
    <p n="189">There was a disturbance behind , and the speaker stopped to step aside for a little procession that was marching very resolutely towards the house ; first<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>, very red and determined , then Mr. Bobby<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>, the village constable , and then the wary<persName corresp="#Mr._Wadgers">Mr. Wadgers</persName>. They had come now armed with a warrant .</p>
    <p n="190">People shouted conflicting information of the recent circumstances .<said who="#Jaffers">“ ‘ Ed or no ‘ ed , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>,<said who="#Jaffers">“ I got to ‘ rest en , and ‘ rest en I will . ”</said></p>
    <p n="191"><persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>marched up the steps , marched straight to the door of the parlour and flung it open .<said who="#Jaffers">“ Constable , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Jaffers">“ do your duty . ”</said></p>
    <p n="192"><persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>marched in .<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>next , Wadgers last . They saw in the dim light the headless figure facing them , with a gnawed crust of bread in one gloved hand and a chunk of cheese in the other .</p>
    <p n="193"><said who="#Hall">“ That 's him ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>.</p>
    <p n="194"><said who="#Jaffers">“ What the devil 's this ? ”</said>came in a tone of angry expostulation from above the collar of the figure .</p>
    <p n="195"><said who="#Jaffers">“ You 're a damned rum customer , mister , ”</said>said Mr.<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>.<said who="#Jaffers">“ But ‘ ed or no ‘ ed , the warrant says ‘ body , ’ and duty 's duty — ”</said></p>
    <p n="196"><said who="#Hall">“ Keep off ! ”</said>said the figure , starting back .</p>
    <p n="197">Abruptly he whipped down the bread and cheese , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>just grasped the knife on the table in time to save it . Off came the stranger 's left glove and was slapped in<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>’ face . In another moment<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>, cutting short some statement concerning a warrant , had gripped him by the handless wrist and caught his invisible throat . He got a sounding kick on the shin that made him shout , but he kept his grip .<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>sent the knife sliding along the table to Wadgers , who acted as goal-keeper for the offensive , so to speak , and then stepped forward as<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>and the stranger swayed and staggered towards him , clutching and hitting in . A chair stood in the way , and went aside with a crash as they came down together .</p>
    <p n="198"><said who="#Jaffers">“ Get the feet , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>between his teeth .</p>
    <p n="199"><persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>, endeavouring to act on instructions , received a sounding kick in the ribs that disposed of him for a moment , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Wadgers">Mr. Wadgers</persName>, seeing the decapitated stranger had rolled over and got the upper side of<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>, retreated towards the door , knife in hand , and so collided with<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>and the Sidderbridge carter coming to the rescue of law and order . At the same moment down came three or four bottles from the chiffonnier and shot a web of pungency into the air of the room .</p>
    <p n="200"><said who="#Jaffers">“ I 'll surrender , ”</said>cried the stranger , though he had<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>down , and in another moment he stood up panting , a strange figure , headless and handless — for he had pulled off his right glove now as well as his left .<said who="#Jaffers">“ It 's no good , ”</said>he said , as if sobbing for breath .</p>
    <p n="201">It was the strangest thing in the world to hear that voice coming as if out of empty space , but the Sussex peasants are perhaps the most matter-of-fact people under the sun .<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>got up also and produced a pair of handcuffs . Then he stared .</p>
    <p n="202"><said who="#Jaffers">“ I say ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>, brought up short by a dim realization of the incongruity of the whole business ,<said who="#Jaffers">“ Darn it ! Ca n't use ‘ em as I can see . ”</said></p>
    <p n="203">The stranger ran his arm down his waistcoat , and as if by a miracle the buttons to which his empty sleeve pointed became undone . Then he said something about his shin , and stooped down . He seemed to be fumbling with his shoes and socks .</p>
    <p n="204"><said who="#Huxter">“ Why ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>, suddenly ,<said who="#Huxter">“ that 's not a man at all . It 's just empty clothes . Look ! You can see down his collar and the linings of his clothes . I could put my arm — ”</said></p>
    <p n="205">He extended his hand ; it seemed to meet something in mid-air , and he drew it back with a sharp exclamation .<said who="#Jaffers">“ I wish you 'd keep your fingers out of my eye , ”</said>said the aerial voice , in a tone of savage expostulation .<said who="#Jaffers">“ The fact is , I 'm all here — head , hands , legs , and all the rest of it , but it happens I 'm invisible . It 's a confounded nuisance , but I am . That 's no reason why I should be poked to pieces by every stupid bumpkin in Iping , is it ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="206">The suit of clothes , now all unbuttoned and hanging loosely upon its unseen supports , stood up , arms akimbo .</p>
    <p n="207">Several other of the men folks had now entered the room , so that it was closely crowded .<said who="#Huxter">“ Invisible , eh ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>, ignoring the stranger 's abuse .<said who="#Huxter">“ Who ever heard the likes of that ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="208"><said who="#Jaffers">“ It 's strange , perhaps , but it 's not a crime . Why am I assaulted by a policeman in this fashion ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="209"><said who="#Jaffers">“ Ah ! that 's a different matter , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>.<said who="#Jaffers">“ No doubt you are a bit difficult to see in this light , but I got a warrant and it 's all correct . What I 'm after ai n't no invisibility ,— it 's burglary . There 's a house been broke into and money took . ”</said></p>
    <p n="210"><said who="#Huxter">“ Well ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="211"><said who="#Jaffers">“ And circumstances certainly point — ”</said></p>
    <p n="212"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Stuff and nonsense ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>.</p>
    <p n="213"><said who="#Jaffers">“ I hope so , sir ; but I 've got my instructions . ”</said></p>
    <p n="214"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Well , ”</said>said the stranger ,<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I 'll come . I 'll come . But no handcuffs . ”</said></p>
    <p n="215"><said who="#Jaffers">“ It 's the regular thing , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>.</p>
    <p n="216"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ No handcuffs , ”</said>stipulated the stranger .</p>
    <p n="217"><said who="#Jaffers">“ Pardon me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>.</p>
    <p n="218">Abruptly the figure sat down , and before any one could realise was was being done , the slippers , socks , and trousers had been kicked off under the table . Then he sprang up again and flung off his coat .</p>
    <p n="219"><said who="#Jaffers">“ Here , stop that , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>, suddenly realising what was happening . He gripped at the waistcoat ; it struggled , and the shirt slipped out of it and left it limply and empty in his hand .<said who="#Jaffers">“ Hold him ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>, loudly .<said who="#Jaffers">“ Once he gets the things off — ”</said></p>
    <p n="220"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Hold him ! ”</said>cried everyone , and there was a rush at the fluttering white shirt which was now all that was visible of the stranger .</p>
    <p n="221">The shirt-sleeve planted a shrewd blow in<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>'s face that stopped his open-armed advance , and sent him backward into old Toothsome the sexton , and in another moment the garment was lifted up and became convulsed and vacantly flapping about the arms , even as a shirt that is being thrust over a man 's head .<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>clutched at it , and only helped to pull it off ; he was struck in the mouth out of the air , and incontinently threw his truncheon and smote<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy Henfrey</persName>savagely upon the crown of his head .</p>
    <p n="222"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ Look out ! ”</said>said everybody , fencing at random and hitting at nothing .<said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ Hold him ! Shut the door ! Do n't let him loose ! I got something ! Here he is ! ”</said>A perfect Babel of noises they made . Everybody , it seemed , was being hit all at once , and Sandy Wadgers , knowing as ever and his wits sharpened by a frightful blow in the nose , reopened the door and led the rout . The others , following incontinently , were jammed for a moment in the corner by the doorway . The hitting continued . Phipps , the Unitarian , had a front tooth broken , and<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>was injured in the cartilage of his ear .<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>was struck under the jaw , and , turning , caught at something that intervened between him and<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>in the melee , and prevented their coming together . He felt a muscular chest , and in another moment the whole mass of struggling , excited men shot out into the crowded hall .</p>
    <p n="223"><said who="#Jaffers">“ I got him ! ”</said>shouted<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>, choking and reeling through them all , and wrestling with purple face and swelling veins against his unseen enemy .</p>
    <p n="224">Men staggered right and left as the extraordinary conflict swayed swiftly towards the house door , and went spinning down the half-dozen steps of the inn .<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>cried in a strangled voice — holding tight , nevertheless , and making play with his knee — spun around , and fell heavily undermost with his head on the gravel . Only then did his fingers relax .</p>
    <p n="225">There were excited cries of “ Hold him ! ”<said who="#Jaffers">“ Invisible ! ”</said>and so forth , and a young fellow , a stranger in the place whose name did not come to light , rushed in at once , caught something , missed his hold , and fell over the constable 's prostrate body . Half-way across the road a woman screamed as something pushed by her ; a dog , kicked apparently , yelped and ran howling into<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>'s yard , and with that the transit of<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>was accomplished . For a space people stood amazed and gesticulating , and then came panic , and scattered them abroad through the village as a gust scatters dead leaves .</p>
    <p n="226">But<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>lay quite still , face upward and knees bent , at the foot of the steps of the inn .</p>

    <p n="227">The eighth chapter is exceedingly brief , and relates that Gibbons , the amateur naturalist of the district , while lying out on the spacious open downs without a soul within a couple of miles of him , as he thought , and almost dozing , heard close to him the sound as of a man coughing , sneezing , and then swearing savagely to himself ; and looking , beheld nothing . Yet the voice was indisputable . It continued to swear with that breadth and variety that distinguishes the swearing of a cultivated man . It grew to a climax , diminished again , and died away in the distance , going as it seemed to him in the direction of Adderdean . It lifted to a spasmodic sneeze and ended . Gibbons had heard nothing of the morning 's occurrences , but the phenomenon was so striking and disturbing that his philosophical tranquillity vanished ; he got up hastily , and hurried down the steepness of the hill towards the village , as fast as he could go .</p>

    <p n="228">You must picture<persName corresp="#Mr._Thomas_Marvel">Mr. Thomas Marvel</persName>as a person of copious , flexible visage , a nose of cylindrical protrusion , a liquorish , ample , fluctuating mouth , and a beard of bristling eccentricity . His figure inclined to embonpoint ; his short limbs accentuated this inclination . He wore a furry silk hat , and the frequent substitution of twine and shoe-laces for buttons , apparent at critical points of his costume , marked a man essentially bachelor .</p>
    <p n="229"><persName corresp="#Mr._Thomas_Marvel">Mr. Thomas Marvel</persName>was sitting with his feet in a ditch by the roadside over the down towards Adderdean , about a mile and a half out of Iping . His feet , save for socks of irregular open-work , were bare , his big toes were broad , and pricked like the ears of a watchful dog . In a leisurely manner — he did everything in a leisurely manner — he was contemplating trying on a pair of boots . They were the soundest boots he had come across for a long time , but too large for him ; whereas the ones he had were , in dry weather , a very comfortable fit , but too thin-soled for damp .<persName corresp="#Mr._Thomas_Marvel">Mr. Thomas Marvel</persName>hated roomy shoes , but then he hated damp . He had never properly thought out which he hated most , and it was a pleasant day , and there was nothing better to do . So he put the four shoes in a graceful group on the turf and looked at them . And seeing them there among the grass and springing agrimony , it suddenly occurred to him that both pairs were exceedingly ugly to see . He was not at all startled by a voice behind him .</p>
    <p n="230"><said who="#the_Voice">“ They 're boots , anyhow , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>.</p>
    <p n="231"><said who="#Mr._Thomas_Marvel">“ They are — charity boots , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Thomas_Marvel">Mr. Thomas Marvel</persName>, with his head on one side regarding them distastefully ;<said who="#Mr._Thomas_Marvel">“ and which is the ugliest pair in the whole blessed universe , I 'm darned if I know ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="232"><said who="#the_Voice">“ H 'm , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>.</p>
    <p n="233"><said who="#Mr._Thomas_Marvel">“ I 've worn worse — in fact , I 've worn none . But none so owdacious ugly — if you 'll allow the expression . I 've been cadging boots — in particular — for days . Because I was sick of them . They 're sound enough , of course . But a gentleman on tramp sees such a thundering lot of his boots . And if you 'll believe me , I 've raised nothing in the whole blessed country , try as I would , but them . Look at ‘ em ! And a good country for boots , too , in a general way . But it 's just my promiscuous luck . I 've got my boots in this country ten years or more . And then they treat you like this . ”</said></p>

    <p n="236">He turned his head over his shoulder to the right , to look at the boots of his interlocutor with a view to comparisons , and lo ! where the boots of his interlocutor should have been were neither legs nor boots . He was irradiated by the dawn of a great amazement .<said who="#Mr._Thomas_Marvel">“ Where are yer ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Thomas_Marvel">Mr. Thomas Marvel</persName>over his shoulder and coming on all fours .

    <p n="298"><said who="#the_Voice">“ But if you betray me , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ if you fail to do as I direct you — ”</said>He paused and tapped<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>'s shoulder smartly .<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>gave a yelp of terror at the touch .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ I do n't want to betray you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>, edging away from the direction of the fingers .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Do n't you go a-thinking that , whatever you do .

    <p n="299">After the first gusty panic had spent itself Iping became argumentative . Scepticism suddenly reared its head — rather nervous scepticism , not at all assured of its back , but scepticism nevertheless . It is so much easier not to believe in an invisible man ; and those who had actually seen him dissolve into air , or felt the strength of his arm , could be counted on the fingers of two hands . And of these witnesses<persName corresp="#Mr._Wadgers">Mr. Wadgers</persName>was presently missing , having retired impregnably behind the bolts and bars of his own house , and<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>was lying stunned in the parlour of the “ Coach and<persName>Horses</persName>. ” Great and strange ideas transcending experience often have less effect upon men and women than smaller , more tangible considerations . Iping was gay with bunting , and everybody was in gala dress . Whit Monday had been looked forward to for a month or more . By the afternoon even those who believed in<persName corresp="#the_Unseen">the Unseen</persName>were beginning to resume their little amusements in a tentative fashion , on the supposition that he had quite gone away , and with the sceptics he was already a jest . But people , sceptics and believers alike , were remarkably sociable all that day .</p>
    <p n="300">Haysman 's meadow was gay with a tent , in which<persName corresp="#Mrs._Bunting">Mrs. Bunting</persName>and other ladies were preparing tea , while , without , the Sunday-school children ran races and played games under the noisy guidance of the curate and the Misses<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>and Sackbut . No doubt there was a slight uneasiness in the air , but people for the most part had the sense to conceal whatever imaginative qualms they experienced . On the village green an inclined strong , down which , clinging the while to a pulley-swung handle , one could be hurled violently against a sack at the other end , came in for considerable favour among the adolescent , as also did the swings and the cocoanut shies . There was also promenading , and the steam organ attached to a small roundabout filled the air with a pungent flavour of oil and with equally pungent music . Members of the club , who had attended church in the morning , were splendid in badges of pink and green , and some of the gayer-minded had also adorned their bowler hats with brilliant-coloured favours of ribbon . Old Fletcher , whose conceptions of holiday-making were severe , was visible through the jasmine about his window or through the open door ( whichever way you chose to look ) , poised delicately on a plank supported on two chairs , and whitewashing the ceiling of his front room .</p>
    <p n="301">About four o'clock a stranger entered the village from the direction of the downs . He was a short , stout person in an extraordinarily shabby top hat , and he appeared to be very much out of breath . His cheeks were alternately limp and tightly puffed . His mottled face was apprehensive , and he moved with a sort of reluctant alacrity . He turned the corner of the church , and directed his way to the “ Coach and<persName>Horses</persName>. ” Among others old Fletcher remembers seeing him , and indeed the old gentleman was so struck by his peculiar agitation that he inadvertently allowed a quantity of whitewash to run down the brush into the sleeve of his coat while regarding him .</p>
    <p n="302">This stranger , to the perceptions of the proprietor of the cocoanut shy , appeared to be talking to himself , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>remarked the same thing . He stopped at the foot of the “ Coach and<persName>Horses</persName>” steps , and , according to<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>, appeared to undergo a severe internal struggle before he could induce himself to enter the house . Finally he marched up the steps , and was seen by<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>to turn to the left and open the door of the parlour .<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>heard voices from within the room and from the bar apprising the man of his error .<said who="#Hall">“ That room 's private ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>, and the stranger shut the door clumsily and went into the bar .</p>
    <p n="303">In the course of a few minutes he reappeared , wiping his lips with the back of his hand with an air of quiet satisfaction that somehow impressed<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>as assumed . He stood looking about him for some moments , and then<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>saw him walk in an oddly furtive manner towards the gates of the yard , upon which the parlour window opened . The stranger , after some hesitation , leant against one of the gate-posts , produced a short clay pipe , and prepared to fill it . His fingers trembled while doing so . He lit it clumsily , and folding his arms began to smoke in a languid attitude , an attitude which his occasional glances up the yard altogether belied .</p>
    <p n="304">All this<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>saw over the canisters of the tobacco window , and the singularity of the man 's behaviour prompted him to maintain his observation .</p>
    <p n="305">Presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his pocket . Then he vanished into the yard . Forthwith<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>, conceiving he was witness of some petty larceny , leapt round his counter and ran out into the road to intercept the thief . As he did so ,<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>reappeared , his hat askew , a big bundle in a blue table-cloth in one hand , and three books tied together — as it proved afterwards with the Vicar 's braces — in the other . Directly he saw<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>he gave a sort of gasp , and turning sharply to the left , began to run .<said who="#Huxter">“ Stop , thief ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>, and set off after him .<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>'s sensations were vivid but brief . He saw the man just before him and spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill road . He saw the village flags and festivities beyond , and a face or so turned towards him . He bawled ,<said who="#Huxter">“ Stop ! ”</said>again . He had hardly gone ten strides before his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion , and he was no longer running , but flying with inconceivable rapidity through the air . He saw the ground suddenly close to his face . The world seemed to splash into a million whirling specks of light , and subsequent proceedings interested him no more .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="11">
    <p n="306">Now in order clearly to understand what had happened in the inn , it is necessary to go back to the moment when<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>first came into view of<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>'s window .</p>
    <p n="307">At that precise moment<persName corresp="#Mr._Cuss">Mr. Cuss</persName>and<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>were in the parlour . They were seriously investigating the strange occurrences of the morning , and were , with<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>'s permission , making a thorough examination of<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>'s belongings .<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>had partially recovered from his fall and had gone home in the charge of his sympathetic friends . The stranger 's scattered garments had been removed by<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>and the room tidied up . And on the table under the window where the stranger had been wont to work ,<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>had hit almost at once on three big books in manuscript labelled “ Diary . ”</p>
    <p n="308"><said who="#Cuss">“ Diary ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>, putting the three books on the table .<said who="#Cuss">“ Now , at any rate , we shall learn something . ”</said>The Vicar stood with his hands on the table .</p>
    <p n="309"><said who="#Cuss">“ Diary , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>, sitting down , putting two volumes to support the third , and opening it .<said who="#Cuss">“ H 'm — no name on the fly-leaf . Bother !— cypher . And figures . ”</said></p>
    <p n="310">The vicar came round to look over his shoulder .</p>
    <p n="311"><persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>turned the pages over with a face suddenly disappointed .<said who="#Cuss">“ I 'm — dear me ! It 's all cypher ,<persName corresp="#Bunting">Bunting</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="312"><said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ There are no diagrams ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ No illustrations throwing light — ”</said></p>
    <p n="313"><said who="#Mr._Cuss">“ See for yourself , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Cuss">Mr. Cuss</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Cuss">“ Some of it 's mathematical and some of it 's Russian or some such language ( to judge by the letters ) , and some of it 's Greek . Now the Greek I thought you — ”</said></p>
    <p n="314"><said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ Of course , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>, taking out and wiping his spectacles and feeling suddenly very uncomfortable — for he had no Greek left in his mind worth talking about ;<said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ yes — the Greek , of course , may furnish a clue . ”</said></p>
    <p n="315"><said who="#Mr._Cuss">“ I 'll find you a place . ”</said></p>
    <p n="316"><said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ I 'd rather glance through the volumes first , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>, still wiping .<said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ A general impression first ,<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>, and then , you know , we can go looking for clues . ”</said></p>
    <p n="317">He coughed , put on his glasses , arranged them fastidiously , coughed again , and wished something would happen to avert the seemingly inevitable exposure . Then he took the volume<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>handed him in a leisurely manner . And then something did happen .</p>
    <p n="318">The door opened suddenly .</p>
    <p n="319">Both gentlemen started violently , looked round , and were relieved to see a sporadically rosy face beneath a furry silk hat .<said who="#Cuss">“ Tap ? ”</said>asked the face , and stood staring .</p>
    <p n="320"><said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ No , ”</said>said both gentlemen at once .</p>
    <p n="321"><said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ Over the other side , my man , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>. And “ Please shut that door , ” said<persName corresp="#Mr._Cuss">Mr. Cuss</persName>, irritably .</p>
    <p n="322"><said who="#Mr._Cuss">“ All right , ”</said>said the intruder , as it seemed in a low voice curiously different from the huskiness of its first inquiry .<said who="#Mr._Cuss">“ Right you are , ”</said>said the intruder in the former voice .<said who="#Mr._Cuss">“ Stand clear ! ”</said>and he vanished and closed the door .</p>
    <p n="323"><said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ A sailor , I should judge , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ Amusing fellows , they are . Stand clear ! indeed . A nautical term , referring to his getting back out of the room , I suppose . ”</said></p>
    <p n="324"><said who="#Cuss">“ I daresay so , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>.<said who="#Cuss">“ My nerves are all loose to-day . It quite made me jump — the door opening like that . ”</said></p>
    <p n="325"><persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>smiled as if he had not jumped .<said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ And now , ”</said>he said with a sigh ,<said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ these books . ”</said></p>
    <p n="326">Someone sniffed as he did so .</p>
    <p n="327"><said who="#Bunting">“ One thing is indisputable , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Bunting">Bunting</persName>, drawing up a chair next to that of<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>.<said who="#Bunting">“ There certainly have been very strange things happen in Iping during the last few days — very strange . I cannot of course believe in this absurd invisibility story — ”</said></p>
    <p n="328"><said who="#Cuss">“ It 's incredible , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>—<said who="#Cuss">“ incredible . But the fact remains that I saw — I certainly saw right down his sleeve — ”</said></p>
    <p n="329"><said who="#Bunting">“ But did you — are you sure ? Suppose a mirror , for instance — hallucinations are so easily produced . I do n't know if you have ever seen a really good conjuror — ”</said></p>
    <p n="330"><said who="#Cuss">“ I wo n't argue again , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>.<said who="#Cuss">“ We 've thrashed that out ,<persName corresp="#Bunting">Bunting</persName>. And just now there 's these books — Ah ! here 's some of what I take to be Greek ! Greek letters certainly . ”</said></p>
    <p n="331">He pointed to the middle of the page .<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>flushed slightly and brought his face nearer , apparently finding some difficulty with his glasses . Suddenly he became aware of a strange feeling at the nape of his neck . He tried to raise his head , and encountered an immovable resistance . The feeling was a curious pressure , the grip of a heavy , firm hand , and it bore his chin irresistibly to the table .<said who="#Bunting">“ Do n't move , little men , ”</said>whispered a voice ,<said who="#Cuss">“ or I 'll brain you both ! ”</said>He looked into the face of<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>, close to his own , and each saw a horrified reflection of his own sickly astonishment .</p>
    <p n="332"><said who="#the_Voice">“ I 'm sorry to handle you so roughly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>,<said who="#the_Voice">“ but it 's unavoidable . ”</said></p>
    <p n="333"><said who="#the_Voice">“ Since when did you learn to pry into an investigator 's private memoranda , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>; and two chins struck the table simultaneously , and two sets of teeth rattled .</p>
    <p n="334"><said who="#Cuss">“ Since when did you learn to invade the private rooms of a man in misfortune ? ”</said>and the concussion was repeated .</p>
    <p n="335"><said who="#the_Voice">“ Where have they put my clothes ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="336"><said who="#the_Voice">“ Listen , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>.<said who="#the_Voice">“ The windows are fastened and I 've taken the key out of the door . I am a fairly strong man , and I have the poker handy — besides being invisible . There 's not the slightest doubt that I could kill you both and get away quite easily if I wanted to — do you understand ? Very well . If I let you go will you promise not to try any nonsense and do what I tell you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="337">The vicar and the doctor looked at one another , and the doctor pulled a face .<said who="#the_doctor">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>, and the doctor repeated it . Then the pressure on the necks relaxed , and the doctor and the vicar sat up , both very red in the face and wriggling their heads .</p>
    <p n="338"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Please keep sitting where you are , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>.<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Here 's the poker , you see . ”</said></p>
    <p n="339"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ When I came into this room , ”</said>continued<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>, after presenting the poker to the tip of the nose of each of his visitors ,<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I did not expect to find it occupied , and I expected to find , in addition to my books of memoranda , an outfit of clothing . Where is it ? No — do n't rise . I can see it 's gone . Now , just at present , though the days are quite warm enough for an invisible man to run about stark , the evenings are quite chilly . I want clothing — and other accommodation ; and I must also have those three books . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="12">
    <p n="340">It is unavoidable that at this point the narrative should break off again , for a certain very painful reason that will presently be apparent . While these things were going on in the parlour , and while<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>was watching<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>smoking his pipe against the gate , not a dozen yards away were<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>and<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy Henfrey</persName>discussing in a state of cloudy puzzlement the one Iping topic .</p>
    <p n="341">Suddenly there came a violent thud against the door of the parlour , a sharp cry , and then — silence .</p>
    <p n="342"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ Hul-lo ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy Henfrey</persName>.</p>
    <p n="343"><said who="#Mr._Hall">“ Hul-lo ! ”</said>from the Tap .</p>
    <p n="344"><persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>took things in slowly but surely .<said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ That ai n't right , ”</said>he said , and came round from behind the bar towards the parlour door .</p>
    <p n="345">He and<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Teddy</persName>approached the door together , with intent faces . Their eyes considered .<said who="#Hall">“ Summat wrong , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>, and<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>nodded agreement . Whiffs of an unpleasant chemical odour met them , and there was a muffled sound of conversation , very rapid and subdued .</p>
    <p n="346"><said who="#Hall">“ You all right thur ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>, rapping .</p>
    <p n="347">The muttered conversation ceased abruptly , for a moment silence , then the conversation was resumed , in hissing whispers , then a sharp cry of “ No ! no , you do n't ! ” There came a sudden motion and the oversetting of a chair , a brief struggle . Silence again .</p>
    <p n="348"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ What the dooce ? ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>, sotto voce .</p>
    <p n="349"><said who="#Mr._Hall">“ You — all — right thur ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>, sharply , again .</p>
    <p n="350">The Vicar 's voice answered with a curious jerking intonation :<said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ Quite ri-right . Please do n't — interrupt . ”</said></p>
    <p n="351"><said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ Odd ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Henfrey">Mr. Henfrey</persName>.</p>
    <p n="352"><said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ Odd ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Hall">Mr. Hall</persName>.</p>
    <p n="353"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ Says , ‘ Do n't interrupt , ’ ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>.</p>
    <p n="354"><said who="#Hall">“ I heerd'n , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>.</p>
    <p n="355"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ And a sniff , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>.</p>
    <p n="356">They remained listening . The conversation was rapid and subdued .<said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ I can n't , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>, his voice rising ;<said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ I tell you , sir , I will not . ”</said></p>
    <p n="357"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ What was that ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>.</p>

    <p n="360"><said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ ‘ Disgraceful , ’ ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Henfrey">Mr. Henfrey</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Henfrey">“ I heard it — distinct . ”</said></p>
    <p n="361"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ Who 's that speaking now ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>.</p>
    <p n="362"><said who="#Hall">“<persName corresp="#Mr._Cuss">Mr. Cuss</persName>, I s'pose , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>.<said who="#Hall">“ Can you hear — anything ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="363">Silence . The sounds within indistinct and perplexing .</p>
    <p n="364"><said who="#Hall">“ Sounds like throwing the table-cloth about , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>.</p>
    <p n="365"><persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>appeared behind the bar .<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>made gestures of silence and invitation . This aroused<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>'s wifely opposition .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ What yer listenin ’ there for ,<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>? ”</said>she asked .<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Ai n't you nothin ’ better to do — busy day like this ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="366"><persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>tried to convey everything by grimaces and dumb show , but<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>was obdurate . She raised her voice . So<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>and<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>, rather crestfallen , tiptoed back to the bar , gesticulating to explain to her .</p>
    <p n="367">At first she refused to see anything in what they had heard at all . Then she insisted on<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>keeping silence , while<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>told her his story . She was inclined to think the whole business nonsense — perhaps they were just moving the furniture about .<said who="#Hall">“ I heerd'n say ‘ disgraceful ’ ; that I did , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>.</p>
    <p n="368"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ I heerd that ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>.</p>
    <p n="369"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Like as not — ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>.</p>
    <p n="370"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Hsh ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Teddy_Henfrey">Mr. Teddy Henfrey</persName>.<said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ Did n't I hear the window ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="371"><said who="#Mrs._Hall">“ What window ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>.</p>
    <p n="372"><said who="#Teddy_Henfrey">“ Parlour window , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>.</p>
    <p n="373">Everyone stood listening intently .<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>'s eyes , directed straight before her , saw without seeing the brilliant oblong of the inn door , the road white and vivid , and<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>'s shop-front blistering in the June sun . Abruptly<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>'s door opened and<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>appeared , eyes staring with excitement , arms gesticulating .<said who="#Huxter">“ Yap ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>.<said who="#Huxter">“ Stop thief ! ”</said>and he ran obliquely across the oblong towards the yard gates , and vanished .</p>
    <p n="374">Simultaneously came a tumult from the parlour , and a sound of windows being closed .</p>
    <p n="375"><persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>,<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>, and the human contents of the tap rushed out at once pell-mell into the street . They saw someone whisk round the corner towards the road , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>executing a complicated leap in the air that ended on his face and shoulder . Down the street people were standing astonished or running towards them .</p>
    <p n="376"><persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>was stunned .<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>stopped to discover this , but<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>and the two labourers from the Tap rushed at once to the corner , shouting incoherent things , and saw<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>vanishing by the corner of the church wall . They appear to have jumped to the impossible conclusion that this was<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>suddenly become visible , and set off at once along the lane in pursuit . But<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>had hardly run a dozen yards before he gave a loud shout of astonishment and went flying headlong sideways , clutching one of the labourers and bringing him to the ground . He had been charged just as one charges a man at football . The second labourer came round in a circle , stared , and conceiving that<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>had tumbled over of his own accord , turned to resume the pursuit , only to be tripped by the ankle just as<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>had been . Then , as the first labourer struggled to his feet , he was kicked sideways by a blow that might have felled an ox .</p>
    <p n="377">As he went down , the rush from the direction of the village green came round the corner . The first to appear was the proprietor of the cocoanut shy , a burly man in a blue jersey . He was astonished to see the lane empty save for three men sprawling absurdly on the ground . And then something happened to his rear-most foot , and he went headlong and rolled sideways just in time to graze the feet of his brother and partner , following headlong . The two were then kicked , knelt on , fallen over , and cursed by quite a number of over-hasty people .</p>
    <p n="378">Now when<persName corresp="#Hall">Hall</persName>and<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>and the labourers ran out of the house ,<persName corresp="#Mrs._Hall">Mrs. Hall</persName>, who had been disciplined by years of experience , remained in the bar next the till . And suddenly the parlour door was opened , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Cuss">Mr. Cuss</persName>appeared , and without glancing at her rushed at once down the steps toward the corner .<said who="#Mr._Cuss">“ Hold him ! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Mr._Cuss">“ Do n't let him drop that parcel . ”</said></p>
    <p n="379">He knew nothing of the existence of<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>. For<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>had handed over the books and bundle in the yard . The face of<persName corresp="#Mr._Cuss">Mr. Cuss</persName>was angry and resolute , but his costume was defective , a sort of limp white kilt that could only have passed muster in Greece .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Hold him ! ”</said>he bawled .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ He 's got my trousers ! And every stitch of the Vicar 's clothes ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="380"><said who="#Huxter">“ ‘ Tend to him in a minute ! ”</said>he cried to<persName corresp="#Teddy_Henfrey">Henfrey</persName>as he passed the prostrate<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>, and , coming round the corner to join the tumult , was promptly knocked off his feet into an indecorous sprawl . Somebody in full flight trod heavily on his finger . He yelled , struggled to regain his feet , was knocked against and thrown on all fours again , and became aware that he was involved not in a capture , but a rout . Everyone was running back to the village . He rose again and was hit severely behind the ear . He staggered and set off back to the “ Coach and<persName>Horses</persName>” forthwith , leaping over the deserted<persName corresp="#Huxter">Huxter</persName>, who was now sitting up , on his way .</p>
    <p n="381">Behind him as he was halfway up the inn steps he heard a sudden yell of rage , rising sharply out of the confusion of cries , and a sounding smack in someone 's face . He recognised the voice as that of<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>, and the note was that of a man suddenly infuriated by a painful blow .</p>
    <p n="382">In another moment<persName corresp="#Mr._Cuss">Mr. Cuss</persName>was back in the parlour .<said who="#Mr._Cuss">“ He 's coming back ,<persName corresp="#Bunting">Bunting</persName>! ”</said>he said , rushing in .<said who="#Mr._Cuss">“ Save yourself ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="383"><persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>was standing in the window engaged in an attempt to clothe himself in the hearth-rug and a West Surrey Gazette .<said who="#Bunting">“ Who 's coming ? ”</said>he said , so startled that his costume narrowly escaped disintegration .</p>
    <p n="384"><said who="#Cuss">“ Invisible Man , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Cuss">Cuss</persName>, and rushed on to the window .<said who="#Cuss">“ We 'd better clear out from here ! He 's fighting mad ! Mad ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="385">In another moment he was out in the yard .</p>
    <p n="386"><said who="#Mr._Bunting">“ Good heavens ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>, hesitating between two horrible alternatives . He heard a frightful struggle in the passage of the inn , and his decision was made . He clambered out of the window , adjusted his costume hastily , and fled up the village as fast as his fat little legs would carry him .</p>
    <p n="387">From the moment when<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>screamed with rage and<persName corresp="#Mr._Bunting">Mr. Bunting</persName>made his memorable flight up the village , it became impossible to give a consecutive account of affairs in Iping . Possibly<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>'s original intention was simply to cover<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>'s retreat with the clothes and books . But his temper , at no time very good , seems to have gone completely at some chance blow , and forthwith he set to smiting and overthrowing , for the mere satisfaction of hurting .</p>
    <p n="388">You must figure the street full of running figures , of doors slamming and fights for hiding-places . You must figure the tumult suddenly striking on the unstable equilibrium of old Fletcher 's planks and two chairs — with cataclysmic results . You must figure an appalled couple caught dismally in a swing . And then the whole tumultuous rush has passed and the Iping street with its gauds and flags is deserted save for the still raging unseen , and littered with cocoanuts , overthrown canvas screens , and the scattered stock in trade of a sweetstuff stall . Everywhere there is a sound of closing shutters and shoving bolts , and the only visible humanity is an occasional flitting eye under a raised eyebrow in the corner of a window pane .</p>
    <p n="389"><persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>amused himself for a little while by breaking all the windows in the “ Coach and<persName>Horses</persName>, ” and then he thrust a street lamp through the parlour window of Mrs. Gribble . He it must have been who cut the telegraph wire to Adderdean just beyond Higgins ’ cottage on the Adderdean road . And after that , as his peculiar qualities allowed , he passed out of human perceptions altogether , and he was neither heard , seen , nor felt in Iping any more . He vanished absolutely .</p>
    <p n="390">But it was the best part of two hours before any human being ventured out again into the desolation of Iping street .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="13">
    <p n="391">When the dusk was gathering and Iping was just beginning to peep timorously forth again upon the shattered wreckage of its Bank Holiday , a short , thick-set man in a shabby silk hat was marching painfully through the twilight behind the beechwoods on the road to Bramblehurst . He carried three books bound together by some sort of ornamental elastic ligature , and a bundle wrapped in a blue table-cloth . His rubicund face expressed consternation and fatigue ; he appeared to be in a spasmodic sort of hurry . He was accompanied by a voice other than his own , and ever and again he winced under the touch of unseen hands .</p>

    <p n="397"><said who="#Marvel">“ It 's bad enough to let these floundering yokels explode my little secret , without your cutting off with my books . It 's lucky for some of them they cut and ran when they did ! Here am I ... No one knew I was invisible ! And now what am I to do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="398"><said who="#Marvel">“ What am I to do ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>, sotto voce .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="14">
    <p n="430">Ten o'clock the next morning found<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>, unshaven , dirty , and travel-stained , sitting with the books beside him and his hands deep in his pockets , looking very weary , nervous , and uncomfortable , and inflating his cheeks at infrequent intervals , on the bench outside a little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe . Beside him were the books , but now they were tied with string . The bundle had been abandoned in the pine-woods beyond Bramblehurst , in accordance with a change in the plans of<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>.<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>sat on the bench , and although no one took the slightest notice of him , his agitation remained at fever heat . His hands would go ever and again to his various pockets with a curious nervous fumbling .</p>
    <p n="431">When he had been sitting for the best part of an hour , however , an elderly mariner , carrying a newspaper , came out of the inn and sat down beside him .<said who="#the_mariner">“ Pleasant day , ”</said>said the mariner .</p>
    <p n="432"><persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>glanced about him with something very like terror .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Very , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="433"><said who="#the_mariner">“ Just seasonable weather for the time of year , ”</said>said the mariner , taking no denial .</p>
    <p n="434"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Quite , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>.</p>
    <p n="435">The mariner produced a toothpick , and ( saving his regard ) was engrossed thereby for some minutes . His eyes meanwhile were at liberty to examine<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>'s dusty figure , and the books beside him . As he had approached<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>he had heard a sound like the dropping of coins into a pocket . He was struck by the contrast of<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>'s appearance with this suggestion of opulence . Thence his mind wandered back again to a topic that had taken a curiously firm hold of his imagination .</p>
    <p n="436"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Books ? ”</said>he said suddenly , noisily finishing with the toothpick .</p>
    <p n="437"><persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>started and looked at them .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Oh , yes , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Yes , they 're books . ”</said></p>
    <p n="438"><said who="#the_mariner">“ There 's some extra-ordinary things in books , ”</said>said the mariner .</p>
    <p n="439"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ I believe you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>.</p>
    <p n="440"><said who="#the_mariner">“ And some extra-ordinary things out of ‘ em , ”</said>said the mariner .</p>
    <p n="441"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ True likewise , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>. He eyed his interlocutor , and then glanced about him .</p>
    <p n="442"><said who="#the_mariner">“ There 's some extra-ordinary things in newspapers , for example , ”</said>said the mariner .</p>
    <p n="443"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ There are . ”</said></p>
    <p n="444"><said who="#the_mariner">“ In this newspaper , ”</said>said the mariner .</p>
    <p n="445"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Ah ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>.</p>
    <p n="446"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ There 's a story , ”</said>said the mariner , fixing<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>with an eye that was firm and deliberate ;<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ there 's a story about an Invisible Man , for instance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="447"><persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>pulled his mouth askew and scratched his cheek and felt his ears glowing .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ What will they be writing next ? ”</said>he asked faintly .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Ostria , or America ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="448"><said who="#the_mariner">“ Neither , ”</said>said the mariner .<said who="#the_mariner">“ Here . ”</said></p>

    <p n="450"><said who="#the_mariner">“ When I say here , ”</said>said the mariner , to<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>'s intense relief ,<said who="#the_mariner">“ I do n't of course mean here in this place , I mean hereabouts . ”</said></p>
    <p n="451"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ An Invisible Man ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ And what 's he been up to ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="452"><said who="#Marvel">“ Everything , ”</said>said the mariner , controlling<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>with his eye , and then amplifying ,<said who="#Marvel">“ every — blessed — thing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="453"><said who="#Marvel">“ I ai n't seen a paper these four days , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>.</p>

    <p n="456"><said who="#the_mariner">“ He started there . And where he came from , nobody do n't seem to know . Here it is : ‘ Pe-culiar Story from Iping . ’ And it says in this paper that the evidence is extra-ordinary strong — extra-ordinary . ”</said></p>

    <p n="458"><said who="#the_mariner">“ But then , it 's an extra-ordinary story . There is a clergyman and a medical gent witnesses — saw ‘ im all right and proper — or leastways did n't see ‘ im . He was staying , it says , at the ‘ Coach an ’<persName>Horses</persName>, ’ and no one do n't seem to have been aware of his misfortune , it says , aware of his misfortune , until in an Altercation in the inn , it says , his bandages on his head was torn off . It was then ob-served that his head was invisible . Attempts were At Once made to secure him , but casting off his garments , it says , he succeeded in escaping , but not until after a desperate struggle , in which he had inflicted serious injuries , it says , on our worthy and able constable , Mr. J . A.<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>. Pretty straight story , eh ? Names and everything . ”</said></p>
    <p n="459"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Lord ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>, looking nervously about him , trying to count the money in his pockets by his unaided sense of touch , and full of a strange and novel idea .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ It sounds most astonishing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="460"><said who="#Marvel">“ Do n't it ? Extra-ordinary , I call it . Never heard tell of Invisible Men before , I have n't , but nowadays one hears such a lot of extra-ordinary things — that — ”</said></p>

    <p n="462"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ It 's enough , ai n't it ? ”</said>said the mariner .</p>
    <p n="463"><said who="#Marvel">“ Did n't go Back by any chance ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>.<said who="#Marvel">“ Just escaped and that 's all , eh ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="464"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ All ! ”</said>said the mariner .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Why !— ai n't it enough ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="465"><said who="#Marvel">“ Quite enough , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>.</p>

    <p n="469">He nodded his head slowly .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ It makes me regular uncomfortable , the bare thought of that chap running about the country ! He is at present At Large , and from certain evidence it is supposed that he has — taken — took , I suppose they mean — the road to Port Stowe . You see we 're right in it ! None of your American wonders , this time . And just think of the things he might do ! Where 'd you be , if he took a drop over and above , and had a fancy to go for you ? Suppose he wants to rob — who can prevent him ? He can trespass , he can burgle , he could walk through a cordon of policemen as easy as me or you could give the slip to a blind man ! Easier ! For these here blind chaps hear uncommon sharp , I 'm told . And wherever there was liquor he fancied — ”</said></p>
    <p n="470"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ He 's got a tremenjous advantage , certainly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>.<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ And — well ... ”</said></p>

    <p n="472">All this time<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>had been glancing about him intently , listening for faint footfalls , trying to detect imperceptible movements . He seemed on the point of some great resolution . He coughed behind his hand .</p>
    <p n="473">He looked about him again , listened , bent towards the mariner , and lowered his voice :<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ The fact of it is — I happen — to know just a thing or two about this Invisible Man . From private sources . ”</said></p>

    <p n="479"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ The fact is , ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>eagerly in a confidential undertone . Suddenly his expression changed marvellously .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Ow ! ”</said>he said . He rose stiffly in his seat . His face was eloquent of physical suffering .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Wow ! ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="480"><said who="#Marvel">“ What 's up ? ”</said>said the mariner , concerned .</p>
    <p n="481"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Toothache , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>, and put his hand to his ear . He caught hold of his books .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ I must be getting on , I think , ”</said>he said . He edged in a curious way along the seat away from his interlocutor .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ But you was just a-going to tell me about this here Invisible Man ! ”</said>protested the mariner .<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>seemed to consult with himself .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Hoax , ”</said>said a Voice .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ It 's a hoax , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>.</p>

    <p n="485"><said who="#Marvel">“ Not a word of it , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>, stoutly .</p>
    <p n="486">The mariner stared , paper in hand .<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>jerkily faced about .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Wait a bit , ”</said>said the mariner , rising and speaking slowly ,<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ D'you mean to say —? ”</said></p>
    <p n="487"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ I do , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>.</p>
    <p n="488"><said who="#Marvel">“ Then why did you let me go on and tell you all this blarsted stuff , then ? What d'yer mean by letting a man make a fool of himself like that for ? Eh ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="489"><persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>blew out his cheeks . The mariner was suddenly very red indeed ; he clenched his hands .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ I been talking here this ten minutes , ”</said>he said ;<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ and you , you little pot-bellied , leathery-faced son of an old boot , could n't have the elementary manners — ”</said></p>
    <p n="490"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Do n't you come bandying words with me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>.</p>
    <p n="491"><said who="#Marvel">“ Bandying words ! I 'm a jolly good mind — ”</said></p>
    <p n="492"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Come up , ”</said>said a Voice , and<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>was suddenly whirled about and started marching off in a curious spasmodic manner .<said who="#the_mariner">“ You 'd better move on , ”</said>said the mariner .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Who 's moving on ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>. He was receding obliquely with a curious hurrying gait , with occasional violent jerks forward . Some way along the road he began a muttered monologue , protests and recriminations .</p>
    <p n="493"><said who="#Marvel">“ Silly devil ! ”</said>said the mariner , legs wide apart , elbows akimbo , watching the receding figure .<said who="#Marvel">“ I 'll show you , you silly ass — hoaxing me ! It 's here — on the paper ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="494"><persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>retorted incoherently and , receding , was hidden by a bend in the road , but the mariner still stood magnificent in the midst of the way , until the approach of a butcher 's cart dislodged him . Then he turned himself towards Port Stowe .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Full of extra-ordinary asses , ”</said>he said softly to himself .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Just to take me down a bit — that was his silly game — It 's on the paper ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="495">And there was another extraordinary thing he was presently to hear , that had happened quite close to him . And that was a vision of a “ fist full of money ” ( no less ) travelling without visible agency , along by the wall at the corner of St. Michael 's Lane . A brother mariner had seen this wonderful sight that very morning . He had snatched at the money forthwith and had been knocked headlong , and when he had got to his feet the butterfly money had vanished . Our mariner was in the mood to believe anything , he declared , but that was a bit too stiff . Afterwards , however , he began to think things over .</p>
    <p n="496">The story of the flying money was true . And all about that neighbourhood , even from the august London and Country Banking Company , from the tills of shops and inns — doors standing that sunny weather entirely open — money had been quietly and dexterously making off that day in handfuls and rouleaux , floating quietly along by walls and shady places , dodging quickly from the approaching eyes of men . And it had , though no man had traced it , invariably ended its mysterious flight in the pocket of that agitated gentleman in the obsolete silk hat , sitting outside the little inn on the outskirts of Port Stowe .</p>
    <p n="497">It was ten days after — and indeed only when the Burdock story was already old — that the mariner collated these facts and began to understand how near he had been to the wonderful Invisible Man .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="15">
    <p n="498">In the early evening time<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>was sitting in his study in the belvedere on the hill overlooking Burdock . It was a pleasant little room , with three windows — north , west , and south — and bookshelves covered with books and scientific publications , and a broad writing-table , and , under the north window , a microscope , glass slips , minute instruments , some cultures , and scattered bottles of reagents .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>'s solar lamp was lit , albeit the sky was still bright with the sunset light , and his blinds were up because there was no offence of peering outsiders to require them pulled down .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>was a tall and slender young man , with flaxen hair and a moustache almost white , and the work he was upon would earn him , he hoped , the fellowship of the Royal Society , so highly did he think of it .</p>
    <p n="499">And his eye , presently wandering from his work , caught the sunset blazing at the back of the hill that is over against his own . For a minute perhaps he sat , pen in mouth , admiring the rich golden colour above the crest , and then his attention was attracted by the little figure of a man , inky black , running over the hill-brow towards him . He was a shortish little man , and he wore a high hat , and he was running so fast that his legs verily twinkled .</p>
    <p n="500"><said who="#Kemp">“ Another of those fools , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ Like that ass who ran into me this morning round a corner , with the ‘'Visible Man a-coming , sir ! ’ I can n't imagine what possess people . One might think we were in the thirteenth century . ”</said></p>
    <p n="501">He got up , went to the window , and stared at the dusky hillside , and the dark little figure tearing down it .<said who="#Kemp">“ He seems in a confounded hurry , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>,<said who="#Kemp">“ but he does n't seem to be getting on . If his pockets were full of lead , he could n't run heavier . ”</said></p>
    <p n="502"><said who="#Kemp">“ Spurted , sir , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="503">In another moment the higher of the villas that had clambered up the hill from Burdock had occulted the running figure . He was visible again for a moment , and again , and then again , three times between the three detached houses that came next , and then the terrace hid him .</p>
    <p n="504"><said who="#Kemp">“ Asses ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>, swinging round on his heel and walking back to his writing-table .</p>
    <p n="505">But those who saw the fugitive nearer , and perceived the abject terror on his perspiring face , being themselves in the open roadway , did not share in the doctor 's contempt . By the man pounded , and as he ran he chinked like a well-filled purse that is tossed to and fro . He looked neither to the right nor the left , but his dilated eyes stared straight downhill to where the lamps were being lit , and the people were crowded in the street . And his ill-shaped mouth fell apart , and a glairy foam lay on his lips , and his breath came hoarse and noisy . All he passed stopped and began staring up the road and down , and interrogating one another with an inkling of discomfort for the reason of his haste .</p>
    <p n="506">And then presently , far up the hill , a dog playing in the road yelped and ran under a gate , and as they still wondered something — a wind — a pad , pad , pad ,— a sound like a panting breathing , rushed by .</p>
    <p n="507">People screamed . People sprang off the pavement : It passed in shouts , it passed by instinct down the hill . They were shouting in the street before<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>was halfway there . They were bolting into houses and slamming the doors behind them , with the news . He heard it and made one last desperate spurt . Fear came striding by , rushed ahead of him , and in a moment had seized the town .</p>
    <p n="508"><said who="#Marvel">“<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>is coming !<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>! ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="16">
    <p n="509">The “ Jolly Cricketers ” is just at the bottom of the hill , where the tram-lines begin . The barman leant his fat red arms on the counter and talked of horses with an anaemic cabman , while a black-bearded man in grey snapped up biscuit and cheese , drank Burton , and conversed in American with a policeman off duty .</p>
    <p n="510"><said>“ What 's the shouting about ! ”</said>said the anaemic cabman , going off at a tangent , trying to see up the hill over the dirty yellow blind in the low window of the inn . Somebody ran by outside .<said who="#the_barman">“ Fire , perhaps , ”</said>said the barman .</p>
    <p n="511">Footsteps approached , running heavily , the door was pushed open violently , and<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>, weeping and dishevelled , his hat gone , the neck of his coat torn open , rushed in , made a convulsive turn , and attempted to shut the door . It was held half open by a strap .</p>
    <p n="512"><said who="#Marvel">“ Coming ! ”</said>he bawled , his voice shrieking with terror .<said who="#Marvel">“ He 's coming . The ‘ Visible Man ! After me ! For Gawd 's sake ! ‘ Elp ! ‘ Elp ! ‘ Elp ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="513"><said who="#the_policeman">“ Shut the doors , ”</said>said the policeman .<said who="#the_policeman">“ Who 's coming ? What 's the row ? ”</said>He went to the door , released the strap , and it slammed . The American closed the other door .</p>
    <p n="514"><said who="#Marvel">“ Lemme go inside , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>, staggering and weeping , but still clutching the books .<said who="#Marvel">“ Lemme go inside . Lock me in — somewhere . I tell you he 's after me . I give him the slip . He said he 'd kill me and he will . ”</said></p>
    <p n="515"><said who="#Marvel">“ You 're safe , ”</said>said the man with the black beard .<said who="#Marvel">“ The door 's shut . What 's it all about ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="516"><said who="#Marvel">“ Lemme go inside , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>, and shrieked aloud as a blow suddenly made the fastened door shiver and was followed by a hurried rapping and a shouting outside .<said who="#Marvel">“ Hullo , ”</said>cried the policeman ,<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ who 's there ? ”</said><persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>began to make frantic dives at panels that looked like doors .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ He 'll kill me — he 's got a knife or something . For Gawd 's sake —! ”</said></p>
    <p n="517"><said who="#the_barman">“ Here you are , ”</said>said the barman .<said who="#the_barman">“ Come in here . ”</said>And he held up the flap of the bar .</p>
    <p n="518"><persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>rushed behind the bar as the summons outside was repeated .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Do n't open the door , ”</said>he screamed .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Please do n't open the door . Where shall I hide ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="519"><said who="#Marvel">“ This , this Invisible Man , then ? ”</said>asked the man with the black beard , with one hand behind him .<said who="#Marvel">“ I guess it 's about time we saw him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="520">The window of the inn was suddenly smashed in , and there was a screaming and running to and fro in the street . The policeman had been standing on the settee staring out , craning to see who was at the door . He got down with raised eyebrows .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ It 's that , ”</said>he said . The barman stood in front of the bar-parlour door which was now locked on<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>, stared at the smashed window , and came round to the two other men .</p>
    <p n="521">Everything was suddenly quiet .<said who="#Marvel">“ I wish I had my truncheon , ”</said>said the policeman , going irresolutely to the door .<said who="#Marvel">“ Once we open , in he comes . There 's no stopping him . ”</said></p>
    <p n="522"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Do n't you be in too much hurry about that door , ”</said>said the anaemic cabman , anxiously .</p>
    <p n="523"><said who="#Marvel">“ Draw the bolts , ”</said>said the man with the black beard ,<said who="#Marvel">“ and if he comes — ”</said>He showed a revolver in his hand .</p>
    <p n="524"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ That wo n't do , ”</said>said the policeman ;<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ that 's murder . ”</said></p>
    <p n="525"><said who="#Marvel">“ I know what country I 'm in , ”</said>said the man with the beard .<said who="#Marvel">“ I 'm going to let off at his legs . Draw the bolts . ”</said></p>
    <p n="526"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Not with that blinking thing going off behind me , ”</said>said the barman , craning over the blind .</p>
    <p n="527"><said who="#Marvel">“ Very well , ”</said>said the man with the black beard , and stooping down , revolver ready , drew them himself . Barman , cabman , and policeman faced about .</p>
    <p n="528"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Come in , ”</said>said the bearded man in an undertone , standing back and facing the unbolted doors with his pistol behind him . No one came in , the door remained closed . Five minutes afterwards when a second cabman pushed his head in cautiously , they were still waiting , and an anxious face peered out of the bar-parlour and supplied information .<said who="#Marvel">“ Are all the doors of the house shut ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>.<said who="#Marvel">“ He 's going round — prowling round . He 's as artful as the devil . ”</said></p>
    <p n="529"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Good Lord ! ”</said>said the burly barman . “ There 's the back ! Just watch them doors ! I say —! ” He looked about him helplessly . The bar-parlour door slammed and they heard the key turn .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ There 's the yard door and the private door . The yard door — ”</said></p>
    <p n="530">He rushed out of the bar .</p>
    <p n="531">In a minute he reappeared with a carving-knife in his hand .<said who="#Marvel">“ The yard door was open ! ”</said>he said , and his fat underlip dropped .<said who="#Marvel">“ He may be in the house now ! ”</said>said the first cabman .</p>
    <p n="532"><said who="#the_barman">“ He 's not in the kitchen , ”</said>said the barman .<said who="#the_barman">“ There 's two women there , and I 've stabbed every inch of it with this little beef slicer . And they do n't think he 's come in . They have n't noticed — ”</said></p>
    <p n="533"><said who="#Marvel">“ Have you fastened it ? ”</said>asked the first cabman .</p>
    <p n="534"><said who="#the_barman">“ I 'm out of frocks , ”</said>said the barman .</p>
    <p n="535">The man with the beard replaced his revolver . And even as he did so the flap of the bar was shut down and the bolt clicked , and then with a tremendous thud the catch of the door snapped and the bar-parlour door burst open . They heard<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>squeal like a caught leveret , and forthwith they were clambering over the bar to his rescue . The bearded man 's revolver cracked and the looking-glass at the back of the parlour starred and came smashing and tinkling down .</p>
    <p n="536">As the barman entered the room he saw<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>, curiously crumpled up and struggling against the door that led to the yard and kitchen . The door flew open while the barman hesitated , and<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>was dragged into the kitchen . There was a scream and a clatter of pans .<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>, head down , and lugging back obstinately , was forced to the kitchen door , and the bolts were drawn .</p>
    <p n="537">Then the policeman , who had been trying to pass the barman , rushed in , followed by one of the cabmen , gripped the wrist of the invisible hand that collared<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>, was hit in the face and went reeling back . The door opened , and<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>made a frantic effort to obtain a lodgment behind it . Then the cabman collared something .<said who="#the_cabman">“ I got him , ”</said>said the cabman . The barman 's red hands came clawing at the unseen .<said who="#the_cabman">“ Here he is ! ”</said>said the barman .</p>
    <p n="538"><persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>, released , suddenly dropped to the ground and made an attempt to crawl behind the legs of the fighting men . The struggle blundered round the edge of the door . The voice of<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>was heard for the first time , yelling out sharply , as the policeman trod on his foot . Then he cried out passionately and his fists flew round like flails . The cabman suddenly whooped and doubled up , kicked under the diaphragm . The door into the bar-parlour from the kitchen slammed and covered<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>'s retreat . The men in the kitchen found themselves clutching at and struggling with empty air .</p>
    <p n="539"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Where 's he gone ? ”</said>cried the man with the beard .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Out ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="540"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ This way , ”</said>said the policeman , stepping into the yard and stopping .</p>
    <p n="541">A piece of tile whizzed by his head and smashed among the crockery on the kitchen table .</p>
    <p n="542"><said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ I 'll show him , ”</said>shouted the man with the black beard , and suddenly a steel barrel shone over the policeman 's shoulder , and five bullets had followed one another into the twilight whence the missile had come . As he fired , the man with the beard moved his hand in a horizontal curve , so that his shots radiated out into the narrow yard like spokes from a wheel .</p>
    <p n="543">A silence followed .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Five cartridges , ”</said>said the man with the black beard .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ That 's the best of all . Four aces and a joker . Get a lantern , someone , and come and feel about for his body . ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="17">
    <p n="544"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>had continued writing in his study until the shots aroused him . Crack , crack , crack , they came one after the other .</p>
    <p n="545"><said who="#Kemp">“ Hullo ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>, putting his pen into his mouth again and listening .<said who="#Kemp">“ Who 's letting off revolvers in Burdock ? What are the asses at now ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="546">He went to the south window , threw it up , and leaning out stared down on the network of windows , beaded gas-lamps and shops , with its black interstices of roof and yard that made up the town at night .<said who="#Kemp">“ Looks like a crowd down the hill , ”</said>he said , “ by ‘ The Cricketers , ’ ” and remained watching . Thence his eyes wandered over the town to far away where the ships ’ lights shone , and the pier glowed — a little illuminated , facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow light . The moon in its first quarter hung over the westward hill , and the stars were clear and almost tropically bright .</p>
    <p n="547">After five minutes , during which his mind had travelled into a remote speculation of social conditions of the future , and lost itself at last over the time dimension ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>roused himself with a sigh , pulled down the window again , and returned to his writing desk .</p>
    <p n="548">It must have been about an hour after this that the front-door bell rang . He had been writing slackly , and with intervals of abstraction , since the shots . He sat listening . He heard the servant answer the door , and waited for her feet on the staircase , but she did not come .<said who="#Kemp">“ Wonder what that was , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="549">He tried to resume his work , failed , got up , went downstairs from his study to the landing , rang , and called over the balustrade to the housemaid as she appeared in the hall below .<said who="#Kemp">“ Was that a letter ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="550"><said who="#Kemp">“ Only a runaway ring , sir , ”</said>she answered .</p>
    <p n="551"><said who="#Kemp">“ I 'm restless to-night , ”</said>he said to himself . He went back to his study , and this time attacked his work resolutely . In a little while he was hard at work again , and the only sounds in the room were the ticking of the clock and the subdued shrillness of his quill , hurrying in the very centre of the circle of light his lampshade threw on his table .</p>
    <p n="552">It was two o'clock before<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>had finished his work for the night . He rose , yawned , and went downstairs to bed . He had already removed his coat and vest , when he noticed that he was thirsty . He took a candle and went down to the dining-room in search of a syphon and whiskey .</p>
    <p n="553"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>'s scientific pursuits have made him a very observant man , and as he recrossed the hall , he noticed a dark spot on the linoleum near the mat at the foot of the stairs . He went on upstairs , and then it suddenly occurred to him to ask himself what the spot on the linoleum might be . Apparently some subconscious element was at work . At any rate , he turned with his burden , went back to the hall , put down the syphon and whiskey , and bending down , touched the spot . Without any great surprise he found it had the stickiness and colour of drying blood .</p>
    <p n="554">He took up his burden again , and returned upstairs , looking about him and trying to account for the blood-spot . On the landing he saw something and stopped astonished . The door-handle of his own room was blood-stained .</p>
    <p n="555">He looked at his own hand . It was quite clean , and then he remembered that the door of his room had been open when he came down from his study , and that consequently he had not touched the handle at all . He went straight into his room , his face quite calm — perhaps a trifle more resolute than usual . His glance , wandering inquisitively , fell on the bed . On the counterpane was a mess of blood , and the sheet had been torn . He had not noticed this before because he had walked straight to the dressing-table . On the further side the bedclothes were depressed as if someone had been recently sitting there .</p>
    <p n="556">Then he had an odd impression that he had heard a low voice say ,<said>“ Good Heavens !—<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>! ”</said>But<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>was no believer in voices .</p>
    <p n="557">He stood staring at the tumbled sheets . Was that really a voice ? He looked about again , but noticed nothing further than the disordered and blood-stained bed . Then he distinctly heard a movement across the room , near the wash-hand stand . All men , however highly educated , retain some superstitious inklings . The feeling that is called “ eerie ” came upon him . He closed the door of the room , came forward to the dressing-table , and put down his burdens . Suddenly , with a start , he perceived a coiled and blood-stained bandage of linen rag hanging in mid-air , between him and the wash-hand stand .</p>
    <p n="558">He stared at this in amazement . It was an empty bandage , a bandage properly tied but quite empty . He would have advanced to grasp it , but a touch arrested him , and a voice speaking quite close to him .</p>
    <p n="559"><said who="#the_Voice">“<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>.</p>
    <p n="560"><said who="#the_Voice">“ Eh ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, with his mouth open .</p>
    <p n="561"><said who="#the_Voice">“ Keep your nerve , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>.<said who="#the_Voice">“ I 'm an Invisible Man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="562"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>made no answer for a space , simply stared at the bandage .<said who="#Kemp">“ Invisible Man , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="563"><said who="#the_Voice">“ I am an Invisible Man , ”</said>repeated<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>.</p>
    <p n="564">The story he had been active to ridicule only that morning rushed through<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s brain . He does not appear to have been either very much frightened or very greatly surprised at the moment . Realisation came later .</p>
    <p n="565"><said who="#Kemp">“ I thought it was all a lie , ”</said>he said . The thought uppermost in his mind was the reiterated arguments of the morning .<said who="#Kemp">“ Have you a bandage on ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="566"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>.</p>
    <p n="567"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Oh ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, and then roused himself .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I say ! ”</said>he said .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ But this is nonsense . It 's some trick . ”</said>He stepped forward suddenly , and his hand , extended towards the bandage , met invisible fingers .</p>
    <p n="568">He recoiled at the touch and his colour changed .</p>
    <p n="569"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Keep steady ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, for God 's sake ! I want help badly . Stop ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="570">The hand gripped his arm . He struck at it .</p>
    <p n="571"><said who="#the_Voice">“<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>.<said who="#the_Voice">“<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>! Keep steady ! ”</said>and the grip tightened .</p>
    <p n="572">A frantic desire to free himself took possession of<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>. The hand of the bandaged arm gripped his shoulder , and he was suddenly tripped and flung backwards upon the bed . He opened his mouth to shout , and the corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth .<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>had him down grimly , but his arms were free and he struck and tried to kick savagely .</p>
    <p n="573"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Listen to reason , will you ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>, sticking to him in spite of a pounding in the ribs .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ By<persName>Heaven</persName>! you 'll madden me in a minute !</said></p>

    <p n="589"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>stared at the bandage as it moved across the room , then saw a basket chair dragged across the floor and come to rest near the bed . It creaked , and the seat was depressed the quarter of an inch or so . He rubbed his eyes and felt his neck again .<said who="#Kemp">“ This beats ghosts , ”</said>he said , and laughed stupidly .</p>

    <p n="593"><said who="#Kemp">“ It did n't feel so . Where are you ? If I get up shall I run into you ? There ! all right . Whiskey ? Here . Where shall I give it to you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="594">The chair creaked and<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>felt the glass drawn away from him . He let go by an effort ; his instinct was all against it . It came to rest poised twenty inches above the front edge of the seat of the chair . He stared at it in infinite perplexity .<said who="#the_Voice">“ This is — this must be — hypnotism .

    <p n="600"><said who="#Kemp">“ Food ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="601">The tumbler of whiskey tilted itself .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>rapping it down .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Have you a dressing-gown ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="602"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>made some exclamation in an undertone . He walked to a wardrobe and produced a robe of dingy scarlet .<said who="#Kemp">“ This do ? ”</said>he asked . It was taken from him . It hung limp for a moment in mid-air , fluttered weirdly , stood full and decorous buttoning itself , and sat down in his chair .<said who="#the_Unseen">“ Drawers , socks , slippers would be a comfort , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Unseen">the Unseen</persName>, curtly .<said who="#the_Unseen">“ And food . ”</said></p>
    <p n="603"><said who="#Kemp">“ Anything . But this is the insanest thing I ever was in , in my life ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="604">He turned out his drawers for the articles , and then went downstairs to ransack his larder .

    <p n="605"><said who="#Kemp">“ Invisible ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, and sat down on a bedroom chair .</p>
    <p n="606"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I always like to get something about me before I eat , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>, with a full mouth , eating greedily .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Queer fancy ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="607"><said who="#Kemp">“ I suppose that wrist is all right , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="608"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Trust me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>.</p>
    <p n="609"><said who="#Kemp">“ Of all the strange and wonderful — ”</said></p>
    <p n="610"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Exactly . But it 's odd I should blunder into your house to get my bandaging . My first stroke of luck ! Anyhow I meant to sleep in this house to-night . You must stand that ! It 's a filthy nuisance , my blood showing , is n't it ? Quite a clot over there . Gets visible as it coagulates , I see . It 's only the living tissue I 've changed , and only for as long as I 'm alive .... I 've been in the house three hours . ”</said></p>
    <p n="611"><said who="#Kemp">“ But how 's it done ? ”</said>began<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, in a tone of exasperation .<said who="#Kemp">“ Confound it ! The whole business — it 's unreasonable from beginning to end . ”</said></p>
    <p n="612"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Quite reasonable , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>.<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Perfectly reasonable . ”</said></p>
    <p n="613">He reached over and secured the whiskey bottle .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>stared at the devouring dressing gown . A ray of candle-light penetrating a torn patch in the right shoulder , made a triangle of light under the left ribs .<said who="#Kemp">“ What were the shots ? ”</said>he asked .<said who="#Kemp">“ How did the shooting begin ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="614"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ There was a real fool of a man — a sort of confederate of mine — curse him !— who tried to steal my money . Has done so . ”</said></p>
    <p n="615"><said who="#Kemp">“ Is he invisible too ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="616"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="617"><said who="#Kemp">“ Well ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="618"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Ca n't I have some more to eat before I tell you all that ? I 'm hungry — in pain . And you want me to tell stories ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="619"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>got up .<said who="#Kemp">“ You did n't do any shooting ? ”</said>he asked .</p>
    <p n="620"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Not me , ”</said>said his visitor .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Some fool I 'd never seen fired at random . A lot of them got scared . They all got scared at me . Curse them !— I say — I want more to eat than this ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="621"><said who="#Kemp">“ I 'll see what there is to eat downstairs , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ Not much , I 'm afraid . ”</said></p>
    <p n="622">After he had done eating , and he made a heavy meal ,<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>demanded a cigar . He bit the end savagely before<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>could find a knife , and cursed when the outer leaf loosened . It was strange to see him smoking ; his mouth , and throat , pharynx and nares , became visible as a sort of whirling smoke cast .</p>
    <p n="623"><said who="#Kemp">“ This blessed gift of smoking ! ”</said>he said , and puffed vigorously .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I 'm lucky to have fallen upon you ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>. You must help me . Fancy tumbling on you just now ! I 'm in a devilish scrape — I 've been mad , I think . The things I have been through ! But we will do things yet . Let me tell you — ”</said></p>
    <p n="624">He helped himself to more whiskey and soda .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>got up , looked about him , and fetched a glass from his spare room .<said who="#Kemp">“ It 's wild — but I suppose I may drink . ”</said></p>
    <p n="625"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ You have n't changed much ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, these dozen years . You fair men do n't . Cool and methodical — after the first collapse . I must tell you . We will work together ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="626"><said who="#Kemp">“ But how was it all done ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>,<said who="#Kemp">“ and how did you get like this ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="627"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ For God 's sake , let me smoke in peace for a little while ! And then I will begin to tell you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="628">But the story was not told that night .<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>'s wrist was growing painful ; he was feverish , exhausted , and his mind came round to brood upon his chase down the hill and the struggle about the inn . He spoke in fragments of<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>, he smoked faster , his voice grew angry .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>tried to gather what he could .</p>
    <p n="629"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ He was afraid of me , I could see that he was afraid of me , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>many times over .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ He meant to give me the slip — he was always casting about !

    <p n="633"><persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>was silent for a space .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I can n't tell you to-night , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="634">He groaned suddenly and leant forward , supporting his invisible head on invisible hands .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, ”</said>he said ,<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I 've had no sleep for near three days , except a couple of dozes of an hour or so .

    <p n="635"><said who="#Kemp">“ Well , have my room — have this room . ”</said></p>
    <p n="636"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ But how can I sleep ? If I sleep — he will get away . Ugh ! What does it matter ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="637"><said who="#Kemp">“ What 's the shot wound ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, abruptly .</p>
    <p n="638"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Nothing — scratch and blood . Oh , God ! How I want sleep ! ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="18">
    <p n="643">Exhausted and wounded as<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>was , he refused to accept<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s word that his freedom should be respected . He examined the two windows of the bedroom , drew up the blinds and opened the sashes , to confirm<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s statement that a retreat by them would be possible . Outside the night was very quiet and still , and the new moon was setting over the down . Then he examined the keys of the bedroom and the two dressing-room doors , to satisfy himself that these also could be made an assurance of freedom . Finally he expressed himself satisfied . He stood on the hearth rug and<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>heard the sound of a yawn .</p>
    <p n="644"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I 'm sorry , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>,<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ if I cannot tell you all that I have done to-night .

But believe me ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, in spite of your arguments of this morning , it is quite a possible thing . I have made a discovery . I meant to keep it to myself . I can n't . I must have a partner . And you .... We can do such things ... But to-morrow . Now ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, I feel as though I must sleep or perish . ”</said></p>
    <p n="645"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>stood in the middle of the room staring at the headless garment .<said who="#Kemp">“ I suppose I must leave you , ”</said>he said .<said who="#Kemp">“ It 's — incredible . Three things happening like this , overturning all my preconceptions — would make me insane . But it 's real ! Is there anything more that I can get you ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="646"><said who="#Griffin">“ Only bid me good-night , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>.</p>
    <p n="647"><said who="#Kemp">“ Good-night , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, and shook an invisible hand . He walked sideways to the door . Suddenly the dressing-gown walked quickly towards him .<said who="#Kemp">“ Understand me ! ”</said>said the dressing-gown .<said who="#Kemp">“ No attempts to hamper me , or capture me ! Or — ”</said></p>
    <p n="648"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s face changed a little .<said who="#Griffin">“ I thought I gave you my word , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="649"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>closed the door softly behind him , and the key was turned upon him forthwith . Then , as he stood with an expression of passive amazement on his face , the rapid feet came to the door of the dressing-room and that too was locked .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>slapped his brow with his hand .<said who="#Kemp">“ Am I dreaming ? Has the world gone mad — or have I ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="650">He laughed , and put his hand to the locked door .<said who="#Griffin">“ Barred out of my own bedroom , by a flagrant absurdity ! ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="651">He walked to the head of the staircase , turned , and stared at the locked doors .<said who="#Kemp">“ It 's fact , ”</said>he said . He put his fingers to his slightly bruised neck .<said who="#Kemp">“ Undeniable fact !</said></p>
    <p n="652"><said who="#Griffin">“ But — ”</said></p>
    <p n="653">He shook his head hopelessly , turned , and went downstairs .</p>
    <p n="654">He lit the dining-room lamp , got out a cigar , and began pacing the room , ejaculating . Now and then he would argue with himself .</p>
    <p n="655"><said who="#Kemp">“ Invisible ! ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="656"><said who="#Kemp">“ Is there such a thing as an invisible animal ? ... In the sea , yes . Thousands — millions . All the larvae , all the little nauplii and tornarias , all the microscopic things , the jelly-fish . In the sea there are more things invisible than visible ! I never thought of that before . And in the ponds too ! All those little pond-life things — specks of colourless translucent jelly ! But in air ? No !</said></p>
    <p n="657"><said who="#Kemp">“ It can n't be .</said></p>
    <p n="658"><said who="#Kemp">“ But after all — why not ?</said></p>
    <p n="659"><said who="#Griffin">“ If a man was made of glass he would still be visible . ”</said></p>
    <p n="660">His meditation became profound . The bulk of three cigars had passed into the invisible or diffused as a white ash over the carpet before he spoke again . Then it was merely an exclamation . He turned aside , walked out of the room , and went into his little consulting-room and lit the gas there . It was a little room , because<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>did not live by practice , and in it were the day 's newspapers . The morning 's paper lay carelessly opened and thrown aside . He caught it up , turned it over , and read the account of a “ Strange Story from Iping ” that the mariner at Port Stowe had spelt over so painfully to<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>.<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>read it swiftly .</p>
    <p n="661"><said who="#Kemp">“ Wrapped up ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ Disguised ! Hiding it ! ‘ No one seems to have been aware of his misfortune . ’ What the devil is his game ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="662">He dropped the paper , and his eye went seeking .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Ah ! ”</said>he said , and caught up the St. James ’ Gazette , lying folded up as it arrived .<said who="#Kemp">“ Now we shall get at the truth , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>. He rent the paper open ; a couple of columns confronted him . “ An Entire Village in Sussex goes Mad ” was the heading .</p>
    <p n="663"><said who="#Kemp">“ Good Heavens ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, reading eagerly an incredulous account of the events in Iping , of the previous afternoon , that have already been described . Over the leaf the report in the morning paper had been reprinted .</p>
    <p n="664">He re-read it .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ Ran through the streets striking right and left .<persName corresp="#Jaffers">Jaffers</persName>insensible .<persName corresp="#Mr._Huxter">Mr. Huxter</persName>in great pain — still unable to describe what he saw . Painful humiliation — vicar . Woman ill with terror ! Windows smashed . This extraordinary story probably a fabrication . Too good not to print — cum grano ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="665">He dropped the paper and stared blankly in front of him .<said who="#Kemp">“ Probably a fabrication ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="666">He caught up the paper again , and re-read the whole business .<said who="#Mr._Marvel">“ But when does the Tramp come in ? Why the deuce was he chasing a tramp ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="667">He sat down abruptly on the surgical bench .<said who="#Kemp">“ He 's not only invisible , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Kemp">“ but he 's mad ! Homicidal ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="668">When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar smoke of the dining-room ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>was still pacing up and down , trying to grasp the incredible .</p>
    <p n="669">He was altogether too excited to sleep . His servants , descending sleepily , discovered him , and were inclined to think that over-study had worked this ill on him . He gave them extraordinary but quite explicit instructions to lay breakfast for two in the belvedere study — and then to confine themselves to the basement and ground-floor . Then he continued to pace the dining-room until the morning 's paper came . That had much to say and little to tell , beyond the confirmation of the evening before , and a very badly written account of another remarkable tale from Port Burdock . This gave<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>the essence of the happenings at the “ Jolly Cricketers , ” and the name of<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>.<said who="#Marvel">“ He has made me keep with him twenty-four hours , ”</said><persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>testified . Certain minor facts were added to the Iping story , notably the cutting of the village telegraph-wire . But there was nothing to throw light on the connexion between<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>and the Tramp ; for<persName corresp="#Mr._Marvel">Mr. Marvel</persName>had supplied no information about the three books , or the money with which he was lined . The incredulous tone had vanished and a shoal of reporters and inquirers were already at work elaborating the matter .</p>
    <p n="670"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>read every scrap of the report and sent his housemaid out to get everyone of the morning papers she could . These also he devoured .</p>
    <p n="671"><said who="#Kemp">“ He is invisible ! ”</said>he said .<said who="#Kemp">“ And it reads like rage growing to mania ! The things he may do ! The things he may do ! And he 's upstairs free as the air . What on earth ought I to do ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="672"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ For instance , would it be a breach of faith if —? No . ”</said></p>
    <p n="673">He went to a little untidy desk in the corner , and began a note . He tore this up half written , and wrote another . He read it over and considered it . Then he took an envelope and addressed it to “ Colonel<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>, Port Burdock . ”</p>
    <p n="674"><persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>awoke even as<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>was doing this . He awoke in an evil temper , and<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, alert for every sound , heard his pattering feet rush suddenly across the bedroom overhead . Then a chair was flung over and the wash-hand stand tumbler smashed .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>hurried upstairs and rapped eagerly .</p>

His doubts of the sanity of the entire business flashed and vanished again as he looked across to where<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>sat at the breakfast-table — a headless , handless dressing-gown , wiping unseen lips on a miraculously held serviette .</p>
    <p n="687"><said who="#Griffin">“ It 's simple enough — and credible enough , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>, putting the serviette aside and leaning the invisible head on an invisible hand .</p>

    <p n="689"><said who="#Griffin">“ Well , yes ; to me it seemed wonderful at first , no doubt . But now , great God ! ... But we will do great things yet ! I came on the stuff first at Chesilstowe . ”</said></p>

    <p n="692"><said who="#Kemp">“ Ah ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="693"><said who="#Griffin">“ Optical density ! The whole subject is a network of riddles — a network with solutions glimmering elusively through . And being but two-and-twenty and full of enthusiasm , I said , ‘ I will devote my life to this . This is worth while . ’ You know what fools we are at two-and-twenty ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="694"><said who="#Kemp">“ Fools then or fools now , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="695"><said who="#Kemp">“ As though knowing could be any satisfaction to a man !</said></p>
    <p n="696"><said who="#Griffin">“ But I went to work — like a slave . And I had hardly worked and thought about the matter six months before light came through one of the meshes suddenly — blindingly ! I found a general principle of pigments and refraction — a formula , a geometrical expression involving four dimensions . Fools , common men , even common mathematicians , do not know anything of what some general expression may mean to the student of molecular physics . In the books — the books that tramp has hidden — there are marvels , miracles ! But this was not a method , it was an idea , that might lead to a method by which it would be possible , without changing any other property of matter — except , in some instances colours — to lower the refractive index of a substance , solid or liquid , to that of air — so far as all practical purposes are concerned . ”</said></p>
    <p n="697"><said who="#Kemp">“ Phew ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ That 's odd ! But still I do n't see quite ... I can understand that thereby you could spoil a valuable stone , but personal invisibility is a far cry . ”</said></p>
    <p n="698"><said who="#Griffin">“ Precisely , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>.<said who="#Griffin">“ But consider , visibility depends on the action of the visible bodies on light . Either a body absorbs light , or it reflects or refracts it , or does all these things . If it neither reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light , it cannot of itself be visible . You see an opaque red box , for instance , because the colour absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest , all the red part of the light , to you . If it did not absorb any particular part of the light , but reflected it all , then it would be a shining white box . Silver ! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor reflect much from the general surface , but just here and there where the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and refracted , so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing reflections and translucencies — a sort of skeleton of light . A glass box would not be so brilliant , not so clearly visible , as a diamond box , because there would be less refraction and reflection . See that ? From certain points of view you would see quite clearly through it . Some kinds of glass would be more visible than others , a box of flint glass would be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass . A box of very thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light , because it would absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little . And if you put a sheet of common white glass in water , still more if you put it in some denser liquid than water , it would vanish almost altogether , because light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or reflected or indeed affected in any way . It is almost as invisible as a jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air . And for precisely the same reason ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="699"><said who="#Kemp">“ Yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>,<said who="#Kemp">“ that is pretty plain sailing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="700"><said who="#Griffin">“ And here is another fact you will know to be true . If a sheet of glass is smashed ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, and beaten into a powder , it becomes much more visible while it is in the air ; it becomes at last an opaque white powder . This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the glass at which refraction and reflection occur . In the sheet of glass there are only two surfaces ; in the powder the light is reflected or refracted by each grain it passes through , and very little gets right through the powder . But if the white powdered glass is put into water , it forthwith vanishes . The powdered glass and water have much the same refractive index ; that is , the light undergoes very little refraction or reflection in passing from one to the other .</said></p>
    <p n="701"><said who="#Kemp">“ You make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly the same refractive index ; a transparent thing becomes invisible if it is put in any medium of almost the same refractive index . And if you will consider only a second , you will see also that the powder of glass might be made to vanish in air , if its refractive index could be made the same as that of air ; for then there would be no refraction or reflection as the light passed from glass to air . ”</said></p>
    <p n="702"><said who="#Kemp">“ Yes , yes , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ But a man 's not powdered glass ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="703"><said who="#Griffin">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>.<said who="#Griffin">“ He 's more transparent ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="704"><said who="#Kemp">“ Nonsense ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="705"><said who="#Griffin">“ That from a doctor ! How one forgets ! Have you already forgotten your physics , in ten years ? Just think of all the things that are transparent and seem not to be so . Paper , for instance , is made up of transparent fibres , and it is white and opaque only for the same reason that a powder of glass is white and opaque . Oil white paper , fill up the interstices between the particles with oil so that there is no longer refraction or reflection except at the surfaces , and it becomes as transparent as glass . And not only paper , but cotton fibre , linen fibre , wool fibre , woody fibre , and bone ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, flesh ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, hair ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, nails and nerves ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, in fact the whole fabric of a man except the red of his blood and the black pigment of hair , are all made up of transparent , colourless tissue . So little suffices to make us visible one to the other . For the most part the fibres of a living creature are no more opaque than water . ”</said></p>
    <p n="706"><said who="#Kemp">“ Great Heavens ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ Of course , of course ! I was thinking only last night of the sea larvae and all jelly-fish ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="707"><said who="#Griffin">“ Now you have me ! And all that I knew and had in mind a year after I left London — six years ago . But I kept it to myself . I had to do my work under frightful disadvantages . Oliver , my professor , was a scientific bounder , a journalist by instinct , a thief of ideas — he was always prying ! And you know the knavish system of the scientific world . I simply would not publish , and let him share my credit . I went on working ; I got nearer and nearer making my formula into an experiment , a reality . I told no living soul , because I meant to flash my work upon the world with crushing effect and become famous at a blow . I took up the question of pigments to fill up certain gaps . And suddenly , not by design but by accident , I made a discovery in physiology . ”</said></p>
    <p n="708"><said who="#Kemp">“ Yes ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="709"><said who="#Griffin">“ You know the red colouring matter of blood ; it can be made white — colourless — and remain with all the functions it has now ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="710"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>gave a cry of incredulous amazement .</p>
    <p n="711"><persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>rose and began pacing the little study .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ You may well exclaim . I remember that night . It was late at night — in the daytime one was bothered with the gaping , silly students — and I worked then sometimes till dawn . It came suddenly , splendid and complete in my mind . I was alone ; the laboratory was still , with the tall lights burning brightly and silently . In all my great moments I have been alone . ‘ One could make an animal — a tissue — transparent ! One could make it invisible ! All except the pigments — I could be invisible ! ’ I said , suddenly realising what it meant to be an albino with such knowledge . It was overwhelming . I left the filtering I was doing , and went and stared out of the great window at the stars . ‘ I could be invisible ! ’ I repeated .</said></p>
    <p n="712"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ To do such a thing would be to transcend magic . And I beheld , unclouded by doubt , a magnificent vision of all that invisibility might mean to a man — the mystery , the power , the freedom . Drawbacks I saw none . You have only to think ! And I , a shabby , poverty-struck , hemmed-in demonstrator , teaching fools in a provincial college , might suddenly become — this . I ask you ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>if you ... Anyone , I tell you , would have flung himself upon that research . And I worked three years , and every mountain of difficulty I toiled over showed another from its summit . The infinite details ! And the exasperation ! A professor , a provincial professor , always prying . ‘ When are you going to publish this work of yours ? ’ was his everlasting question . And the students , the cramped means ! Three years I had of it —</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="20">
    <p n="718">For a moment<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>sat in silence , staring at the back of the headless figure at the window . Then he started , struck by a thought , rose , took<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>'s arm , and turned him away from the outlook .</p>
    <p n="719"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ You are tired , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ and while I sit , you walk about . Have my chair . ”</said></p>
    <p n="720">He placed himself between<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>and the nearest window .</p>
    <p n="721">For a space<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>sat silent , and then he resumed abruptly :</p>
    <p n="722"><said who="#Griffin">“ I had left the Chesilstowe cottage already , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Griffin">“ when that happened . It was last December . I had taken a room in London , a large unfurnished room in a big ill-managed lodging-house in a slum near Great Portland Street . The room was soon full of the appliances I had bought with his money ; the work was going on steadily , successfully , drawing near an end . I was like a man emerging from a thicket , and suddenly coming on some unmeaning tragedy . I went to bury him . My mind was still on this research , and I did not lift a finger to save his character . I remember the funeral , the cheap hearse , the scant ceremony , the windy frost-bitten hillside , and the old college friend of his who read the service over him — a shabby , black , bent old man with a snivelling cold .</said></p>
    <p n="723"><said who="#Griffin">“ I remember walking back to the empty house , through the place that had once been a village and was now patched and tinkered by the jerry builders into the ugly likeness of a town . Every way the roads ran out at last into the desecrated fields and ended in rubble heaps and rank wet weeds . I remember myself as a gaunt black figure , going along the slippery , shiny pavement , and the strange sense of detachment I felt from the squalid respectability , the sordid commercialism of the place .</said></p>
    <p n="724"><said who="#Griffin">“ I did not feel a bit sorry for my father . He seemed to me to be the victim of his own foolish sentimentality . The current cant required my attendance at his funeral , but it was really not my affair .</said></p>
    <p n="725"><said who="#Griffin">“ But going along the High Street , my old life came back to me for a space , for I met the girl I had known ten years since . Our eyes met .</said></p>
    <p n="726"><said who="#Griffin">“ Something moved me to turn back and talk to her . She was a very ordinary person .</said></p>
    <p n="727"><said who="#Griffin">“ It was all like a dream , that visit to the old places . I did not feel then that I was lonely , that I had come out from the world into a desolate place . I appreciated my loss of sympathy , but I put it down to the general inanity of things . Re-entering my room seemed like the recovery of reality . There were the things I knew and loved . There stood the apparatus , the experiments arranged and waiting . And now there was scarcely a difficulty left , beyond the planning of details .</said></p>
    <p n="728"><said who="#Griffin">“ I will tell you ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, sooner or later , all the complicated processes . We need not go into that now . For the most part , saving certain gaps I chose to remember , they are written in cypher in those books that tramp has hidden . We must hunt him down . We must get those books again . But the essential phase was to place the transparent object whose refractive index was to be lowered between two radiating centres of a sort of ethereal vibration , of which I will tell you more fully later . No , not those Roentgen vibrations — I do n't know that these others of mine have been described . Yet they are obvious enough . I needed two little dynamos , and these I worked with a cheap gas engine . My first experiment was with a bit of white wool fabric . It was the strangest thing in the world to see it in the flicker of the flashes soft and white , and then to watch it fade like a wreath of smoke and vanish .</said></p>
    <p n="729"><said who="#Griffin">“ I could scarcely believe I had done it . I put my hand into the emptiness , and there was the thing as solid as ever . I felt it awkwardly , and threw it on the floor . I had a little trouble finding it again .</said></p>
    <p n="730"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ And then came a curious experience . I heard a miaow behind me , and turning , saw a lean white cat , very dirty , on the cistern cover outside the window . A thought came into my head . ‘ Everything ready for you , ’ I said , and went to the window , opened it , and called softly . She came in , purring — the poor beast was starving — and I gave her some milk . All my food was in a cupboard in the corner of the room . After that she went smelling round the room , evidently with the idea of making herself at home . The invisible rag upset her a bit ; you should have seen her spit at it ! But I made her comfortable on the pillow of my truckle-bed . And I gave her butter to get her to wash . ”</said></p>
    <p n="731"><said who="#Griffin">“ And you processed her ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="732"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I processed her . But giving drugs to a cat is no joke ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>! And the process failed . ”</said></p>
    <p n="733"><said who="#Kemp">“ Failed ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="734"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ In two particulars . These were the claws and the pigment stuff , what is it ?— at the back of the eye in a cat . You know ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="735"><said who="#Kemp">“ Tapetum . ”</said></p>
    <p n="736"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Yes , the tapetum . It did n't go . After I 'd given the stuff to bleach the blood and done certain other things to her , I gave the beast opium , and put her and the pillow she was sleeping on , on the apparatus . And after all the rest had faded and vanished , there remained two little ghosts of her eyes . ”</said></p>
    <p n="737"><said who="#Kemp">“ Odd ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="738"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I can n't explain it . She was bandaged and clamped , of course — so I had her safe ; but she woke while she was still misty , and miaowed dismally , and someone came knocking . It was an old woman from downstairs , who suspected me of vivisecting — a drink-sodden old creature , with only a white cat to care for in all the world . I whipped out some chloroform , applied it , and answered the door . ‘ Did I hear a cat ? ’ she asked . ‘ My cat ? ’ ‘ Not here , ’ said I , very politely . She was a little doubtful and tried to peer past me into the room ; strange enough to her no doubt — bare walls , uncurtained windows , truckle-bed , with the gas engine vibrating , and the seethe of the radiant points , and that faint ghastly stinging of chloroform in the air . She had to be satisfied at last and went away again . ”</said></p>
    <p n="739"><said who="#Kemp">“ How long did it take ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="740"><said who="#Kemp">“ Three or four hours — the cat . The bones and sinews and the fat were the last to go , and the tips of the coloured hairs . And , as I say , the back part of the eye , tough , iridescent stuff it is , would n't go at all .</said></p>
    <p n="741"><said who="#Kemp">“ It was night outside long before the business was over , and nothing was to be seen but the dim eyes and the claws . I stopped the gas engine , felt for and stroked the beast , which was still insensible , and then , being tired , left it sleeping on the invisible pillow and went to bed . I found it hard to sleep . I lay awake thinking weak aimless stuff , going over the experiment over and over again , or dreaming feverishly of things growing misty and vanishing about me , until everything , the ground I stood on , vanished , and so I came to that sickly falling nightmare one gets . About two , the cat began miaowing about the room . I tried to hush it by talking to it , and then I decided to turn it out . I remember the shock I had when striking a light — there were just the round eyes shining green — and nothing round them . I would have given it milk , but I had n't any . It would n't be quiet , it just sat down and miaowed at the door . I tried to catch it , with an idea of putting it out of the window , but it would n't be caught , it vanished . Then it began miaowing in different parts of the room . At last I opened the window and made a bustle . I suppose it went out at last . I never saw any more of it .</said></p>
    <p n="742"><said who="#Griffin">“ Then —<persName>Heaven</persName>knows why — I fell thinking of my father 's funeral again , and the dismal windy hillside , until the day had come . I found sleeping was hopeless , and , locking my door after me , wandered out into the morning streets . ”</said></p>
    <p n="743"><said who="#Kemp">“ You do n't mean to say there 's an invisible cat at large ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="744"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ If it has n't been killed , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>.<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Why not ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="745"><said who="#Kemp">“ Why not ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ I did n't mean to interrupt . ”</said></p>
    <p n="746"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ It 's very probably been killed , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>.<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ It was alive four days after , I know , and down a grating in Great Titchfield Street ; because I saw a crowd round the place , trying to see whence the miaowing came . ”</said></p>
    <p n="747">He was silent for the best part of a minute . Then he resumed abruptly :</p>
    <p n="748"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I remember that morning before the change very vividly . I must have gone up Great Portland Street . I remember the barracks in Albany Street , and the horse soldiers coming out , and at last I found the summit of Primrose Hill . It was a sunny day in January — one of those sunny , frosty days that came before the snow this year . My weary brain tried to formulate the position , to plot out a plan of action .</said></p>
    <p n="749"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I was surprised to find , now that my prize was within my grasp , how inconclusive its attainment seemed . As a matter of fact I was worked out ; the intense stress of nearly four years ’ continuous work left me incapable of any strength of feeling . I was apathetic , and I tried in vain to recover the enthusiasm of my first inquiries , the passion of discovery that had enabled me to compass even the downfall of my father 's grey hairs . Nothing seemed to matter . I saw pretty clearly this was a transient mood , due to overwork and want of sleep , and that either by drugs or rest it would be possible to recover my energies .</said></p>
    <p n="750"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ All I could think clearly was that the thing had to be carried through ; the fixed idea still ruled me . And soon , for the money I had was almost exhausted . I looked about me at the hillside , with children playing and girls watching them , and tried to think of all the fantastic advantages an invisible man would have in the world . After a time I crawled home , took some food and a strong dose of strychnine , and went to sleep in my clothes on my unmade bed . Strychnine is a grand tonic ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, to take the flabbiness out of a man . ”</said></p>
    <p n="751"><said who="#Kemp">“ It 's the devil , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ It 's the palaeolithic in a bottle . ”</said></p>
    <p n="752"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I awoke vastly invigorated and rather irritable . You know ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="753"><said who="#Kemp">“ I know the stuff . ”</said></p>
    <p n="754"><said who="#Kemp">“ And there was someone rapping at the door . It was my landlord with threats and inquiries , an old Polish Jew in a long grey coat and greasy slippers . I had been tormenting a cat in the night , he was sure — the old woman 's tongue had been busy . He insisted on knowing all about it . The laws in this country against vivisection were very severe — he might be liable . I denied the cat . Then the vibration of the little gas engine could be felt all over the house , he said . That was true , certainly . He edged round me into the room , peering about over his German-silver spectacles , and a sudden dread came into my mind that he might carry away something of my secret . I tried to keep between him and the concentrating apparatus I had arranged , and that only made him more curious . What was I doing ? Why was I always alone and secretive ? Was it legal ? Was it dangerous ? I paid nothing but the usual rent . His had always been a most respectable house — in a disreputable neighbourhood . Suddenly my temper gave way . I told him to get out . He began to protest , to jabber of his right of entry . In a moment I had him by the collar ; something ripped , and he went spinning out into his own passage . I slammed and locked the door and sat down quivering .</said></p>
    <p n="755"><said who="#Kemp">“ He made a fuss outside , which I disregarded , and after a time he went away .</said></p>
    <p n="756"><said who="#Kemp">“ But this brought matters to a crisis . I did not know what he would do , nor even what he had the power to do . To move to fresh apartments would have meant delay ; altogether I had barely twenty pounds left in the world , for the most part in a bank — and I could not afford that . Vanish ! It was irresistible . Then there would be an inquiry , the sacking of my room .</said></p>
    <p n="757"><said who="#Kemp">“ At the thought of the possibility of my work being exposed or interrupted at its very climax , I became very angry and active . I hurried out with my three books of notes , my cheque-book — the tramp has them now — and directed them from the nearest Post Office to a house of call for letters and parcels in Great Portland Street . I tried to go out noiselessly . Coming in , I found my landlord going quietly upstairs ; he had heard the door close , I suppose . You would have laughed to see him jump aside on the landing as came tearing after him . He glared at me as I went by him , and I made the house quiver with the slamming of my door . I heard him come shuffling up to my floor , hesitate , and go down . I set to work upon my preparations forthwith .</said></p>
    <p n="758"><said who="#Kemp">“ It was all done that evening and night . While I was still sitting under the sickly , drowsy influence of the drugs that decolourise blood , there came a repeated knocking at the door . It ceased , footsteps went away and returned , and the knocking was resumed . There was an attempt to push something under the door — a blue paper . Then in a fit of irritation I rose and went and flung the door wide open . ‘ Now then ? ’ said I .</said></p>
    <p n="759"><said who="#Kemp">“ It was my landlord , with a notice of ejectment or something . He held it out to me , saw something odd about my hands , I expect , and lifted his eyes to my face .</said></p>
    <p n="760"><said who="#Kemp">“ For a moment he gaped . Then he gave a sort of inarticulate cry , dropped candle and writ together , and went blundering down the dark passage to the stairs . I shut the door , locked it , and went to the looking-glass . Then I understood his terror .... My face was white — like white stone .</said></p>
    <p n="761"><said who="#Kemp">“ But it was all horrible . I had not expected the suffering . A night of racking anguish , sickness and fainting . I set my teeth , though my skin was presently afire , all my body afire ; but I lay there like grim death . I understood now how it was the cat had howled until I chloroformed it . Lucky it was I lived alone and untended in my room . There were times when I sobbed and groaned and talked . But I stuck to it .... I became insensible and woke languid in the darkness .</said></p>
    <p n="762"><said who="#Kemp">“ The pain had passed . I thought I was killing myself and I did not care . I shall never forget that dawn , and the strange horror of seeing that my hands had become as clouded glass , and watching them grow clearer and thinner as the day went by , until at last I could see the sickly disorder of my room through them , though I closed my transparent eyelids . My limbs became glassy , the bones and arteries faded , vanished , and the little white nerves went last . I gritted my teeth and stayed there to the end . At last only the dead tips of the fingernails remained , pallid and white , and the brown stain of some acid upon my fingers .</said></p>
    <p n="763"><said who="#Kemp">“ I struggled up . At first I was as incapable as a swathed infant — stepping with limbs I could not see . I was weak and very hungry . I went and stared at nothing in my shaving-glass , at nothing save where an attenuated pigment still remained behind the retina of my eyes , fainter than mist . I had to hang on to the table and press my forehead against the glass .</said></p>
    <p n="764"><said who="#Kemp">“ It was only by a frantic effort of will that I dragged myself back to the apparatus and completed the process .</said></p>
    <p n="765"><said who="#Kemp">“ I slept during the forenoon , pulling the sheet over my eyes to shut out the light , and about midday I was awakened again by a knocking . My strength had returned . I sat up and listened and heard a whispering . I sprang to my feet and as noiselessly as possible began to detach the connections of my apparatus , and to distribute it about the room , so as to destroy the suggestions of its arrangement . Presently the knocking was renewed and voices called , first my landlord 's , and then two others . To gain time I answered them . The invisible rag and pillow came to hand and I opened the window and pitched them out on to the cistern cover . As the window opened , a heavy crash came at the door . Someone had charged it with the idea of smashing the lock . But the stout bolts I had screwed up some days before stopped him . That startled me , made me angry . I began to tremble and do things hurriedly .</said></p>
    <p n="766"><said who="#Kemp">“ I tossed together some loose paper , straw , packing paper and so forth , in the middle of the room , and turned on the gas . Heavy blows began to rain upon the door . I could not find the matches . I beat my hands on the wall with rage . I turned down the gas again , stepped out of the window on the cistern cover , very softly lowered the sash , and sat down , secure and invisible , but quivering with anger , to watch events . They split a panel , I saw , and in another moment they had broken away the staples of the bolts and stood in the open doorway . It was the landlord and his two step-sons , sturdy young men of three or four and twenty . Behind them fluttered the old hag of a woman from downstairs .</said></p>
    <p n="767"><said who="#Kemp">“ You may imagine their astonishment to find the room empty . One of the younger men rushed to the window at once , flung it up and stared out . His staring eyes and thick-lipped bearded face came a foot from my face . I was half minded to hit his silly countenance , but I arrested my doubled fist . He stared right through me . So did the others as they joined him . The old man went and peered under the bed , and then they all made a rush for the cupboard . They had to argue about it at length in Yiddish and Cockney English . They concluded I had not answered them , that their imagination had deceived them . A feeling of extraordinary elation took the place of my anger as I sat outside the window and watched these four people — for the old lady came in , glancing suspiciously about her like a cat , trying to understand the riddle of my behaviour .</said></p>
    <p n="768"><said who="#Kemp">“ The old man , so far as I could understand his patois , agreed with the old lady that I was a vivisectionist . The sons protested in garbled English that I was an electrician , and appealed to the dynamos and radiators . They were all nervous about my arrival , although I found subsequently that they had bolted the front door . The old lady peered into the cupboard and under the bed , and one of the young men pushed up the register and stared up the chimney . One of my fellow lodgers , a coster-monger who shared the opposite room with a butcher , appeared on the landing , and he was called in and told incoherent things .</said></p>
    <p n="769"><said who="#Kemp">“ It occurred to me that the radiators , if they fell into the hands of some acute well-educated person , would give me away too much , and watching my opportunity , I came into the room and tilted one of the little dynamos off its fellow on which it was standing , and smashed both apparatus . Then , while they were trying to explain the smash , I dodged out of the room and went softly downstairs .</said></p>
    <p n="770"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I went into one of the sitting-rooms and waited until they came down , still speculating and argumentative , all a little disappointed at finding no ‘ horrors , ’ and all a little puzzled how they stood legally towards me . Then I slipped up again with a box of matches , fired my heap of paper and rubbish , put the chairs and bedding thereby , led the gas to the affair , by means of an india-rubber tube , and waving a farewell to the room left it for the last time . ”</said></p>
    <p n="771"><said who="#Kemp">“ You fired the house ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="772"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Fired the house . It was the only way to cover my trail — and no doubt it was insured . I slipped the bolts of the front door quietly and went out into the street . I was invisible , and I was only just beginning to realise the extraordinary advantage my invisibility gave me . My head was already teeming with plans of all the wild and wonderful things I had now impunity to do . ”</said></p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="21">
    <p n="773"><said >“ In going downstairs the first time I found an unexpected difficulty because I could not see my feet ; indeed I stumbled twice , and there was an unaccustomed clumsiness in gripping the bolt . By not looking down , however , I managed to walk on the level passably well .</said></p>
    <p n="774"><said >“ My mood , I say , was one of exaltation . I felt as a seeing man might do , with padded feet and noiseless clothes , in a city of the blind . I experienced a wild impulse to jest , to startle people , to clap men on the back , fling people 's hats astray , and generally revel in my extraordinary advantage .</said></p>
    <p n="775"><said >“ But hardly had I emerged upon Great Portland Street , however ( my lodging was close to the big draper 's shop there ) , when I heard a clashing concussion and was hit violently behind , and turning saw a man carrying a basket of soda-water syphons , and looking in amazement at his burden . Although the blow had really hurt me , I found something so irresistible in his astonishment that I laughed aloud . ‘ The devil 's in the basket , ’ I said , and suddenly twisted it out of his hand . He let go incontinently , and I swung the whole weight into the air .</said></p>
    <p n="776"><said >“ But a fool of a cabman , standing outside a public house , made a sudden rush for this , and his extending fingers took me with excruciating violence under the ear . I let the whole down with a smash on the cabman , and then , with shouts and the clatter of feet about me , people coming out of shops , vehicles pulling up , I realised what I had done for myself , and cursing my folly , backed against a shop window and prepared to dodge out of the confusion . In a moment I should be wedged into a crowd and inevitably discovered . I pushed by a butcher boy , who luckily did not turn to see the nothingness that shoved him aside , and dodged behind the cab-man 's four-wheeler . I do not know how they settled the business , I hurried straight across the road , which was happily clear , and hardly heeding which way I went , in the fright of detection the incident had given me , plunged into the afternoon throng of Oxford Street .</said></p>
    <p n="777"><said >“ I tried to get into the stream of people , but they were too thick for me , and in a moment my heels were being trodden upon . I took to the gutter , the roughness of which I found painful to my feet , and forthwith the shaft of a crawling hansom dug me forcibly under the shoulder blade , reminding me that I was already bruised severely . I staggered out of the way of the cab , avoided a perambulator by a convulsive movement , and found myself behind the hansom . A happy thought saved me , and as this drove slowly along I followed in its immediate wake , trembling and astonished at the turn of my adventure . And not only trembling , but shivering . It was a bright day in January and I was stark naked and the thin slime of mud that covered the road was freezing . Foolish as it seems to me now , I had not reckoned that , transparent or not , I was still amenable to the weather and all its consequences .</said></p>
    <p n="778"><said >“ Then suddenly a bright idea came into my head . I ran round and got into the cab . And so , shivering , scared , and sniffing with the first intimations of a cold , and with the bruises in the small of my back growing upon my attention , I drove slowly along Oxford Street and past Tottenham Court Road . My mood was as different from that in which I had sallied forth ten minutes ago as it is possible to imagine . This invisibility indeed ! The one thought that possessed me was — how was I to get out of the scrape I was in .</said></p>
    <p n="779"><said >“ We crawled past Mudie 's , and there a tall woman with five or six yellow-labelled books hailed my cab , and I sprang out just in time to escape her , shaving a railway van narrowly in my flight . I made off up the roadway to Bloomsbury Square , intending to strike north past the Museum and so get into the quiet district . I was now cruelly chilled , and the strangeness of my situation so unnerved me that I whimpered as I ran . At the northward corner of the Square a little white dog ran out of the Pharmaceutical Society 's offices , and incontinently made for me , nose down .</said></p>
    <p n="780"><said >“ I had never realised it before , but the nose is to the mind of a dog what the eye is to the mind of a seeing man . Dogs perceive the scent of a man moving as men perceive his vision . This brute began barking and leaping , showing , as it seemed to me , only too plainly that he was aware of me . I crossed Great Russell Street , glancing over my shoulder as I did so , and went some way along Montague Street before I realised what I was running towards .</said></p>
    <p n="781"><said >“ Then I became aware of a blare of music , and looking along the street saw a number of people advancing out of Russell Square , red shirts , and the banner of the Salvation Army to the fore . Such a crowd , chanting in the roadway and scoffing on the pavement , I could not hope to penetrate , and dreading to go back and farther from home again , and deciding on the spur of the moment , I ran up the white steps of a house facing the museum railings , and stood there until the crowd should have passed . Happily the dog stopped at the noise of the band too , hesitated , and turned tail , running back to Bloomsbury Square again .</said></p>
    <p n="782"><said >“ On came the band , bawling with unconscious irony some hymn about ‘ When shall we see His face ? ’ and it seemed an interminable time to me before the tide of the crowd washed along the pavement by me . Thud , thud , thud , came the drum with a vibrating resonance , and for the moment I did not notice two urchins stopping at the railings by me . ‘ See ‘ em , ’ said one . ‘ See what ? ’ said the other . ‘ Why — them footmarks — bare . Like what you makes in mud . ’</said></p>
    <p n="783"><said >“ I looked down and saw the youngsters had stopped and were gaping at the muddy footmarks I had left behind me up the newly whitened steps . The passing people elbowed and jostled them , but their confounded intelligence was arrested . ‘ Thud , thud , thud , when , thud , shall we see , thud , his face , thud , thud . ’ ‘ There 's a barefoot man gone up them steps , or I do n't know nothing , ’ said one . ‘ And he ai n't never come down again . And his foot was a-bleeding . ’</said></p>
    <p n="784"><said >“ The thick of the crowd had already passed . ‘ Looky there , Ted , ’ quoth the younger of the detectives , with the sharpness of surprise in his voice , and pointed straight to my feet . I looked down and saw at once the dim suggestion of their outline sketched in splashes of mud . For a moment I was paralysed .</said></p>
    <p n="785"><said >“ ‘ Why , that 's rum , ’ said the elder . ‘ Dashed rum ! It 's just like the ghost of a foot , ai n't it ? ’ He hesitated and advanced with outstretched hand . A man pulled up short to see what he was catching , and then a girl . In another moment he would have touched me . Then I saw what to do . I made a step , the boy started back with an exclamation , and with a rapid movement I swung myself over into the portico of the next house . But the smaller boy was sharp-eyed enough to follow the movement , and before I was well down the steps and upon the pavement , he had recovered from his momentary astonishment and was shouting out that the feet had gone over the wall .</said></p>
    <p n="786"><said >“ They rushed round and saw my new footmarks flash into being on the lower step and upon the pavement . ‘ What 's up ? ’ asked someone . ‘ Feet ! Look ! Feet running ! ’</said></p>
    <p n="787"><said >“ Everybody in the road , except my three pursuers , was pouring along after the Salvation Army , and this blow not only impeded me but them . There was an eddy of surprise and interrogation . At the cost of bowling over one young fellow I got through , and in another moment I was rushing headlong round the circuit of Russell Square , with six or seven astonished people following my footmarks . There was no time for explanation , or else the whole host would have been after me .</said></p>
    <p n="788"><said >“ Twice I doubled round corners , thrice I crossed the road and came back upon my tracks , and then , as my feet grew hot and dry , the damp impressions began to fade . At last I had a breathing space and rubbed my feet clean with my hands , and so got away altogether . The last I saw of the chase was a little group of a dozen people perhaps , studying with infinite perplexity a slowly drying footprint that had resulted from a puddle in Tavistock Square , a footprint as isolated and incomprehensible to them as Crusoe 's solitary discovery .</said></p>
    <p n="789"><said >“ This running warmed me to a certain extent , and I went on with a better courage through the maze of less frequented roads that runs hereabouts . My back had now become very stiff and sore , my tonsils were painful from the cabman 's fingers , and the skin of my neck had been scratched by his nails ; my feet hurt exceedingly and I was lame from a little cut on one foot . I saw in time a blind man approaching me , and fled limping , for I feared his subtle intuitions . Once or twice accidental collisions occurred and I left people amazed , with unaccountable curses ringing in their ears . Then came something silent and quiet against my face , and across the Square fell a thin veil of slowly falling flakes of snow . I had caught a cold , and do as I would I could not avoid an occasional sneeze . And every dog that came in sight , with its pointing nose and curious sniffing , was a terror to me .</said></p>
    <p n="790"><said>“ Then came men and boys running , first one and then others , and shouting as they ran . It was a fire . They ran in the direction of my lodging , and looking back down a street I saw a mass of black smoke streaming up above the roofs and telephone wires . It was my lodging burning ; my clothes , my apparatus , all my resources indeed , except my cheque-book and the three volumes of memoranda that awaited me in Great Portland Street , were there . Burning ! I had burnt my boats — if ever a man did ! The place was blazing . ”</said></p>

   <div type="chapter" n="22">
    <p n="792"><said >“ So last January , with the beginning of a snowstorm in the air about me — and if it settled on me it would betray me !— weary , cold , painful , inexpressibly wretched , and still but half convinced of my invisible quality , I began this new life to which I am committed . I had no refuge , no appliances , no human being in the world in whom I could confide . To have told my secret would have given me away — made a mere show and rarity of me . Nevertheless , I was half-minded to accost some passer-by and throw myself upon his mercy . But I knew too clearly the terror and brutal cruelty my advances would evoke . I made no plans in the street . My sole object was to get shelter from the snow , to get myself covered and warm ; then I might hope to plan . But even to me , an Invisible Man , the rows of London houses stood latched , barred , and bolted impregnably .</said></p>
    <p n="793"><said >“ Only one thing could I see clearly before me — the cold exposure and misery of the snowstorm and the night .</said></p>
    <p n="794"><said >“ And then I had a brilliant idea . I turned down one of the roads leading from Gower Street to Tottenham Court Road , and found myself outside Omniums , the big establishment where everything is to be bought — you know the place : meat , grocery , linen , furniture , clothing , oil paintings even — a huge meandering collection of shops rather than a shop . I had thought I should find the doors open , but they were closed , and as I stood in the wide entrance a carriage stopped outside , and a man in uniform — you know the kind of personage with ‘ Omnium ’ on his cap — flung open the door . I contrived to enter , and walking down the shop — it was a department where they were selling ribbons and gloves and stockings and that kind of thing — came to a more spacious region devoted to picnic baskets and wicker furniture .</said></p>
    <p n="795"><said >“ I did not feel safe there , however ; people were going to and fro , and I prowled restlessly about until I came upon a huge section in an upper floor containing multitudes of bedsteads , and over these I clambered , and found a resting-place at last among a huge pile of folded flock mattresses . The place was already lit up and agreeably warm , and I decided to remain where I was , keeping a cautious eye on the two or three sets of shopmen and customers who were meandering through the place , until closing time came . Then I should be able , I thought , to rob the place for food and clothing , and disguised , prowl through it and examine its resources , perhaps sleep on some of the bedding . That seemed an acceptable plan . My idea was to procure clothing to make myself a muffled but acceptable figure , to get money , and then to recover my books and parcels where they awaited me , take a lodging somewhere and elaborate plans for the complete realisation of the advantages my invisibility gave me ( as I still imagined ) over my fellow-men .</said></p>
    <p n="796"><said >“ Closing time arrived quickly enough . It could not have been more than an hour after I took up my position on the mattresses before I noticed the blinds of the windows being drawn , and customers being marched doorward . And then a number of brisk young men began with remarkable alacrity to tidy up the goods that remained disturbed . I left my lair as the crowds diminished , and prowled cautiously out into the less desolate parts of the shop . I was really surprised to observe how rapidly the young men and women whipped away the goods displayed for sale during the day . All the boxes of goods , the hanging fabrics , the festoons of lace , the boxes of sweets in the grocery section , the displays of this and that , were being whipped down , folded up , slapped into tidy receptacles , and everything that could not be taken down and put away had sheets of some coarse stuff like sacking flung over them . Finally all the chairs were turned up on to the counters , leaving the floor clear . Directly each of these young people had done , he or she made promptly for the door with such an expression of animation as I have rarely observed in a shop assistant before . Then came a lot of youngsters scattering sawdust and carrying pails and brooms . I had to dodge to get out of the way , and as it was , my ankle got stung with the sawdust . For some time , wandering through the swathed and darkened departments , I could hear the brooms at work . And at last a good hour or more after the shop had been closed , came a noise of locking doors . Silence came upon the place , and I found myself wandering through the vast and intricate shops , galleries , show-rooms of the place , alone . It was very still ; in one place I remember passing near one of the Tottenham Court Road entrances and listening to the tapping of boot-heels of the passers-by .</said></p>
    <p n="797"><said >“ My first visit was to the place where I had seen stockings and gloves for sale . It was dark , and I had the devil of a hunt after matches , which I found at last in the drawer of the little cash desk . Then I had to get a candle . I had to tear down wrappings and ransack a number of boxes and drawers , but at last I managed to turn out what I sought ; the box label called them lambswool pants , and lambswool vests . Then socks , a thick comforter , and then I went to the clothing place and got trousers , a lounge jacket , an overcoat and a slouch hat — a clerical sort of hat with the brim turned down . I began to feel a human being again , and my next thought was food .</said></p>
    <p n="798"><said >“ Upstairs was a refreshment department , and there I got cold meat . There was coffee still in the urn , and I lit the gas and warmed it up again , and altogether I did not do badly . Afterwards , prowling through the place in search of blankets — I had to put up at last with a heap of down quilts — I came upon a grocery section with a lot of chocolate and candied fruits , more than was good for me indeed — and some white burgundy . And near that was a toy department , and I had a brilliant idea . I found some artificial noses — dummy noses , you know , and I thought of dark spectacles . But Omniums had no optical department . My nose had been a difficulty indeed — I had thought of paint . But the discovery set my mind running on wigs and masks and the like . Finally I went to sleep in a heap of down quilts , very warm and comfortable .</said></p>
    <p n="799"><said >“ My last thoughts before sleeping were the most agreeable I had had since the change . I was in a state of physical serenity , and that was reflected in my mind . I thought that I should be able to slip out unobserved in the morning with my clothes upon me , muffling my face with a white wrapper I had taken , purchase , with the money I had taken , spectacles and so forth , and so complete my disguise . I lapsed into disorderly dreams of all the fantastic things that had happened during the last few days . I saw the ugly little Jew of a landlord vociferating in his rooms ; I saw his two sons marvelling , and the wrinkled old woman 's gnarled face as she asked for her cat . I experienced again the strange sensation of seeing the cloth disappear , and so I came round to the windy hillside and the sniffing old clergyman mumbling ‘ Earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust , ’ at my father 's open grave .</said></p>
    <p n="800"><said >“ ‘ You also , ’ said a voice , and suddenly I was being forced towards the grave . I struggled , shouted , appealed to the mourners , but they continued stonily following the service ; the old clergyman , too , never faltered droning and sniffing through the ritual . I realised I was invisible and inaudible , that overwhelming forces had their grip on me . I struggled in vain , I was forced over the brink , the coffin rang hollow as I fell upon it , and the gravel came flying after me in spadefuls . Nobody heeded me , nobody was aware of me . I made convulsive struggles and awoke .</said></p>
    <p n="801"><said >“ The pale London dawn had come , the place was full of a chilly grey light that filtered round the edges of the window blinds . I sat up , and for a time I could not think where this ample apartment , with its counters , its piles of rolled stuff , its heap of quilts and cushions , its iron pillars , might be . Then , as recollection came back to me , I heard voices in conversation .</said></p>
    <p n="802"><said >“ Then far down the place , in the brighter light of some department which had already raised its blinds , I saw two men approaching . I scrambled to my feet , looking about me for some way of escape , and even as I did so the sound of my movement made them aware of me . I suppose they saw merely a figure moving quietly and quickly away . ‘ Who 's that ? ’ cried one , and ‘ Stop , there ! ’ shouted the other . I dashed around a corner and came full tilt — a faceless figure , mind you !— on a lanky lad of fifteen . He yelled and I bowled him over , rushed past him , turned another corner , and by a happy inspiration threw myself behind a counter . In another moment feet went running past and I heard voices shouting , ‘ All hands to the doors ! ’ asking what was ‘ up , ’ and giving one another advice how to catch me .</said></p>
    <p n="803"><said >“ Lying on the ground , I felt scared out of my wits . But — odd as it may seem — it did not occur to me at the moment to take off my clothes as I should have done . I had made up my mind , I suppose , to get away in them , and that ruled me . And then down the vista of the counters came a bawling of ‘ Here he is ! ’</said></p>
    <p n="804"><said>“ I sprang to my feet , whipped a chair off the counter , and sent it whirling at the fool who had shouted , turned , came into another round a corner , sent him spinning , and rushed up the stairs . He kept his footing , gave a view hallo , and came up the staircase hot after me . Up the staircase were piled a multitude of those bright-coloured pot things — what are they ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="805"><said who="#Kemp">“ Art pots , ”</said>suggested<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="806"><said who="#Kemp">“ That 's it ! Art pots . Well , I turned at the top step and swung round , plucked one out of a pile and smashed it on his silly head as he came at me . The whole pile of pots went headlong , and I heard shouting and footsteps running from all parts . I made a mad rush for the refreshment place , and there was a man in white like a man cook , who took up the chase . I made one last desperate turn and found myself among lamps and ironmongery . I went behind the counter of this , and waited for my cook , and as he bolted in at the head of the chase , I doubled him up with a lamp . Down he went , and I crouched down behind the counter and began whipping off my clothes as fast as I could . Coat , jacket , trousers , shoes were all right , but a lambswool vest fits a man like a skin . I heard more men coming , my cook was lying quiet on the other side of the counter , stunned or scared speechless , and I had to make another dash for it , like a rabbit hunted out of a wood-pile .</said></p>
    <p n="807"><said who="#Kemp">“ ‘ This way , policeman ! ’ I heard someone shouting . I found myself in my bedstead storeroom again , and at the end of a wilderness of wardrobes . I rushed among them , went flat , got rid of my vest after infinite wriggling , and stood a free man again , panting and scared , as the policeman and three of the shopmen came round the corner . They made a rush for the vest and pants , and collared the trousers . ‘ He 's dropping his plunder , ’ said one of the young men . ‘ He must be somewhere here . ’</said></p>
    <p n="808"><said who="#Kemp">“ But they did not find me all the same .</said></p>
    <p n="809"><said who="#Kemp">“ I stood watching them hunt for me for a time , and cursing my ill-luck in losing the clothes . Then I went into the refreshment-room , drank a little milk I found there , and sat down by the fire to consider my position .</said></p>
    <p n="810"><said who="#Kemp">“ In a little while two assistants came in and began to talk over the business very excitedly and like the fools they were . I heard a magnified account of my depredations , and other speculations as to my whereabouts . Then I fell to scheming again . The insurmountable difficulty of the place , especially now it was alarmed , was to get any plunder out of it . I went down into the warehouse to see if there was any chance of packing and addressing a parcel , but I could not understand the system of checking . About eleven o'clock , the snow having thawed as it fell , and the day being finer and a little warmer than the previous one , I decided that the Emporium was hopeless , and went out again , exasperated at my want of success , with only the vaguest plans of action in my mind . ”</said></p>

I had no shelter — no covering — to get clothing was to forego all my advantage , to make myself a strange and terrible thing .

    <p n="813"><said who="#Kemp">“ Nor had I . And the snow had warned me of other dangers . I could not go abroad in snow — it would settle on me and expose me . Rain , too , would make me a watery outline , a glistening surface of a man — a bubble . And fog — I should be like a fainter bubble in a fog , a surface , a greasy glimmer of humanity . Moreover , as I went abroad — in the London air — I gathered dirt about my ankles , floating smuts and dust upon my skin . I did not know how long it would be before I should become visible from that cause also . But I saw clearly it could not be for long .</said></p>
    <p n="814"><said who="#Kemp">“ Not in London at any rate .</said></p>
    <p n="815"><said who="#Kemp">“ I went into the slums towards Great Portland Street , and found myself at the end of the street in which I had lodged . I did not go that way , because of the crowd halfway down it opposite to the still smoking ruins of the house I had fired . My most immediate problem was to get clothing . What to do with my face puzzled me . Then I saw in one of those little miscellaneous shops — news , sweets , toys , stationery , belated Christmas tomfoolery , and so forth — an array of masks and noses . I realised that problem was solved . In a flash I saw my course . I turned about , no longer aimless , and went — circuitously in order to avoid the busy ways , towards the back streets north of the Strand ; for I remembered , though not very distinctly where , that some theatrical costumiers had shops in that district .</said></p>
    <p n="816"><said who="#Kemp">“ The day was cold , with a nipping wind down the northward running streets . I walked fast to avoid being overtaken . Every crossing was a danger , every passenger a thing to watch alertly . One man as I was about to pass him at the top of Bedford Street , turned upon me abruptly and came into me , sending me into the road and almost under the wheel of a passing hansom . The verdict of the cab-rank was that he had had some sort of stroke . I was so unnerved by this encounter that I went into Covent Garden Market and sat down for some time in a quiet corner by a stall of violets , panting and trembling . I found I had caught a fresh cold , and had to turn out after a time lest my sneezes should attract attention .</said></p>
    <p n="817"><said who="#Kemp">“ At last I reached the object of my quest , a dirty , fly-blown little shop in a by-way near Drury Lane , with a window full of tinsel robes , sham jewels , wigs , slippers , dominoes and theatrical photographs . The shop was old-fashioned and low and dark , and the house rose above it for four storeys , dark and dismal . I peered through the window and , seeing no one within , entered . The opening of the door set a clanking bell ringing . I left it open , and walked round a bare costume stand , into a corner behind a cheval glass . For a minute or so no one came . Then I heard heavy feet striding across a room , and a man appeared down the shop .</said></p>
    <p n="818"><said who="#Kemp">“ My plans were now perfectly definite . I proposed to make my way into the house , secrete myself upstairs , watch my opportunity , and when everything was quiet , rummage out a wig , mask , spectacles , and costume , and go into the world , perhaps a grotesque but still a credible figure . And incidentally of course I could rob the house of any available money .</said></p>
    <p n="819"><said who="#Kemp">“ The man who had just entered the shop was a short , slight , hunched , beetle-browed man , with long arms and very short bandy legs . Apparently I had interrupted a meal . He stared about the shop with an expression of expectation . This gave way to surprise , and then to anger , as he saw the shop empty . ‘ Damn the boys ! ’ he said . He went to stare up and down the street . He came in again in a minute , kicked the door to with his foot spitefully , and went muttering back to the house door .</said></p>
    <p n="820"><said who="#Kemp">“ I came forward to follow him , and at the noise of my movement he stopped dead . I did so too , startled by his quickness of ear . He slammed the house door in my face .</said></p>
    <p n="821"><said who="#Kemp">“ I stood hesitating . Suddenly I heard his quick footsteps returning , and the door reopened . He stood looking about the shop like one who was still not satisfied . Then , murmuring to himself , he examined the back of the counter and peered behind some fixtures . Then he stood doubtful . He had left the house door open and I slipped into the inner room .</said></p>
    <p n="822"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ It was a queer little room , poorly furnished and with a number of big masks in the corner . On the table was his belated breakfast , and it was a confoundedly exasperating thing for me ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, to have to sniff his coffee and stand watching while he came in and resumed his meal . And his table manners were irritating . Three doors opened into the little room , one going upstairs and one down , but they were all shut . I could not get out of the room while he was there ; I could scarcely move because of his alertness , and there was a draught down my back . Twice I strangled a sneeze just in time .</said></p>
    <p n="823"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ The spectacular quality of my sensations was curious and novel , but for all that I was heartily tired and angry long before he had done his eating . But at last he made an end and putting his beggarly crockery on the black tin tray upon which he had had his teapot , and gathering all the crumbs up on the mustard stained cloth , he took the whole lot of things after him . His burden prevented his shutting the door behind him — as he would have done ; I never saw such a man for shutting doors — and I followed him into a very dirty underground kitchen and scullery . I had the pleasure of seeing him begin to wash up , and then , finding no good in keeping down there , and the brick floor being cold on my feet , I returned upstairs and sat in his chair by the fire . It was burning low , and scarcely thinking , I put on a little coal . The noise of this brought him up at once , and he stood aglare . He peered about the room and was within an ace of touching me . Even after that examination , he scarcely seemed satisfied . He stopped in the doorway and took a final inspection before he went down .</said></p>
    <p n="824"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I waited in the little parlour for an age , and at last he came up and opened the upstairs door . I just managed to get by him .</said></p>
    <p n="825"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ On the staircase he stopped suddenly , so that I very nearly blundered into him . He stood looking back right into my face and listening . ‘ I could have sworn , ’ he said . His long hairy hand pulled at his lower lip . His eye went up and down the staircase . Then he grunted and went on up again .</said></p>
    <p n="826"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ His hand was on the handle of a door , and then he stopped again with the same puzzled anger on his face . He was becoming aware of the faint sounds of my movements about him . The man must have had diabolically acute hearing . He suddenly flashed into rage . ‘ If there 's anyone in this house — ’ he cried with an oath , and left the threat unfinished . He put his hand in his pocket , failed to find what he wanted , and rushing past me went blundering noisily and pugnaciously downstairs . But I did not follow him . I sat on the head of the staircase until his return .</said></p>
    <p n="827"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Presently he came up again , still muttering . He opened the door of the room , and before I could enter , slammed it in my face .</said></p>
    <p n="828"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I resolved to explore the house , and spent some time in doing so as noiselessly as possible . The house was very old and tumble-down , damp so that the paper in the attics was peeling from the walls , and rat infested . Some of the door handles were stiff and I was afraid to turn them . Several rooms I did inspect were unfurnished , and others were littered with theatrical lumber , bought second-hand , I judged , from its appearance . In one room next to his I found a lot of old clothes . I began routing among these , and in my eagerness forgot again the evident sharpness of his ears . I heard a stealthy footstep and , looking up just in time , saw him peering in at the tumbled heap and holding an old-fashioned revolver in his hand . I stood perfectly still while he stared about open-mouthed and suspicious . ‘ It must have been her , ’ he said slowly . ‘ Damn her ! ’</said></p>
    <p n="829"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ He shut the door quietly , and immediately I heard the key turn in the lock . Then his footsteps retreated . I realised abruptly that I was locked in . For a minute I did not know what to do . I walked from door to window and back , and stood perplexed . A gust of anger came upon me . But I decided to inspect the clothes before I did anything further , and my first attempt brought down a pile from an upper shelf . This brought him back , more sinister than ever . That time he actually touched me , jumped back with amazement and stood astonished in the middle of the room .</said></p>
    <p n="830"><said who="#Kemp">“ Presently he calmed a little . ‘ Rats , ’ he said in an undertone , fingers on lips . He was evidently a little scared . I edged quietly out of the room , but a plank creaked . Then the infernal little brute started going all over the house , revolver in hand and locking door after door and pocketing the keys . When I realised what he was up to I had a fit of rage — I could hardly control myself sufficiently to watch my opportunity . By this time I knew he was alone in the house , and so I made no more ado , but knocked him on the head . ”</said></p>
    <p n="831"><said who="#Kemp">“ Knocked him on the head ? ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="832"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Yes — stunned him — as he was going downstairs . Hit him from behind with a stool that stood on the landing . He went downstairs like a bag of old boots . ”</said></p>
    <p n="833"><said who="#Kemp">“ But — I say ! The common conventions of humanity — ”</said></p>
    <p n="834"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Are all very well for common people . But the point was ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, that I had to get out of that house in a disguise without his seeing me . I could n't think of any other way of doing it . And then I gagged him with a Louis Quatorze vest and tied him up in a sheet . ”</said></p>
    <p n="835"><said who="#Kemp">“ Tied him up in a sheet ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="836"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Made a sort of bag of it . It was rather a good idea to keep the idiot scared and quiet , and a devilish hard thing to get out of — head away from the string . My dear<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, it 's no good your sitting glaring as though I was a murderer . It had to be done . He had his revolver . If once he saw me he would be able to describe me — ”</said></p>
    <p n="837"><said who="#Kemp">“ But still , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>,<said who="#Kemp">“ in England — to-day . And the man was in his own house , and you were — well , robbing . ”</said></p>
    <p n="838"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Robbing ! Confound it ! You 'll call me a thief next ! Surely ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, you 're not fool enough to dance on the old strings . Ca n't you see my position ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="839"><said who="#Kemp">“ And his too , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="840"><persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>stood up sharply .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ What do you mean to say ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="841"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s face grew a trifle hard . He was about to speak and checked himself .<said who="#Kemp">“ I suppose , after all , ”</said>he said with a sudden change of manner ,<said who="#Kemp">“ the thing had to be done . You were in a fix . But still — ”</said></p>
    <p n="842"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Of course I was in a fix — an infernal fix . And he made me wild too — hunting me about the house , fooling about with his revolver , locking and unlocking doors . He was simply exasperating . You do n't blame me , do you ? You do n't blame me ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="843"><said who="#Kemp">“ I never blame anyone , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ It 's quite out of fashion . What did you do next ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="844"><said who="#Kemp">“ I was hungry . Downstairs I found a loaf and some rank cheese — more than sufficient to satisfy my hunger . I took some brandy and water , and then went up past my impromptu bag — he was lying quite still — to the room containing the old clothes . This looked out upon the street , two lace curtains brown with dirt guarding the window . I went and peered out through their interstices . Outside the day was bright — by contrast with the brown shadows of the dismal house in which I found myself , dazzlingly bright . A brisk traffic was going by , fruit carts , a hansom , a four-wheeler with a pile of boxes , a fishmonger 's cart . I turned with spots of colour swimming before my eyes to the shadowy fixtures behind me . My excitement was giving place to a clear apprehension of my position again . The room was full of a faint scent of benzoline , used , I suppose , in cleaning the garments .</said></p>
    <p n="845"><said who="#Kemp">“ I began a systematic search of the place . I should judge the hunchback had been alone in the house for some time . He was a curious person . Everything that could possibly be of service to me I collected in the clothes storeroom , and then I made a deliberate selection . I found a handbag I thought a suitable possession , and some powder , rouge , and sticking-plaster .</said></p>
    <p n="846"><said who="#Kemp">“ I had thought of painting and powdering my face and all that there was to show of me , in order to render myself visible , but the disadvantage of this lay in the fact that I should require turpentine and other appliances and a considerable amount of time before I could vanish again . Finally I chose a mask of the better type , slightly grotesque but not more so than many human beings , dark glasses , greyish whiskers , and a wig . I could find no underclothing , but that I could buy subsequently , and for the time I swathed myself in calico dominoes and some white cashmere scarfs . I could find no socks , but the hunchback 's boots were rather a loose fit and sufficed . In a desk in the shop were three sovereigns and about thirty shillings ’ worth of silver , and in a locked cupboard I burst in the inner room were eight pounds in gold . I could go forth into the world again , equipped .</said></p>
    <p n="847"><said who="#Kemp">“ Then came a curious hesitation . Was my appearance really credible ? I tried myself with a little bedroom looking-glass , inspecting myself from every point of view to discover any forgotten chink , but it all seemed sound . I was grotesque to the theatrical pitch , a stage miser , but I was certainly not a physical impossibility . Gathering confidence , I took my looking-glass down into the shop , pulled down the shop blinds , and surveyed myself from every point of view with the help of the cheval glass in the corner .</said></p>
    <p n="848"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I spent some minutes screwing up my courage and then unlocked the shop door and marched out into the street , leaving the little man to get out of his sheet again when he liked . In five minutes a dozen turnings intervened between me and the costumier 's shop . No one appeared to notice me very pointedly . My last difficulty seemed overcome . ”</said></p>
    <p n="849">He stopped again .</p>
    <p n="850"><said who="#Kemp">“ And you troubled no more about the hunchback ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="851"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>.<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Nor have I heard what became of him . I suppose he untied himself or kicked himself out . The knots were pretty tight . ”</said></p>
    <p n="852">He became silent and went to the window and stared out .</p>
    <p n="853"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ What happened when you went out into the Strand ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="854"><said who="#Kemp">“ Oh !— disillusionment again . I thought my troubles were over . Practically I thought I had impunity to do whatever I chose , everything — save to give away my secret . So I thought . Whatever I did , whatever the consequences might be , was nothing to me . I had merely to fling aside my garments and vanish . No person could hold me . I could take my money where I found it . I decided to treat myself to a sumptuous feast , and then put up at a good hotel , and accumulate a new outfit of property . I felt amazingly confident ; it 's not particularly pleasant recalling that I was an ass . I went into a place and was already ordering lunch , when it occurred to me that I could not eat unless I exposed my invisible face . I finished ordering the lunch , told the man I should be back in ten minutes , and went out exasperated . I do n't know if you have ever been disappointed in your appetite . ”</said></p>
    <p n="855"><said who="#Kemp">“ Not quite so badly , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>,<said who="#Kemp">“ but I can imagine it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="856"><said who="#Kemp">“ I could have smashed the silly devils . At last , faint with the desire for tasteful food , I went into another place and demanded a private room . ‘ I am disfigured , ’ I said . ‘ Badly . ’ They looked at me curiously , but of course it was not their affair — and so at last I got my lunch . It was not particularly well served , but it sufficed ; and when I had had it , I sat over a cigar , trying to plan my line of action . And outside a snowstorm was beginning .</said></p>
    <p n="857"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ The more I thought it over ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, the more I realised what a helpless absurdity an Invisible Man was — in a cold and dirty climate and a crowded civilised city . Before I made this mad experiment I had dreamt of a thousand advantages . That afternoon it seemed all disappointment . I went over the heads of the things a man reckons desirable . No doubt invisibility made it possible to get them , but it made it impossible to enjoy them when they are got . Ambition — what is the good of pride of place when you cannot appear there ? What is the good of the love of woman when her name must needs be Delilah ? I have no taste for politics , for the blackguardisms of fame , for philanthropy , for sport . What was I to do ? And for this I had become a wrapped-up mystery , a swathed and bandaged caricature of a man ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="858">He paused , and his attitude suggested a roving glance at the window .</p>
    <p n="859"><said who="#Kemp">“ But how did you get to Iping ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, anxious to keep his guest busy talking .</p>
    <p n="860"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I went there to work . I had one hope . It was a half idea ! I have it still . It is a full blown idea now . A way of getting back ! Of restoring what I have done . When I choose . When I have done all I mean to do invisibly . And that is what I chiefly want to talk to you about now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="861"><said who="#Kemp">“ You went straight to Iping ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="862"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Yes . I had simply to get my three volumes of memoranda and my cheque-book , my luggage and underclothing , order a quantity of chemicals to work out this idea of mine — I will show you the calculations as soon as I get my books — and then I started . Jove ! I remember the snowstorm now , and the accursed bother it was to keep the snow from damping my pasteboard nose . ”</said></p>
    <p n="863"><said who="#Kemp">“ At the end , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>,<said who="#Kemp">“ the day before yesterday , when they found you out , you rather — to judge by the papers — ”</said></p>
    <p n="864"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I did . Rather . Did I kill that fool of a constable ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="865"><said who="#Kemp">“ No , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ He 's expected to recover . ”</said></p>
    <p n="866"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ That 's his luck , then . I clean lost my temper , the fools ! Why could n't they leave me alone ? And that grocer lout ? ”</said></p>

    <p n="868"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I do n't know about that tramp of mine , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>, with an unpleasant laugh .</p>

    <p n="874">He moved nearer his guest as he spoke in such a manner as to prevent the possibility of a sudden glimpse of the three men who were advancing up the hill road — with an intolerable slowness , as it seemed to<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="875"><said who="#Kemp">“ What were you planning to do when you were heading for Port Burdock ? Had you any plan ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="876"><said who="#Kemp">“ I was going to clear out of the country . But I have altered that plan rather since seeing you . I thought it would be wise , now the weather is hot and invisibility possible , to make for the South . Especially as my secret was known , and everyone would be on the lookout for a masked and muffled man . You have a line of steamers from here to France . My idea was to get aboard one and run the risks of the passage . Thence I could go by train into Spain , or else get to Algiers . It would not be difficult . There a man might always be invisible — and yet live . And do things . I was using that tramp as a money box and luggage carrier , until I decided how to get my books and things sent over to meet me . ”</said></p>
    <p n="877"><said who="#Kemp">“ That 's clear . ”</said></p>

    <p n="894"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I made a mistake ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, a huge mistake , in carrying this thing through alone .

    <p n="896"><said who="#Kemp">“ Hitherto I have gone on vague lines . We have to consider all that invisibility means , all that it does not mean .

Once you 've caught me you could easily imprison me . But on the other hand I am hard to catch . This invisibility , in fact , is only good in two cases : It 's useful in getting away , it 's useful in approaching . It 's particularly useful , therefore , in killing . I can walk round a man , whatever weapon he has , choose my point , strike as I like . Dodge as I like . Escape as I like . ”</said></p>

He must take some town like your Burdock and terrify and dominate it . He must issue his orders . He can do that in a thousand ways — scraps of paper thrust under doors would suffice .

    <p n="907"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Let me see , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>, and advanced , arm extended , to the door .</p>
    <p n="908">And then things happened very swiftly .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>hesitated for a second and then moved to intercept him .<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>started and stood still .<said who="#the_Voice">“ Traitor ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>, and suddenly the dressing-gown opened , and sitting down<persName corresp="#the_Unseen">the Unseen</persName>began to disrobe .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>made three swift steps to the door , and forthwith<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>— his legs had vanished — sprang to his feet with a shout .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>flung the door open .</p>
    <p n="909">As it opened , there came a sound of hurrying feet downstairs and voices .</p>
    <p n="910">With a quick movement<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>thrust<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>back , sprang aside , and slammed the door . The key was outside and ready . In another moment<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>would have been alone in the belvedere study , a prisoner . Save for one little thing . The key had been slipped in hastily that morning . As<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>slammed the door it fell noisily upon the carpet .</p>
    <p n="911"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s face became white . He tried to grip the door handle with both hands . For a moment he stood lugging . Then the door gave six inches . But he got it closed again . The second time it was jerked a foot wide , and the dressing-gown came wedging itself into the opening . His throat was gripped by invisible fingers , and he left his hold on the handle to defend himself . He was forced back , tripped and pitched heavily into the corner of the landing . The empty dressing-gown was flung on the top of him .</p>
    <p n="912">Halfway up the staircase was Colonel<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>, the recipient of<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s letter , the chief of the Burdock police . He was staring aghast at the sudden appearance of<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, followed by the extraordinary sight of clothing tossing empty in the air . He saw<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>felled , and struggling to his feet . He saw him rush forward , and go down again , felled like an ox .</p>
    <p n="913">Then suddenly he was struck violently . By nothing ! A vast weight , it seemed , leapt upon him , and he was hurled headlong down the staircase , with a grip on his throat and a knee in his groin . An invisible foot trod on his back , a ghostly patter passed downstairs , he heard the two police officers in the hall shout and run , and the front door of the house slammed violently .</p>
    <p n="914">He rolled over and sat up staring . He saw , staggering down the staircase ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, dusty and disheveled , one side of his face white from a blow , his lip bleeding , and a pink dressing-gown and some underclothing held in his arms .</p>
    <p n="915"><said who="#Kemp">“ My God ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>,<said who="#Kemp">“ the game 's up ! He 's gone ! ”</said></p>

    <p n="916">For a space<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>was too inarticulate to make<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>understand the swift things that had just happened .

But presently<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>began to grasp something of the situation .</p>
    <p n="917"><said who="#Kemp">“ He is mad , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>;<said who="#Kemp">“ inhuman . He is pure selfishness .

    <p n="919"><said who="#Kemp">“ But how ? ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, and suddenly became full of ideas .<said who="#Kemp">“ You must begin at once . You must set every available man to work ; you must prevent his leaving this district . Once he gets away , he may go through the countryside as he wills , killing and maiming . He dreams of a reign of terror ! A reign of terror , I tell you . You must set a watch on trains and roads and shipping . The garrison must help . You must wire for help . The only thing that may keep him here is the thought of recovering some books of notes he counts of value . I will tell you of that ! There is a man in your police station —<persName corresp="#Marvel">Marvel</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="920"><said who="#Adye">“ I know , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>,<said who="#Adye">“ I know . Those books — yes . But the tramp .... ”</said></p>

The houses everywhere must be barred against him .<persName>Heaven</persName>send us cold nights and rain ! The whole country-side must begin hunting and keep hunting . I tell you ,<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>, he is a danger , a disaster ; unless he is pinned and secured , it is frightful to think of the things that may happen . ”</said></p>
    <p n="922"><said who="#Adye">“ What else can we do ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>.<said who="#Adye">“ I must go down at once and begin organising . But why not come ?

What else is there we can do ? Put that stuff down . ”</said></p>
    <p n="923">In another moment<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>was leading the way downstairs . They found the front door open and the policemen standing outside staring at empty air .<said who="#Kemp">“ He 's got away , sir , ”</said>said one .</p>
    <p n="924"><said who="#Adye">“ We must go to the central station at once , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>.<said who="#Adye">“ One of you go on down and get a cab to come up and meet us — quickly .

   <div type="chapter" n="26">
    <p n="934"><persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>seems to have rushed out of<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s house in a state of blind fury . A little child playing near<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s gateway was violently caught up and thrown aside , so that its ankle was broken , and thereafter for some hours<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>passed out of human perceptions . No one knows where he went nor what he did . But one can imagine him hurrying through the hot June forenoon , up the hill and on to the open downland behind Port Burdock , raging and despairing at his intolerable fate , and sheltering at last , heated and weary , amid the thickets of Hintondean , to piece together again his shattered schemes against his species . That seems to most probable refuge for him , for there it was he re-asserted himself in a grimly tragical manner about two in the afternoon .</p>
    <p n="935">One wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time , and what plans he devised . No doubt he was almost ecstatically exasperated by<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s treachery , and though we may be able to understand the motives that led to that deceit , we may still imagine and even sympathise a little with the fury the attempted surprise must have occasioned . Perhaps something of the stunned astonishment of his Oxford Street experiences may have returned to him , for he had evidently counted on<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s co-operation in his brutal dream of a terrorised world . At any rate he vanished from human ken about midday , and no living witness can tell what he did until about half-past two . It was a fortunate thing , perhaps , for humanity , but for him it was a fatal inaction .</p>
    <p n="936">During that time a growing multitude of men scattered over the countryside were busy . In the morning he had still been simply a legend , a terror ; in the afternoon , by virtue chiefly of<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s drily worded proclamation , he was presented as a tangible antagonist , to be wounded , captured , or overcome , and the countryside began organising itself with inconceivable rapidity . By two o'clock even he might still have removed himself out of the district by getting aboard a train , but after two that became impossible . Every passenger train along the lines on a great parallelogram between Southampton , Manchester , Brighton and Horsham , travelled with locked doors , and the goods traffic was almost entirely suspended . And in a great circle of twenty miles round Port Burdock , men armed with guns and bludgeons were presently setting out in groups of three and four , with dogs , to beat the roads and fields .</p>
    <p n="937">Mounted policemen rode along the country lanes , stopping at every cottage and warning the people to lock up their houses , and keep indoors unless they were armed , and all the elementary schools had broken up by three o'clock , and the children , scared and keeping together in groups , were hurrying home .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s proclamation — signed indeed by<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>— was posted over almost the whole district by four or five o'clock in the afternoon . It gave briefly but clearly all the conditions of the struggle , the necessity of keeping<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>from food and sleep , the necessity for incessant watchfulness and for a prompt attention to any evidence of his movements . And so swift and decided was the action of the authorities , so prompt and universal was the belief in this strange being , that before nightfall an area of several hundred square miles was in a stringent state of siege . And before nightfall , too , a thrill of horror went through the whole watching nervous countryside . Going from whispering mouth to mouth , swift and certain over the length and breadth of the country , passed the story of the murder of Mr.<persName>Wicksteed</persName>.</p>
    <p n="938">If our supposition that<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>'s refuge was the Hintondean thickets , then we must suppose that in the early afternoon he sallied out again bent upon some project that involved the use of a weapon . We cannot know what the project was , but the evidence that he had the iron rod in hand before he met<persName>Wicksteed</persName>is to me at least overwhelming .</p>
    <p n="939">Of course we can know nothing of the details of that encounter . It occurred on the edge of a gravel pit , not two hundred yards from Lord Burdock 's lodge gate . Everything points to a desperate struggle — the trampled ground , the numerous wounds Mr.<persName>Wicksteed</persName>received , his splintered walking-stick ; but why the attack was made , save in a murderous frenzy , it is impossible to imagine . Indeed the theory of madness is almost unavoidable . Mr.<persName>Wicksteed</persName>was a man of forty-five or forty-six , steward to Lord Burdock , of inoffensive habits and appearance , the very last person in the world to provoke such a terrible antagonist . Against him it would seem<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>used an iron rod dragged from a broken piece of fence . He stopped this quiet man , going quietly home to his midday meal , attacked him , beat down his feeble defences , broke his arm , felled him , and smashed his head to a jelly .</p>
    <p n="940">Of course , he must have dragged this rod out of the fencing before he met his victim — he must have been carrying it ready in his hand . Only two details beyond what has already been stated seem to bear on the matter . One is the circumstance that the gravel pit was not in Mr.<persName>Wicksteed</persName>'s direct path home , but nearly a couple of hundred yards out of his way . The other is the assertion of a little girl to the effect that , going to her afternoon school , she saw the murdered man “ trotting ” in a peculiar manner across a field towards the gravel pit . Her pantomime of his action suggests a man pursuing something on the ground before him and striking at it ever and again with his walking-stick . She was the last person to see him alive . He passed out of her sight to his death , the struggle being hidden from her only by a clump of beech trees and a slight depression in the ground .</p>
    <p n="941">Now this , to the present writer 's mind at least , lifts the murder out of the realm of the absolutely wanton . We may imagine that<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>had taken the rod as a weapon indeed , but without any deliberate intention of using it in murder .<persName>Wicksteed</persName>may then have come by and noticed this rod inexplicably moving through the air . Without any thought of<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>— for Port Burdock is ten miles away — he may have pursued it . It is quite conceivable that he may not even have heard of<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>. One can then imagine<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>making off — quietly in order to avoid discovering his presence in the neighbourhood , and<persName>Wicksteed</persName>, excited and curious , pursuing this unaccountably locomotive object — finally striking at it .</p>
    <p n="942">No doubt<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>could easily have distanced his middle-aged pursuer under ordinary circumstances , but the position in which<persName>Wicksteed</persName>'s body was found suggests that he had the ill luck to drive his quarry into a corner between a drift of stinging nettles and the gravel pit . To those who appreciate the extraordinary irascibility of<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>, the rest of the encounter will be easy to imagine .</p>
    <p n="943">But this is pure hypothesis . The only undeniable facts — for stories of children are often unreliable — are the discovery of<persName>Wicksteed</persName>'s body , done to death , and of the blood-stained iron rod flung among the nettles . The abandonment of the rod by<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>, suggests that in the emotional excitement of the affair , the purpose for which he took it — if he had a purpose — was abandoned . He was certainly an intensely egotistical and unfeeling man , but the sight of his victim , his first victim , bloody and pitiful at his feet , may have released some long pent fountain of remorse which for a time may have flooded whatever scheme of action he had contrived .</p>
    <p n="944">After the murder of Mr.<persName>Wicksteed</persName>, he would seem to have struck across the country towards the downland . There is a story of a voice heard about sunset by a couple of men in a field near Fern Bottom . It was wailing and laughing , sobbing and groaning , and ever and again it shouted . It must have been queer hearing . It drove up across the middle of a clover field and died away towards the hills .</p>
    <p n="945">That afternoon<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>must have learnt something of the rapid use<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>had made of his confidences . He must have found houses locked and secured ; he may have loitered about railway stations and prowled about inns , and no doubt he read the proclamations and realised something of the nature of the campaign against him . And as the evening advanced , the fields became dotted here and there with groups of three or four men , and noisy with the yelping of dogs . These men-hunters had particular instructions in the case of an encounter as to the way they should support one another . But he avoided them all . We may understand something of his exasperation , and it could have been none the less because he himself had supplied the information that was being used so remorselessly against him . For that day at least he lost heart ; for nearly twenty-four hours , save when he turned on<persName>Wicksteed</persName>, he was a hunted man . In the night , he must have eaten and slept ; for in the morning he was himself again , active , powerful , angry , and malignant , prepared for his last great struggle against the world .</p>

   <div type="chapter" n="27">
    <p n="946"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>read a strange missive , written in pencil on a greasy sheet of paper .</p>
    <p n="947"><said who="#Kemp">“ You have been amazingly energetic and clever , ”</said>this letter ran ,<said>“ though what you stand to gain by it I cannot imagine . You are against me . For a whole day you have chased me ; you have tried to rob me of a night 's rest . But I have had food in spite of you , I have slept in spite of you , and the game is only beginning . The game is only beginning . There is nothing for it , but to start the Terror . This announces the first day of the Terror . Port Burdock is no longer under the Queen , tell your Colonel of Police , and the rest of them ; it is under me — the Terror ! This is day one of year one of the new epoch — the Epoch of<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>. I am Invisible Man the First . To begin with the rule will be easy . The first day there will be one execution for the sake of example — a man named<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>. Death starts for him to-day . He may lock himself away , hide himself away , get guards about him , put on armour if he likes — Death , the unseen Death , is coming . Let him take precautions ; it will impress my people . Death starts from the pillar box by midday . The letter will fall in as the postman comes along , then off ! The game begins . Death starts . Help him not , my people , lest Death fall upon you also . To-day<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>is to die . ”</said></p>
    <p n="948"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>read this letter twice , “ It 's no hoax , ” he said .<said who="#Kemp">“ That 's his voice ! And he means it . ”</said></p>
    <p n="949">He turned the folded sheet over and saw on the addressed side of it the postmark Hintondean , and the prosaic detail “ 2d . to pay . ”</p>
    <p n="950">He got up slowly , leaving his lunch unfinished — the letter had come by the one o'clock post — and went into his study . He rang for his housekeeper , and told her to go round the house at once , examine all the fastenings of the windows , and close all the shutters . He closed the shutters of his study himself . From a locked drawer in his bedroom he took a little revolver , examined it carefully , and put it into the pocket of his lounge jacket . He wrote a number of brief notes , one to Colonel<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>, gave them to his servant to take , with explicit instructions as to her way of leaving the house .<said who="#Adye">“ There is no danger , ”</said>he said , and added a mental reservation ,<said who="#Adye">“ to you . ”</said>He remained meditative for a space after doing this , and then returned to his cooling lunch .</p>
    <p n="951">He ate with gaps of thought . Finally he struck the table sharply .<said who="#Kemp">“ We will have him ! ”</said>he said ;<said who="#Kemp">“ and I am the bait . He will come too far . ”</said></p>
    <p n="952">He went up to the belvedere , carefully shutting every door after him .<said who="#Adye">“ It 's a game , ”</said>he said ,<said who="#Adye">“ an odd game — but the chances are all for me , Mr.<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>, in spite of your invisibility .<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>contra mundum ... with a vengeance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="953">He stood at the window staring at the hot hillside .<said who="#Kemp">“ He must get food every day — and I do n't envy him . Did he really sleep last night ? Out in the open somewhere — secure from collisions . I wish we could get some good cold wet weather instead of the heat .</said></p>
    <p n="954"><said who="#Adye">“ He may be watching me now . ”</said></p>
    <p n="955">He went close to the window . Something rapped smartly against the brickwork over the frame , and made him start violently back .</p>
    <p n="956"><said who="#Kemp">“ I 'm getting nervous , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>. But it was five minutes before he went to the window again .<said who="#Kemp">“ It must have been a sparrow , ”</said>he said .</p>
    <p n="957">Presently he heard the front-door bell ringing , and hurried downstairs . He unbolted and unlocked the door , examined the chain , put it up , and opened cautiously without showing himself . A familiar voice hailed him . It was<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>.</p>
    <p n="958"><said who="#Adye">“ Your servant 's been assaulted ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, ”</said>he said round the door .</p>
    <p n="959"><said who="#Kemp">“ What ! ”</said>exclaimed<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="960"><said who="#Adye">“ Had that note of yours taken away from her . He 's close about here . Let me in . ”</said></p>
    <p n="961"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>released the chain , and<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>entered through as narrow an opening as possible . He stood in the hall , looking with infinite relief at<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>refastening the door .<said who="#Kemp">“ Note was snatched out of her hand . Scared her horribly . She 's down at the station . Hysterics . He 's close here . What was it about ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="962"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>swore .</p>
    <p n="963"><said who="#Kemp">“ What a fool I was , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ I might have known . It 's not an hour 's walk from Hintondean . Already ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="964"><said who="#Adye">“ What 's up ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>.</p>
    <p n="965"><said who="#Adye">“ Look here ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, and led the way into his study . He handed<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName><persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>'s letter .<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>read it and whistled softly . “ And you —? ” said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>.</p>
    <p n="966"><said who="#Kemp">“ Proposed a trap — like a fool , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>,<said who="#Kemp">“ and sent my proposal out by a maid servant . To him . ”</said></p>

    <p n="969"><said who="#Kemp">“ Not he , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="970">A resounding smash of glass came from upstairs .<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>had a silvery glimpse of a little revolver half out of<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s pocket .<said who="#Kemp">“ It 's a window , upstairs ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, and led the way up . There came a second smash while they were still on the staircase . When they reached the study they found two of the three windows smashed , half the room littered with splintered glass , and one big flint lying on the writing table . The two men stopped in the doorway , contemplating the wreckage .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>swore again , and as he did so the third window went with a snap like a pistol , hung starred for a moment , and collapsed in jagged , shivering triangles into the room .</p>
    <p n="971"><said who="#Adye">“ What 's this for ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>.</p>

    <p n="977">Smash , and then whack of boards hit hard came from downstairs .<said who="#Kemp">“ Confound him ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ That must be — yes — it 's one of the bedrooms .

    <p n="978">Another window proclaimed its destruction . The two men stood on the landing perplexed .<said who="#Adye">“ I have it ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>.<said who="#Adye">“ Let me have a stick or something , and I 'll go down to the station and get the bloodhounds put on . That ought to settle him ! They 're hard by — not ten minutes — ”</said></p>
    <p n="979">Another window went the way of its fellows .</p>
    <p n="980"><said who="#Adye">“ You have n't a revolver ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>.</p>
    <p n="981"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s hand went to his pocket . Then he hesitated .<said who="#Kemp">“ I have n't one — at least to spare . ”</said></p>
    <p n="982"><said who="#Adye">“ I 'll bring it back , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>,<said who="#Adye">“ you 'll be safe here . ”</said></p>
    <p n="983"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, ashamed of his momentary lapse from truthfulness , handed him the weapon .</p>
    <p n="984"><said who="#Adye">“ Now for the door , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>.</p>
    <p n="985">As they stood hesitating in the hall , they heard one of the first-floor bedroom windows crack and clash .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>went to the door and began to slip the bolts as silently as possible . His face was a little paler than usual .<said who="#Kemp">“ You must step straight out , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>. In another moment<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>was on the doorstep and the bolts were dropping back into the staples . He hesitated for a moment , feeling more comfortable with his back against the door . Then he marched , upright and square , down the steps . He crossed the lawn and approached the gate . A little breeze seemed to ripple over the grass . Something moved near him .<said who="#Adye">“ Stop a bit , ”</said>said a Voice , and<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>stopped dead and his hand tightened on the revolver .</p>
    <p n="986"><said who="#Adye">“ Well ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>, white and grim , and every nerve tense .</p>
    <p n="987"><said who="#the_Voice">“ Oblige me by going back to the house , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>, as tense and grim as<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>'s .</p>
    <p n="988"><said who="#Adye">“ Sorry , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>a little hoarsely , and moistened his lips with his tongue .<persName corresp="#the_Voice">The Voice</persName>was on his left front , he thought . Suppose he were to take his luck with a shot ?</p>
    <p n="989"><said who="#the_Voice">“ What are you going for ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>, and there was a quick movement of the two , and a flash of sunlight from the open lip of<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>'s pocket .</p>
    <p n="990"><persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>desisted and thought .<said who="#Adye">“ Where I go , ”</said>he said slowly ,<said who="#Adye">“ is my own business . ”</said>The words were still on his lips , when an arm came round his neck , his back felt a knee , and he was sprawling backward . He drew clumsily and fired absurdly , and in another moment he was struck in the mouth and the revolver wrested from his grip . He made a vain clutch at a slippery limb , tried to struggle up and fell back .<said who="#Adye">“ Damn ! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>.<persName corresp="#the_Voice">The Voice</persName>laughed .<said who="#Adye">“ I 'd kill you now if it was n't the waste of a bullet , ”</said>it said . He saw the revolver in mid-air , six feet off , covering him .</p>
    <p n="991"><said who="#Adye">“ Well ? ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>, sitting up .</p>
    <p n="992"><said who="#the_Voice">“ Get up , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>.</p>
    <p n="993"><persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>stood up .</p>
    <p n="994"><said who="#the_Voice">“ Attention , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>, and then fiercely ,<said who="#the_Voice">“ Do n't try any games . Remember I can see your face if you can n't see mine . You 've got to go back to the house . ”</said></p>
    <p n="995"><said who="#Adye">“ He wo n't let me in , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>.</p>
    <p n="996"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ That 's a pity , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>.<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I 've got no quarrel with you . ”</said></p>
    <p n="997"><persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>moistened his lips again . He glanced away from the barrel of the revolver and saw the sea far off very blue and dark under the midday sun , the smooth green down , the white cliff of the Head , and the multitudinous town , and suddenly he knew that life was very sweet . His eyes came back to this little metal thing hanging between heaven and earth , six yards away .<said who="#Adye">“ What am I to do ? ”</said>he said sullenly .</p>
    <p n="998"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ What am I to do ? ”</said>asked<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>.<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ You will get help . The only thing is for you to go back . ”</said></p>
    <p n="999"><said who="#Adye">“ I will try . If he lets me in will you promise not to rush the door ? ”</said></p>
    <p n="1000"><said who="#the_Voice">“ I 've got no quarrel with you , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1001"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>had hurried upstairs after letting<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>out , and now crouching among the broken glass and peering cautiously over the edge of the study window sill , he saw<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>stand parleying with<persName corresp="#the_Unseen">the Unseen</persName>.<said who="#the_Unseen">“ Why does n't he fire ? ”</said>whispered<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>to himself . Then the revolver moved a little and the glint of the sunlight flashed in<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s eyes . He shaded his eyes and tried to see the source of the blinding beam .</p>
    <p n="1002"><said who="#the_Voice">“ Surely ! ”</said>he said ,<said who="#the_Voice">“<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>has given up the revolver . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1003"><said who="#Adye">“ Promise not to rush the door , ”</said><persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>was saying .<said who="#Adye">“ Do n't push a winning game too far . Give a man a chance . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1004"><said who="#Kemp">“ You go back to the house . I tell you flatly I will not promise anything . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1005"><persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>'s decision seemed suddenly made . He turned towards the house , walking slowly with his hands behind him .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>watched him — puzzled . The revolver vanished , flashed again into sight , vanished again , and became evident on a closer scrutiny as a little dark object following<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>. Then things happened very quickly .<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>leapt backwards , swung around , clutched at this little object , missed it , threw up his hands and fell forward on his face , leaving a little puff of blue in the air .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>did not hear the sound of the shot .<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>writhed , raised himself on one arm , fell forward , and lay still .</p>
    <p n="1006">For a space<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>remained staring at the quiet carelessness of<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>'s attitude . The afternoon was very hot and still , nothing seemed stirring in all the world save a couple of yellow butterflies chasing each other through the shrubbery between the house and the road gate .<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>lay on the lawn near the gate . The blinds of all the villas down the hill-road were drawn , but in one little green summer-house was a white figure , apparently an old man asleep .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>scrutinised the surroundings of the house for a glimpse of the revolver , but it had vanished . His eyes came back to<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>. The game was opening well .</p>
    <p n="1007">Then came a ringing and knocking at the front door , that grew at last tumultuous , but pursuant to<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s instructions the servants had locked themselves into their rooms . This was followed by a silence .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>sat listening and then began peering cautiously out of the three windows , one after another . He went to the staircase head and stood listening uneasily . He armed himself with his bedroom poker , and went to examine the interior fastenings of the ground-floor windows again . Everything was safe and quiet . He returned to the belvedere .<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>lay motionless over the edge of the gravel just as he had fallen . Coming along the road by the villas were the housemaid and two policemen .</p>
    <p n="1008">Everything was deadly still . The three people seemed very slow in approaching . He wondered what his antagonist was doing .</p>
    <p n="1009">He started . There was a smash from below . He hesitated and went downstairs again . Suddenly the house resounded with heavy blows and the splintering of wood . He heard a smash and the destructive clang of the iron fastenings of the shutters . He turned the key and opened the kitchen door . As he did so , the shutters , split and splintering , came flying inward . He stood aghast . The window frame , save for one crossbar , was still intact , but only little teeth of glass remained in the frame . The shutters had been driven in with an axe , and now the axe was descending in sweeping blows upon the window frame and the iron bars defending it . Then suddenly it leapt aside and vanished . He saw the revolver lying on the path outside , and then the little weapon sprang into the air . He dodged back . The revolver cracked just too late , and a splinter from the edge of the closing door flashed over his head . He slammed and locked the door , and as he stood outside he heard<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>shouting and laughing . Then the blows of the axe with its splitting and smashing consequences , were resumed .</p>
    <p n="1010"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>stood in the passage trying to think . In a moment<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>would be in the kitchen . This door would not keep him a moment , and then —</p>
    <p n="1011">A ringing came at the front door again . It would be the policemen . He ran into the hall , put up the chain , and drew the bolts . He made the girl speak before he dropped the chain , and the three people blundered into the house in a heap , and<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>slammed the door again .</p>
    <p n="1012"><said who="#Kemp">“<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>! ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ He has a revolver , with two shots — left . He 's killed<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>. Shot him anyhow . Did n't you see him on the lawn ? He 's lying there . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1013"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Who ? ”</said>said one of the policemen .</p>
    <p n="1014"><said who="#Kemp">“<persName corresp="#Adye">Adye</persName>, ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1015"><said who="#Adye">“ We came in the back way , ”</said>said the girl .</p>
    <p n="1016"><said who="#Kemp">“ What 's that smashing ? ”</said>asked one of the policemen .</p>
    <p n="1017"><said who="#Adye">“ He 's in the kitchen — or will be . He has found an axe — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1018">Suddenly the house was full of<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>'s resounding blows on the kitchen door . The girl stared towards the kitchen , shuddered , and retreated into the dining-room .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>tried to explain in broken sentences . They heard the kitchen door give .</p>
    <p n="1019"><said who="#Kemp">“ This way , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, starting into activity , and bundled the policemen into the dining-room doorway .</p>
    <p n="1020"><said who="#Kemp">“ Poker , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, and rushed to the fender . He handed the poker he had carried to the policeman and the dining-room one to the other . He suddenly flung himself backward .</p>
    <p n="1021"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Whup ! ”</said>said one policeman , ducked , and caught the axe on his poker . The pistol snapped its penultimate shot and ripped a valuable Sidney Cooper . The second policeman brought his poker down on the little weapon , as one might knock down a wasp , and sent it rattling to the floor .</p>
    <p n="1022">At the first clash the girl screamed , stood screaming for a moment by the fireplace , and then ran to open the shutters — possibly with an idea of escaping by the shattered window .</p>
    <p n="1023">The axe receded into the passage , and fell to a position about two feet from the ground . They could hear<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>breathing .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Stand away , you two , ”</said>he said .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ I want that man<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>. ”</said></p>
    <p n="1024"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ We want you , ”</said>said the first policeman , making a quick step forward and wiping with his poker at<persName corresp="#the_Voice">the Voice</persName>.<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>must have started back , and he blundered into the umbrella stand .</p>
    <p n="1025">Then , as the policeman staggered with the swing of the blow he had aimed ,<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>countered with the axe , the helmet crumpled like paper , and the blow sent the man spinning to the floor at the head of the kitchen stairs . But the second policeman , aiming behind the axe with his poker , hit something soft that snapped . There was a sharp exclamation of pain and then the axe fell to the ground . The policeman wiped again at vacancy and hit nothing ; he put his foot on the axe , and struck again . Then he stood , poker clubbed , listening intent for the slightest movement .</p>
    <p n="1026">He heard the dining-room window open , and a quick rush of feet within . His companion rolled over and sat up , with the blood running down between his eye and ear .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Where is he ? ”</said>asked the man on the floor .</p>
    <p n="1027"><said who="#the_Voice">“ Do n't know . I 've hit him . He 's standing somewhere in the hall . Unless he 's slipped past you . Doctor<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>— sir . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1028">Pause .</p>
    <p n="1029"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Doctor<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, ”</said>cried the policeman again .</p>
    <p n="1030">The second policeman began struggling to his feet . He stood up . Suddenly the faint pad of bare feet on the kitchen stairs could be heard .<said who="#the_Voice">“ Yap ! ”</said>cried the first policeman , and incontinently flung his poker . It smashed a little gas bracket .</p>
    <p n="1031">He made as if he would pursue<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>downstairs . Then he thought better of it and stepped into the dining-room .</p>
    <p n="1032"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Doctor<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>— ”</said>he began , and stopped short .</p>
    <p n="1033"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Doctor<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s a hero , ”</said>he said , as his companion looked over his shoulder .</p>
    <p n="1034">The dining-room window was wide open , and neither housemaid nor<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>was to be seen .</p>
    <p n="1035">The second policeman 's opinion of<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>was terse and vivid .</p>
   </div>
   <div type="chapter" n="28">
    <p n="1036"><persName corresp="#Mr._Heelas">Mr. Heelas</persName>, Mr.<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s nearest neighbour among the villa holders , was asleep in his summer house when the siege of<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s house began .<persName corresp="#Mr._Heelas">Mr. Heelas</persName>was one of the sturdy minority who refused to believe “ in all this nonsense ” about an Invisible Man . His wife , however , as he was subsequently to be reminded , did . He insisted upon walking about his garden just as if nothing was the matter , and he went to sleep in the afternoon in accordance with the custom of years . He slept through the smashing of the windows , and then woke up suddenly with a curious persuasion of something wrong . He looked across at<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s house , rubbed his eyes and looked again . Then he put his feet to the ground , and sat listening . He said he was damned , but still the strange thing was visible . The house looked as though it had been deserted for weeks — after a violent riot . Every window was broken , and every window , save those of the belvedere study , was blinded by the internal shutters .</p>
    <p n="1037"><said who="#Mr._Heelas">“ I could have sworn it was all right ”</said>— he looked at his watch —<said who="#Mr._Heelas">“ twenty minutes ago . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1038">He became aware of a measured concussion and the clash of glass , far away in the distance . And then , as he sat open-mouthed , came a still more wonderful thing . The shutters of the drawing-room window were flung open violently , and the housemaid in her outdoor hat and garments , appeared struggling in a frantic manner to throw up the sash . Suddenly a man appeared beside her , helping her —<persName corresp="#Kemp">Dr. Kemp</persName>! In another moment the window was open , and the housemaid was struggling out ; she pitched forward and vanished among the shrubs .<persName corresp="#Mr._Heelas">Mr. Heelas</persName>stood up , exclaiming vaguely and vehemently at all these wonderful things . He saw<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>stand on the sill , spring from the window , and reappear almost instantaneously running along a path in the shrubbery and stooping as he ran , like a man who evades observation . He vanished behind a laburnum , and appeared again clambering over a fence that abutted on the open down . In a second he had tumbled over and was running at a tremendous pace down the slope towards<persName corresp="#Mr._Heelas">Mr. Heelas</persName>.</p>
    <p n="1039"><said who="#Mr._Heelas">“ Lord ! ”</said>cried<persName corresp="#Mr._Heelas">Mr. Heelas</persName>, struck with an idea ;<said who="#Mr._Heelas">“ it 's that Invisible Man brute ! It 's right , after all ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1040">With<persName corresp="#Mr._Heelas">Mr. Heelas</persName>to think things like that was to act , and his cook watching him from the top window was amazed to see him come pelting towards the house at a good nine miles an hour . There was a slamming of doors , a ringing of bells , and the voice of<persName corresp="#Mr._Heelas">Mr. Heelas</persName>bellowing like a bull .<said who="#Mr._Heelas">“ Shut the doors , shut the windows , shut everything !—<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>is coming ! ”</said>Instantly the house was full of screams and directions , and scurrying feet . He ran himself to shut the French windows that opened on the veranda ; as he did so<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s head and shoulders and knee appeared over the edge of the garden fence . In another moment<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>had ploughed through the asparagus , and was running across the tennis lawn to the house .</p>
    <p n="1041"><said who="#Mr._Heelas">“ You can n't come in , ”</said>said<persName corresp="#Mr._Heelas">Mr. Heelas</persName>, shutting the bolts .<said who="#Mr._Heelas">“ I 'm very sorry if he 's after you , but you can n't come in ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1042"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>appeared with a face of terror close to the glass , rapping and then shaking frantically at the French window . Then , seeing his efforts were useless , he ran along the veranda , vaulted the end , and went to hammer at the side door . Then he ran round by the side gate to the front of the house , and so into the hill-road . And<persName corresp="#Mr._Heelas">Mr. Heelas</persName>staring from his window — a face of horror — had scarcely witnessed<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>vanish , ere the asparagus was being trampled this way and that by feet unseen . At that<persName corresp="#Mr._Heelas">Mr. Heelas</persName>fled precipitately upstairs , and the rest of the chase is beyond his purview . But as he passed the staircase window , he heard the side gate slam .</p>
    <p n="1043">Emerging into the hill-road ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>naturally took the downward direction , and so it was he came to run in his own person the very race he had watched with such a critical eye from the belvedere study only four days ago . He ran it well , for a man out of training , and though his face was white and wet , his wits were cool to the last . He ran with wide strides , and wherever a patch of rough ground intervened , wherever there came a patch of raw flints , or a bit of broken glass shone dazzling , he crossed it and left the bare invisible feet that followed to take what line they would .</p>
    <p n="1044">For the first time in his life<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>discovered that the hill-road was indescribably vast and desolate , and that the beginnings of the town far below at the hill foot were strangely remote . Never had there been a slower or more painful method of progression than running . All the gaunt villas , sleeping in the afternoon sun , looked locked and barred ; no doubt they were locked and barred — by his own orders . But at any rate they might have kept a lookout for an eventuality like this ! The town was rising up now , the sea had dropped out of sight behind it , and people down below were stirring . A tram was just arriving at the hill foot . Beyond that was the police station . Was that footsteps he heard behind him ? Spurt .</p>
    <p n="1045">The people below were staring at him , one or two were running , and his breath was beginning to saw in his throat . The tram was quite near now , and the “ Jolly Cricketers ” was noisily barring its doors . Beyond the tram were posts and heaps of gravel — the drainage works . He had a transitory idea of jumping into the tram and slamming the doors , and then he resolved to go for the police station . In another moment he had passed the door of the “ Jolly Cricketers , ” and was in the blistering fag end of the street , with human beings about him . The tram driver and his helper — arrested by the sight of his furious haste — stood staring with the tram horses unhitched . Further on the astonished features of navvies appeared above the mounds of gravel .</p>
    <p n="1046">His pace broke a little , and then he heard the swift pad of his pursuer , and leapt forward again .<said who="#Kemp">“<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>! ”</said>he cried to the navvies , with a vague indicative gesture , and by an inspiration leapt the excavation and placed a burly group between him and the chase . Then abandoning the idea of the police station he turned into a little side street , rushed by a greengrocer 's cart , hesitated for the tenth of a second at the door of a sweetstuff shop , and then made for the mouth of an alley that ran back into the main Hill Street again . Two or three little children were playing here , and shrieked and scattered at his apparition , and forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers revealed their hearts . Out he shot into Hill Street again , three hundred yards from the tram-line end , and immediately he became aware of a tumultuous vociferation and running people .</p>
    <p n="1047">He glanced up the street towards the hill . Hardly a dozen yards off ran a huge navvy , cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with a spade , and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists clenched . Up the street others followed these two , striking and shouting . Down towards the town , men and women were running , and he noticed clearly one man coming out of a shop-door with a stick in his hand .<said who="#Kemp">“ Spread out ! Spread out ! ”</said>cried some one .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>suddenly grasped the altered condition of the chase . He stopped , and looked round , panting .<said who="#Kemp">“ He 's close here ! ”</said>he cried .<said who="#Kemp">“ Form a line across — ”</said></p>
    <p n="1048">He was hit hard under the ear , and went reeling , trying to face round towards his unseen antagonist . He just managed to keep his feet , and he struck a vain counter in the air . Then he was hit again under the jaw , and sprawled headlong on the ground . In another moment a knee compressed his diaphragm , and a couple of eager hands gripped his throat , but the grip of one was weaker than the other ; he grasped the wrists , heard a cry of pain from his assailant , and then the spade of the navvy came whirling through the air above him , and struck something with a dull thud . He felt a drop of moisture on his face . The grip at his throat suddenly relaxed , and with a convulsive effort ,<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>loosed himself , grasped a limp shoulder , and rolled uppermost . He gripped the unseen elbows near the ground .<said who="#Kemp">“ I 've got him ! ”</said>screamed<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>.<said who="#Kemp">“ Help ! Help — hold ! He 's down ! Hold his feet ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1049">In another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle , and a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an exceptionally savage game of Rugby football was in progress . And there was no shouting after<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>'s cry — only a sound of blows and feet and heavy breathing .</p>
    <p n="1050">Then came a mighty effort , and<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>threw off a couple of his antagonists and rose to his knees .<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>clung to him in front like a hound to a stag , and a dozen hands gripped , clutched , and tore at<persName corresp="#the_Unseen">the Unseen</persName>. The tram conductor suddenly got the neck and shoulders and lugged him back .</p>
    <p n="1051">Down went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over . There was , I am afraid , some savage kicking . Then suddenly a wild scream of “ Mercy ! Mercy ! ” that died down swiftly to a sound like choking .</p>
    <p n="1052"><said who="#Kemp">“ Get back , you fools ! ”</said>cried the muffled voice of<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>, and there was a vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms .<said who="#Kemp">“ He 's hurt , I tell you . Stand back ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1053">There was a brief struggle to clear a space , and then the circle of eager faces saw the doctor kneeling , as it seemed , fifteen inches in the air , and holding invisible arms to the ground . Behind him a constable gripped invisible ankles .</p>
    <p n="1054"><said who="#Kemp">“ Do n't you leave go of en , ”</said>cried the big navvy , holding a blood-stained spade ;<said who="#Kemp">“ he 's shamming . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1055"><said who="#the_Unseen">“ He 's not shamming , ”</said>said the doctor , cautiously raising his knee ;<said who="#the_Unseen">“ and I 'll hold him . ”</said>His face was bruised and already going red ; he spoke thickly because of a bleeding lip . He released one hand and seemed to be feeling at the face .<said who="#the_Unseen">“ The mouth 's all wet , ”</said>he said . And then ,<said who="#the_Unseen">“ Good God ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1056">He stood up abruptly and then knelt down on the ground by the side of the thing unseen . There was a pushing and shuffling , a sound of heavy feet as fresh people turned up to increase the pressure of the crowd . People now were coming out of the houses . The doors of the “ Jolly Cricketers ” stood suddenly wide open . Very little was said .</p>
    <p n="1057"><persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>felt about , his hand seeming to pass through empty air .<said who="#Kemp">“ He 's not breathing , ”</said>he said , and then ,<said who="#Kemp">“ I can n't feel his heart . His side — ugh ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1058">Suddenly an old woman , peering under the arm of the big navvy , screamed sharply .<said who="#the_Unseen">“ Looky there ! ”</said>she said , and thrust out a wrinkled finger .</p>
    <p n="1059">And looking where she pointed , everyone saw , faint and transparent as though it was made of glass , so that veins and arteries and bones and nerves could be distinguished , the outline of a hand , a hand limp and prone . It grew clouded and opaque even as they stared .</p>
    <p n="1060"><said who="#Kemp">“ Hullo ! ”</said>cried the constable .<said who="#Kemp">“ Here 's his feet a-showing ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1061">And so , slowly , beginning at his hands and feet and creeping along his limbs to the vital centres of his body , that strange change continued . It was like the slow spreading of a poison . First came the little white nerves , a hazy grey sketch of a limb , then the glassy bones and intricate arteries , then the flesh and skin , first a faint fogginess , and then growing rapidly dense and opaque . Presently they could see his crushed chest and his shoulders , and the dim outline of his drawn and battered features .</p>
    <p n="1062">When at last the crowd made way for<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>to stand erect , there lay , naked and pitiful on the ground , the bruised and broken body of a young man about thirty . His hair and brow were white — not grey with age , but white with the whiteness of albinism — and his eyes were like garnets . His hands were clenched , his eyes wide open , and his expression was one of anger and dismay .</p>
    <p n="1063"><said who="#Kemp">“ Cover his face ! ”</said>said a man .<said who="#Kemp">“ For Gawd 's sake , cover that face ! ”</said>and three little children , pushing forward through the crowd , were suddenly twisted round and sent packing off again .</p>
    <p n="1064">Someone brought a sheet from the “ Jolly Cricketers , ” and having covered him , they carried him into that house . And there it was , on a shabby bed in a tawdry , ill-lighted bedroom , surrounded by a crowd of ignorant and excited people , broken and wounded , betrayed and unpitied , that<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>, the first of all men to make himself invisible ,<persName corresp="#Griffin">Griffin</persName>, the most gifted physicist the world has ever seen , ended in infinite disaster his strange and terrible career .</p>
    <p>THE EPILOGUE</p>
    <p n="1065">So ends the story of the strange and evil experiments of<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">the Invisible Man</persName>. And if you would learn more of him you must go to a little inn near Port Stowe and talk to the landlord . The sign of the inn is an empty board save for a hat and boots , and the name is the title of this story . The landlord is a short and corpulent little man with a nose of cylindrical proportions , wiry hair , and a sporadic rosiness of visage . Drink generously , and he will tell you generously of all the things that happened to him after that time , and of how the lawyers tried to do him out of the treasure found upon him .</p>
    <p n="1066"><said who="#Griffin">“ When they found they could n't prove who 's money was which , I 'm blessed , ”</said>he says ,<said who="#Griffin">“ if they did n't try to make me out a blooming treasure trove ! Do I look like a Treasure Trove ? And then a gentleman gave me a guinea a night to tell the story at the Empire Music ‘ All — just to tell ‘ em in my own words — barring one . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1067">And if you want to cut off the flow of his reminiscences abruptly , you can always do so by asking if there were n't three manuscript books in the story . He admits there were and proceeds to explain , with asseverations that everybody thinks he has ‘ em ! But bless you ! he has n't .<said>“<persName corresp="#the_Invisible_Man">The Invisible Man</persName>it was took ‘ em off to hide ‘ em when I cut and ran for Port Stowe . It 's that Mr.<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>put people on with the idea of my having ‘ em . ”</said></p>
    <p n="1068">And then he subsides into a pensive state , watches you furtively , bustles nervously with glasses , and presently leaves the bar .</p>
    <p n="1069">He is a bachelor man — his tastes were ever bachelor , and there are no women folk in the house . Outwardly he buttons — it is expected of him — but in his more vital privacies , in the matter of braces for example , he still turns to string . He conducts his house without enterprise , but with eminent decorum . His movements are slow , and he is a great thinker . But he has a reputation for wisdom and for a respectable parsimony in the village , and his knowledge of the roads of the South of England would beat Cobbett .</p>
    <p n="1070">And on Sunday mornings , every Sunday morning , all the year round , while he is closed to the outer world , and every night after ten , he goes into his bar parlour , bearing a glass of gin faintly tinged with water , and having placed this down , he locks the door and examines the blinds , and even looks under the table . And then , being satisfied of his solitude , he unlocks the cupboard and a box in the cupboard and a drawer in that box , and produces three volumes bound in brown leather , and places them solemnly in the middle of the table . The covers are weather-worn and tinged with an algal green — for once they sojourned in a ditch and some of the pages have been washed blank by dirty water . The landlord sits down in an armchair , fills a long clay pipe slowly — gloating over the books the while . Then he pulls one towards him and opens it , and begins to study it — turning over the leaves backwards and forwards .</p>
    <p n="1071">His brows are knit and his lips move painfully .<said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Hex , little two up in the air , cross and a fiddle-de-dee . Lord ! what a one he was for intellect ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1072">Presently he relaxes and leans back , and blinks through his smoke across the room at things invisible to other eyes .<said who="#Griffin">“ Full of secrets , ”</said>he says .<said who="#Griffin">“ Wonderful secrets ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1073"><said who="#the_Invisible_Man">“ Once I get the haul of them — Lord ! ”</said></p>
    <p n="1074"><said who="#Griffin">“ I would n't do what he did ; I 'd just — well ! ”</said>He pulls at his pipe .</p>
    <p n="1075">So he lapses into a dream , the undying wonderful dream of his life . And though<persName corresp="#Kemp">Kemp</persName>has fished unceasingly , no human being save the landlord knows those books are there , with the subtle secret of invisibility and a dozen other strange secrets written therein . And none other will know of them until he dies .</p>
